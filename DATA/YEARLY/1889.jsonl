J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nAppeal\u2014Contempt of court\u2014Discretion\u2014R. S. C. c. 135 s. 27\u2014Final judgment\u2014Practice in case of contempt.\nBy a rule nisi of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick E. was called upon to show cause why an attachment should not issue against him, or he be committed for contempt of court, in publishing certain articles in a newspaper. On the return of the rule it was made absolute, and a writ of attachment was issued commanding the sheriff to have the body of E. before the court on a day named. By the practice in such cases in the said court it appeared that the attachment was issued merely in order to bring the party into court, where he might be ordered to answer interrogatories and by his answers purge if he could his contempt. If unable to do this the court would pronounce sentence. E. appealed from the judgment making the rule absolute. On motion to quash said appeal.\u2014\nHeld, that the judgment appealed from was not a final judgment from which an appeal would lie under sec. 24 (a) of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, R. S. C. c. 135.\nMotion to quash appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nThe appellant is editor of a newspaper in St. John, N.B., and as such published certain articles concerning judicial proceedings in regard to an election in New Brunswick. The respondent, one of the candidates at such election, obtained a rule nisi for an attachment for contempt against the appellant, which was afterwards made absolute, and this appeal was brought from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick making the said rule absolute.\nThe practice in New Brunswick in matters of constructive contempt is as follows: On application supported by affidavits, which is usually made by the Attorney-General, a rule nisi is granted, requiring the person alleged to be in contempt to show cause why an attachment should not issue against him, or why he should not be committed for contempt. On the return of this rule, if it has been properly served and within four days, if sufficient cause is not shown against it, it is made absolute. The court then orders the prosecutor to administer, interrogatories to the party in contempt within four days, he either giving bail for his appearance to answer the same or being committed to gaol. After the interrogatories are administered, if the contempt is not purged by the answers thereto, or in case of refusal to answer, the party is adjudged guilty of contempt and the court imposes sentence therefor.\nThese were the proceedings in the present case, and the rule for an attachment being made absolute the appellant gave sureties for his appearance to answer the interrogatories, and then brought his appeal. Pending the appeal the time for answering the interrogatories has been extended by the court below.\nCurrie moves to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nThere are several objections to the jurisdiction of the court in this case.\nFirst\u2014The case is not ripe for appeal. Until the interrogatories are administered, and the court is in a position to pronounce sentence, there is no final judgment. Corner's Crown Practice[1], Dunn's Crown Practice[2]. Secondly\u2014There is no appeal unless contempt is expressly mentioned in the statute giving jurisdiction in this court.\nThirdly\u2014The subject matter in this appeal is entirely within the discretion of the court brought into contempt, and the appeal is expressly taken away by statute. R.S.C. c. 135, s. 27. Rapalje on Contempt[3]; McDermott's Case[4]; Rainy v. Justice of Sierra Leone[5].\nFourthly\u2014The matter of contempt is not, and from its nature cannot be, a subject matter of appeal. See Hayes v. Fischer[6]; New Orleans v. S. S.Co.[7]; Exparte Kearney[8]; Shattuck v. The Stale[9].\nThe Privy Council will never entertain such appeals. See Macpherson's P.C. Prac.[10].\nDavis Q.C. contra cited Rex v. Elkins[11], on the first of the above grounds, that the case was not ripe for appeal, and Jarmain v. Chatterton[12], where an appeal in a case of contempt was entertained and the rule governing such appeals laid down.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I am of opinion the motion to quash should be granted without costs, on the ground that there was no final adjudication; and, in my opinion, the party appellant was led into error by the action of the court, and should not suffer therefor.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that the motion to quash must be granted. The rule nisi was in the alternative for an attachment or to commit the appellant for contempt. It was made absolute generally, and the rule absolute does not specify which alternative was granted. As the granting of the rule was followed up by an attachment, we must assume that it was intended to make the rule absolute in the alternative which asked for this writ; more especially as the appellant did not move against the writ for irregularity, but gave bail to it. Then this writ of attachment is merely the first step in the procedure to punish for contempt of court. It is only a process to bring the party to be attached into court in order that he may answer. The proceedings subsequent to the execution and return of the writ include the bringing of the body into court, the requiring the defendant to answer to the contempt and to answer interrogatories and there is then a formal adjudication, followed by sentence. Until there has been an adjudication as to the defendant's guilt or innocence of the contempt there is no final judgment from which an appeal can lie.\nThere seem to be two modes of proceedings for contempt of court\u2014one formal and plenary, the other summary. The former mode of proceeding is that which has been adopted in the present case.\nI proceed altogether upon what appears on the face of the proceedings; the rules nisi and absolute, and the writ of attachment itself\u2014the exigency of which is that the appellant shall be attached in order that he may \"appear and answer.\" Surely when the stage of appearance in answer to process of this kind has alone been reached, and there has not even been a hearing, there cannot be said to be any final judgment. In the opinions delivered by some of the learned judges they do not advert to the distinction between the summary mode of procedure and the more formal mode of proceeding adopted in the present case.\nI agree with the Chief Justice, that there should be no costs. FOURNIER J. concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would quash this appeal, on the ground that the judgment appealed from is not a final judgment.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In Easter Term, 1887, a rule was issued out of the Supreme Court of the Province of New Brunswick. Crown side, exparte George F. Baird, the above respondent, calling upon the above appellant, the editor, publisher and proprietor of the \"St. John Globe\" a newspaper printed and published in the city of St. John, in the Province of New Brunswick, to show cause in Trinity Term then next why an attachment should not be issued against him, or why he should not be committed for contempt of court for writing printing and publishing in the issue of the said \"St. John Globe\" newspaper, on the 18th March preceding, an article under the caption of \"The Queen's Election,\" and certain other articles in other issues of the newspaper mentioned in the rule\nin which said articles the said John V. Ellis has been guilty of a contempt of this honourable court in scandalising this court, and particularly His Honor Mr. Justice Tuck, one of the Justices thereof, in calumniating and vilifying the applicant George F. Baird, and in commenting on matters of said election, said recount and said order nisi for a writ of prohibition in a manner calculated to prejudice and that does prejudice the public before the hearing and judicial decision of said matters, and so as is calculated to prevent the said applicant George F. Baird from obtaining a fair and impartial disposal of said matters, &c. Upon reading the said articles in the newspapers aforesaid, and upon reading the affidavit of George F. Baird.\nUpon this rule being served and the matter being brought up again before the court, if it should appear that the appellant had written and published the articles complained of, or any of them, all that remained to be done by the court, after hearing the appellant show cause in person or by his counsel as he was called upon by the rule to do, was to pronounce judgment either convicting the appellant of the offence and passing appropriate sentence upon him for such offence, or otherwise dealing with the case as justice might require and to the court should seem meet.\nFrom the judgment and expression of opinion as delivered by the learned Chief Justice of the court, and which is made part of the case laid before us, it appears that the appellant appeared in obedience to the above rule and showed cause thereto, as he was called upon by the rule to do; for the learned Chief Justice there says:\u2014\nThe writing and publishing of the articles complained of are admitted by Mr. Ellis, but his counsel contends that they do not amount to a contempt of court, for two reasons.\nHe then states these reasons, and adds:\nI do not think either of these objections is sustainable.\nHe then proceeds to deal with those objections, and to define the law as to contempt of court and to apply it to the circumstances of the case before him; and referring to the proceedings which were before Mr. Justice Tuck, and which formed the subject of comment in the articles complained of, he concludes:\nIn what he (Mr. Justice Tuck) did, he was acting for this court judicially, and in the administration of justice, and the language which was used respecting him in the matter, in some at least of the articles published, was a contemptuous interference with the judicial proceedings in which he was acting.\nFrom the above it appears beyond doubt that in the opinion of the learned Chief Justice the appellant, by writing and publishing the articles complained of (as admitted by him), was guilty of a contempt of court; and if that opinion had been embodied in the rule of court issued thereupon, which is the subject matter of this appeal, the appellant would have been, beyond all doubt, convicted of the offence of contempt of court with which he had been charged, and by the rule nisi cited to appear in court and answer; but the learned Chief Justice concludes his judgment thus:\nI am therefore of opinion that the rule should be made absolute for an attachment.\nNot, it is to be observed, for committal of the appellant, as for an offence of which he had been convicted.\nMr. Justice Fraser expressed his concurrence in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice.\nMr. Justice Wetmore, after referring to the circumstances of the case, the nature of the proceedings before Mr. Justice Tuck, and a point that had been argued that he had been acting without jurisdiction, and that, therefore, the articles constituted no contempt of court, concludes thus:\nI cannot fancy any cause that could be reasonably shown against making the rule absolute; but if there was any, there would have been ample opportunity to have presented it for the judges' consideration at the return of the rule nisi. But supposing I am all wrong in the views I have expressed, and that Judge Tuck had no right to have granted the rule nisi, what justification would his error be for the articles published in the \"Globe\" newspaper? It appears to me, none whatever; so, whether Judge Tuck was right or wrong\u2014the severe articles are equally such a contempt of court as call for the attachment.\nAnd he agreed with the Chief Justice that an attachment should be ordered.\nNow as the appellant was before the court and showed cause to the rule nisi, and admitted the publication by him of the articles complained of, and as a majority of the court were clearly of opinion that the publication of the articles, so admitted by the appellant to have been published by him, was a contempt of court, it does not clearly appear why judgment should not have been pronounced, convicting the appellant of the contempt and passing an appropriate sentence therefor, instead of ordering an attachment to issue,' the object of which appears, from the judgment of Mr. Justice Palmer, to be still to keep the matter of the rule nisi sub judice, and to be an interlocutory proceeding only. He says:\u2014\nI do not say that Mr. Ellis is guilty of the acts charged against him or convict him of a contempt of this court; all I at present say is that sufficient is shown to make it our duty to bring him into court to answer for the acts charged against him. When here, it will be the duty of this court to give him an opportunity to fully defend himself and, if it turns out, according to his own oath, that he has not violated any of the principles I have endeavored to state it will be the pleasant duty of this court to acquit; if otherwise, it will be our duty, no matter how unpleasant, to inflict upon him the punishment that the law directs, which is just such punishment as will prevent a repetition of the crime by him or by anybody else.\nNow, whether or not the articles contain matter which, being published as admitted, constitutes a contempt of court, is a question the determination of which depends upon the construction by the court of the articles themselves\u2014and the publication having been admitted by the appellant, and counsel who showed cause for him having been heard, I fail to see why the matter should not have been considered as quite ripe for adjudication, without any further opportunity of showing cause being given to the appellant. However, the court seems to have adopted the view expressed by Mr. Justice Palmer as to the object of the attachment being issued\u2014for the order made by the court, and which is the subject of this appeal, simply is that the rule nisi be made absolute and upon the rule so made absolute the court has issued a writ of attachment, addressed to the sheriff of the city and county of St. John commanding him to attach the appellant, so that he may have him before the court on a day named \"to answer for certain trespasses and contempts brought against him\"\u2014thus adopting the view expressed by Mr. Justice Palmer as being the object and purpose of the attachment ordered, namely, as an interlocutory proceeding to enable the appellant to show cause why he should not be \"convicted\" of the offence of contempt of court and to defend himself against the charge brought against him. It appears, therefore, that the order of the court, which is the subject of this appeal, is not a final adjudication in the matter, and that therefore it is not appealable to this court. The appeal, therefore, must be quashed and with costs.\nAppeal quashed without costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Weldon, McLean & Devlin.\nSolicitor for respondent: L. A.

J.

(fresh meat) and contracted to deliver the same in like good order and condition* * *loss or damage resulting from sweating * * * decay, stowage,* * * or from any of the following perils, whether arising from the negligence, default or error in judgment of the pilot, master, mariners or other persons in the service of the ship, or for whose acts the shipowner is liable (or otherwise howsoever) always excepted, namely (setting them out).\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, Sir W. J. Ritchie C.J. and Fournier J. dissenting, that the clause \"whether arising from the negligence, default or error in judgment of the master,\" &c., covered as well the preceding exceptions as those which followed, and was not limited in its application by the words \"from any of the following perils,\" and the defendants were, therefore, not liable for damage to the goods shipped resulting from improper stowage, which was one of the excepted perils.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, setting aside a verdict for the plaintiffs and ordering a non-suit.\nThis was an action of damages against the defendant company for negligence in storing and carrying the plaintiffs goods, fresh beef and mutton, from Charlottetown to St. Johns, Newfoundland. The defence was that the injury to the goods arose from causes for which the defendants were exempt from liability under the bill of lading.\nThe exemptions in the bill of lading were amongst others, the following: \" (The act of God, the Queen's enemies, pirates, robbers, thieves, vermin, barratry of master or mariners, restraint of princes and rulers, or people, or resulting from strikes or mob, loss or damage resulting from sweating, insufficiency of package, leakage, breakage, pilferage, wastage, rust, frost, decay, rain, spray, stowage, or contact with or smell or evaporation from any other goods, insufficiency of marks, numbers, address, or description of goods shipped, injury to wrappers, however caused, or from any of the following perils (whether arising from the negligence, default or error in judgment of the pilot, master mariners, engineers or other persons in the service of the ship, or for whose act the shipowner is liable..or otherwise howsoever) always excepted, namely, risk of craft or hulk, or transhipment, explosion, heat, fire at sea, in craft or hulk, or on shore, boiler, steam or machinery, or from the consequences of any damage or injury thereto, however such damage or injury may be caused.\"\nOne of the contentions of the defendants was that the words in the above exceptions, \"whether arising from the negligence, default or error etc\" covered what went before, as well as what came after them.\nThe negligence principally relied on by the plaintiffs Was in the manner of stowing the goods on the vessel, and as to this the learned judge who delivered the judgment of the full court, and who had also tried the case, says: \" In my charge to the jury, I said that it appeared that during the time the meat was being packed it rained, the hatch was uncovered and that the meat packed under it must have been much wetted. That it also appeared that the men engaged in packing necessarily trod upon it with their boots on in this wet state, and that it was for the jury to say whether this was a proper mode o shipping and stowing the meat. That, in my opinion, a more improper manner of treating goods committed to a carrier could not be imagined, and I think so still.\" But he held that it was competent for the defendants to protect themselves against liability for any and all negligence, and that the bill of lading did so protect them in this case. He also found that the word \"stowage,\" in the exceptions in the bill of lading, necessarily meant \"improper stowage.\"\nThe plaintiffs claimed that even if the defendants were protected from liability on account of gross negligence, which they disputed, yet as they had only pleaded exemption on account of a portion of the exempted clauses, and the damage was occasioned by a clause not pleaded, namely, heating, they could not claim the benefit of such exceptions.\nThe Supreme Court, en banc, sustained the judgment of the trial judge in favor of the defendants. The plaintiff then appealed to this court.\nDavies Q.C. and Morson for the appellant. It cannot be disputed that the defendants were guilty of negligence, and they must show that they are protected by the exceptions which they have pleaded. If they choose to rely, in their pleadings, on specified exceptions they cannot claim the benefit of others which are not pleaded.\nThe bill of lading does not relieve the owner from the necessity of providing a seaworthy ship and proper accommodation for stowing the cargo.\nThe following authorities were relied on. Steel v. The State Line S. S. Co. ([1]); Stanton v. Richardson ([2]); Tattersall v. The National Steamship Co. ([3]); Gillespie v. Thompson ([4]); Hutchinson on Carriers ([5]).\nPeters for the respondents. The plaintiffs did not declare against us for not providing a seaworthy ship and cannot rely on it now.\nIn the bill of lading the exception for \"stowage\" must be taken to mean \"negligent stowage,\" as there could be no damage for stowage not negligent.\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think it was the duty of the shipowners to provide: first, a suitable vessel; secondly, a suitable place in that, vessel having regard to the nature of the cargo shipped; and thirdly, to take it on board at a suitable time and in a suitable manner, that the shipowners are bound to provide a ship reasonably fit for the purpose of the carriage of the cargo, that is meat, in this case, which they contracted to carry and that the shipowners warrant the fitness of their ship when she sails, and that if the proviso in the bill of lading that the owners will not be responsible for the default of the master applies to this case it does not relieve them from the implied obligation to provide a vessel efficient and properly equipped for the service.\nThen, did the shipowners make provision sufficient to enable them to fulfil their contract? I think they did not. If the meat could not be shipped under the hatchways without the hatchways being uncovered, and the meat exposed for an hour and a half to the pouring rain, and without the men trampling on it with their wet muddy boots, and spitting their tobacco juice on it, certainly the place was not, in my opinion, a fit and proper place, either as to the time of loading, during a pouring rain, or as to placing the meat there at all. It was, in my opinion, the duty of the shipowners to ship the cargo, having reference to its nature and liability to injury, at a time when it could, with reasonable and proper care, be safely shipped ; and the shipowners, having like reference, were, in my opinion, bound to ship the cargo in a proper place where it could be stowed without being so trampled or spit upon; in other words, having undertaken to carry fresh meat, the obligation was on them to furnish a vessel fit to carry, in a fit and proper place, that cargo, and it cannot be disputed that the place in which this meat was put was an improper place if the meat could not be shipped dry and without being trampled and spit upon; and it was, therefore, not a fit and proper place for the purpose. As was said by the Privy Council in \"The Freedom\" ([6]):\nThe simple truth is, that they did not make provisions sufficient to enable them to fulfil their contract.\nAnd after stating that the shipowners ought to have known that without ventilation and without circulation of air, &c, a portion of the cargo shipped would be damaged, the judgment proceeds:\nAs they did not, in fact, provide sufficiently against such a natural, if not necessary, consequence, they imposed upon themselves the disability to fulfil the express contract into which they had entered under the bill of lading. In this view it is not material to the plaintiffs whether the defendants are or are not chargeable with neglect, default or improvidence. It is enough for the plaintiffs to have established that the defendants have not performed their contract and have not sustained either of the defences which they have pleaded as a legal excuse for non-performance.\nI think it was not right or proper to remove the meat from the warehouse, as one of the witnesses says, in a pouring rain; and the judge says, \"it rained during the whole time of the loading and there was no covering over the hatchway,\u201d about 8 feet square; \"(the mate explained that the lowering tackle could not work if there had been).\"\nI think they should have waited until the weather was suitable for shipping such a cargo.\nThe learned judge says:\nIn my charge to the jury I said that it appeared that during the time the meat was being packed it rained, the hatoh was uncovered; and that the meat packed under it must have been wetted ; that it also appeared that the men engaged in packing necessarily trod upon it with their boots on in this wet state ; and that it was for the jury to say whether this was a proper mode of shipping and stowing the meat; that, in my opinion, a more improper manner of treating goods committed to a carrier could not be imagined, and I think so still.\nAnd the jury have so found it, and, in my opinion, loading meat at an improper time, on a rainy night with open hatches, and at a place where the men had to trample on the meat with muddy boots and to spit tobacco juice on it, are not within any of the exceptions of the bill of lading.\nIn my opinion, the loss was caused by the previous default of the shipowners. In the case of a bill of lading it is different from that of a policy of insurance, because there the contract is to carry with reasonable care, unless prevented by the excepted perils ; if the goods are not carried with reasonable care, and are consequently lost by perils of the seas, it becomes necessary to reconcile two parts of the instrument and this is done by holding that if the loss through perils of the seas is caused by the previous default of the shipowners He is liable for this breach of his covenant. Per Willes J. in Grill v. General Iron Screw Collier Co. ([7]), said to be the true view of Lord Herschell in Wilson v. Owners of Cargo per The Xantho ([8]).\nThe bill of lading acknowledges the articles to have been shipped in good order and well conditioned and they are to be delivered in like good order and well conditioned at the port of St. Johns with the following exceptions:\nThe act of God, the Queen's enemies, pirates, robers, thieves, vermin, barratry of master or mariners, restraint of princes and rulers; or people, or resulting from strikes, or mob, loss or damage resulting from sweating, insufficiency of package, breakage, pilferage, wastage, rust, frost, decay, rain, spray, stowage, or contract with or smell or evaporation from any other goods, insufficiency of marks, numbers, address, or descriptions of goods shipped, injury to wrappers however caused, or from any of the following perils, whether arising from the negligence, default or error in judgment of the pilot, master, mariners, engineers or other person in the service of the ship, or for whose acts the shipowners is liable, or otherwise howsoever) always excepted\u2014namely, risk of craft or hulk, or transhipment, explosion, heat or fire at sea, in craft or hulk, or on shore boilers, steam or machinery, or from the consequences of any damage or injury thereto, however such damage or injury may be caused. Collision, stranding or peril of the seas, rivers, navigation of land transit of whatever nature or. kind soever, and howsoever caused, With liberty in the event of the steamer putting back or into any port, or otherwise being prevented from any cause from proceeding in the ordinary course of her voyage, to tranship the goods by any other steamer, and with liberty to sail with or without pilots, to call at any intermediate port or ports, and to tow and assist vessels in all situations.\nAs at present advised, I think the exception as to exemptions from negligence or default applies to the \"following perils\" and not to the antecedents named, namely, whether arising from the negligence, default or error in judgment of the pilot, master', mariners, engineers or other persons in the service of the ship, or for whose act the shipowner is liable, or otherwise howsoever, and so \"whether arising from negligence\" does not apply to all that has gone before, but only to the perils afterwards enumerated, and if so the exceptions in the bill of lading did not protect the shipowners. from negligence as to stowage, or any of the other matters named in the bill of lading anterior to the provision relating to negligence, &c., and therefore they did not contract themselves out of liability arising from negligent stowage.\nI think to enable the shipowner to contract against the effect of his own, that is his servants' negligence, the contract should be so clear and unambiguous as not to be open to any reasonable doubt as to the intention of the parties; if not made so clear, the construction should be against the shipowner and in favour of the shipper.\nBe this as it may, I think the terms of the bill of lading relate to the carriage of the goods on the voyage and not to anything before the commencement of the voyage.\nIn this case the bill of lading acknowledges the receipt of the goods in apparent good condition, to be delivered from the ship's deck in like good order and condition, and there is evidence to show that the meat was in good condition when received by the shipowners in their warehouse.\n(His Lordship then read a portion of the evidence and proceeded):\nCan there be any doubt that this meat left the warehouse in good condition and was landed at St. John's in a most dirty, filthy, disgraceful condition?\nI think the evidence was quite sufficient to warrant the jury in arriving at the conclusion that the meat when received at the warehouse and when ready to be shipped was in good condition.\nNo doubt, as in the case of \"The Freedom\" ([9]), from the cramming of the ship so as to prevent any circulation of air and the closing of the hatches the atmosphere in the ship's hold became heated, damp and vitiated, without means of escape, and this atmosphere was the proximate cause of the damage to the meat, the subject of this suit; and this was aided and accelerated by reason of taking in the cargo at an improper time, in view of the heavy rain falling and in view of the treading on of the meat with the dirty boots of the packers, and the tobacco spitting on the meat by the stowers. The duty of defendant to carry and deliver these goods arises out of his contract, and his failure to do so is a breach of that contract. I am of the opinion in this case that, independent of and apart from any construction to be put on the bill of lading, the defendants have broken their contract, without any sufficient excuse or justification, and t ht this action is maintainable. Upon this point the law seems to be abundantly clear.\nIn Czech v. The General Steam Navigation Company ([10]) Bovill C. J. says:\nThe evidence in every case must vary according to its peculiar circumstances; but if the goods are damaged, and no reasonable explanation of the damage can be given, except the negligence of the defendants, a jury are justified in finding that such negligence is proved.\nWILLES J:\nI will, however, assume that it is so for the purpose of this case, but it does not, therefore, restrict the plaintiffs as to the nature of the evidence by which such negligence shall be proved. To explain this by an illustration: If a shipment of sugar took place under a bill of lading, such as the present one, and it was proved that the sugar was sound when put on board, and had become converted into syrup before the end of the voyage, if that was put as an abstract case I think the shipowner would not be liable, because there may have been storms which occasioned the injury, without any want of care on the part of the captain or crew ; the injury alone, therefore, would be no evidence of negligence on their part. But if it was proved that the sugar was damaged by fresh water then there would be a strong probability that the hatches had been negligently left open, and the rain had so come in and done the injury, and, though it would be possible that some one had wilfully poured fresh water down into the hold, this would be so improbable that a jury would be justified in finding that the injury had been occasioned by negligenoe in the management of the ship. In Phillips v. Clark ([11]) Cockburn C. J. says:\u2014\nThe question arises upon these words in the margin of the bill of lading, \"Not accountable for leakage or breakage.\" Admitting that a carrier may protect himself from liability for loss or damage to goods intrusted to him to carry, even if occasioned by negligence\non the part of himself or his servants, provided any one is willing to contract with him on such terms, yet it seems to me that we ought not to put such a construction upon the contract as is here contended for when it is susceptible of another and more reasonable\none.* * * *\nBut there is no reason why, because he is by the terms of the contract relieved from that liability, we should hold that the plaintiff intended also to exempt him from any of the consequences arising from his negligence. The contract being susceptible of two constructions, I think we are bound to put that construction upon it which is the more consonant to reason and common sense; and to hold that it was only intended to exempt him from his ordinary common law liability, and not from responsibility for damage resulting from negligence. I therefore think the plaintiff is entitled to judgment.\nCrowder, J.:\nIt could hardly have been contemplated by the plaintiff that the defendant should be utterly absolved from the obligation of taking any care of the goods. The construction put upon the contract by my Lord is evidently the most just and reasonable, as absolving the defendant from liability for leakage and breakage, the result of mere accident, where no blame was imputable to the master, and for which, but for the stipulation in question, he would have been still liable. It clearly was not intended to relieve him from responsibility for leakage or breakage, the result of his negligence and want of care. The construction contended for on the part of the defendant would be giving the contract a sense not necessarily involved in the words as they stand.\nIn Taylor et al v. The Liverpool and Great Western Steam Company ([12]) it appears by the statement of the case that the following were the material parts of the bill of lading:\nReceived, in good order, &c., on board the steamship Nevada, one box, said to contain precious stones of the value of \u00a3250, to be delivered from the ship's deck (subject to the exceptions and restrictions in the following and undermentioned clause) at the port of New York; the act of God, the Queen's enemies, pirates, robbers, thieves, vermin, barratry of master and mariners, restraints of princes and rulers, or people, sweating, insufficiency of package, in size, strength, or otherwise, leakage, breakage, pilferage, wastage, rain, frost * * * and all damage, loss or injury arising from the perils or things above mentioned, and whether such perils or things arise from the negligence, default or error in judgment of the pilot, master, the mariners, engineers, stevedores, or other persons in the service of the shipowners, always excepted.\nLush J. says:\nThe first question is, does \"thieves\" include persons on board the ship, or is it to be limited, as has been held in cases as to policies of insurance, to persons outside the ship and not belonging to it. The word is ambiguous, and being of doubtful meaning it must receive such a construction as is most in favor of the shipper, and not such as is most in favor of the shipowner, for whose benefit the exceptions are framed; for if it was intended to give to it the larger meaning which is now contended for, the intention to give the shipowner that protection ought to have been expressed in clear and unambiguous language. It is not, I think, reasonable to suppose, when the language used is ambiguous, that it was intended that the shipowner should not be liable for thefts by one of the crew or persons on board. The shipowner must protect himself if he intends this by the use of unambiguous language.* * *\nThe case of Czech v. General Steam Navigation Co. ([13]) seems to me to have no direct bearing on this case. There it was stipulated in the bill of lading that the shipowner should not be liable for breakage, leakage or damage (which had been decided by previous cases not to include leakage, or breakage, or damage caused by the negligence of the shipowner or his servants).\nThe language of Lush J. is quoted in Hayn v. Culliford ([14]) and acted on by Denman, J. in delivering the judgment of the court.\nIn Grill v. General Iron Screw Colliery Co. ([15]), Kelly C. B. says:\nWith respect to the question whether a loss by the negligence of the defendant's servants is within the exception in the bill of lad- ing, I am of opinion that is concluded by authority. The cases of Phillips v. Clark ([16]) in the Common Pleas, and Lloyd v. General Iron Screw Collier Co. ([17]) in the Exchequer, are expressly in point; and we ought not to overrule those decisions, though sitting in a Court of Error, unless we think them to be opposed to some principle of law or to common sense. I agree with my brother Channell that, independently of all authority, the loss in this case is not within the exception. If shipowners wish to except losses resulting from the negligence of themselves or their servants they must do so by express language, though they may thereby make the bill of lading repugnant. To show how impossible it is to construe the exception in this bill of lading in the way contended for by the defendants, I need only refer to what Cresswell J. says in Phillips v. Clark (l).The question there arose upon a bill of lading which contained a stipulation that the owner was not to be accountable for leakage and breakage, and that learned judge says : \"Ordinarily, the master undertakes to take due and proper care of goods intrusted to him for conveyance, and to stow them properly, and he is responsible for leakage and breakage. Here he expressly stipulates not to be accountable for leakage and breakage, leaving the rest as before. That is to say, the ordinary obligation of the owner to take due and proper care of the goods was left untouched by the exception. It appears to me, and I believe to the rest of the court, that the loss in question arising from negligence is not within the exception and that the liability of the owners is only to be excluded by express words.\nWith reference to the duty of the shipowners to provide a fit and proper ship, and proper accommodation for stowage of the goods, the law is also clear. On this point I refer to the following authorities:\u2014\nIn Tattersall v. National Steamship Co. ([18]) the bill of lading contained the following exceptions and conditions:\nThese animals being in sole charge of shippers' servants, it is hereby expressly agreed that the National Steamship Company, Limited, or its agents or servants, are, as respects these animals, in no way responsible for either their escape from the steamer or for accidents, disease, or mortality, and that under no circumstances shall they be held liable for more than \u00a35 for each of the animals; all dogs to be placed wherever the captain may appoint, but at the sole risk of the shipper and (or) owner, the act of God, the Queen's enemies, pirates, robbers, thieves by land or at sea, barratry of master or mariners, restraint of princes, rulers, or people; loss or damage resulting from heat, boilers, steam or steam machinery, including consequences of defect therein, or damage thereto, collision, stranding, or other perils of the sea, rivers, steam and steam navigation; and all damage, loss or injury arising from the perils or matters above mentioned, and whether such perils or matters arise from the negligence, default or error in judgment of the pilot, master, mariners, engineers, stevedores, or other persons in the service of the shipowners.\nDay J. says:\u2014\nI take it to have been clearly established, if not previously, at any rate since the case of Steel v. State Line Steamship Company (1[19]), that where there is a contract to carry goods in a ship there is, in the absence of any stipulation to the contrary, an implied engagement on the part of the person so undertaking to carry that the ship is reasonably fit for the purposes of such carriage. In this case it is clear that the ship was not reasonably fit for the carriage of these cattle. There is, therefore, a breach of their implied engagement by the defendants, and the plaintiff having sustained damage in consequence, must be entitled to recover the amount of such damage, unless the defendants are protected by any express stipulation.\nI have considered the terms of the bill of lading, and as I construe it, its stipulations, which have been relied upon, all relate to the carriage of the goods on the voyage, and do not in any way affect the liability for not providing a ship fit for their reception.\nThey were damaged simply because the defendant's servants neglected their preliminary duty of seeing that the ship was in a proper condition to receive them, and received them into a ship that was not fit to receive them.\nA. L. Smith. J. says:\nIt is admitted that the damage was occasioned by the negligence of the shipowner's servants before the voyage commenced, in not properly cleansing and disinfecting the ship. There is unquestionably a duty on the part of the shipowner to have the ship reasonably fit for the carriage of the goods. The case of Steel v. The State Line Steamship Company (1) conclusively so decides. Is there, then, anything in this bill of lading to exempt the defendants from what would primd facie be their liability in respect of the breach of this duty? I do not think there is. The terms of the bill of lading which have been alluded to appear to me to deal with the contract so far as it relates to the carriage of the goods upon the voyage; they do not, in my opinion, relate to anything before the commencement of the voyage.\nBovill C. J. In Stanton v. Richardson ([20]):\nThe ship must be fit to receive any reasonable cargo of the nature that the shipowner undertook to carry.\nIn Carver's Carriage by Sea ([21]) the law is thus laid down:\nA shipowner will not be exonorated from losses arising from any of these excepted causes when there has been any neglect on his part to take all reasonable steps to avoid them, or to guard against their possible effects; Siordet v. Hall ([22]), The Freedom ([23]), or to arrest their consequences. (See illustrations cited in Ang.Carr, ss. 160-164), Notara v. Henderson ([24]). And where these causes have followed upon a departure from the proper prosecution of the voyage, and would not have operated but for that, the shipowner is not excused; as where a tempest has been encountered after a deviation from the proper course; Scaramangav. Scamp ([25]), Davis v. Garrett ([26]). And see infra, ch. X., or where the cargo has deteriorated owing to improper delay on the voyage. Hawes v. S. E. Ry. Co. ([27]), but see Baldwin v. L.C. & D. Ry. Co. ([28]).\nAnd further, the shipowner is always responsible for loss or damage to the goods, however caused, if the ship was not in a seaworthy condition when she commenced her voyage, and if the loss would not have arisen but for that unseaworthiness. This is so, although the shipowner may have taken all reasonable pains and precautions to make the ship seaworthy, if, in fact, he has failed to make her so. He undertakes absolutely that she shall be fit, on sailing upon the voyage, to carry the cargo which she has on board, and with it to encounter safely whatever perils a ship of that kind may fairly be expected to be exposed to in the course of that voyage at that season of the year. If her unfitness becomes a real cause of loss or damage to the cargo the shipowner is responsible, although other causes, from whose effects he is excused, either at common law or by express contract, have contributed to produce the loss. The Glenfruin ([29]), Steel v. State Line SS. Co. ([30]), Kopitoff v. Wilson ([31]), Lyon v. Mells ([32]). Lord Blackburn, in Steel v. State Line Steamship Co., ([33]), said: \u2014\nI take it, my Lords, to be quite clear, both in England and in Scotland, that where there is a contract to carry goods in a ship, whether that contract is in the shape of a bill of lading or any other form, there is a duty on the part of the person who furnishes or supplies that ship, or that ship's room, unless something be stipulated which should prevent it, that the ship shall be fit for its purpose. That is generally expressed by saying that it shall be seaworthy; and I think, also, in marine contracts\u2014contracts for sea carriage\u2014that is what is properly called a \" warranty,\" not merely that they should do their best to make the ship fit, but that the ship should really be fit.\nThe conclusion, then, at which I have arrived, is that the defendants were guilty of a breach of duty in taking the meat on board at an improper time, in reference to the state of the weather, and also in the manner in which it was handled on being taken on board. If the majority of the court agree in this view, and with the construction I have put on the bill of lading, then the appeal should be allowed with costs, and the verdict restored. If, on the contrary, a majority cannot arrive at this conclusion, then, as the defendants were also guilty of a breach of duty in failing to provide a fit and proper ship, and a fit and proper place in that ship for the stowage of goods contracted to be carried; and as the plaintiffs can maintain an action for such breach of duty, but as the trial of this case seems to have turned rather on the terms of the bill of lading than on any breach of the implied obligation of the shipowners, the appeal should be allowed with costs and a new trial ordered, with leave to the plaintiff to amend his declaration as he may be advised and to the defendants to amend their pleas to meet such amended declaration.\nSTRONG J.\u2014If the respondents' liability as carriers had been in no way restricted by contract there was ample evidence to warrant the verdict. The decision of the court below, in setting aside the verdict, can, therefore, only be supported by establishing that the terms of the bill of lading were such as to exonerate the respondents from liability for the negligence of their crew; and this is the only question which need be considered. The exception in the bill of lading is as follows:\nThe act of God, the Queen's enemies, pirates, robbers, thieves, vermin, barratry of master or mariners, restraint of princes and rulers, or people, or resulting from strikes or mob, loss or damage resulting from sweating, insufficiency of package, leakage, breakage, pilferage, wastage, rust, frost, decay, rain, spray, stowage, or contact with or smell or evaporation from any other goods, insufficiency of marks, numbers, address or description of goods shipped, injury to wrappers, however caused, or from any of the following perils, whether arising from the negligence, default or error in judgment of the pilot, master, mariners, engineers or other persons in the service of the ship, or for whose acts the shipowner is liable, or otherwise howsoever, always excepted\u2014namely, risk of craft or hulk, or transhipment, explosion, heat or fire at sea, in craft or hulk, or on shore, boilers, steam or machinery, or from the consequences of any damage or injury thereto, however such damage or injury may be caused. Collision, stranding or other peril of the seas, rivers, navigation or land transit of whatever nature or kind soever, and howsoever caused, with liberty, in the event of the steamer putting back or into any port, or otherwise being prevented from any cause from proceeding in the ordinary course of her voyage, to tranship the goods by any other steamer, and with liberty to sail with or without pilots, to call at any intermediate port or ports, and to tow and assist vessels in all situations.\nIt appears to me that the construction of this exception is plain, and entitles the shipowners to the exemption which they claim. The obvious and grammatical reading of it is, that \"loss or damage resulting from stowage\" is an excepted peril \"whether arising from the negligence, default, or error in judgment of the pilot, master, mariners, engineers, or other persons in the service of the ship, for whose acts the shipowner is liable, or otherwise howsoever. That this, and not that which would confine the exception of negligence to the perils immediately afterwards enumerated, is the proper construction is apparent when we consider that what is excepted is \"loss or damage,'' which might result as well from perils antecedently specified as from those subsequently mentioned.\nThe bill of lading in Steel v. State Line Company ([34]) was similarly worded, but the House of Lords there did not pronounce any judgment on the question of construction, inasmuch as it was sufficient for the disposition of that case to hold that the shipowners were liable on the implied undertaking that the ship was seaworthy, of which it was held there had been a breach and from which there had been no dispensation from liability. That case is, therefore, not an authority here for either party.\nAs regards contracts for carriage of goods by sea, the Legislature has not interposed to control the contracts of the parties, stipulating for freedom from liability for negligence, as it has in England in the case of railway and canal companies, and here also to some extent in the case of railway carriers. In cases like the present the parties are free to enter into any contract they may think fit.\nIt is no doubt a well established and sound rule of construction that the exception of liability for the negligence of the crew and other persons for whose acts the owner is, by the general law, responsible, should be provided for in the most plain and unequivocal terms, and that all doubtful or ambiguous clauses should be strictly interpreted against the owner for whose benefit they are introduced into the contract. But giving the appellant the full benefit of this rule, I am unable to see that there can be the least doubt as to the meaning of the exception found in this bill of lading. Then, this being the proper construction of the instrument the onus was upon the respondents to bring themselves within it, and this I am of opinion they have done, since the evidence clearly established that the damage to the meat was caused by bad stowage, careless exposure to rain, and the negligent conduct of the crew. The verdict was therefore properly set aside. As I have said, it was for the respondents to bring themselves within the exception, and the plaintiff would have made a sufficient prim\u00e2 facie case by merely proving that the meat reached its destination in a damaged condition. The plaintiffs did not, however, confine themselves to & prim\u00e2 facie case of this kind, but by their own evidence established that the loss was occasioned by some of the excepted perils and the negligence of the crew, from which, on the construction of the exception already indicated, it resulted that the plaintiff by his own case established that there was no cause of action. The rule was therefore properly made absolute for a non-suit, and this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I entirely concur in the judgment prepared by the Chief Justice, and think the appeal should be allowed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I concur with my brother Strong, and for the reasons by him given I think that this appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014There can be no doubt that these defendants might have by their contract with the plaintiff, if the latter had pleased to enter into such a contract, exempted themselves from all liability for any loss or damage which should happen to the carcasses of meat delivered to them to be carried, even though such damage or loss should in any respect result from a cause occurring before the vessel in which the meat was to be earned should proceed upon her voyage, and eyen though such cause should arise or be occasioned by the negligence of the defendants, or any of their servants, or of any person for whose acts, default or neglect they should be responsible.\nThe plaintiff's declaration in the present case contains five counts, the substantial allegations in each of which are, that the plaintiff delivered to the defendants certain goods of the plaintiff upon a certain contract made by the plaintiff with the defendants, whereby the latter agreed to use due and proper care in stowing the said goods on a ship of defendants, and carrying them from Prince Edward Island to St. Johns, Newfoundland, and there to deliver them to the plaintiff in as good condition as they were received by them (certain perils and causalties only excepted), and that the defendants, though not prevented by any of the perils or casualties excepted, did not use such due and proper care as aforesaid, and failed to carry the said goods safely and to deliver them to plaintiff in good condition as aforesaid, but so carelessly and negligently conducted themselves in the stowage of the said goods and otherwise in the premises, and took such bad care of the goods, that by reason thereof a great part of the said goods, became lost to the plaintiff, and much damaged and deteriorated in value.\nTo these counts the defendants pleaded several pleas, among others that the goods mentioned in the declaration were delivered to the defendants and were received by them to be carried under a bill of lading signed on behalf of the defendants and accepted by the plaintiff, and that except the contract contained in the bill of lading there was never any contract between the defendants or the plaintiff. They then set forth the bill of lading verbatim, which contained a clause exempting the defendants from any loss or damage which should occur to the goods (which consisted of carcasses of meat) from, among other causes, sweating, insufficiency of package, decay or stowage, and they averred in one plea that the loss and damage complained of arose from sweating, in another from insufficiency of package, in another from decay, and in another from stowage, all being excepted cases in the bill of lading. To these several pleas the plaintiff replied, that, although admitting that the said goods were delivered to and received by the defendants on the terms and conditions in the said bill of lading mentioned, yet the plaintiff alleged that the said several causes which the defendants in their said respective pleas alleged to have been excepted in the said bill of lading were occasioned by and arose through the negligence of the defendants, and were not, nor was either of them, within or covered by the several and respective exceptions in the said bill of lading as alleged. The substantial issue offered by these replications was simply this: Admitting the loss and damage to have arisen from sweating, from insufficiency of package, from decay, or from stowage, in whole or in part from some or one of those causes, were these several causes within the clause of exemption from liability contained in the bill of lading if they arose or were occasioned, as the replications alleged they were, by the negligence of the defendants? Now, as the bill of lading was set out verbatim in the pleas to which these replications were pleaded, the question of the defendants' liability could have been determined upon demurrer to the replications, which, admitting the only matter of fact alleged in them, namely, that the several causes of loss and damage pleaded were occasioned by the negligence of the defendants would have raised the single question of law upon the right determination of which the defendants' liability depends, namely, whether the bill of lading does or does not exempt the defendants from liability, assuming the causes of loss and damage as pleaded by the defendants to have been occasioned by the negligence of the defendants as alleged in the replications. Instead of demurring, the defendants, however, joined issue, which still left the question of the defendants liability to be determined as a matter of Jaw depending upon the construction of the contract contained in the bill of lading. At the trial the plaintiff went into evidence which proved that the immediate cause of the loss and damage proved was sweating and decay, which necessitated the condemnation and destruction of a great part of the meat as unfit for human food ; but it was alleged that this sweating and decay arose or was aggravated by improper stowage, and evidence was adduced on the part of the plaintiff, although contradicted by witnesses of the defendants, to show that the men employed in stowing the meat on the vessel trampled upon and otherwise ill-treated it, and this ill-usage of the meat in the stowing of it contributed, as was alleged by some of the witnesses, in some measure though not altogether, to the sweating and decay which were the immediate cause of the loss and damage. At the close of the plaintiff's case the defendants' counsel moved for a non-suit, upon the ground that by the contract in the bill of lading, the defendants were exempt from all liability, even though the causes of damage did arise by reason of the negligence of the defendants. Leave was renewed to the defendants to move the court above to enter a non-suit and the case was left to the jury, chiefly upon the point raised as to the mode in which the meat was stowed in the vessel, and with a charge which assumed the defendants not to be exempted from liability arising from such mode of stowing the meat and the jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff with $600 damages. Upon a motion made in the court above a rule nisi was obtained by the defendants to show cause why this verdict should not be set aside and a verdict entered for the defendants, or a non-suit entered, or a new trial granted on the following grounds:\n1. That the learned judge misdirected the jury in charging them that the defendants were liable for damages caused by improper stowage that he should have charged that the defendants were exempted from such damages by the exemptions in the bill of lading.\n2. That the learned judge refused to charge that the defendants were not liable for decay.\n3. That the judge refused to charge that the defendants were not liable for sweating or heating.\n4. That the damages were excessive.\n5. That there should be a verdict entered for the defendants as to the counts alleging negligence in carrying, because there was no evidence of negligence in carrying.\n6. That there should be a verdict for defendants on the tenth plea which was, that the plaintiff could have protected himself from the loss which occurred by insurance.\nThis rule the court, after argument, made absolute for entering a non-suit, from which judgment this appeal is taken, and thereby the case is brought back to the original and sole question upon which the plaintiff's right of action turns, namely, does or does not the contract in the bill of lading exempt the defendants from liability for loss or damage occurring from sweating, or from decay, or from stowage\u2014 assuming these causes to have been occasioned by the negligence of the defendants? The answer to this question depends simply upon the proper answer to be given to the subsidiary question, namely, upon the proper construction of the contract do the words inserted therein, namely,\nWhether arising from the negligence, default or error in judgment of the pilot, master, mariners, engineers, or other persons in the service of the ship, or for whose acts the shipowner is liable, or otherwise, howsoever always excepted apply only to the points enumerated subsequently to this clause, or does the clause apply as well to the preceding causes of loss enumerated, or such of them as could arise from the negligence of the persons named, which included, among other causes, loss or damage resulting from \"sweating,\" or from \"decay,\" or from \"stowage,\" as well as to loss or damage arising from any of the perils subsequently enumerated?\nThe whole sentence in which the clause of exemption occurs is not expressed with the most perfect grammatical precision, but the collocation of the part relating to negligence cannot have the effect of limiting the application of that part to the causes of loss subsequently enumerated; and in my opinion it applies equally to such of those previously enumerated as could be occasioned\nby the defendants or any other persons employed in the service of the ship, or for whose acts the shipowner is liable.\nThe rule, therefore, to enter a non-suit was, in my opinion, properly granted, and this appeal should be dismissed with costs. It was argued that under the first count the plaintiff was entitled to recover something for the want of due and proper care and skill of the defendants in stowing the goods, though there was no attempt made to distinguish the loss, if, indeed, it could be done, from the subsequent loss by sweating and decay ; but it is not pretended that there was, indeed it is concluded by the admissions on the pleadings, that there was not, any contract whatever between the defendants and the plaintiff in relation to the goods but that contained in the bill of lading, and the contract in the first count is stated as one promise to use proper skill in stowing, and to carry, &c., certain perils and casualties only excepted, which plainly applies to the one contract in the bill of lading; so that, apart from a breach of the contract in the bill of lading, it is apparent that the plaintiff has not alleged any cause of action in respect of which he could recover upon this record.\nA technical point was also taken, namely, that the rule nisi for leave to enter a non-suit contains, as is contended, no grounds for a non-suit but only for a new trial; but there is nothing in this objection, even if it could be entertained on an appeal, for the objection to the rulings of the judge which are stated, namely, that the defendants were liable for damages caused by improper stowage\u2014that he should have ruled that they were exempted from such damages by the exemptions in the bill of lading\u2014that he refused to direct that the defendants were not liable for decay, or for sweating or heating\u2014if these objections were well founded are sufficient reasons why the plaintiff should be non-suited, and the court below having made the rule absolute for a non-suit a court of appeal cannot take notice of such a technical objection; which, if there was anything in it, affected only a matter of procedure in the court below.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Neil McLeod.\nSolicitor for respondents: Arthur Peters.\n[1] 3 App. Cas. 72.\n[2] L.

J. and Gwynne J.dissenting, that the combination was not previously in use and was a patentable invention.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) in an action brought against respondent, a carriage manufacturer, of the city of Montreal, for damages for the infringement of a patent of invention, issued to appellant on the 6th May, 1881, for an improvement in the construction of carriages, called \"Dansereau's carriage tops.\"\nThe letters patent give the following definition of the invention claimed by appellant:\n\"It consists in the combination of a top made in folding sections as described, with the posts D, O fe P arranged to turn down substantially as set forth.\"\nThe paper called specification which is annexed to the letters patent contains a more explicit description of the pretended discovery and is as follows:\u2014\n\"This invention has reference more particularly to the construction and arrangement of the top of carriages, to obviate the difficulty that when tops. are made so that they \"let down\" and are formed of flexible material and in a short time show all the ribs of the bows, and thereby become shabby looking and ill shaped, and this defect cannot be remedied without removing the covering of the top, or replacing it with a new one; by my invention a rigid top is provided, arranged in sections so that when it is desired to \" turn down \" the top, it may be folded up and then turn down. Also, as constructed, whenever the top that I have invented becomes shabby it is only necessary to coat it with paint to make it look as good as new. My invention also enables glass pannels to be used all round the carriage, a thing that is very much desired by the public at this time\"\nSix months after the registering of this patent, the plaintiff caused an additional one to be registered with the following description:\n\"I It consists first in the combination of a top divided into rigid parts and hinged together as described, one of the said parts secured in posts C and the whole of the parts turning back, with the said posts; 2nd, in the combination of a top divided into rigid parts as described and arranged to turn completely back as described, with back turn down posts C and front turn down posts H.\"\nThe defendant pleaded:\n1st. The carriage tops manufactured by the defendants were neither an imitation of those built by the plaintiff nor an infringement on his patent.\n2nd.The pretended invention of plaintiff was not one in reality and his patent was null and void. At the date when said patent was registered carriage tops made of rigid material and folding by sections were well known to the public and had been in use for a considerable time; the plaintiff was not the inventor of the carriage tops described in his letters patent; plaintiff's patent had been obtained by fraud and false representations and could not form a basis of a suit at law.\nThese two pleas were followed by a general denial.\nAfter evidence on both sides was concluded the court, of its own motion, appointed experts to examine and compare the carriage tops of four carriages made by respondent and alleged by appellant to be infringements on his patent; and also to examine the carriage top of one carnage, in the possession of C. A. Dumaine, alleged by respondent to be made on the same principle as appellant's invention, and to have been in use long before the appellant obtained his patent; and to ascertain and report on the 17th September, 8 3, whether they were constructed on the principle covered by the appellant's s patents, exhibits Nos. 1 and 2 and to state the differences if any existed.\nThe court on the said 17th September, on motion of appellant extended the delay for the experts to report, until the 20th of September, 1883, the report was then filed, and was favorable to plaintiff's contentions.\nThe court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff, which judgment was subsequently reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench.\nGeoffrion Q. C. for appellant.\nsaint Pierre for respondent. Sir W J. Ritchie C.J. \u2011 I cannot discover that the invention is novel, that it developes any new principle, or exhibits the application of known principles to a new use. The principle claimed by the plaintiff on the folding of carriage-tops appears to have been applied and used by Dumaine in reference to the front part of carriages for some time before the plaintiff obtained his patent, and plaintiff's patent would seem to be only the application of the same principle to the rear part, and Mr. Larivi\u00e8re, one of the experts, says: \"the principle of the front part of Dumaine's carriage could be applied to the rear part as well and the fact that the post is solidly attached to the top or connected with it, by means of hinges does not constitute any difference.\"\nThe principle in Dumaine's carriage seems to be precisely the same as the invention covered by the letters patent 1 and 2 In both the tor) is solid in front both open by sections, and the principle is, therefore, exactly the same in both cases; therefore, as I can discover no new invention by plaintiff in this case, I am not disposed to interfere with the judgment of the Queen's Bench\u2011that plaintiffs patent disclosed no new patentable invention or discovery.\nStrong J.\u2011 I am iu favor of allowing the appeal for the reasons which will be given by my brother Mr Justice Taschereau.\nFOURNIER.J I agree with the view of the case taken by Mr Justice Taschereau and also with the reasons given by Mr. Justice Loranger, in the Superior Court, for upholding the appellant's patent.\nTaschereau J.\u2014 This is an appeal by the plantiff from a judgment in an action brought against respondent, a carriage manufacturer, of the city of Montreal, for damages for the infringement of a patent of invention, issued to appellant in May, 1881, for an improvement in the construction of carriages called \"Dansereau's carriage tops,\" which was extended by a subsequent patent issued on 7th November, 1881.\nThe Superior Court had maintained the plainitiff''s action hut the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment, and dismissed the action on the ground the said patent discloses no new patentable invention or discovery.\nIt appears by the first patent and specifications, and drawings annexed thereto, that the invention of the appellant is an improvement in the construction of carriages, by the combination of a folding sectional roof joined to the carriage posts, in such a way and by such an arrangement of sections of the roof folding in themselves, and of the carriage posts on hinges, that the whole carriage top can be made (like stationary tops) entirely in sections of wood or other rigid material with glass sashes all round, and the carriage be opened in the centre into two principal parts, and at once converted into an open uncovered carriage.\nThe arrangement of all the parts being (as shown by the specifications and drawings) combined in such a way that the sections of the roof opened and folded in themselves, the lining is protected from the weather and the sashes also protected by a special device. One of the most important devices used in the combination, to convert the carriage from a covered to an uncovered carriage is that some of the sections of the roof, are rigidly attached to the door posts, so that when the carriage is to be converted from a closed into an open carriage, two of the door posts are thrown back on hinges with the rigid sections attached, and two are thrown forward with the other rigid sections of the roof attached; or in summer, the top may be left up as a protection from the sun, with the sides, back, and front all open, the sashes being let down.\nThe respondent pleaded first, that he had not copied plaintiff's invention, and secondly, that the patent covered no new or patentable invention.\nAs to the first of these pleas, there is no question. That the respondent did manufacture carriage tops similar in principle to the one described in this patent is clearly proved, and in fact was hardly denied by the respondent at the hearing. The two experts found against the respondent on this point.\nOn the second of the respondent's pleas, by which he alleged that the plaintiff's patent disclosed no new or patentable invention, there is more difficulty.\nI have however come to the conclusion that this plea is also unfounded, and that the judgment of the Superior Court was right.\nThe respondent to sustain this examined seven witnesses Dumaine, Racette, Roussel and Giroux, carters: MacCabe a blacksmith and Houle and Parizeau, carriage makers; the two latter only may be classed as mechanics skilled in the subject matter of the invention, but do not appear to have had any long experience in the business.\nThe first witness, Dumaine, who is described as a cooper and a carter, says, that on a visit to New York, in 1878, he got the plan of a carriage top, which he brought to Montreal, and that the front part folded like the model B, and that he had a carriage of his own, remodelled on the same plan by a carriage maker, but he could not tell, without having the carriage before him whether it closed like the model or not. Racette a carter, in the employ of Dumaine, says he saw a few months previous to 1881, a carriage, the front of which was like appellant's model, but it appears the carriage he saw belonged to Mr. Dumaine. Houle, a carriage maker says, he saw the carriage of Mr. Dumaine, and that it folds up like appellant's. That he had seen carriages like appellant's for five, six, or seven years, perhaps longer; but he afterwards says, he never saw carriages like Mr.Dumaine's until he saw his He does not say where he had seen any other carriages like the model, whether in Canada or the United States and he describes no other carriages than Mr. Dumaine's.\nPapineau testifies that he made in 180, a carriage with folded top like that of model, that it was a round carriage, repaired for Mr. Hoofsteter. He had made one for Mr. F X. Roy like the model, but Mr. Roy had been prosecuted by appellant, and he had been told that Mr. Roy had promised to make no more carriages like that and that the suit had been settled.\nMaccabe, a blacksmith, says that he examined the carriage of Mr. Dumaine and that the front part closes in the same way as appellant's model B; he then states and describes differences in the constructions and adds, que ca revient toujours \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 la m\u00eame affaire. But he never made any carriage like the model B.\nGiroux, a carter, says he has seen carriage tops folding like the model B for a long time\u2014Mr. Marlo had one for nine years. Mr. Hoofsteter had one for three or four years. Mr. Mario's was made by F. X. Royas to the carriage of Mr. Mario, he cannot say positively qu'elle ferme les deux draps ensemble.\nThese were the witnesses produced by respondent in support of this plea.\nOn examining Papineau's testimony it appears that Roy had been prosecuted for manufacturing carriages on appellant's model, and that the action had been settled by Roy promising not to manufacture any more. This statement rebuts the assertion that the carriage made for Mario by Roy, had been made prior to the appellant's patent, for, if such had been the case, there would have been no reason for Roy's settling appellant's action and stopping the manufacture. It may be observed here that the appellant's invention was found by expert and skilled carriage makers to be so new and useful that they consented to pay $10 and $20 as royalty for each top manufactured on the model patented. Giroux, being a carter and not a carriage maker and therefore not skilled in the construction of carriages, the general appearance of the folding of the top might have seemed to him so like the model, that he could see no difference in principle. It does not appear that he examined Mario's carriage with any care, for on cross-examination, he is unable to say how it closed; consequently he could make no comparison. Giroux also says, that Mr Hoofsteter had one folding like the model for three or four years, but he says that it was a coupe; he says also that this was the same carriage that the witness Papineau says he altered from a round top, for Mr. Hoofsteter, by cutting the front.\nAs the points of resemblance of Mario's carriage and Hoofsteter's carriage to the appellant's are not shown, the only carriage known prior to appellant's patents, about which there can be any question of resemblance, in the principle of construction, is that of Dumaine. As to the respondent's plea, that appellant's s alleged invention was used by others long before appellant obtained his patent, the respondent seeks to show this, by attempting to prove that the carriage of Dumaine constructed by him, before appellant obtained his patent, was on the same principle as appellants.\nThe respondent attempted to sustain this part of his plea by the same witnesses above referred to, but in my opinion, completely failed in his attempt.\nThe appellant brought in as witnesses men of large experience in the carriage trade, in Montreal, who all swear that they never saw any tops folding on the same principle as the one patented, and the evidence on this part of the case strongly preponderates in favor of the plaintiff. The material part of the contestation, as already remarked, was as to one of Dumaine's carriages, which the respondent alleged was similar and anterior to that of the plaintiff. But the report of the expert Simpson against this contention seems to me so clear and able, that I am not surprised that the Superior Court did not hesitate to adopt it. I would allow the appeal with costs distraits.\nGWYNNE J \u2011 I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed upon the grounds taken in the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, appeal side, that the appellant's patent disclosed no novelty.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant; Geoffrion, Dorion, Lafieur & Rinfret.\nSolicitors for respondent: saint Pierre, Globensky & Poirier.\n"}

J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nJurisdiction\u2014 Appeal\u2014Future rights\u2014Supreme and Exchequer Courts Acts Sec. 29 Subsec. (b.)\nIn an action for $1333.36, a balance of one of several money payments of $2000 each, one whereof the defendants agreed to pay to the plaintiff every year so long as certain security given by the plaintiff for the defendants remained in the hands of the government, the defendants contended that the security had been released by the action of the government and they were therefore not liable to pay the amount sued for, or any further instalments. The Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) held that the security had not been released and gave judgment for the amount claimed. The defendants applied to one of the judges of that court and obtained leave to appeal on the ground that if the judgment was well founded then future rights would be bound and they had become liable for two other instalments of $2000 each for which actions were pending.\nHeld, that the appeal would not lie, because even if the future rights of the defendants were bound by the judgment such future rights had no relation to any of the matters or things enumerated in subsec. b. of sec. 29 of the S. & E. C. Act.\nThe words \" where the rights in future might be bound \" in this subsection are governed and qualified by the preceding words, and to make a case appealable when the amount in controversy is less than $2000, not only must future rights be bound by the judgment, but the future rights to be so bound must relate to \"a fee of office, duty, rent, revenue or sum of money payable to Her Majesty, or to some title to lands or tenements, or to annual rents out of lands or tenements, or to some like matters and things.\" APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court by which the respondent's action for $1,333.66 was dismissed.\nThe only point determined upon this appeal was that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench in this case was not appealable.\nThe petition presented by appellant to the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada sets forth the grounds relied on by appellant and is as follows :\n\"To any of the honorable judges of the Court of Queen's Bench, Province of Quebec, appeal side, sitting in Montreal, the petition of Ebenezer E. Gilbert et al., the respondents above mentioned, respectfully show '.\n\"That by judgment of this honorable court rendered on the twenty-second day of December, instant, they have been compelled to pay to the appellant the sum of eleven hundred and sixty-six dollars and sixty-seven cents ($1,166.67) and costs, as well in the Court of Queen's Bench as in the Superior Court.\n\"That said judgment was based on a letter, whereby in substance your petitioners agreed to pay the appellant the sum of two thousand dollars per annum, for the use of certain security (to the extent of $15,000) deposited by appellant with the government of the Dominion of Canada, so long as such security was not released by said Government of Canada.\n\"That your petitioners contended that such security had been released on the twentieth of November 1885 by the return then made by the said government of Canada, through your petitioners to the said appe1lant, of a certain deposit receipt of the Exchange Bank of Canada for a like sum of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00), but which return of said deposit receipt this honorable court has decided not to constitute a release of the said security.\n\"That the said government of Canada contends that by the return of said deposit receipt, the said security was entirely released, the said appellant having brought a direct action against the said government of Canada for the sum of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000 00), which is now before the Exchequer Court for the Dominion of Canada, and the said Government now defending the said action, and refusing to return to the said Gilman the said sum of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) claimed by him.\n\"That by reason of the premises, if the judgment of this honorable court is well founded, your petitioners have become liable already for the payment of two other sums of two thousand dollars each, to wit, for the year commencing on the twenty-sixth day of July, 1886, and on the twenty-sixth day of July, 1887, and actions for said sums have been instituted by the appellant against your petitioners, and one of said actions is now pending in appeal before this honorable court, and the other one is pending before the Superior Court for the district of Montreal.\n\"That by reason of the premises, the judgment rendered in this cause is of a nature to bind and affect certain rights between the parties, and does in fact decide the said two cases for two thousand dollars each, pending as aforesaid before the course in this district.\n\"Whereby the present judgment is susceptible of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\"Wherefore your petitioner prays that he may be permitted to appeal from the judgment of this court rendered in this cause on the twenty-second day ox December, inst. to the said Supreme Court of Canada and justice will be done.\" The parties having been heard Mr. Justice Church made the following order :\n\"Seeing that the matter in controversy in this cause relates to matters or things where the rights in future might be bound, and that the said Ebenezer E. Gilbert, et at., have given security to the extent of five hundred dollars, as required by the 46th section of chapter 135 of the Revised Statutes of Canada (The Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, 1886), that they will effectually prosecute their said appeal, and pay such costs and damages as may be awarded against them by the Supreme Court, the appeal to the Supreme Court is hereby allowed.\"\nBefore the Supreme Court Mr. Gilman moved to quash the appeal on the ground of want of jurisdiction.\nC. Robinson Q. C. and Archibald Q. C. contra.\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2011I certainly for one do not see my way to entertain this appeal, especially when we take it in connection with the decision of this court in the Bank of Toronlo v. Le Cur\u00e9 and Les Marguilliers, &c., ([1]), and also the late decision in the Privy Council in Allan v. Pratt ([2]).\nThe statute enacts \"no appeal shall lie where in the matter in controversy does not amount to the sum of value of two thousand dollars.\" In this court when the question first arose we held that the matter claimed in the declaration was to govern as being the amount in controversy, but a late decision of the Privy Council has determined that the matter in controversy is the amount of the judgment. In this case it is not claimed that either the amount claimed by the declaration or adjudged by the judgment amounts to the sum of two thousand dollars. Then to make it appealable the appllant must be prepared to show that it \" relates to a fee of office,\"\u2014which it is not,\u2014\"duty, rent, revenue or sum of money payable to Her Majesty\"\u2014which it is not,\u2014or \"to any title to lands or tenements \",\u2014which it is not,\u2014or a \"annual rents\" that is annual rents out of lands or tenements\u2014 which it is not,\u2014or \"such like matters or things where the rights in future might be bound.\" I have no doubt that the words s such like matters or things '' are governed by the preceding words. If ever the doctrine noscitur a sociis is applicable it is in this case\u2014and under these circumstansces I cannot see how we can get the matter within the above named exceptions of the section or within the portion of the section which declares that to make the case appealable the matter in controversy must amount to two thousand dollars.\nAs to the argument of inconvenience all I can say is that the legislature has not given the right of appeal in the present case. If hereafter a case should arise in connection with this transaction in which the amount in controversy is two thousand dollars and it is determined in a manner hostile to the present appellant, then such a case would be appealable to this court not because it affects any future rights, but because the amount in controversy was sufficient and this court would not be bound in that matter by any decision of the court below, inasmuch as that court is not a superior tribunal to this court.\nUnder these circumstances I cannot escape the conclusion that this is not an appealable case and therefore the appeal must be quashed with costs,\nSTRONG J.\u2014The jurisdiction to entertain this appeal must depend altogether on sec. 29 sub-sec. b. of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act. It is said that future rights will be bound by the judgment appealed if it is allowed to stand unreversed. it is plain however that this is not enough, for not only must future rights be bound by the judgment in order that an appeal may be admitted when the amount in controversy is less than $2000, but further the future rights to be so bound must relate to some or one of the matters or things specified in the sub-section in question, viz: to a fee of office, duty, rent, revenue or sum of money payable to Her Majesty, or to some title to lands or tenements, or to some like matters and things where the same consequence will follow, viz: when future rights will be bound. Now it is manifest that in the present case, even if future rights will be bound by the judgment under appeal, such future rights will have no relation whatever to any of the matters or things enumerated in this sub-section in question.\nIt therefore follows that the case does not come within the only exception to the first part of section 29 to which jurisdiction to entertain it has been ascribed, and the appeal must therefore be quashed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I do not dissent. I have given my reasons at length in the cases of Joyce v. Hart ([3]) Bank of Toronto v. Le Cur\u00e9 et les Marguilliers, &c. de la Paroisse de la Nativit\u00e9 ([4]), and in Reburn v Corporation of Ste. Anne ([5]) as to my interpretation of this section 29 giving a right of appeal in cases coming from the Province of Quebec.\nIn my opinion the case of Allan v. Pratt ([6]) decided by the Privy Council is not applicable to the present case.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I need only add that we are asked to read this section as if it read\u2014\" Or in any matters or things where the rights in future might be bound.\" But the words the legislature has used are \"such like matters,\" thereby qualifying them to such matters or things as are precedently mentioned. Now what would be the result if we were to adopt the construction contended for? Take an extreme case. Suppose a man owed $1,900 payable by instalments, and the action was taken only when all the instalments were due, the case would not be appealable but if after default of the first instalments, could it be said he had a right to appeal because the decision on that instalment would affect the decision as to future instalments? Certainly not. But putting aside the consideration of \"rights in future,\" I am clearly of opinion that this case is not appealable and this conclusion is in affirmance of the decision of this court in the case of the Bank of Toronto v. Le cur\u00e9 et les Marguilliers, &c ([7]). As to Allan v. Pratt, ([8]) I do not think this case comes up under the part of the section of the act to which that decision is applicable. I suppose, however, that we are bound by that decision and the members of the bar from the Province of Quebec, will no doubt understand that the decision of this court in Joyce v. Hart ([9]) has been overruled\nPATTERSON J.\u2014There are no future rights, within the meaning of the clause limiting appeals from the Province of Quebec, affected by this judgment. The words \"or to any title to lands or tenements, annual rents or such like matters or things where the rights in future might be bound,\" cannot be construed to include this claim for the balance of one of the money payments which the defendant was to make to the plaintiff every year as long as certain security given by the plaintiff for the defendant remained in the hands of the government. If the amount claimed in the action had been for more than $2,000 while the judgment was recovered for less than that amount, the limitation of the appealable amount would have applied, because the matter in controversy which, as explained in Allan v. Pratt ([10]), means the matter in controversy upon the appeal, would have been only the smaller sum. Here, however, the claim is only for the balance of $1,339.66.\nThere may be actions for sums under the minimum appealable amount where the judgment will be conclusive of the right to much larger sums, as e.g., an action to recover one instalment upon an obligation to pay a large sum by small instalments, or an action by a legatee claiming the income of a fund where the present right to the income and the ultimate right to the fund itself depend on the validity of the will In such cases, when the whole amount involved in the decision exceeds $2,000 it is not to be supposed that the parties are precluded from appealing merely because the money immediately payable, and the payment of which is sought to be enforced, is under that sum. But the right to appeal in such cases arises, or rather the limitation is excluded, not because future rights are involved, but because the matter in controversy is the whole fund or the whole obligation and amounts to the sum or value of $2,000.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Archibald, Lynch & Foster.\nSolicitor for respondent : J.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nContempt of court\u2014Constructive contempt\u2014Appeal\u2014Discretion of court\u2014R.S.C. c. 135 s. 27\u2014Obstructing litigation\u2014Prejudice to suitor\u2014Locus standi.\nThe decision of a provincial court in a case of constructive contempt is not a matter of discretion in which an appeal is prohibited by sec. 27 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act. Taschereau J. dubitante.\nThe Supreme Court has jurisdiction to entertain such an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Province, not only under sec. 24, sub sec. (a) of Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act as a final judgment in an action or suit, but also under sub-sec. (1) of sec. 26 of the same act, as a final judgment \u201cin a matter or other judicial proceeding\u201d within the meaning of said sec. 26.\nThe adjudication that the appellant, a solicitor and officer of the court and moved against in that quality, has been guilty of a contempt is by itself an appealable judgment, although no sentence for the contempt has been pronounced by the court. When the party in contempt has been ordered to pay the costs of the application to commit the court in effect inflicts a fine for the contempt.\nThe alleged contempt consisted in publishing in a newspaper comments on a judgment rendered by a master in chambers in a cause in which the writer was solicitor for the defendant. The motion to commit was made by the relator in such cause. Notice of appeal from said judgment had been given but before the motion was made the notice was countermanded and the appeal abandoned. Held, that the proceedings in the cause before the master being at an end the relator in the cause could not be prejudiced, as a suitor, by the publication complained of; and as such prejudice was the only ground on which he could institute the proceedings for contempt he had no locus standi and his application should not have been entertained.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of Mr. Justice Proudfoot[2] who held the appellant guilty of contempt in publishing a certain letter in the Toronto Daily Mail.\nThese proceedings took place in the course of proceedings by quo warranto against Howland, a candidate for Mayor of Toronto, by which his qualification for the office was attacked. The matter was heard before a master and the next morning an editorial appeared in the Mail commenting on the proceedings and stating that Howland had made a bad blunder in running for Mayor without being qualified. The appellant was a strong supporter of Howland and chairman of his committee, and he caused to be published in the Mail a few days later the following letter explaining the position, which was the alleged contempt of court:\u2014\nTo the Editor of the Mail.\nSIR,\u2014The many friends of Mr. W.H. Howland must have been gratified (as doubtless he was himself) as well by your timely and heartily expressed suggestion that he should now be returned by acclamation, as by your appropriate remarks on the conduct of those who have been stirring up this litigation. There is one remark, however, which I must ask your indulgence to refer to and explain.\nYou say Mr. Howland made a bad blunder in running without a proper qualification. It was perhaps natural to assume this on the supposition that the law was correctly expounded last Tuesday. We contend it was not so, but will speak of that hereafter. Mr. Howland\u2019s advisers, however, had to take the law as they found it. How then did it stand before the election?\n1. Ever since we have had municipal institutions it has been assumed that a husband properly rated, and whose wife has the necessary property, had the right to vote and qualify in respect of that property. The generally received and acted upon opinion was that the property had under such circumstances the right to representation, and that this right was in the husband. The whole country has acted on this view, and the right has never been questioned until now. It might have been brought up at any time since the Married Woman\u2019s Act of 1859, but was not.\n2. Chief Justice Richards, probably the best authority on such matters in Canada, had held in 1871 that under such circumstances the husband had the right we contend for in the Howland case. This decision has never been over-ruled, is consistent with common sense, and with the universally accepted opinion on the subject.\nUnder these circumstances the counsel who advised Mr. Howland that his qualification was sufficient were amply justified in so doing. They did so advise Mr. Howland plainly and distinctly when asked by him. If they were wrong surely the blame should rest on them, and not on the person who had been unhesitatingly advised that he had the qualification required by law.\nYou may naturally ask: Why then was the decision the other way? This question I am unable to answer. The delivered judgment affords no answer. The arguments addressed were simply ignored, and the authority relied on by us, so far from being explained or distinguished, was not even referred to. This is eminently unsatisfactory to both the profession and the public\u2014an officer of the court over-ruling the judgment of a Chief Justice who, above all others in our land, was skilled in matters of municipal law. But the legislature on both sides of the House, on the matter being presented, at once admitted that the interpretation of Chief Justice Richards was correct and according to the original intention of the legislature, and thereupon declared that to be the case, and removed the apparent difficulty. This being the case Mr. Howland has decided not to keep matters in abeyance by asking for a stay of proceedings pending appeal, and instead of relying upon a reversal of the late judgment by a higher authority, has determined to go at once to the people, encouraged thereto partly by your own manly utterance on the subject, and by the universal expressions of sympathy and support which he has received.\nIt may be necessary as a question of costs to appeal from the recent judgment, but that does not now effect the question before the electors.\nYours, etc.,\nHENRY O\u2019BRIEN. Before the publication of this letter the legislature of Ontario, then in session, passed an act declaring the qualification claimed by Howland (one in respect to his wife\u2019s property) to be sufficient for the purpose of the election and Howland was again a candidate for the mayoralty; and the intention of this letter was alleged by O\u2019Brien, in the proceedings for contempt, to be to do away with the effect on the electors of the Mail\u2019s editorial. After the passing of this declaratory act the solicitors of Mr. Howland in the quo warranto proceedings gave notice of abandonment of the appeal which they had contemplated from the judgment of the master.\nSubsequent to the service of this notice of abandonment application was made in the quo warranto suit to the divisional court for an attachment against O\u2019Brien for contempt of court for publishing the above letter, and he was adjudged guilty of such contempt and ordered to pay the costs of the application to the informant in the suit, the order of the court stating that as no prejudice could then result to the informant from the letter no punishment would be inflicted. This decision was confirmed by the court of appeal, and from the judgment of the latter court this appeal was brought to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nBain Q.C., for the respondent, objects to the hearing of this appeal for want of jurisdiction. Ashworth v. Outram[3]; McDermott\u2019s case[4]; Jarmain v. Chatterton[5]; Rainy v. The Justices of Sierra Leone[6]. See also R.S.C. ch. 135, sec. 21.\nS.H. Blake Q.C. for the appellant. This is not the exercise of a judicial discretion unless every judgment of a court is such. Witt v. Corcoran[7]; Ashworth v. Outram3; Jarmain v. Chatterton5; Re Johnson[8]; Re Wallace[9]; Re William Arrandale[10] are cases in which the courts in England entertained appeals in matters of contempt.\nThe proceedings in the original suit being at an end the informant had no right to make this application; Metzler v. Gounod[11].\nThere was no contempt of court in the appellant\u2019s letter. Plating Co. v. Farquharson[12]; Dallas v. Ledger[13].\nThe master had no jurisdiction to hear the matter as it was connected with an election. Reg. v. Duncan[14].\nThe learned counsel referred also to Lechmere Charlton\u2019s case[15]; Lincoln Election Case[16]; Reg. v. Wilkinson[17].\nBain Q.C. for the respondent. The proceedings in the original suit could not be abandoned without the order of the court. Ex parte Turner[18].\nSee also Tichborne v. Mostyn[19]; Daw v. Eley[20].\nThe order is simply one for payment of costs for which an appeal will not lie.\nSIR W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014In January, 1886, Mr. William Henry Howland was, by a large majority of votes, elected Mayor of Toronto. On the 18th February, 1886, the respondent in the present appeal, Mr. Frederic Felitz, as relator, instituted proceedings in the nature of a quo warranto against Mr. Howland to set aside the election upon the ground of want of qualification. This quo warranto afterwards, and on the 20th of March, 1886, came on to be heard before the master in chambers who, on the 23rd of March, delivered judgment unseating Mr. Howland. On the 26th of March, 1886, the defendant gave notice of appeal against the judgment of the master to a judge in chambers. On the 29th of March the defendant served the solicitors of the relator with a notice that the notice of appeal previously served was withdrawn and that the appeal was abandoned. On the same 29th of March, 1886, the relator in the quo warranto proceeding, the present respondent, Frederic Felitz, served the appellant, Henry O\u2019Brien, Esq., who had acted as solicitor for Mr. Howland in the proceedings to set aside the election and who had also been one of his principal supporters in the contest, with a notice of motion to commit him for contempt of court. This notice of motion was as follows:\u2014\nTake notice, that by special leave granted by His Lordship the Chancellor, this court will be moved on behalf of the above named Frederic Felitz on Thursday the 1st day of April, 1886, at the hour of eleven o\u2019clock in the forenoon, or so soon thereafter as counsel can be heard, for an order to commit Henry O\u2019Brien, of the City of Toronto, Esq., solicitor for the above named William H. Howland in this cause, to the common gaol of the county in which he may be found, on the ground that the said Henry O\u2019Brien while such solicitor and while the proceedings in this cause are still pending has been guilty of contempt of this court and for his said contempt of court in writing and publishing and procuring to be published in the issue of the Toronto Daily Mail of Saturday the 27th March, 1886, a letter addressed to the editor of the Mail, with the heading \u201cThe Mayor\u2019s position explained\u201d and signed \u201cHenry O\u2019Brien\u201d.\nAnd that all necessary attachments may be issued for that purpose and for an order that the said Henry O\u2019Brien do pay the costs of this application, or for such other order as to the said court may seem just.\nAnd take notice that on such application will be read the affidavits of Frederic Felitz and Christopher William Bunting this day filed, and exhibits therein referred to, together with papers and proceedings taken herein.\nDated this 29th day of March, 1886.\nYours, &c.\nBAIN, LAIDLAW & Co.\nSolicitors for relator.\nTo Henry O\u2019Brien,\nBarrister, Toronto, and to Messrs. Robinson & O\u2019Brien, Solicitors for W.H. Howland.\nThe notice of countermand of the notice of appeal was accompanied by a letter written and addressed by Messrs. Robinson & O\u2019Brien, the solicitors for Mr. Howland, to the respondent\u2019s solicitors, which was as follows:\u2014\n68 Church Street, Toronto, March 29th, 1886.\nMessrs. BAIN & LAIDLAW, Toronto.\nDEAR SIRS,\u2014We have served on you a notice of abandonment of the motion for appeal from Mr. Dalton\u2019s judgment herein. It was only given as a matter of form to preserve the right of appeal (if any) as the counsel who were advising in this matter were out of town; but as Mr. Howland has decided (as already publicly announced) his intention not to appeal, but to go again before the electors, and as the question of costs is unimportant, the appeal is now formally abandoned, as the thought of appealing was in effect abandoned when Mr. Howland made his announcement that he would run again.\nYours truly,\nROBINSON & O\u2019BRIEN.\nThe 15th paragraph of the affidavit filed by the appellant in answer to the notice to commit was in the following words:\u2014\n15. That the notice of motion to commit me in this matter was not served until after I had written the letter now shown to me marked with the letter \u201cD\u201d and the notice of abandonment now shown to me and marked with the letter \u201cC\u201d and after such notice had been actually delivered to the solicitors for the applicant in this matter.\nThe letter \u201cD\u201d here referred to was the letter before set out.\nThis statement contained in the 15th paragraph of the affidavit is not in any way contradicted. It appears from the affidavits filed by the appellant that the publication complained of as a contempt was induced by, and was written and published for, the purpose of explaining an editorial paragraph which appeared in the Mail newspaper of the 24th March. This paragraph was as follows:\u2014\nTHE MAYORALTY.\nIt is eminently proper that the occupant of the mayor\u2019s chair should be duly qualified according to the requirements of the act; and without doubt Mr. Howland has made a bad blunder in running for the position last January without having the necessary qualifications. Nevertheless there is reason to fear that the suit which terminated yesterday in his being unseated was brought and carried on more for the purpose of tormenting him and putting him to expense than of vindicating the law. What course Mr. Howland intends to pursue we do not know, but there should be no trouble in securing his re-election by acclamation. It is due to him and to the people who chose him for the chief magistracy that no obstacle should be placed in the way of his return.\nThe letter complained of as being a contempt was, as Mr. O\u2019Brien swears, written on the 26th of March, before the notice of appeal was served, and was published in the Mail newspaper on the 27th of March. It is set forth in extenso in the order made on the motion to commit and is in the following words:\u2014\nTo the Editor of the Mail.\nSIR,\u2014The many friends of Mr. W.H. Howland must have been gratified (as doubtless he was himself) as well by your timely and heartily expressed suggestion that he should now be returned by acclamation, as by your appropriate remarks on the conduct of those who have been stirring up this litigation. There is one remark, however, which I must ask your indulgence to refer to and explain.\nYou say Mr. Howland made a bad blunder in running without a proper qualification. It was perhaps natural to assume this on the supposition that the law was correctly expounded last Tuesday. We contend it was not so, but will speak of that hereafter. Mr. Howland\u2019s advisers, however, had to take the law as they found it. How then did it stand before the election?\n1.

The whole country has acted on this view, and the right has never been questioned until now. It might have brought up at any time since the Married Woman\u2019s Act of 1859 but was not.\n2.

The motion to commit came on to be heard before Mr. Justice Proudfoot on the 13th of April, 1886, and on the 28th of April the learned judge pronounced judgment adjudging the publication of the letter complained of to be a contempt and ordering the appellant to pay the costs of the application. The formal order drawn up was as follows:\u2014\nThis court finds that the writing and publishing of the letter aforesaid by the said Henry O\u2019Brien was, under the circumstances under which it was written and published, a contempt of this court. But this court having regard to the circumstances appearing in the affidavits, and being of opinion that no prejudice can now result to the relator from the publication of the said letter, doth not see fit to make any order save that the said Henry O\u2019Brien do forthwith pay to the said relator his costs of this application to be taxed.\nFrom this order Mr. O\u2019Brien appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. This court (which was constituted of four judges, viz: the Chief Justice of Ontario and Burton, Patterson and Ferguson JJ.) by a majority of three judges to one affirmed the order of Mr. Justice Proudfoot and dismissed the appeal, the dissenting judge being Mr. Justice Burton. Mr. O\u2019Brien then appealed to this court.\nThe first question we have to decide is that raised by the respondent as to the jurisdiction of this court to entertain the appeal. This objection presents no difficulty in view of the decisions upon the question of jurisdiction which have already been pronounced here. I am clearly of opinion that we have jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, not only under section 24 subsection (a) of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act (R.S.C. cap. 135) but also under sub\u2011section (1) of section 26 of the same act. The Court of Appeal is the highest court of final resort in the Province of Ontario, and the judgment appealed from is a final judgment according to decisions which the court is bound to follow. Further, if it is not a final judgment in \u201can action or suit\u201d it is nevertheless a final judgment \u201cin a matter or other judicial proceeding\u201d within the meaning which decided cases have attached to those words as used in section 26 sub-section (1).\nI refer to the following authorities as conclusive against the objection, viz., Wallace v. Bossom[21]: Wilkins v. Geddes[22]; Lenoir v. Ritchie[23]; Chevalier v. Cuvillier[24]; Shields v. Peak[25]: Shaw v. St. Louis[26]; McKinnon v. Kerouack[27]; Whiting v. Hovey[28].\nThat the order in question contains an adjudication that the appellant had been guilty of contempt although the word \u201cadjudged\u201d is not used is, I think, too clear to require any observation. The expression \u201cthe court finds\u201d is amply sufficient to meet all the requirements as to an adjudication pointed out as regularly essential by Lord Lyndhurst, Chancellor, in Ex parte Sandau[29]; and I find the equivalent, or perhaps the less distinct, expression of an adjudication \u201cthis court is of opinion\u201d in common use in the precedents given in Seton.\nThen, it is said that this is merely an appeal on a question of costs. This objection also appears to be wholly untenable. The proceeding to commit for contempt is of a penal and quasi-criminal character. The order complained of contains, in the first place, a distinct adjudication that the appellant has been guilty of a contempt of court, and it then proceeds (waiving other punishment) to inflict what is in substance, if not in form, a penalty or punishment by ordering the appellant to pay the costs. The adjudication that the appellant, a solicitor and officer of the court and moved against in that quality, has been guilty of a contempt is, by itself, an appealable judgment and would have been so even if it had not (as in fact, however it has) been followed by sentence. As Mr. Blake forcibly urged the order under appeal affixes to the appellant, as a professional man, a stigma from which he is entitled to be relieved if he has been found guilty upon insufficient evidence or for insufficient reasons.\nAgain, by ordering him to pay costs as a consequence of this conviction the court inflicts upon the appellant a punishment which, if not so in name and form is yet in substance and effect, a fine for his contempt. There can be no analogy between an appeal from such an order as this and one from a decree or order in an ordinary case relating to property or private rights which is confined to an adjudication as to costs to be paid by one party to the other.\nThe authorities to this effect are clear and entirely support what is said on this head in the judgment of Mr. Justice Burton in the court below.\nHaving thus disposed of the preliminary objections which were raised at the hearing of the appeal we may now proceed to consider the case upon its merits.\nContempts of a court of justice being a court of record, other than those committed in its presence (sedente curi\u00e2), have received the name of constructive contempts and may be classed under two entirely distinct and very different heads. In the first place it is held to be a contempt to interfere with the due course of justice by publishing comments or criticisms on pending litigation which may have the effect of influencing the minds of those who will be called upon to decide either upon the facts or the law, jurors or judges, and thus cause prejudice to either of the suitors whose rights are in controversy. Such contempts are, when pro- ceedings are taken to punish them and restrain their repetition, always in practice brought under the notice of the court by the litigant who considers himself aggrieved by the publication or comment, and the order made usually extends to prohibit a repetition of the offences as well as to punish for the past contempt. In cases of this kind, provided the litigation is still pending, the suitor complaining is considered as having a Locus standi to institute the proceedings and is recognized by the courts, at least in cases of private litigation, as the proper person to prosecute the proceedings for the contempt. As Mr. Justice Burton has pointed out in his very clear and able judgment, it was a contempt of this class which was complained of by the respondent. The notice of motion indicates this very plainly. The motion of which notice was given was for the committal of the appellant on the ground that he, while solicitor for Mr. Howland and while the proceedings in the cause were still pending, had been guilty of contempt in writing and publishing and procuring to be published in the \u201cToronto Daily Mail\u201d of Saturday the 27th day of March, 1886, a letter addressed to the editor of the Mail.\nIt is plain, therefore, that what the respondent complained of was not the contents of the letter per se, but the publication of it \u201cwhile the proceedings in the cause were still pending\u201d. This, if the respondent brought himself within the proper conditions, was a matter which he had a sufficient locus standi to complain of. There is, however, nothing in the notice of motion from which it is to be inferred that the motion which the respondent proposed to make was not as a party interested and on his own behalf but merely as a champion of public justice, and by way of asserting the dignity of the court by calling for the punishment of a person who had been guilty of contempt in publishing a libel on one of its officers, a matter in which the respondent had no greater interest than any other of Her Majesty\u2019s subjects. As I shall show hereafter the respondent had no qualification entitling him to constitute himself the prosecutor of a contempt of this latter kind.\nThen regarded as a contempt of the first class before defined, that is as one calculated to prejudice the interest of the respondent in litigation in which he was then engaged and which was actually in progress, our first inquiry must be: Was the respondent at the time he served the notice of motion and made the motion to commit in a position which entitled him to the recognition of the court for such a purpose? Before considering this it is important to recall certain dates already mentioned. The master\u2019s judgment unseating the mayor was pronounced on the 23rd of March, and the letter which is the subject of complaint was written on the 27th of the same month. Now it is obvious that if no step in the cause had been taken between these two dates, the 23rd and 27th, there would have been no litigation pending which could have been prejudiced by the letter to the newspaper, and consequently the respondent would not have been in a position to complain of that communication as a contempt of court. The master\u2019s judgment was final and conclusive unless appealed against within the time limited by statute. If no notice of appeal had been given the case would, on the 29th of March when notice of motion was served, have stood in exactly the same position as an ordinary action at law which had been tried by a jury, and in which the time for moving against the verdict had not expired. On the 26th of March, however, notice of appeal was served. The appellant in the affidavit which he filed in answer to the motion to commit states the reason for serving this notice of appeal to have been that the counsel by whom he was advised was absent from Toronto, and being in doubt what to do he gave the notice of appeal, on the last day for so doing, as a matter of precaution and with the intention of abandoning the appeal if it should appear in consultation with counsel that Mr. Howland was qualified to be a candidate under the new act passed by the legislature subsequent to the judgment. All this, however, appears to be quite immaterial. We have the indisputable fact that from the 26th until the morning of the 29th March an appeal was pending. On the 29th, however, and before the notice of motion to commit the appellant was served, a notice countermanding the notice of appeal, and distinctly abandoning it, was delivered to the respondent\u2019s solicitors accompanied by the letter from Mr. O\u2019Brien before set out, and which also states that the appeal was abandoned and further gives the reason I have already mentioned as that which had induced the appellant to serve the notice of appeal. It is to be especially observed that this notice and letter were actually served and delivered before the contempt proceedings were initiated by the serving of the notice of motion to commit. The effect of this abandonment of the appeal was, of course, not merely to restore the proceedings to the state they were in prior to the notice of appeal being served, but to preclude all right to appeal and to make the master\u2019s judgment from that time absolutely conclusive, and thus finally to terminate the litigation. The case is, therefore, stronger than that of a party, who had obtained a verdict the time for moving against which had not expired, complaining of a publication calculated to interfere with his rights. In the latter case the proceedings might be said to be, in a sense, still pending though dormant for the time, since it would be still within the power of the party against whom the verdict had been found to move for a new trial, but here after the notice waiving the appeal the proceedings were finally closed and disposed of in favor of the respondent.\nThe case of Dallas v. Ledger, which I have not seen reported anywhere but in the Times Law Reports for the 27th of March, 1888, appears to have been a much stronger case than this, a rule for a new trial having been actually pending, but it was there held by a Divisional Court composed of Mr. Justice Stephen and Mr. Justice Field that an article published by the defendant criticising the verdict and the conduct of the jury generally, in very strong and uncourteous language, was not such an interference with the course of justice as warranted the court in granting a rule nisi calling upon the defendant to answer as for a contempt. The learned judges who decided that case must have thought that the article would have been wholly innocuous as regarded the application for a new trial and, indeed, Mr. Justice Stephen points out that it was only material in the contingent event of a new trial being granted, and the case being brought before another jury. In the present case, if the appeal had gone on it is impossible to suppose that this article, having no reference to facts or evidence but to a dry question of law, could have had the slightest influence on the judge in chambers before whom it might have come on appeal. Moreover, when the notice of motion was served all proceedings by way of appeal had been abandoned so that, as I hold, agreeing in that respect entirely with Mr. Justice Burton in the Court of Appeal, the respondent had no locus standi entitling him to make the motion which he did treating the letter as a contempt as having a tendency to exercise an undue influence over the regular course of justice, inasmuch as all proceedings had reached a final termination. Agreeing again with Mr. Justice Burton I do not think we are called upon to consider whether this letter was a contempt included in another class of such offences against the administration of justice, namely, as containing injurious reflections upon a judicial officer of the court. The respondent has, manifestly, not based his motion on any such ground, and even if he had the matter was one with which he was not concerned if I am right in holding that the proceedings in the quo warranto case had terminated, but it was for the court on the publication being brought to its notice, if it considered the letter a contempt, to have interfered ex officio and to have itself instituted proceedings calling the appellant to account for his contumacious conduct. Further, I may add that although I admit the letter might have been more courteously worded I, at present, fail to see that it exceeded the bounds of that fair criticism upon the public administration of justice which every one is entitled to write and publish. That the writer was inaccurate in his law, as he manifestly was, for it is beyond doubt that the decision of the learned master was perfectly correct, can make no difference provided his remarks were made in good faith, and that they were so made appears, I think, from the fact that the letter complained of was not a spontaneous communication to the \u201cMail\u201d by Mr. O\u2019Brien but was an answer to, and was elicited by, certain editorial comments on the mayoralty case contained in a preceding number of the same newspaper. The observations which are said to constitute a contempt have reference, not to facts but exclusively to questions of law. The letter certainly does allege that the learned master had pronounced an erroneous decision, but it does not contain any imputation that such alleged error proceeded from any improper motive. The most that can be said against Mr. O\u2019Brien is that in this letter he erroneously stated that Chief Justice Richards had decided the same point of law in a different way from that in which the master had determined it in the mayor\u2019s case and, further, that the master\u2019s decision was wrong in law. Although I altogether differ from Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s views of the law I cannot say that in publishing these criticisms under the circumstances stated in his affidavit he was guilty of any contempt of court.\nI am of opinion that the appeal must be allowed with costs to the appellant in all the courts.\nFOURNIER J. was also of opinion that the appeal should be allowed for the reasons given by Gwynne J.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am not prepared to assent to, or dissent from, the judgment about to be entered. I was doubtful as to our jurisdiction and as to the right of appeal under the Supreme Court Act and more especially under section 27 thereof. I will not, however, unnecessarily delay the judgment. I hope that Parliament will interfere and protect the dignity of the provincial courts by making their decisions in matters of contempt final.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In McDermott v. The Judges of British Guiana[30], there was no question as to whether or not the publication complained of constituted a contempt of court, and all that the judicial committee there say is:\u2014\nNot a single case is to be found where there has been a committal by one of the colonial courts for contempt, where it appeared clearly upon the face of the order that the party had committed a contempt, that he had been duly summoned, and that the punishment awarded for the contempt was an appropriate one, in which this committee has ever entertained an appeal against an order of this description.\nBut this practice of the judicial committee of the Privy Council, however invariable it be, has no bearing upon the question before us, which is whether or not an appeal lies by law to this court in the present case, a question which must be determined by the statute constituting the court. It may be admitted that an order convicting a party of contempt of court committed in facie curi\u0153 may be so drawn as to leave nothing which could be open upon an appeal, and so to exclude an appeal, but in the present case the publication complained of as a contempt of court is set out at large in the order that is appealed from, and a question is raised as to the proper construction to be put upon that publication and whether under the circumstances appearing in the case that publication can in point of law be held to have been a contempt of court.\nNow, that an appeal lies in the present case in virtue of the express provisions of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, ch. 135 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, there can be no doubt unless it is excluded by the 27th section of that act which enacts that:\u2014\nNo appeal shall lie from any order made in any action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding made in the exercise of the judicial discretion of the court or judge making the same.\nThe contention that an order of a court pronouncing a publication to contain matter which constitutes it a contempt of court, and adjudging the party convicted of such contempt to pay costs to the suitor who made the application to commit the party for such contempt, is an order so made in the exercise of the judicial discretion of the court as to take from the party against whom it is made all right to appeal from it cannot, in my opinion, be for a moment entertained. Whether matter published out of court constitutes a contempt of court may involve a question whether it constitutes a defamatory libel upon a judge or other officer of the court, or a question whether it can properly be construed to interfere with the due administration of justice in some pending proceeding, or to be calculated to influence the result of the pending proceedings which questions of law and fact must need be determined before the accused could be convicted of the offence of contempt of court. Now, whether matter published out of court be or be not a libel upon the court or upon some judge or other officer thereof, or whether it could or not interfere with the due administration of justice in any particular pending proceeding, can never be said to rest in the unquestionable discretion of the court before which a motion for an order to commit is made and to be free from all appeal to a higher tribunal calling in question the correctness of the decision of the court upon its construction and view of the matter published. That the matter published in the present case did not, under the circumstances appearing in the case, justify an adjudication that it constituted a contempt of court was, and still is, the point in issue, and that is an issue which, for its determination, called for a judgment, not rendered in the exercise of an arbitrary discretion of the court to which the question of law was submitted, but rendered in accordance with the principles of law and justice equally as any other point of law in any action, suit or judicial proceeding is submitted, and so equally subject to revision on appeal. The 27th section of the act relates, in my opinion, to matters which the court or a judge may at its or his pleasure decide indifferently one way or the other and not to a matter submitted to judicial enquiry and adjudication as the principles of law and a proper construction of the facts involved in the case require. In Daw v. Eley[31] a motion was made to commit a solicitor, as in the present case, for contempt of court in writing for publication letters tending to influence the result of the suit fox one of the parties to which he was solicitor, and Lord Romilly, Master of the Rolls, before whom the motion was made, while adjudicating that the solicitor was guilty of contempt of court in writing the letters, directed that the order should not be enforced for a fortnight for the express purpose of enabling the solicitor to appeal. In Witt v. Corcoran[32], an order declaring that defendant had committed a breach of an \u201cinjunction,\u201d but giving no directions except that the defendant should pay the costs of an application to commit him, was appealed against, and it was contended for the plaintiff that no appeal lay for that the order was merely for the payment of costs and that the act under which proceedings were taken provided that there should be no appeal for costs where they are in the discretion of the court, but Lord Justice James giving judgment that an appeal lay, says:\u2014\nThere is no discretion as to whether a man has or has not been guilty of something alleged against him. The defendant says he has been guilty of nothing, and if the court had been of that opinion it could not have ordered him to pay the costs any more than it could dismiss a bill and order the defendant to pay the costs of the suit. The court has made an adjudication and as a consequence of that adjudication has ordered the defendant to pay the costs. If the court had thought that no contempt had been committed it could not have ordered the defendant to pay the costs. The defendant must have a right to appeal against the adjudication.\nIn Jarmain v. Chatterton[33] an appeal was taken from an order refusing to commit a party for an alleged contempt of court and directing the applicant for the order of commitment to pay the costs of the application, and it was contended upon the authority of Ashworth v. Outram[34] that an application to commit for contempt is a matter in the discretion of the judge and that no appeal lay from his refusal to commit, but the Master of the Rolls giving judgment, said:\nIt is clear that Lord Justice James never intended in Ashworth v. Outram to lay down a new rule, and that his words must mean that in the circumstances of that case there was no appeal. The case of Ashworth v. Outram is not in our way here where a question of right is discussed\u2014where the defendants are asserting that the plaintiffs have no right to what they claim.\nAnd Lord Justice Brett, in the same case, explains Ashworth v. Outram:\nAs being a case in which there was no dispute as to the meaning of the order said to have been disobeyed\u2014no dispute as to whether it had been disobeyed or not\u2014but the Vice Chancellor in the circumstances of the case came to the conclusion that he should exercise his discretion indulgently, that is, he merely made the costs of the motion costs in the cause, and there was no appeal as to his construction of the agreement, the appeal was confined to the mode of enforcing an order, and was simply from the discretion of the court; and the court of appeal said that when an appeal is simply on this ground although the court has jurisdiction on so delicate a matter it will not exercise it; here the meaning of the order is in dispute, and a considerable question arises whether the Vice Chancellor did not interpret the order in a different way from that in which this court has construed it.\nSo in the case now before us the questions were and are as to the proper construction of the letter which is charged to have been a contempt of court; and whether under the circumstances appearing in the case the order of the court below adjudging its publication to have been a contempt of court, and ordering the solicitor of the defendant in the quo warranto proceeding to pay to the relator in that proceeding the cost of his application to commit was a proper order to have been made, and these are questions that, in my opinion, are proper questions to be submitted to this court by way of appeal from such order.\nIt is impossible I think to read the case as it is reported in 11th O.R. 633, under the title Regina ex relatione Felitz v. Howland in re O\u2019Brien, without perceiving that the application to commit O\u2019Brien the solicitor of the defendant Howland for contempt of court in writing and causing to be published the letter in question was made by the relator in the quo warranto proceeding instituted by him against the defendant Howland as a matter of right claimed to be vested in him as a suitor in that proceeding, and on the ground that the publication of the letter was, as was contended on his behalf, calculated to prejudice his case, and to interfere with the due administration of justice in the determination of and the adjudication in that proceeding, and that it was so entertained by the divisional court in which the application was made. The contention upon behalf of the relator was that although judgment had been rendered by the master in chambers in the quo warranto proceeding which was a final determination of the matter unless appealed from, yet that a notice of appeal from that judgment had been served upon the relator and that after such notice had been served the letter complained of was published and that, therefore, the quo warranto proceeding was still pending so as to leave vested in the relator a right to complain that the publication of the letter was calculated to prejudice his case and to interfere with the due administration of justice therein. The judgment of the master in chambers which adjudged that Mr. Howland, the defendant in the quo warranto proceeding, had not a legal qualification to warrant his being elected mayor of the City of Toronto was rendered on the 23rd March, 1886. On the 26th of March Mr. O\u2019Brien, as solicitor of the defendant, gave a notice of appeal from that judgment. On the 27th March the letter complained of appeared in the Mail, a newspaper published in the city of Toronto. On the 29th of March notice of the abandonment of the appeal was served upon the relator\u2019s solicitor, and upon the same day but after the service of such notice the motion to commit was made. All these facts appeared in an affidavit made by Mr. O\u2019Brien in answer to the motion, in which affidavit he also stated that the letter complained of was written by way of answer to an article which appeared in the Mail newspaper on the 24th March, which was annexed to his affidavit, and he said that by reason of a statement in that article to the effect that Mr. Howland had made a bad blunder in running for mayor without a qualification, serious injury, as he was informed, was done to Mr. Howland\u2019s reputation as a public man and that he, Mr. O\u2019Brien, held it to be his duty, being familiar with the matter, to explain his, Mr. Howland\u2019s, position, and he added that his sole object in writing the letter and the only thought in his mind was a desire to correct a misapprehension which had been raised in the public mind by the said article and by certain other statements of a like nature which were apparently intended to try and prevent Mr. Howland from again becoming a candidate as mayor of the city. He further stated in his said affidavit, that upon the 25th of March, after discussion among Mr. Howland\u2019s supporters, it was finally decided not to appeal from the judgment, and that instructions to that effect were given to him, and that an announcement of such decision was published in the newspapers that evening and the next morning, and he stated further to the effect that the notice of appeal served by him on the 26th March was given by him merely as a precautionary measure, as the 26th was the last day upon which such notice could be served, and to keep the matter open until the decision of Mr. Howland and his supporters could be (communicated to Mr. Howland\u2019s counsel who was then absent from Toronto. He stated further that he wrote the letter complained of on the morning of the 26th March before the notice of appeal was served, and that as it was only written for the purpose and under the circumstances aforesaid, namely, to answer the article published on the 24th March, it did not occur to him to withdraw it in view of any possible contention that the quo warranto proceedings could be said to be still pending, and further that when he wrote the letter he believed that his professional connection with the proceedings was in fact at an end, and that he wrote the letter simply as a citizen in the interests of the candidate he had supported at the last election, and intended to support again, and he added that as a matter of fact at such time no proceedings were pending in said quo warranto matter. The letter as published contained the following paragraph at the conclusion of an argument wherein he stated his reasons for thinking the judgment which had been rendered to be wrong in point of law:\u2014\nThis being the case Mr. Howland has decided not to keep matters in abeyance by asking for a stay of proceedings pending appeal, and instead of reversing the late judgment by a higher authority has determined to go at once to the people, encouraged thereto partly by your own manly utterances on the subject, and by the universal expressions of sympathy and support which he has received. It may be necessary as a question of costs to appeal from the recent judgment, but that does not now affect the question before the electors.\nThe letter he subscribed with his own signature in disavowal of any intention of treating with disrespect the master in chambers who had rendered the judg- ment which the letter commented on. Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s affidavit concluded as follows:\u2014\nWhile I am unable to conclude that in writing the said letter I offended against any rule of this honorable court, or any rule of professional etiquette, or was guilty of disrespect to the learned master, if it should be thought I, in any way, offended in these respects or if there are (unintended by me) any expressions which could in any way indicate that I thought the learned master had not acted with impartiality, I must unfeignedly say that I deeply regret them and desire to withdraw the said letter so far as the same are concerned.\nNow the relator\u2019s counsel in supporting his motion insisted that the relator was not deprived of his right to make the motion and to press it by reason of notice of abandonment of the appeal having been served before the motion was made, for that the relator\u2019s position was to be considered as at the time the letter was published, and that he was entitled to insist upon his rights as they were then, and he contended that the tendency of the publication was to interfere with and to obstruct the due administration of justice in his quo warranto proceeding which by reason of the notice of appeal he contended was still pending at the time of the publication of the letter although it had ceased to be so when the motion was first made. In support of this contention he relied upon Skipworth\u2019s Case[35]; Tichborne v. Mostyn[36]; and Daw v. Eley[37] from which latter case he quoted the following passages as appears by the report of the case[38].\nThe principle is quite established in all these cases that no person must do anything with a view to pervert the sources of justice, or the proper flow of justice; in fact they ought not to make any publications or to write anything which would induce the court, or which might possibly induce the court or the jury, the tribunal that will have to try the matter to come to any conclusion other than that which is to be derived from the evidence in the cause between parties * * * [39] Gentlemen who are concerned for contending clients in this court, whether solicitor or counsel, should abstain entirely from the merits of these questions in public print.\nThe context in immediate connection with the last quotation is\nIf they do it at all they ought to put their names to their communications; but to let the public suppose that it is merely done by a person who takes a great interest in, and has great knowledge of the subject and discusses it from a public point of view, when, if the fact were known, he is the solicitor of the defendant and has the strongest possible interest in his success is, in my opinion, highly reprehensible.\nNow all the above cases so relied upon were cases of flagrant attempts to taint and obstruct the due course of the flow of justice by scandalous vituperation of a judge before whom a case was shortly to be tried with a view to endeavoring to prevent his trying the case, and by interested representations of facts in such a manner as to endeavor to obtain a result of legal proceedings not yet tried different from that which should be derived from the evidence in the cause and different from what would follow in the ordinary course. It cannot therefore, I think, admit of a doubt that the motion was made simply in assertion of a legal right vested in the relator in the quo warranto proceeding to make it upon the ground that, as he contended, the publication complained of was calculated, and had an evident tendency, to affect the result of the quo warranto proceedings to the prejudice of the relator and thereby to obstruct and interfere with the due administration of justice in that proceeding; and that it was upon this ground that the motion was entertained and adjudicated on by the court appears, I think, from the terms of the order which was made upon the motion which, after stating that the motion was made by the relator, and setting out the letter at length, concludes as follows: The court finds that the writing and publishing of the letter aforesaid by the said Henry O\u2019Brien was, under the circumstances under which it was written, and published, a contempt of court; but this court having regard to the circumstances appearing in the affidavits and being of opinion that no prejudice can now result to the relator from the publication of the said letter doth not see fit to make any order save that the said Henry O\u2019Brien do forthwith pay to the said relator his costs of this application to be taxed.\nThe reason for the court arriving at the opinion which is stated in the order\u2014that \u201cno prejudice can now result to the relator\u201d is shown to have been the abandonment of the appeal; so that it appears, I think, to be clear, not only that the motion was made, but that it was entertained and adjudicated upon by the court, as one which the relator as a suitor in a cause pending in court had a vested right in law to make, because of the prejudice to his suit by reason of the tendency which the publication of the letter had to obstruct the due administration of justice in the quo warranto proceeding instituted by him, and that it was because of the tendency so to prejudice the relator in the result of that proceeding that the court pronounced the publication to have been a contempt of court, and ordered Mr. O\u2019Brien to pay to the relator the costs of his application. We may therefore, I think, confine ourselves to the consideration of the question whether the publication of the letter can properly be said to have had a tendency to obstruct the flow of justice and to interfere with its due administration to the prejudice of the result of the quo warranto proceeding instituted by the relator, and we are, as it appears to me, relieved from determining whether or not there is anything in the manner in which the judgment of the master in chambers is commented upon in the letter which can be said so to transgress the bounds of fair criticism as to justify the letter being adjudged to have been for that reason a contempt of court, for a judgment of a court of justice is open to fair comment and criticism which may call in question its soundness in point of law even though it be still open to revision upon appeal. This much, however, may, I think, be said of the letter, that whether the reasoning upon which the soundness of the learned master\u2019s judgment was impugned be sound or otherwise, and whether the authorities and references by which the writer essayed to support his argument when properly understood gave weight to his argument or had the contrary effect, the whole tenor of the letter nevertheless appeared upon its face to be, as it was intended to be, an argument calling in question a judgment delivered upon purely legal grounds, and that if a motion to commit the writer of the letter as guilty of contempt of court upon any public grounds, as that the letter contained a very calumnious vituperation or a personal attack upon the integrity of the judge, or as having a tendency to bring him or his judgments into contempt with the public, there could not have been found, I think, in modern times at least, any precedent for entertaining such an application upon such grounds upon like materials; and certainly none of the authorities which were relied upon by the relator in the present case would have had any application in such a case.\nUpon the question, then, as to the prejudice to the relator in the quo warranto proceeding instituted by him all the authorities are to the same effect, namely, that any publication, the object of which is, or the evident tendency of which is, though not intended, to bend and pervert the source of justice, or to disturb its free course, as to induce the tribunal having to try a matter in litigation to come to any decision other than that which is to be derived from the evidence in the cause between the parties, is a contempt of court which any suitor whose suit may be prejudiced by such publication has an undoubted legal right to bring under the notice of the court and to demand its adjudication thereon.\nThe matter which in Tichborne v. Mostyn and Tichborne v. Tichborne[40] was pronounced to be a contempt of court was an article in a newspaper pronouncing certain affidavits sworn by several persons upon behalf of the claimant in a cause pending in court, but which had not yet been laid before the court, to be in some particulars false, absurd, and worthless, and upon the strength of facts alleged within the knowledge of the writer commenting upon the plaintiff\u2019s case unfavorably, and that so freely that the solicitor of the plaintiff filed an affidavit in support of the motion, stating his belief that the article was likely to create a prejudice against the plaintiff and to prevent witnesses from making affidavits. The court then came to the conclusion that the comments in the article had a clear and distinct tendency to direct and sway the mind of the court and jury by whom the case was to be determined. Onslow\u2019s and Whalley\u2019s Case[41] was a case of a most open undisguised attempt to interfere with the result of a trial about to take place by prejudicing the minds of the public, from whom the jurors should have to come, by most inflammatory addresses at public meetings, charging several persons alleged to be related to the claimant in that suit of Tichborne v. Tichborne,42 who was about to be put upon his trial for perjury committed by him in the suit, with having entered into a conspiracy to deprive him of his legal rights, well knowing him to be the person he represented himself to be and, as such, heir to the Tichborne estates, and endeavoring to influence the public mind in favor of the claimant upon his said approaching trial. While in Skipworth\u2019s Case[42] there was added to the above a scandalous vituperation of the Chief Justice, with a view to trying to prevent his presiding at the approaching trial, accusing him of having already prejudged the case, and an attack upon the witnesses with a view to prejudicing the trial.\nIn Lechmere Charlton\u2019s case[43] the contempt of court consisted in a barrister writing and sending to a master in chancery a letter which contained threats to induce him, in the absence of the opposite party to a matter in litigation before him, to alter the decision at which he was supposed to have arrived and to come to a conclusion favorable to the case advocated by the writer of the letter. In Littler v. Thompson[44] the publication complained of was an article in a newspaper which alleged that certain affidavits made in support of a motion by the plaintiff for an injunction contained glaring misrepresentations which the writer of the article declared that he believed and hoped would lead to an indictment for perjury. The article also reflected severely upon the conduct of the plaintiff and characterized the chancery proceedings instituted by him as vexatious and unprincipled. Lord Langdale, Master of the Rolls, held that the effect of the publication seemed to be not only to deter persons from coming forward to give evidence on one side, but to induce witnesses to give evidence on the other side alone. In Daw v. Eley[45] the publication complained of entered into a free discussion as to the merits of an invention the novelty and utility of which were the subject of litigation, and the writer spoke with great apparent authority upon the subject, professing to be familiar with all the facts bearing upon the case and to treat the subject as if he was a per- fectly independent stranger, whereas he was in truth the solicitor of one of the litigating parties whose position the article sustained. Lord Romilly, Master of the Rolls, giving judgment in this case says:\u2014\nIn this case the main question to be tried is the novelty of the plaintiff\u2019s invention.\nThen after quoting largely from the article he adds:\nCan any body doubt that if I were persuaded that the whole of the statements in that letter were true, it would very seriously affect my opinion as to the solidity and originality of Mr. Daw\u2019s patent? Then it is to be observed that this is written not by a mere stranger, who might say that he really knew nothing about the cause, but it is written by the solicitor of the gentleman who is opposed to Mr. Daw in this suit; surely that is a very strong feature in the case. He must wish that his client should succeed, and I venture to say that there is no solicitor who would not in the same position feel the same thing, and it is impossible that a solicitor can safely act in a matter of this description in writing an article in a paper which if believed must have a beneficial effect upon his client, and afterwards say: \u201cI had no intention of that sort at all however much I may wish for it.\u201d It must be regarded as an endeavor to interfere with the due administration of justice.\nThis is the case which was mainly relied upon by the relator in support of his motion, yet a case more different from the present it would be difficult to conceive. In all the cases care is taken to point out how the publication complained of in each was calculated to affect the result of a pending suit. Here nothing has been suggested having such a tendency.\nThere never was any fact whatever in issue. The sole question was one of law, namely whether the property of the defendant\u2019s wife upon which the defendant had qualified as mayor of the city of Toronto was a good qualification in point of law. The master in chambers rendered judgment that it was not. The matter never could be brought again before him. The point of law which was in litigation was finally determined by his judgment unless it should be reversed upon appeal, so that Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s letter, which stated his reasons for thinking the qualification to be good, and the master\u2019s judgment to be erroneous, could in no conceivable manner prejudice the relator\u2019s case unless the matter of the letter could be construed to have a tendency to interfere with the due administration of justice in a court of appeal in the event of the master\u2019s judgment being brought before such a court by appeal; a suggestion that it could have such a tendency as offering by implication a grave insult to that court would seem to partake of a contempt of court more than any thing in the letter complained of, which, as a legal argument, appears to have been, in the opinion of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, exceedingly weak, defective and inconclusive, but whether the argument be weak or strong, the suggestion that this argument, stamped as it was with the infirmity that it expressed merely the legal opinion of the solicitor of the party against whose contention the judgment had been rendered, might have a tendency to taint, obstruct or interfere with the due administration of justice in the court of appeal in the event of the matter being brought before that court is a preposterous proposition for which there is no foundation, and in my opinion it cannot be and should not have been entertained. That it could have no such tendency after abandonment of the appeal of which notice had been served is admitted on the face of the order which is the subject of the present appeal; but if for that reason the letter was innocuous when judgment was given upon the application to commit, it was equally innocuous when the motion was made, for the notice of abandonment had then already been served so that the relator was then deprived of the ground upon which alone he invoked and persistently pressed for the interference of the court, and so the language of the Court of Appeal in England in Plating Co. v. Farquharson[46] becomes most appropriate in the determination of the present case. Lord Justice Cotton there says, with the full concurrence of the Master of the Rolls:\u2014\nWhere there is no case for a committal the party moving ought to have no costs to his motion.\nAnd Lord Justice James says:\nThat in such cases he would not only not give the party moving his costs, but should be inclined to make him pay costs.\nThese motions he thought to be a contempt of court in themselves, because they tend to waste the public time.\nNow when the relator made the motion in the present case which he subsequently insisted upon, he well knew that he could suffer no possible prejudice from the letter complained of; the motion therefore was made and persisted in by him vexatiously, in my judgment, and without reasonable cause. I think, therefore, that this appeal should be allowed with costs, and that the order of the Chancery Divisional Court of the Supreme Court of Justice for Ontario now appealed from should be ordered to be discharged and an order in its place be ordered to be issued out of that court refusing the relator\u2019s motion with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Robinson & O\u2019Brien.\nSolicitors for respondent: Bain, Laidlaw & Co.\n[1] 14 Ont.

Strong and Fournier JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming, by an equal division of the court, the judgment of the Divisional Court[1] and of the judge at the trial in favor of the plaintiff.\nThis was an action against the city of London for damages caused by the plaintiff striking her foot against a street curbing raised above the level of the crossing and falling down, by which she was seriously injured. The accident occurred after dark and the plaintiff claimed that both from the improper construction of the crossing, it being alleged to be from four to six inches below the level of the sidewalk, and from its being allowed to fall into disrepair, the city was guilty of negligence and liable to the plaintiff for the injuries sustained by the fall. The defendants claimed that the only objection to the crossing was as to the manner of construction, namely, below the level of the sidewalk, and as that was a matter discretionary with the civic authorities the courts should not interfere with their action. It was also claimed by the defence that the sidewalk was only elevated one and a-half or two inches.\nAt the trial a verdict was given for the plaintiff and the damages assessed at $500. The Divisional Court sustained the verdict, the Chief Justice dissenting, and on appeal the judges of the Court of Appeal were equally divided in opinion, and the judgment of the Divisional Court was therefore affirmed. The defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nW.R. Meredith Q.C. for the appellants. The rule governing actions of this kind is that the defendants are not liable unless they could be indicted for a nuisance which it is clear could not be done in this case. Ringland v. The City of Toronto[2]; Boyle v. The Town of Dundas[3]; Ray v. The Town of Petrolia[4]; The Town of Portland v. Griffiths[5].\nAs to how far the courts will interfere with municipalities in the exercise of their judicial functions see Slattery v. Nailor[6]; St John v. Pattison[7].\nThe following authorities were referred to as cases ejusdem generis where the defendants were held not liable. Metropolitan Ry. Co. v. Jackson[8]; Giblin v. McMullen[9]; Crafter v. The Metropolitan Ry. Co.[10]; Metropolitan Ry. Co. v. Wright[11]; Hamilton v. Johnston[12].\nR.M. Meredith and Love for the respondent. The question as to the construction of the crossing is one solely for the jury, and a court of appeal will not interfere with their verdict. Dublin, Wicklow & Wexford Ry. Co. v. Slattery[13].\nAs to the merits see Moore v. Lambeth Waterworks Co.[14]; Blackmore v. Vestry of Mile End, Old Town[15]; George v. City of Haverhill[16].\nSIR W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014In this case there having been no evidence of either the street or the sidewalk being out of repair, on the contrary, the evidence showing that the sidewalk was in a good state of repair, I think the mere fact of the sidewalk at the street crossing being four inches or less higher than the crossing was no such evidence of neglect or violation of the legal duty on the defendant\u2019s part as was proper to be submitted to the jury. To hold that such a liability was intended to be imposed by the legislature on municipal bodies would be most unreasonable and would practically burden municipalities to an extent that could never have been contemplated by the legislature.\nUnless we are prepared to hold, which I am not, that municipal bodies are bound by law to make the street crossings meet the sidewalks on the level, and that they are liable if the side\u2011walk rises on the perpendicular four inches or less above the crossing at the point of contact, I cannot see how the plaintiff can recover. While not desiring to relieve municipalities from the duties and responsibilities fairly cast upon them I think we should be careful not to subject them to an action for negligence because, as Chief Justice Wilson says, the edge of the sidewalk happens to be four inches higher than the crossing at the point of contact. I think the appeal should be allowed. STRONG and FOURNIER JJ. were of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would allow this appeal, and order a non-suit to be entered. I cannot see that any actionable wrong has been proved against this corporation. The street itself and the sidewalk were in a perfect state of repair. That the sidewalk was from two to four inches higher than the street is the only ground of this action.\nI agree with the remarks made by the Chief Justice of Ontario and Mr. Justice Burton in the Court of Appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I entirely concur with the judgments in this case of Sir Adam Wilson, late Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, and of the Chief Justice of Ontario and of Mr. Justice Burton in the Court of Appeal of Ontario, that the fact of a sidewalk in the city of London being four inches above the level of the roadway was no evidence proper to be submitted to a jury of neglect by the corporation of any legal duty so as to make them responsible therefor, either in a criminal prosecution or a civil action, and that the plaintiff, therefore, in this case, should have been non-suited. The appeal should be allowed with costs, and a rule for judgment of non-suit be ordered to be issued in the court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Meredith & Cox.\nSolicitor for respondent: Francis Love.\n[1] 11 O.R. 26.\n[2] 23 U.C.C.P. 93.\n[3] 23 U.C.C.P. 470.\n[4] 24 U.C.C.P. 763.\n[5] 11 Can.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nRailway Co.\u2014Aid to\u2014By-law granting bonus\u2014Conditions of prior agreement\u2014Performance of conditions\u2014Specific performance\u2014Damages.\nBy an agreement between the E. & H. Railway Co. and the Town of C. the latter agreed to pass a by-law granting a bonus to the company in aid of the construction of a railway subject to the performance of certain specified conditions. The by-law subsequently approved by the ratepayers, and passed by the council of the town, did not contain all the conditions of the agreement. In an action against the town to compel the delivery of debentures for the amount of the bonus the defendants pleaded non-performance of the conditions of the agreement as justifying the withholding of the debentures and, byway of counter-claim, prayed specific performance of such conditions by the plaintiffs.\nHeld\u20141. Per Ritchie C.J,. Strong, Fournier and Henry JJ., Taschereau and Gwynne JJ. contra, that the title to the debentures did not depend upon prior performance of conditions in the agreement not included in the by-law, but upon performance of those in the by-law alone, and the latter having been complied with the debentures should issue.\n2. Per Fournier J., that the debentures should, nevertheless, be withheld until the damages for non-performance of the conditions in the agreement were paid or secured.\n3. Per Ritchie C.J., Strong and Henry JJ., Fournier J. contra, that specific performance was not an appropriate remedy in such a case and the defendants could only claim damages for non-performance. 4. Per Ritchie C.J., Strong and Fournier JJ., that the claim of defendants for damages could be disposed of in this action under the counterclaim and there should be a reference to assess the same.\n5. Per Henry J., that the evidence did not justify a reference and the counterclaim should be dismissed with a reservation of defendant\u2019s rights.\nOne of the conditions in the agreement to be performed by the railway company was \u201cto construct at or near the corner of Colborne and William Streets (in Toronto) a freight and passenger station with all necessary accommodation, connected by switches, sidings or otherwise with said road\u201d upon the council of the town passing a by-law granting a necessary right of way.\nHeld\u20141. That such condition was not complied with by the erection of a station building not used, nor intended to be used, and for which proper officers such as station master, ticket agent, etc., were not appointed. Strong J. dissenting.\n2. Per Strong J., that the condition only called for the construction of a building with the required accommodation and connections, and did not amount to a covenant to run the trains to such station or make any other use of it.\n3. The words \u201call necessary accommodation\u201d in the condition required that grounds and yards sufficient for freight and passenger traffic in case the station were used should be provided.\nThe act incorporating the railway company contained provisions respecting bonuses granted to it by municipalities not found in the Municipal Act.\nHeld, that such special act was not restrictive of the municipal act, and it was only necessary that the provisions of the latter should be followed to pass a valid by-law granting such a bonus.\nHeld also, that all defects of form in the by-law were cured by 44 Vic. ch. 24, sec. 28, providing for registry of by-laws and requiring an application to quash to be made within three months after such registry.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Common Pleas Division[2] in favor of the plaintiff.\nThe action in this case was brought to compel the delivery by the defendants of debentures to the amount of $30,000 to which the plaintiffs claimed to be entitled under a by-law of the defendant corporation therefor, passed in December, 1883. The conditions of the by-law as to what was necessary to be done by plaintiffs to entitle them to the debentures were as follows:\u2014\n\u201cThe construction and completion for running of the track and road of the Erie & Huron Railway Company from the town of Chatham to the Canada Southern Railway, on or before the 30th day of June, A.D. 1883, or such later date as the council of said town may by resolution from time to time fix; and the construction and completion, within two years from the date on which this by-law takes effect, of the whole track and road of said Erie & Huron Railway Company from the town of Dresden and the village of Wallaceburg to the Rondeau Harbor, laid with steel rails and with stations and freight houses and other necessary accommodation attached and connected therewith, and with a station and freight house and switches or sidings at the crossing of the track of the Canada Southern Railway Company, so that trains can run off the track of the Erie & Huron Railway Company upon, or parallel with and adjacent to, the track of the Canada Southern Railway Company, with a platform 600 feet long adjacent to and parallel with the said last-mentioned track, and 400 feet long and adjacent to and parallel with the track of the Erie & Huron Railway Company; the construction of a bridge over the Thames with an iron or wooden swing, and an adjoining bridge and way for foot passengers over said river not less than four feet in width; the complete construction of said road in other respects supplied with all necessary rolling stock and materials, so as to connect the said town with Rondeau, Blenheim, the Canada Southern Railway, Dresden and Wallaceburg, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Public Works for the time being for Ontario, or an engineer appointed by him; and said company thereafter bon\u00e2 fide running said road with all necessary accommodation for the public, and with connection at the track of the Canada Southern Railway Company for one week.\u201d\nThis by-law was duly registered as provided by 44 Vic., ch. 24, sec 28.\nPrior to the passing of the by-law an agreement was entered into between the defendants and the Erie & Huron Railway Company, by which the defendants agreed to pass such by-law on conditions similar to the above, and with the following additional clauses:\n\u201cAnd to construct at or near the corner of Colborne and William streets, in the said town, a freight and passenger station with all necessary accommodation, connected by switches, sidings or otherwise with said road of the company, upon the council of said town, within three months from the final passing of said by-law, passing another by-law empowering the said company to make its roads and lay its rails along a highway or highways in the said town to said corner, from where the said road would be if the construction thereof were completed in a direct line through the said town, or upon the said council procuring for and giving to said company a right of way along the northerly side of McGregor\u2019s Creek (one half in the water) for the road of said company to or near said corner and to load from gravel piles, pits or beds purchased by said corporation adjacent to or adjoining the track of said company, and carry gravel over said road to any place required by the said town for the construction, maintenance, and repair of public roads in said town, and for other purposes of the town for a sum and at a rate for loading and carriage not to exceed 3 cents per cubic yard of gravel per mile, for all distances less than ten miles, and 2 cents per mile for all distances of ten miles and over, but under 25 miles, and one and-a-half cents per mile for all distances of and over 25 miles.\u201d\nThe road was completed and in running order, and carrying freight and passengers, long before the time mentioned in the by-law, and was run continuously thereafter to and from the King street station for a week, and has been running ever since.\nOn 1st November, 1883, Robert McCallum, a civil engineer, appointed by the Commissioner of Public Works for the province of Ontario, gave a certificate in the following words:\u2014\u201cThis is to certify that I have examined the Erie & Huron Railway from Rondeau Harbor to the town of Dresden, and from Dresden to Wallaceburg, and find that the said road is completed and at present supplied with all necessary rolling stock and materials so as to connect Rondeau Harbor with the Canada Southern Railway, Blenheim, Chatham, Dresden and Wallaceburg, and, in my opinion, is ready for the conveyance of freight and passengers.\u201d\nThe same engineer granted a more formal certificate, setting forth that on the 23rd day of December, 1884, he had made an examination and inspection of the Erie & Huron Railway from Rondeau Harbor to the town of Dresden and from Dresden to Wallaceburg, and had in connection with such examination perused the agreement entered into between the Erie & Huron Railway Company and the corporation of the town of Chatham, dated November, 1882; also, the by-law of the town of Chatham, passed in the month of December, 1882, granting a bonus of $30,000 to the railway company upon certain terms and conditions; that he found the said railway was completed and supplied with all necessary rolling stock and materials so as to connect, as arranged, with the Canada Southern Railway Company, Blenheim, Chatham, Dresden and Wallaceburg, and was, in his opinion, ready for the conveyance of freight and passengers., and that the railway company had substantially complied with the terms and conditions regarding the work to be performed required by the said agreement and by-law, except as to time, as to which he would give no certificate as he was not aware of the time limited. He also found and certified that the platforms provided for by the said agreement and by-law at the crossings of the Canada Southern Railway were theretofore completed in accordance with the requirements of the said agreement and by-law, but that afterwards a portion thereof was temporarily removed by the Canada Southern Railway for the purpose of enabling the said company to lay a pipe to a water tank, and such portion at the time of inspection had not been restored\nNo notice was given to the defendants of the appointment of McCallum as the engineer to make the inspection, nor of the time he would make his inspection; and such inspection was made without the presence of any one acting for or on behalf of the town.\nAfter the passing of the bonus by-law the defendants passed another by-law on the 24th of March, 1883, authorizing the railway company to make its road and lay its rails for one single track, or train, along the southerly side of Colborne street, from the main line to William street in said town, and for two tracks, or a double track, between Adelaide and William streets, provided that the said road and tracks should be at least eight feet from the middle line of said street.\nThe agreement between the Erie & Huron Railway Company and the defendants, and the agreement between the plaintiff, Bickford, and the plaintiffs, the Erie and Huron Railway Company, were made valid and binding by 46 Vic., cap. 52. The defence set up by the defendants was, in substance, that the station was not placed at the corner of Colborne and William streets as provided in the agreement; that McCallum was not appointed, and did not make his examination, as the by-law provided; that the road was not completed within the time limited; that the said railway was not constructed and completed on or before the 30th day of September, 1883, with station and freight houses and other necessary accommodation, which they submitted included a freight and passenger station with all necessary accommodation for the defendants, with switches, siding, or otherwise connected with the said road at or near the corner of Colborne and William streets, according to the terms of the alleged by-law and agreements, or either of them; that a platform 600 feet long, adjacent to and parallel with the Canada Southern Railway, and 400 feet long adjacent to and parallel with the Erie and Huron Railway, at the junction of the said two railways was not constructed; that a bridge over the river Thames, with iron or wooden swing, and an adjoining bridge for foot passengers not less than four feet in width, approaches, and other necessaries connected with said bridge, so as to form a way over said river for the public, were not constructed; that a freight and passenger station, with all necessary accommodation, connected by switches, sidings, or otherwise, with said road, was not constructed at or near the corner of Colborne and William streets.\nThe defendants, by counter claim, set forth the several grounds of defence as causes of action against the plaintiff and prayed that the plaintiff be ordered to construct and maintain a foot-bridge across the Thames with approaches over the flats of the river and lands of the plaintiff on both sides of the river, and perform the other requirements of those agreements and remove one of the tracks laid on Colborne street \u2018and to erect and establish all necessary workshops and repairing houses or sheds within the town and to remove the station on Colborne street off the line of the street, and to cease to use said street as a switch, or siding cars or trains thereon, and that it be referred to the master to ascertain the damages which the defendants have sustained, and that plaintiffs be ordered to pay the same.\nThe evidence disclosed that the road was completed and in running order and open for general traffic to the King street station within the time mentioned in the by-law, but there was conflicting evidence as to whether passenger trains had been run to the Colborne street station continuously for one week; that when the iron bridge across the Thames was first completed the footbridge across was not quite the required width, but that afterwards the footbridge was made of the requisite width, except that at one point one of the iron wire guy ropes passed through the footway so as to have the footway obstructed by this rope, but such obstruction did not impair or prevent the convenient use of the footway; that the platform at the southern railway junction was of the specified dimensions but not continuous and was amply sufficient for the requirements of the traffic on the road; that there was a double track on Colborne street and that owing to the state of the street by reason of the encroachment of McGregor\u2019s Creek the rail was not kept eight feet from the centre of the street as required by the by-law allowing the laying of the track on Colborne street, and the station on Colborne street was not placed at the corner of Colborne and William streets but a block away from William street at or near the corner of Colborne and Adelaide streets.\nThere was conflicting evidence as to whether the station could be put nearer to William street so as to be convenient and useful to the public and the company, so there was not a strict compliance with the terms of the plaintiff\u2019s agreement unless the distance between the station and William street was not so great as to prevent it coming within reasonable intendment of the meaning of the word \u201cnear.\u201d\nThe cause was tried before the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas who held that the plaintiffs\u2019 title to the debentures did not depend upon the performance of the requirements of the agreement not provided for in the by-law, and for any breach of the same the defendants\u2019 remedy would be under the counter-claim for damages. His Lordship held the plaintiff bound to perform the following conditions of the by-law before he could succeed in this action:\n\u201cFirst. The construction and completion for running of the track and road from Chatham to the Canada Southern Railway on or before the 30th day of June, 1883.\n\u2018\u2018Secondly. The completion of the whole track and road with stations and freight houses and other necessary accommodations attached and station, freight house and platform of the stipulated dimensions at the Canada Southern crossing.\n\u201cThirdly. The bridge and foot way over the Thames, with the necessary approaches.\nFourthly. The completion of the road in other respects, supplied with all necessary rolling stock and materials so as to connect the town with the places named to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Public Works, or an engineer appointed by him, and,\nLastly, upon the company bon\u00e2 fide thereafter running the said road with all necessary accommodation for the public and with connection at the track of the Canada Southern for one week.\u201d And he held that these conditions were all substantially performed, and that the plaintiff was entitled to the debentures and to a writ of mandamus to compel their delivery.\nAnother ground of defence set up was that the by-law was ultra vires for not complying with the provisions of the plaintiffs\u2019 charter, which, it was contended, overrides the Municipal Act in respect to aid to railways. His Lordship overruled this contention and held that the special act is not restrictive but only enabling and enlarging the power of municipalities under the Municipal Act, and the latter being complied with the by-law was intra vires of the corporation.\nThe defendants appealed from the judgment of the Chief Justice and the Court of Appeal varied that judgment by decreeing the defendants entitled to specific performance of the agreement as to the station on the corner of Colborne and William streets, with a reference to the master to ascertain the damages to be paid defendants for want\u2019 of such station to date of judgment. The mandamus was stayed until the master should report. In other respects the judgment of the Common Pleas was sustained. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nS.H. Blake Q.C. and W. Cassels Q.C. for the appellants.\nAll the judges in the courts below have found that the conditions in the by-law were complied with and those of the agreement were independent of each other. The plaintiffs have therefore performed all the conditions required to entitle them to the debentures. See Wilson v. Northampton & Banbury Junction Ry. Co.[3]; Jessep v. G.T. Ry. Co.[4]; Mead v. Ballan[5]; Lytton v. Great Northern Ry. Co.[6]; Desjardin Canal Co. v. Great Western Ry. Co.[7]; Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Co. v Taff Vale Ry. Co.[8]; Blackett v. Bates[9].\nChristopher Robinson Q.C. and Wilson for the respondents cited Wallace v. Great Western Ry. Co.[10]; Hodges on Railways[11]; Wilson v. Furness Ry. Co,[12]; Rigby v. Great Western Ry. Co.[13]; Hood\u2019s Case[14]; Firth v. Midland Ry. Co.[15]; Green v. West Cheshire Ry. Co.[16]; C.A. Ry. Co. v. County of Ottawa[17].\nSIR W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The statement of this case is to be found at length in the judgment of Chief Justice Cameron[18].\nNeither party was satisfied with the decision of the learned Chief Justice and both parties appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario; that court decreed in substance as follows[19]:\u2014\nFrom this decree both parties also appealed; the plaintiff, however, limited his appeal to that portion of the judgment given upon the counter claim of the defendants construing the covenant in the agreement in reference to the construction of the station at or near the corner of Colborne and William streets and ordering specific performance of such agreement.\nThe by-law under which the debentures are claimed in this case is as follows[20]:\u2014\nThe agreement dated the 3rd of Nov. 1882, between the Erie and Huron Railway Co. and the Town of Chatham recites that:\u2014\nAnd whereas the said Co. in order to complete its road and pro- vide it with rolling stock and all necessaries, requires a further bonus of $30,000 in debentures from the said town payable on obtaining the certificate of the Government\u2019s Engineer of the completion of the said road, according to the terms of a by-law to be submitted to the electors of said town, and the running thereof for one week, and in order to induce the town to submit and pass the said by-law and give such aid, has offered to execute a binding agreement with the town containing the terms and obligations on the part of the Co. hereinafter set forth.\nAnd whereas the town, upon the consideration of such binding agreement, has agreed to read, submit to the electors, and with their consent finally pass, such by-law to give further aid to said company as in the by-law set forth.\nThis very clearly shows that the by-law and agreement were to be considered as two separate and distinct instruments, and the certificate, on the obtaining of which the debentures were to be issued, was to be of the completion of the road according to the terms of the by-law to be submitted, and not according to the terms of the by-law and to the stipulations contained in the agreement but not inserted in the by-law and forming no part of it.\nOn the 1st of Nov., 1883, Mr. C.F. Fraser, Commissioner of Public Works for Ontario, appointed Robert McCallum, C.E., \u201cas engineer under the by-law of the Town of Chatham taking effect on the 30th December, 1882, giving a bonus to the Erie and Huron Railway, for the purpose of certifying as by the said by-law is required.\u2019\u2019\nI can discover nothing to impeach this engineer\u2019s certificate. I do not think the engineer, McCallum, acted in any way as a judge or arbitrator between the town and the railway company or Bickford; all he had to do was personally to examine and inspect the road and to certify whether or not in the terms of the by-law (section 1) the road, &c., was constructed and supplied, &c., in accordance with the by-law to his satisfaction. I can see nothing in the nature of his office, or the performance of his duties, that required notice to either party, either of his appointment or of the time he would make his inspection. I do not think the by-law requires the engineer\u2019s certificate to say anything outside the by-law which does not refer to nor incorporate with it any agreement; the certificate was to certify as to the completion according to the] by-law and not according to any agreement forming no portion of the by-law. The certificate of the engineer is substantially in accordance with the terms of the by-law and the evidence shows that all that the by-law requires had been performed.\nIf, then, all the conditions contained in the by-law have been complied with, and I think the learned Chief Justice was right in so holding, why should not the debentures issue? It was on these conditions being complied with that the municipality and ratepayers agreed that the debentures should issue; what right have we to go outside of the by-law and say they should not issue? If the town of Chatham or the taxpayers had wished to make the issue of the debentures on other conditions they should have had them inserted in the by-law.\nThere appears to have been a great diversity of opinion in the town as to the propriety of establishing the station at Colborne Street; might this not have been the reason why nothing was said about it in the by-law as, if mentioned, the passing of the by-law by the ratepayers might thereby have been jeopardized? Otherwise, why was this not inserted in the by-law if the town and the ratepayers intended that the construction of the station at or near the corner of Colborne and William streets was to be a condition precedent and on the fulfilment of which the debentures were to issue? So far, as a matter of fact, from this by-law being passed because of this particular stipulation I think the inference from the evidence is that this was rather kept in the background for fear, by reason of the conflict of opinion, the ratepayers might refuse to pass the by-law.\nI think all the evidence as to what was said before the submission to the ratepayers, or during the canvass or discussion at any public meeting of ratepayers or others, in the absence of fraud which is not alleged or proved, was wholly irrelevant and, in my opinion, should not have been received as influencing, in any way, the construction that should be placed on either the agreement or by-law, or both.\nThe municipality not having chosen to insert in the by-law any provision or condition for the constructing and establishing of a station at Colborne street, and the ratepayers, on the 13th December, 1887, having, by their vote, consented to the issuing of the debentures without any such condition, I am of opinion that the provisions in the agreement, but not inserted in the by-law, must be treated and dealt with as separate and distinct from the by-law and as independent covenants, and, as I have said, the conditions of the by-law having been complied with the debentures should issue, and for any breach of the agreement outside of the by-law the municipality and ratepayers, not having made the issue of the debentures dependent on the fulfilment of the agreement, must seek indemnity for any breach of such agreement in damages and not seek to enforce the agreement by withholding the debentures.\nI participate in the doubt expressed by Mr. Justice Osler as to the correctness of the finding, as a matter of fact, that at or near the corner of Colborne and William streets may mean at or near the corner of Colborne and Adelaide streets, in another block and with other streets intervening; the evidence satisfies me that there was no impossibility in erecting or working the station at or near the corner named, though no doubt, it may have been a very inconvenient spot for the working of the railway, but I am not disposed to differ from the learned Chief Justice and I entirely agree with him that this station was not essential to the completion of the road in accordance with the by\u2011law and therefore does not prevent the accruing of the plaintiff\u2019s title to the debentures, because I agree with him that this does not depend upon the performance of stipulations in the agreement not provided for by the by-law; that for the breach of plaintiff\u2019s agreement not covered by the conditions of the by-law the remedy of the defendants is under their counter\u2011claim for damages for such breach.\nThe conditions of the by-law, the fulfilment of which are conditions precedent to the right of the plaintiff to the debentures, are[21]:\u2014\nThe Chief Justice then says:\u2014\nThere was no dispute as to the completion of the road for running to the Canada Southern by the time stipulated. The evidence satisfies me the second condition was fulfilled, that is to say, the construction of the whole road, with stations, freight houses and other necessary accommodation attached, and platform accommodation stipulated for at the Canada Southern Junction, or crossing. I am also satisfied that the bridge across the Thames was a substantial compliance with the requirements of the by-law in respect thereto. The approaches were sufficient.\nIn this conclusion, after a very careful perusal of all the evidence in the case, I concur.\nI think the construction of the clause of the agreement in relation to the Colborne and William streets station which is as follows[22]:\u2014\ninvolves all the necessary accommodation for the continuous and ordinary use by the public of the station when constructed. How can it be that there is all necessary accommodation at a station where there is no station master, ticket officer, baggage master or other servants connected therewith? How can it be said that, there is a freight and passenger station with all necessary accommodation connected by switches, sidings or otherwise with said road of the company to which no trains are to be run or if run then no accommodation for freight or passengers to enable the one or the other to be carried from or to the station? I cannot think that the mere erection of a building called a station, and the abandonment of its use as a station, is a performance of the agreement. It seems to me almost a mockery to say there is a station there with all necessary accommodation to which a train is never run and access to which is impossible by reason of the waiting room and ticket office being closed and no person to attend to passengers or to receive and forward freight. What accommodation is afforded by a room called a waiting room, ticket office and freight room, and a platform, if neither the one nor the other can be used by passengers or for freight? I think the connection by switches, sidings and otherwise with the main road of the company shows that the station to be erected was to be ordinarily worked and used as part and parcel of the road by the company, and I am the more impressed with the correctness of this by reading the by-law which grants to the company the right to make its road and lay its rails \u201calong the southerly side of Colborne street from the main line to William street, &c.,\u201d and which the company and Bickford adopted and acted on. It recites that,\nWhereas the said company and Bickford have agreed to construct and establish a station and freight house and other necessary accommodation for said company and the public at the corner of Colborne and William streets upon the council of said corporation passing this by-law; and whereas the council of said corporation desires that such station and freight house and other accommodation should be erected and established.\nNow, what can be the fair meaning of constructing and establishing a station and freight house with necessary accommodation, not for the company alone but for the said company and the public, if it is not to fix, permanently and unalterably, for the ten years the train was to run, a station and freight house with all necessary accommodation for the use, not only of the company but of the public? And who can say that the erection of a building, not to be used as a station and freight house but locked up, with no necessary accommodation for the public to enable the station to be used as such, is satisfied by a station building where no tickets can be obtained and from which no trains are to come and go? I think it is not. I think the true construction of the contract was to construct and establish a station with all such accommodation for the public as is ordinarily to be found at a station from which trains regularly run, and at which passengers are taken up and freight received and delivered. I think the observations of Chief Justice Hagarty with reference to the provision in the agreement to run the road continuously for at least ten years, and with reference to the clause as to Colborne street station, are conclusive that the whole sense of the words used points to a continuous use, and I agree with him that it would be a monstrous injustice to hold that a company may accept the full consideration as to stations, &c., and refuse to place them in a position to be used.\nAssuming that the station was properly located I am of opinion that the station and station accommodations are not sufficient to answer the requirements of the plaintiff\u2019s covenant, being deficient in proper accommodation for loading and unloading freight and the absence of all accommodation for the public. The majority of the Court of Appeal have considered that the defendants are entitled to specific performance of the agreement in the pleadings mentioned as to the station on Colborne street in the town of Chatham, as claimed by the defendants in their counter-claim. Now, what have they claimed?\n(c) That they may be ordered to construct and maintain a freight and passenger station with switches, sidings and all other necessary accommodation for the defendants upon lands of or to be purchased by the plaintiffs at or near the corner of Colborne and William streets, and to provide and keep a station master, ticket and baggage officer, and other necessary and ordinary servants of the said company thereat, and to stop all ordinary trains thereat, and not to run such trains past said town without going to and staying at said station for the purpose of taking up and setting down passengers or freight, or both, and that they use and establish such station as the principal and main station for Chatham.\nThis, I think, cannot be so adjudged. This is not the performance of a definite work to be performed once for all. It is clear that the court may exercise a discretion in granting or withholding a decree for specific perfermance, and I think it is equally clear that such a decree will not be made when the terms of the agreement are vague and its effect is to throw on the court the duty of superintending the performance of a series of continuous acts involving the exercise of skill, personal labor and judgment.\nI think the case of Wilson v. Northampton & Banbury Junction Railway Co.[23] very distinguishable from the present. There the station mentioned in the schedule, so far as it related to the station to be erected, was in the following words\u2014\u201ca station to be made on lots Nos. 24, 25 and 26, parish of Wappingham, or some part or parts thereof.\u201d\nVery different, indeed, from the station which the plaintiff undertook to construct in this case. If then, the construction of a freight and passenger station involves the necessity of maintaining it and providing the necessary officers and means of keeping it in a state of accomplishing the purposes \\of a freight and passenger station, as the Court of Appeal think and as I think it does, then it necessarily involves the keeping of the station open at suitable times for passengers and freight and the carrying on of the business of a freight and passenger station, requiring the performance of personal acts and duties involving the continuous exercise of skill and judgment as well as good faith and diligence in determining the nature and extent of the facilities required at a suitable station. If so would not this constitute the performance to be decreed and if decreed impose on the court the duty of seeing that the performance was within the intent of the contract, and the non-performance of which could only be punished by repeated attachments?[24].\nThe result of decreeing specific performance in such a case as this would compel the court to superintend the execution of this particular stipulation for, at any rate, the ten years that the agreement provides that trains shall run, which, in my opinion, is contrary to the authorities which, I think, conclusively show that the court will not superintend the performance of such continuous acts.\nNothing can very well be more vague and uncertain than this agreement. Upon what land is this station to be constructed? The defendants claim it is to be on lands of, or to be purchased by, the plaintiff at or near the corner of Colborne and William streets. How is the court to determine the exact site and upon what lands of the plaintiffs or, if they have no suitable lands, what lands are they to be required to purchase? Then, as there is no certainty as to where the station is to be placed there is no certainty as to the character of the station, no plans, no specifications, no provision as to dimensions, material or workmanship by which the officer of the court, with the agreement, claim and decree in his hands, could determine whether the agreement had been specifically performed or not.\nThe English and American authorities seem very clear that courts of equity will not enforce the performance of continuous duties, involving personal labor and care of a particular kind which the court cannot superintend. Of the numerous cases to be found in the books I shall notice a very few which seem to me to bear directly on this case.\nMarble Company v. Ripley[25]:\nMr. Justice Strong:\nAnother serious objection to a decree for a specific performance is found in the peculiar character of the contract itself and in the duties which it requires of the owners of the quarries. These duties are continuous. They involve skill, personal labor, and cultivated judgment. It is, in effect, a personal contract to deliver marble of certain kinds, and in blocks of such a kind that the court is incapable of determining whether they accord with the contract or not. The agreement being for a perpetual supply of marble, no decree the court can make will end the controversy. If performance be decreed the case must remain in court forever, and the court to the end of time may be called upon to determine, not only whether the prescribed quantity of marble has been delivered, but whether every block was from the right place, whether it was sound, whether it was of suitable size, or shape, or proportion. Many of the difficulties in the way of decreeing specific performance of a contract, requiring, as this does, continuous personal action, and running through an indefinite period of time, are well stated in The Port Clinton Railroad Co. v. The Cleveland and Toledo Railroad Co.[26]; Fry on Specific Performance[27]\nPort Clinton Ry Co. v. Cleveland & Tol Ry. Co.[28]: Molson J.:\nIt is different from the case where the act to be done would produce some tangible result, which could be inspected and compared with the requisitions of the contract. When no such result follows the personal act, but the act involves the continuous exercise of skill, judgment or discretion, the manner and mode of which are, from its very nature, undetermined, the difficulty of a specific performance seems almost insuperable.\nEven in cases where there would be a visible and tangible product from the personal act, if the contract does not define and determine the character of that product, the court will not supply that which has been left by the parties as a matter of individual judgment, taste or discretion. Thus, in a class of cases in which there has been a diversity of opinion as to the propriety of a specific performance, the building a house on particular land, the covenant to build must have a definite certainty as to size, materials &c. Story Eq. Jur.[29]\nBlanchard v. Detroit and Lake Mich. Ry. Co.[30]:\nGraves C.J.:\nIf, however, it appears, either that the things to be performed are in their nature incapable of execution by the court, or that needful specifications are omitted, or that material matters are left by the parties so obscure or undefined, or so in want of details, or that the subjects of the agreement are so conflicting or incongruous, that the court cannot say whether or not the minds of the parties met upon all the essential particulars, or if they did, then cannot say exactly upon what substantial terms they agreed, or trace out any practical line where their minds met, the case is not one for specific performance.\nAs the court does not make contracts for parties so it never undertakes to supply material ingredients which they omit to mention, and which cannot be legitimately considered as having been within their mutual contemplation. And where the party to perform is left by the agreement with an absolute discretion respecting material and substantial details, and these are therefore indeterminate and unincorporated until by his election they are developed, identified, and fixed as constituents of the transaction, the court cannot substitute its own discretion, and so by its own act perfect and round out the contract. If the court were to do this it would be to assume a right not belonging to it, but one which the parties reserved to themselves. P. 54. It is, first, that defendants shall make and maintain on the premises a depot or station house, suitable for the convenience of the public.\nSecond, that during all future time, when trains run on the road, at least one train each way shall every day stop thereat, and third, that for all future time freight and passengers shall be regularly received and discharged at such depot.\nP. 58. Without going further in this view of the case, it is only needful to say that it seems obvious that the very nature of the provision sought to be enforced is such as to render the remedy impracticable. But if this objection were not insuperable there would be still another in the want of details and lack of particularity and specification. The specific location is not given for the building, nor is there anything certain as to the plan, size, shape, materials or arrangement of the building. All this appears to have been left by the assent of the parties, substantially to the judgment, and discretion of the grantees. The only specification, the only limit upon such judgment and discretion, the parties saw fit to make, was that it should be suitable for the convenience of the public. For many purposes this might be considered definite enough. It would be in a charter in which the end to be obtained would be presented as the object of the legislature, whilst everything in regard to details and means would be rightly and purposely left to the company. But for a building contract or an agreement to be executed by the court, it is not so. If the court were to attempt to decree, what direction could it give as per contract in regard to the plan, size, shape, materials, arrangement and cost? If what would now satisfy the interest of the public were known it might guide as to the present size and arrangement; but it could go no further. What is needful now may be otherwise in time, and future changes in the state of the country or in business may wholly disappoint all present calculations. The public interest may require many alterations. But the reference to the public convenience gives no clue whatever as to the materials, or in regard to other essential matters.\nPowell Duffryn Steam Coal Co. v. Taff Vale Railway Co.[31]\nMr. Greene Q.O. and Mr. Marten Q.C. for the appellants:\nWe have a statutory right to use the railway under the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, s.92, and we seek to have that right protected. In Bell v. Midland Railway Company[32] the court interfered to protect statutory rights under the act, and in Green v. West Cheshire Railway Company[33] it interfered, by way of specific performance, to make a railway company construct and maintain a siding.\nThe Lord Justice James:\nI doubt whether this court can give effect to the rights Conferred by sect. 92. As far as my experience goes, the court has never ordered anything which involves doing something from day to day for an indefinite period.\nThe Lord Justice Mellish:\nI feel the same doubt, and am disposed to think that a court of common law would feel the same difficulty as to a mandamus, A court can only order the doing something which has to be done once for all, so that the court can see to its being done. The Railway Clauses Act was passed at a time when the working of railways was not well understood. The legislature seems to have considered that there was no more difficulty about running over a railway than along a turnpike road. It is found now that the use of points and signals is required: but how can the court see to the defendants working them day after day for a series of years?\nGervais v. Edwards[34].\nThe Lord Chancellor:\nIf the jurisdiction of this court permitted it, I should willingly grant a specific performance of this agreement, because the merits are altogether on the side of the plaintiff; but I do not see how it is possible specifically to execute this contract. The court acts only, when it can perform the very thing, in the terms specifically agreed upon, but when we come to the execution of a contract, depending upon many particulars, and upon uncertain events, the court must see whether it can be specifically executed; nothing can be left to depend upon chance; the court must itself execute the whole contract.\nWaterman on the Specific Performance of Contracts[35]. Contracts incapable of being enforced.\nEquity will not inforce the performance of continuous duties involving personal labor and care of a particular kind which the court cannot superintend as the working of points and signals on the line of as railroad requiring constant supervision; Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Co. v. Taff Vale Ry. Co.[36], or a contract to build and equip a railroad, Danforth v. Philadelphia, etc., Ry. Co.[37], or to work all the trains on a railroad, and keep the engines and rolling stock in repair; Johnson v. Shrewsbury and B.R.R.[38], or to use the railroad of another company with engines and trains, which the court cannot regulate and control; Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Co. v. Taff Vale Ry. Co.[39] or an agreement by a railroad company to maintain and keep in repair cattle-guards upon the land of the plaintiff; Columbus, &c., Ry. Co. v. Watson[40], or a covenant in the lease of a coal mine to work the mine efficiently; Wheatley v. Westminster Coal Co.[41], Lord Abinger v. Askton[42], or an agreement by a street railroad company to run cars along a particular street daily, \u201cat such regular intervals as may be right and proper,\u201d whether the obligation of the company rests in contract, or is derived from the provisions of its charter. McCanny v. South, &c., Ry. Co.[43]\nP. 70 S. granted to a railroad company a right of way through his premises on condition that the company would place beside its road on said premises a platform convenient for loading and unloading cars, take therefrom all produce shipped by S., and bring and place thereon all freight shipped by or for him to that point from any other station on the road provided the company had three days\u2019 notice. Held that S. could not compel specific performance. Atlanta, &c., Ry. Co. v. Speer[44].\nP. 70 n. In this case the court said:\nWe are not asked to compel the plaintiffs in error to transport a particular kind of freight now being on the platform awaiting transportation\u2014we are asked that they shall, in all future time, transport all freight and deliver it as required by defendant in error in the terms of the contract. It is evident that any such decree must be as general and as indefinite in its terms as the contract itself. It cannot specify as to the kind of produce, the quality, the time of performance; nor can the court make a decree, which will be satisfied by any specific act of peformance. After decree made the case must be kept open, and if the defendant in that decree be contumacious, there must be action of the court to enforce it 20, perhaps 50 times a year for all time. Besides in regard to each alleged violation of the contract, the other party is entitled to a hearing, He may insist that the freight in question at one time is not of the description contemplated in the contract; at another that it is not the property of the party complaining; at still another, that notice had not been given in the terms of the contract. We are satisfied that this is not a contract of which performance can be compelled by one sweeping decree embracing all time and all instances demanding performance. The party has an adequate remedy at law, and doubtless would be redressed there. The following clause in a deed to a railroad company is incapable of being specifically enforced; this conveyance is made upon the express condition that said railroad company shall build, erect and maintain a depot or station house on the land herein described, suitable for the convenience of the public, and that at least one train each way shall stop at such depot or station each day when trains run on said road, and that freight and passengers shall be regularly taken at such depot. Blanchard v. Detroit etc., R.R. Co.[45] Graves C.J.: Can the court see that in all coming time these requirements are carried out? Can it know or keep informed whether trains are running, and what accommodations are suitable to the public interest? Can it see whether the proper stoppages are made each day? Can it take notice or legitimately and truly ascertain from day to day what amounts to regularity in the receipt and discharge of passengers and freight? Can it have the means of deciding at all times whether the due regularity is observed? Can it superintend and supervise the business, and cause the requirements in question to be carried out? If it can, and if it may do this in regard to one station on the road, it may, with equal propriety, upon a like showing, do the same in regard to all stations on the road, and not only so, but in regard to all stations on all the present and future roads in the state. That any such jurisdiction is impracticable appears plain, and the fault lies in the circumstance that the objects of the parties as they were written down by them, are, by their very nature, insusceptible of execution by the court. In a suit for specific performance by a landowner against a railroad company it appeared that the company, in consideration for the right of way for their track over the plaintiffs\u2019 land, agreed to fence the same, to deliver to the plaintiff certain bonds, and to release him from a subscription to the stock of the company. It was held that the facts alleged entitled the plaintiff to a judgment for damages, but not to specific performance. Cincinnati and Chicago Railroad Company v. Washburn[46]. A court of Equity as a temporary measure during the pendency of a litigation, may undertake by means of a receiver to operate a railroad. Coe v. Columbus, &c., R.R. Co.[47] But it will only do this when the demand for the exercise of such a jurisdiction is imperative, and the court can make an order of limited duration, and give precise directions as to the manner in which the order shall be carried out Port Clinton R.R. Co. v. Cleveland & Toledo R.R. Co.[48]; see Richmond v. Dubuque & Sioux City R.R. Co.[49] A demurrer was sustained to a bill filed for the specific performance of an award which required that the defendant should execute to the plaintiff a lease of the right to such part of a railway made by the plaintiff as was on the defendant\u2019s land, and that the defendant should be entitled to run carriages on the whole line on certain terms, and might require the plaintiff to supply engine power, while the latter should have an engine on the road; and that the plaintiff, during the whole time, should keep the entire railroad in good repair. The court remarked that it \u201chad no means of enforcing the performance of daily duties during the term of the lease; that it could do nothing more than punish the party by imprisonment or fine in case of failure to perform them and might be called on for a number of years to issue repeated attachments for default.\u201d Blackett v. Bates,[50]. Specific performance was refused of a contract concerning the use and enjoyment of a quarry providing for \u201cthe delivery of certain kinds of marble in good sound blocks of a suitable size, shape, and proportion, and to quarry to order, as might be wanted to keep the mill fully supplied at all times, the amount to be not less than 75,000 feet per annum, and for so long a time as the said Ripley, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, might want.\u201d The court said: \u201cThe agreement being for a perpetual supply of marble, no decree the court can make will end the controversy. If performance be decreed, the case must remain in court forever, and the court, to the end of time, may be called on to determine, not only whether the prescribed quantity of marble has been delivered, but whether every block was from the right place, whether it was sound, whether it was of suitable size, or shape, or proportion. Meanwhile, the parties may be constantly changing. It is manifest that the court cannot superintend the execution of such a decree. It is quite impracticable. And it is certain that equity will not interfere to enforce part of a contract, unless that part is clearly severable from the remainder.\u201d Marble Co, v. Ripley[51]. In a suit to compel the defendant to convey to the plaintiff certain land, it appeared that the defendant and another person owned the land, and that, being desirous of having it partitioned, the defendant employed the plaintiff to do the business, agreeing that for plaintiffs\u2019 services, he would convey to him 320 acres of defendant\u2019s share of the land. A bond was given to secure the performance of this agreement, giving to the plaintiff the right of selection, and making it incumbent on the defendant to convey as soon as the selection was made. A partition having been partly effected, further proceedings therein were postponed until the boundaries of the land could be fixed by proper authorities. This was not done until three years afterwards, when the plaintiff proposed to complete the partition; whereupon he made a selection, and demanded a conveyance. It was held that, as the plaintiff could not be compelled to complete the service he had agreed to perform, nor the defendant to accept them, the contract was not one which could be specifically enforced. Cooper v. Pena[52]. Although usually a contract, relating to personal services, will not be specifically enforced, but the party aggrieved will be left to his remedy at law, yet there is an exception to the rule, when by the contract, something is to be done, on a party\u2019s own land, of such a nature that the opposite party will be deprived of the benefit of labor and materials bestowed thereon, unless the contract is carried out, and the owner of the land is attempting thus to deprive him. Within this principle, a contract between a waver power company and a city, that the former should construct extensive certain water works, of a capacity to supply the city daily with a specified quantity of water, the works having been constructed, was enforced against the city. Columbia Water Power Co v. Columbia[53].\nP. 72. But if the work agreed to be done is definite, and there is no remedy at law, specific performance will be decreed; as the construction by a railroad company of an archway under their road pursuant to their contract. Storer v. Great Western Ry. Co.[54] So specific performance was decreed of a contract between the owner of land and a railroad company that, in consideration of the previous withdrawal by the land owner of a petition to parliament against the company\u2019s bill, the company would construct and forever maintain at their expense a siding of a specified length along the line upon the premises of the land owner and set apart by him for that purpose. Green v. West Cheshire Ry. Co.[55] As to the order that the mandamus should not be enforced until after the report of the master, and the damages, if any, paid or security given, but for the limit by the plaintiffs of their appeal, as at present advised. I am at a loss to discover upon what principle we can withhold the delivery of the debentures and make such delivery dependent upon the payment or security of the damages assessed. If the agreement formed a portion of the by-law, or was to be read as a part of it, and so the erection of the station with all necessary accommodation in the way of buildings, appliances, officers and attendants maintained and used in the regular and continuous running of the road, was a condition precedent, as it was not complied with the plaintiffs claim to the debenture should be dismissed. If it is not to be treated as a condition precedent to the giving of the debentures, I am unable to see what right we have, or upon what principle we can allow the defendants to retain the debentures as decreed. If the defendants were not satisfied with the security of the agreement they, it appears to me, should have stipulated for some better security; not having done so I do not see how the dedentures can be withheld without making an entirely new and different agreement from that entered into by the parties and to which the plaintiffs have never assented and for which the defendants, so far as I can see, in the proceedings have never asked.\nBut, as the plaintiffs have limited their appeal to the construction of the agreement and the order for specific performance I must assume that the retaining of the debentures until the payment, or security was given for the payment, of the damages was considered by the plaintiffs, under the circumstances, a fair and reasonable provision.\nI agree with Chief Justice Cameron that section 559 sub-section 4 of the Municipal Act, R.S.O., cap. 174, the act in force when the by-law was passed, justifies the passing of the by-law; and I also agree that 44 Vic. cap. 24, sec. 28, validates the by-law now in question as passed.\nI think there is nothing in the objection that the validating act does not apply when no debentures have been actually issued. By reason of the terms in the validating act \u201cevery such by-law so registered and the debentures issued thereunder shall be absolutely valid and binding.\u201d\nIf the by-law is valid by reason of this section 28 of 44 Vic. cap. 24, as I think it was, then the by-law is good and must be acted on, and if the conditions of the by-law have been complied with the debentures must be issued in accordance therewith, the issue of the debentures depending on the validity of the by-law under which they are to be issued.\nThe Court of Appeal has not passed on the question of the workshops but has, as the learned Chief Justice in the court below did, reserved the right to the defendants to take such action as they may be advised as to them at some future time.\nI agree with the Court of Appeal that as to the wrongful continuance of the track upon the street a claim for damages does not seem to be an appropriate remedy.\nI do not think the defendants\u2019 counter-claim should be dismissed but that they should have damages assessed in this suit for the damages they can show have been sustained by reason of the breach of the contract as to the station. I think there should be a reference on the counter-claim to ascertain the amount of the defendants\u2019 damages.\nI think the decree in this case should be amended by striking out of the 3rd paragraph the words \u201cthat the defendants are entitled to a specific performance of the agreement in the pleadings mentioned as to a station on Colborne street, in the said town of Chatham, as claimed by the defendants in their counter-claim\u201d and \u201cup to the date of this judgment,\u201d and by striking out the last clause.\nSTRONG J.\u2014All the learned judges who have pronounced upon this case in the courts below, as well the four judges in the Court of Appeal as the late Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, before whom the action was tried, have determined that the objections to the validity of the by-law were not sustainable. With them and for the reasons given in the judgments of the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and of Mr. Justice Burton, which I fully adopt and therefore need not repeat, I am of opinion that the special act of incorporation of the company does not take the case out of the operation of the general municipal law, but that the powers conferred on municipalities by the latter act are applicable. This being so the 28th section of the Ontario Act, 44 Vic., ch. 24, is relied upon as covering any objections which might be made to the by-law upon the ground of non-compliance with the requirements of the municipal act as regards recitals or otherwise. The statute in question, 44 Vic. ch. 24, is an act for the amendment of the general municipal law, and sec. 28 is as follows:\u2014\nEvery by-law passed by any municipality for contracting any debt, by the issue of debentures for a longer term than one year, and for levying rates for the payment of such debts, on the ratable property of the municipality, or any part thereof, shall be registered by the clerk of such municipality, it a county, in the registry office for the county in which the county town is situate, or in case of callo municipalities in the registry office of the registration division in which the local municipality is situate, within the two weeks after the final passing thereof by such municipality; and every such by\u2011law so registered and the debentures issued thereunder shall be ab- solutely valid and binding upon such municipality according to the terms thereof, and shall not be quashed or set aside on any ground whatever, unless an application or suit to quash or set aside the same be made to some court of competent jurisdiction within three months from the registry thereof.\nThe Chief Justice of Ontario says in his judgment:\nIt is conceded that this by-law was registered as directed and no application was made within the three months.\nAnd in the argument at this bar the due registration of the by-law and the omission of any application to set it aside within the prescribed time were conceded as admitted facts by the learned counsel for the respondents. It must therefore now be held that the by-law is valid and binding on the municipality.\nThe next question to be considered is as to the performance by the railway company of the terms of the by-law which were conditions precedent to the issue of the debentures. In this respect, also, I agree in opinion with the learned judges of the courts below, all of whom considered that the provisions of the contract between the town and the railway company dated the 3rd November, 1882, set out in full in the statement of defence, are not to be imported into or construed as part of the by-law. In the words of the Chief Justice of Ontario I read the covenants in this agreement as independent and not as dependent covenants. Although the agreement was intra vires both of the town and the railway company and therefore binding on the latter we are not to consider the stipulations contained in it as avoiding altering or qualifying the express conditions of the by-law, an instrument of later date. An insuperable objection, in my opinion, to a contrary construction is that the assenting and agreeing parties to the two instruments are different. The by-law is assented to by the body of ratepayers, the agreement, so far as the town is concerned, emanates from the council alone. If the by-law had been passed first, no one could contend that any alterations in its terms could have been effected by a contract entered into with the town through the mayor and council. Then the fact that the agreement preceded the by-law so far from being a reason for any difference in this respect makes the objection to such a variation still stronger. Authority to issue debentures could only have been conferred by a by-law assented to by the ratepayers who were never called upon to vote upon a by-law incorporating the terms of the agreement. The railway company to entitle itself to the debentures is therefore bound to show performance of the terms and conditions imposed by the ratepayers, but of no others. The by-law and the agreement being then between different parties, the contract is therefore necessarily entirely collateral to and independent of the by\u2011law. As regards the contract of the 4th Dec, 1882, between the railway company and the other plaintiff. Bickford, for making the railway,\u2014I know of no principle upon which that can be said to have any influence upon the construction of the by-law. It was between different parties entirely and the railway company never undertook to come under the same obligations to the town as Bickford by this contract had assumed towards them. To read the provisions of this last contract as if incorporated in the by-law would be, in my opinion, to make a contract for the parties which they never entered into, besides being open to all the objections already taken with reference to the agreement of the railway company with the town that it would be an innovation upon the terms of the by-law which the ratepayers never assented to and were never as much as called upon to consider. I quite agree, therefore, that the courts below were right in the view which they took of the principal action,\u2014 the proceeding instituted by the railway company, and Mr. Bickford claiming under it by assignment, to enforce the delivery of the debentures\u2014viz., that the right of the plaintiffs in this respect depended exclusively on their ability to show that they had performed the conditions precedent set forth in the body of the by-law itself and that they were not bound to go further and show a performance also of the stipulations of the agreement.\nThen to consider the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, in this aspect, we find that so much of the by\u2011law as specifies the work to be performed by the railway company as preliminary to the issuing of the debentures is contained in the first clause which is as follows:\u2014\nThat upon construction and completion for running of the track and road of the Erie and Huron Railway Company from the town of Chatham to the Canada Southern Railway, on or before the 30th day of June, A.D. 1883, or such later date as the Council of said town may by resolution from time to time fix; and upon construction and completion, within two years from the date on which this by-law takes effect, of the whole track and road of said Erie and Huron Railway Company from the town of Dresden and village of Wallaceburg, to the Rondeau Harbor, laid with steel rails and with stations and freight houses and other necessary accommodation attached and connected therewith, and with a station and freight house and switches or sidings at the crossing of the track of the Canada Southern Railway Company, so that trains can run off the track of the Erie and Huron Railway Company upon, or parallel with and adjacent to, the track of the Canada Southern Railway Company, with a platform 600 feet long adjacent to and parallel with the said last mentioned track, and 400 feet long and adjacent to, and parallel with the track of the Erie and Huron Railway Company; and upon the construction of a bridge over the Thames with an iron or wooden swing, and an adjoining bridge and way for foot passengers over said river not less than four feet in width; and upon the complete construction of said road in other respects, supplied with all necessary rolling stock and materials, so as to connect with the said town, with Rondeau, Blenheim, the Canada Southern Railway, Dresden, and Wallaceburg, to the satis- faction of the Commissioner of Public Works for the time being for Ontario, or an engineer appointed by him; and upon said company thereafter bond fide running said road with all necessary accommodation for the public, and with connection at the track of the Canada Southern Railway Company for one week; the mayor or other head and clerk for the time being, &c., shall forthwith, &c., sign and issue the debentures, &c.\nThe Chief Justice before whom the case was tried found that the requirements as to time had been complied with, that is to say that the railway had been completed to the Canada Southern Railway before the 30th June, 1883, and that the whole line of railway had been completed within the prescribed period of two years, and further that the company had complied with the last condition that it should bon\u00e2 fide run the road with all necessary accommodation for the public and with connection at the track of the Canada Southern Railway C6mpany for one week. As regards the sufficiency of the work, the provisions that the line should be laid with steel rails, and furnished with stations and freight houses and other necessary accommodation attached and connected therewith, and with a station and freight house and switches or sidings at the crossing of the track of the Canada Southern Railway Company so that trains can run off the track of the Erie and Huron Railway Company, upon or parallel with and adjacent to the track of the Canada Southern Railway Company, and the provision as to the platform at this junction with the Canada Southern Railway, and the complete construction of the road in other respects, supplied with all necessary rolling stock and materials all of which was (as in concurrence with both courts below, I construe the by-law) to be done to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Public Works for the time being for Ontario or an engineer appointed by him, it is sufficient to say that it is all covered by the certificate or report of Mr. McCallum the engineer appointed for the purpose by the Commissioner of Public Works. That certificate is as follows:\u2014\nThis is to certify that on the 23rd day of December, 1884, I made an examination and inspection of the Erie and Huron Railway from Rondeau Harbour to the town of Dresden, and from Dresden to Wallaceburg, and I have in connection with such examination perused the agreement entered into between the Erie and Huron Railway Company and the corporation of the town of Chatham, dated November, 1882, also the by-law of the town of Chatham passed in the month of December, 1882, granting a bonus of $30,000 to the said railway company upon certain terms and conditions.\nI find the said railway is completed and at present supplied with all necessary rolling stock and materials, so as to connect as arranged with the Canada Southern Railway Company Blenheim, Chatham, Dresden and Wallaceburgh, and is, in my opinion, ready for the conveyance of freight and passengers.\nI also find that the railway company have substantially complied with the terms and conditions regarding work to be performed, required by the said agreement and by-law, except as to the time, as to which I give no certificate as I am not aware of the time limited.\nI further find that the platforms provided for by the said agreement and by-law at the crossing of the Canada Southern Railway, were heretofore completed in accordance with the requirements of the said agreement and by-law, but that afterwards a portion thereof was temporarily removed by the Canada Southern Railway for the purpose of enabling the said company to lay a pipe to a water tank and such portion has not yet been restored.\n(Signed)OBT. McCALLUM, C.E.,\nEngineer appointed by the Hon. theCommissionerof Public Works for Ontario.\nIt seems to have been assumed that the bridge for foot passengers adjoining the railway bridge was not within the reference to the engineer. In my opinion it was entirely within his competence just as much as the railway bridge itself, and the other works specified by the by\u2011law, for I read the words \u201cto the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Public Works or an engineer appointed by him,\u201d as applying (as accord- ing to the grammatical construction it undoubtedly, does) to all that had gone before, and if this is correct it is covered by the certificate which extends to all the work to be performed required by the by-law, but it seems not to have been so considered by the courts below. They, probably for the reason that this foot-bridge was entirely distinct from the railway works and was an independent matter stipulated for by the town for the convenience of the inhabitants, and that the engineer\u2019s concern in inspecting the road for the purpose of ascertaining the company\u2019s right to receive the provincial bonuses would only be with the railway itself and its appurtenant works, considered the foot bridge an extrinsic matter not coming within the engineer\u2019s competence, and therefore dealt with the question of its sufficient completion as one open upon the evidence. The Chief Justice of the Common Pleas had, however, no difficulty in finding that the terms of the by-law and agreement as regards this foot bridge had been sufficiently complied with; indeed he expresses himself in somewhat strong language as to the objections raised by the defendants on this head, for he speaks of them as follows;\u2014\nI am also satisfied that the bridge across the Thames was a substantial compliance with the requirements of the by-law in respect thereto. The approaches were sufficient. The contention of the defendants that the foot bridge should have been continued to Gaol street is not, I think, well founded. Water street if the nearest street to the river and the stairway from the bridge to that street was a sufficient approach, though Water street or a portion of it is sometimes under water, in time of freshet it is a travelled and used highway, and is the street by which the bridge would be ordinarily reached. The contention of the defendants based upon objections to this bridge and the platform at the Southern railway crossing does not appear to me to speak favorably of the business intelligence or honesty of purpose of those who put it forward. It would seem to be an attempt on purely technical grounds to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s claim and to deprive them of the aid which the defendants agreed to give them, although by the recital in the agreement it is expressly stated that without such aid the road could not be completed.\nIn the Court of Appeal the Chief Justice, referring to this point, says:\nI think he (the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas) has taken the right view as to the bridge and the four foot way and the company was not bound to connect the bridge on each side with the high ground at some distance from the river.\nAnd the other members of the Court of Appeal seem to acquiesce in this for they say nothing as to it. Even if I had differed very seriously from their findings considered as inferences drawn from the evidence I should not have deemed it proper to interfere with them, for sitting here in a court exercising appellate jurisdiction in the second degree, the authority of the Privy Council in the case of Allen v. The Quebec Warehouse Co.[56] would have seemed to me to preclude the propriety of any such interference on a question of fact on which two courts below had been thus unanimous, in a finding not shown to have been grossly erroneous. But I need not rest the decision on that ground, for the reason assigned by the learned Chief Justice in the passage I have quoted from his judgment entirely commends itself to my judgment, as it will I think to that of every person who considers the evidence. To say that the railway company were bound to carry out the approaches to the bridge to the elevated ground beyond the street traversing the flats immediately adjoining the river would have been to require them to do more than they had covenanted to do, and more than the by-law imposed upon them, for the by-law and agreement only call \u201cfor a bridge over the Thames,\u201d and this they have constructed. What the town now insists upon is a bridge not merely over or across the river, but over and across the adjoining flats also. Such an enlargement of the obligation of the railway company by mere implication is wholly inadmissible, and therefore I agree with the courts below on this ground also.\nThe sufficiency and propriety of the engineer\u2019s certificate has been impugned by the defendants upon the ground of want of impartiality. It is alleged that he did not give the defendants notice of his inspection, and that when he went along the line for the purpose of the examination he was accompanied by the company\u2019s engineer. In the first place, this objection is founded on a misconception of the engineer\u2019s duties; he was not an arbitrator or a referee to report either after hearing parties or witnesses, but simply an expert to make an ocular inspection and report on what he saw and not on what he heard; it was his duty to inspect and examine with his own eyes the whole of the line, no matter who accompanied him, and it is to be presumed he performed this duty properly; moreover, he swears he did so.\nIt is sufficient then to say of this point that it entirely fails on the evidence and that such was the judgment of both the judge at the trial and the Court of Appeal. The Chief Justice of the latter court speaking of the certificate of the engineer and the defendant\u2019s impeachment of his conduct says,\nOn the best consideration I can give to the point, I think the certificate of the engineer of the substantial completion of the works set out in the by-law sufficiently showed a performance by the company to satisfy its requirements coupled with the actual running of the road for the week. This latter requirement the learned Chief Justice finds to have been complied with, I do not think the defendants have succeeded in impeaching the certificate of the engineer and that the defence, as to that ground, fails.\nTherefore all the conditions of the by-law having been expressly found by both courts to have been complied with and the opinion being general in con-. formity with the view of the Chief Justice of Appeal who says: \u201cThe covenants in the agreements appear to me to be independent and not dependent covenants,\u201d I should have thought it ought to have followed, that the judgment of the Common Pleas Division should have been affirmed without qualification or alteration so far as it related to the original action, that is to say, that the first paragraph of that judgment declaring the plaintiff\u2019s absolute right to the immediate delivery of the debentures and ordering accordingly, and also the second paragraph awarding a writ of mandamus (by which, I, of course understand a mandamus by way of private remedy and not the prerogative writ to be intended) should have stood affirmed and the plaintiffs should have been left free to enforce the judgment to that extent, whatever may have been the opinion of the court as to the propriety of the disposition which the judgment made of the counter-claim. This, however, was not the opinion of the Court of Appeal, for, instead of permitting the original judgment to remain intact, as far as it directed an immediate and absolute delivery of the debentures, it varied the judgment as regards the counter-claim, which by the original judgment had been dismissed, by declaring and ordering that the defendants were entitled to relief by way both of damages and specific performance as regards so much of it as related to the Colborne and William street station, but dismissing it as to the other matters of counter-claim, and the court then proceeded to direct that the order for the mandamus should not be enforced until after the report of the master on a reference as to damages should have been made, and any damages found to be due should be paid, unless the plaintiffs should in the meantime give security to pay the damages or allow them to be deducted out of the debentures. The first observation which it occurs to me to make upon this head, is that this variation of the judgment by withholding the debentures until payment of the unliquidated damages, which it was referred to the master to assess, was hardly consistent with the strongly and clearly expressed opinion of the Chief Justice in the passage already quoted from his judgment, that the covenants in the agreement and the provisions in the by-law were entirely independent. If they were so independent, surely to withhold the debentures in this way was to take from the plaintiffs the benefit of such an independence, and to give relief on the footing of dependent covenants, in other words, modifying by the judgment what according to the unanimous judgment of the court was the clear construction and meaning of the contract contained in the two instruments, the by-law and agreement. It was clearly not a case for set oft. There could be nothing of that kind between the two rights of the plaintiffs to the debentures and of the defendant to recover some unliquidated damages in respect of a breach of covenant contained in the agreement of the 3rd November, 1882. I know of no principle either legal or equitable upon which this charging of the prospective damages upon the debentures (for that is what the order of the Court of Appeal really effects) can be supported. No authority has been cited to us either at the bar or in the factum for such a form of judgment or decree and for the reason that it alters the rights of the parties as fixed by contract, I think it cannot be maintained; and I say this irrespective of the proper mode of dealing with the counter-claim, a matter yet to be considered.\nAs I have said the late Chief Justice of the Common Pleas dismissed the counter-claim, because he thought it could not be conveniently dealt with in conjunction with the principal action. Although, on a matter of procedure, with which that learned judge was, of course, much more familiar than I can pretend to be, I should be very unwilling to differ from him, I must say that I have searched in vain for any authority for showing an instance of a counter-claim having been so dealt with at the trial after the evidence had all been taken, and save in very exceptional cases I should think on general principles such a proceeding was to say the least fraught with much danger. Provision is certainly made for striking out a counter-claim which is considered embarrassing in the earlier stages of the action, but the rule does not, (in terms at all events), apply to the trial. Assuming, however, that there was the jurisdiction to strike it out, I agree with the Court of Appeal that the present case was not a proper one for the exercise of such a power. The evidence was all before the court and it was desirable in the interests of all the parties that the question should be at once disposed of, and I incline to think it was just as much the strict right of the defendants at the stage which the action had reached, to have it finally disposed of, as it is the right of a plaintiff in an action to insist upon the trial and adjudication of his cause. This appears to have been the view of the Court of Appeal. The Chief Justice says:\u2014\nWe can either leave the decree as framed by the learned Chief Justice, or direct a reference on the counter-claim to ascertain the defendant\u2019s amount of damages. I do not see that much will be saved. But, on the whole, I think my learned brother should have decided by reference or otherwise the causes of action in the counter claim which he held established. I do not care generally to interfere with the exercise of a judge\u2019s discretion in such matters, Higgins v. Tweed)[57] but there are reasons, I think, in the case before us, requiring the disposal of the claim of the defendants in the pending suit. I am of opinion that this was a proper disposition of so much of the appeal as related to the judgment dismissing the counter-claim.\nI cannot, however, bring myself into accord with the Court of Appeal, as regards the proper judgment to be pronounced upon the counter-claim. It should here be stated that the Chief Justice at the trial and also the Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal deal with this counter\u2011claim, which sets up a variety of heads on which the defendants seek relief, as confined to the single question of the Chatham station, at or near the corner of Colborne and William streets. All the rest, including that portion of it which complains of a breach of the agreement to erect workshops at Chatham, was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, following in this respect the judgment appealed from which dismissed the counter-claim absolutely as to all matters but this station and the right to continue the double track on Colborne street, as to which latter heads the original dismissal was without prejudice though this proviso was applied to other matters by the Court of Appeal. Now, for this dismissal of the counter-claim by the original judgment, the Court of Appeal have substituted the following directions:\u2014\n3. And this court doth further declare that the defendants are entitled to a specfic performance of the agreement in the pleadings mentioned as to a station on Colborne street, in the said town of Chatham, as claimed by the defendants in their counter-claim; and doth further order and adjudge that it be referred to a master, to be hereafter named, to ascertain and state the damages (if any) sustained by the defendants up to the date of this judgment in respect of the breach of the said agreement in not keeping open and equipped with all necessary accommodation a freight and passenger station on Colborne street aforesaid, and that as to all other matters referred to in the defendant\u2019s counter-claim, the said counterclaim be and the same is hereby dismissed, without prejudice to any future action or proceedings on the part of the defendants, and that the plaintiffs do pay to the defendants their costs of the said counter claim forthwith after taxation thereof, The facts as regards this Colborne and William street station are, if I have rightly apprehended the evidence and the judgment of Chief Justice Cameron, that although it is not placed at the corner of Colborne and William streets it is placed sufficiently near that site to come within the words of the agreement which require it to be placed \u201cat or near the corner of Colborne and William streets.\u201d This is so expressly found by Chief Justice Cameron and as; the Chief Justice of Appeal says:\u2014\nI do not see any ground for interference with any of the Chief Justice\u2019s findings of fact either as to the claim or counter-claim;\nand as he afterwards adds:\u2014\nThe learned Chief Justice decided that the company had reasonably complied with the contract in placing the Colborne street station where it now stands;\nI take it for granted that as regards the site of the station the Court of Appeal agree with the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas that it was within the terms of the covenant contained in the agreement of 3rd November, 1882.\nI apprehend, therefore, that the non-performance of the agreement which the Court of Appeal considered proved, and which it was intended to compel the plaintiffs by their judgment to carry into execution may be distributed as follows: first, the non-user of the station including the providing of ticket sellers, station master and proper officers and servants; and secondly, the sufficiency of the accommodations as regards the buildings and station grounds requisite for freight and passenger traffic. It is to be observed that the judgment of the Court of Appeal does not contain any specific directions as to how this contract is to be performed, beyond referring generally to the counter-claim, in fact it does not do more than declare the right to such relief, it being, I suppose, left to the Common Pleas Division to prescribe how this right to specific performance is to be carried out in detail. The words of the order, it will be remarked, are that the defendants are entitled to a specific performance (on this head) as claimed by them in their counter-claim Now, turning to the pleadings, we see that these are very large and comprehensive terms, for the counterclaim asks relief in this respect as follows:\u2014\n(c.) That they (plaintiffs) may be ordered to construct and maintain a freight and passenger station with switches, sidings and all other necessary accommodation for the defendants upon lands of or to be purchased by the plaintiffs at or near the corner of Colborne and William streets, and to provide and keep a station master, ticket and baggage officer, and other necessary and ordinary servants of the said company thereat, and to stop all ordinary trains thereat, and not to run such trains past said town without going to, staying at said station for the purpose of taking up and setting down passengers or freight, or both, and that they use and establish such station as the principal and main station for Chatham.\nThe defendants\u2019 right to retain, as part of the judgment under appeal, this direction for specific performance, and their rights generally under the agreement relating to the station in Colborne street, may be conveniently considered in the following order: It is essential in the first place to determine the true construction of the covenant to erect the station contained in the agreement between the town and the railway company of the 3rd November, 1882, and to ascertain what, according to the true interpretation of the language in which that stipulation is expressed, are the rights of the defendants and the obligations of the company, whether they extend to any thing more than the erection of a station with proper accommodations, whether the plaintiffs in order to comply with its terms are bound to keep the station open, maintain a staff of officers, and run trains as insisted upon by the defendants in their counter-claim, or whether having erected a station with all necessary and proper accommodation in the way of buildings and yard room, they are at liberty to use it or not at their own discretion. Next, it is important to inquire how far the contract construed according to its proper legal signification, has been performed and in what respects, if any, it still remains unperformed; and lastly, should it appear that this covenant has not, according to its proper legal construction, been in all respects performed, what relief the defendants are entitled to in respect of such nonperformance, whether they can maintain the judgment directing specific performance, as well as a reference to ascertain damages, or whether they should be restricted to damages.\nFirst, then, as to the proper meaning and construction of the covenant. The clause of the agreement of the 3rd November, 1882, which embodies the terms agreed to respecting the station, is as follows:\nAnd to construct at or near the corner of Colborne and William streets, in the said town, a freight and passenger station with all necessary accommodation, connected by switches, sidings or otherwise with said road of the company, upon the council of said town, within three months from the final passing of said by-law, passing another by-law empowering the said company to make its roads and lay its rails along a highway or highways in the said town to said corner, from where the said road would be if the construction thereof were completed in a direct line through the said town, or upon the said council procuring for and giving to said company a right of way along the northerly side of McGregor\u2019s Creek (one half in the water) for the road of said company to or near said corner and to load from gravel piles, pits or beds purchased by said corporation adjacent to or adjoining the track of said company and carry gravel over said road to any place required by the said town for the construction, maintenance and repair of public roads in said town and for other purposes of the town for a sum and at a rate for loading and carriage not to exceed three cents per cubic yard of gravel per mile, for all distances less than ten miles and two cents per mile for all distances of ten miles and over but under twenty-five miles, and one-and-a-half cents per mile for all distances of and over twenty-five miles. Does then a covenant to construct a freight and passenger station, at or near a specified site, with all necessary accommodation, involve a liability, on the part of the railway company so covenanting, to run its trains to the proposed station? If the question was not concluded by authority I should with great deference to the learned judges of the Court of Appeal have thought there could as a matter of construction, according to the plain and ordinary meaning of language, be little difficulty in answering it in the negative. The obligation undertaken by the company being \u201cto construct\u201d and no liability beyond that being in terms imposed upon them, if this obligation is to be enlarged beyond the literal meaning of the words used, it can only be by incorporating some wider undertaking by implication\u2014but what warrant either on principle or authority is there for thus supplying terms by implication in such a case. In what respect does it differ from reforming and remodelling the contract, which is, of course, no part of the duty of a court called on to construe it, thus to speculate on what the intention must have been and to arrive at a conclusion by balancing the utility of the literal construction against that contended for by those who seek to enlarge it? Surely such a mode of dealing with a contract is something more than interpreting the mere words in which the parties have expressed themselves, which we are told by the best authorities ought to be the limit which should bound the jurisdiction of a court of construction. The sound policy of holding parties fairly to the meaning of the language they have used, unless they are able to show fraud or error, considerations which, of course, are altogether out of place here, is, I think, obvious, when it is considered that if the courts were once to admit a mode of interpretation which should permit the addition of terms by showing that without them the contract literally construed would be of little use, the greatest uncertainty would be introduced into transactions, and legal interpretation would soon degenerate into conjecture. I maintain, therefore, that when a railway company covenants to erect a station it is bound to build the station, but not to do more. It may well be that the defendants might reasonably have considered it improbable that the railway company would require more than one station at Chatham, and that they would therefore, if compelled to erect this one on the corner of Colborne and William streets, not incur the expenditure of another but content themselves with this, as their only station at Chatham and use it accordingly. But if they speculated on these probabilities, and trusted to the railway company acting in accordance with what it then appeared would be to their interest, that does not constitute any ground for enlarging the words by construction and giving the defendants the benefit of what they never stipulated for. The case, however, is really concluded by that of Wilson v. Northampton & Banbury Junction By. Co.[58], for with great deference I cannot see the distinction between that case and the present which the learned Chief Justice of Ontario seems to recognise. In the case cited the covenant was \u201cto erect, fit up and construct the station, &c.,\u201d and it was distinctly held that no stipulations as to the use of the station were to be implied from such a covenant. The language of the covenant there, it will be observed, is almost identical with that now under consideration. The words \u201call necessary accommodation\u201d cannot possibly enlarge the scope to the extent contended for as warranting the implication of something not expressed, namely, a covenant to use and run trains to the station, and if these words make no difference the cases are identical. I am of opinion that the interpretation of this covenant contended for by the defendants is inadmissible, and that at the utmost it only bound the railway company to build and erect a station with the necessary buildings and yard room for passenger and freight traffic. Further, that as the company were not bound to run trains to or to make any other use of the station, they are not bound to maintain a staff of officers or servants there.\nNext such being, in my opinion, the proper meaning of the company\u2019s stipulations the question remains whether construed in this sense, it has been sufficiently performed. The learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in the written opinion with which he accompanied his formal judgment seems to say that in his view the company had failed of performance in two respects, one being that they did not keep a proper staff of officers and servants at the station, viz., station master, ticket agent, freight agent, &c. In the view I take, these are not omissions of any agreement binding on the company, for, as already pointed out, they were not in terms bound to provide such officers, and their employment could only be as incidental to the use of the station, and I hold they were under no obligation to run trains or make any other use of it. But the Chief Justice also considered that proper accommodation had not been provided for loading and unloading freight. The learned judges own words are as follows:\u2014\nI am of opinion on the evidence that the station accommodation on Colborne street is not sufficient to answer the requirements of the plaintiffs\u2019 covenants, that that station has not been kept open in the usual manner in which stations are kept open for the convenience of the public, and that there should be kept there a person to sell tickets and check baggage at reasonable times before the arrival and departure of trains. So far I am unable to agree with the learned judge for the reasons already given, but he proceeds:\u2014\nThere is no present accommodation for loading or unloading of freight within the yard or grounds of the company and the use of the street for that purpose is an unauthorized use.\nI think the words \u201call necessary accommodation\u201d do require that in addition to suitable buildings to serve as passenger and freight stations and sheds appropriate station grounds and yards should be provided such as would be reasonably sufficient for all the purposes of freight and passenger traffic if the station were in constant and regular use. These, however, have not, according to the Chief Justice, been provided by the company. The Chief Justice having dismissed the counter-claim, his opinion in this respect is not to to be received as a formal finding, but from the evidence I think it may be gathered that his opinion in this respect, though not formally obligatory upon the parties, may well be adopted as a proper inference from the evidence.\nThen what should be the relief in respect of this default of performance by the railway company to provide suitable station grounds? The case of Wilson v. Northampton Ry. Co.[59] is here again in point, for it shows that the appropriate relief in such a case is not specific performance, but damages. What use would it be to any one to compel the railway company to buy land and acquire station grounds which they could not afterwards be compelled to make use of? It is manifest therefore that just as in Wilson v. Northampton Ry. Co.[60] a remedy in damages will be more likely to do justice than a decree or judgment for specific performance. All the arguments which Lord Selborne in that case uses in pronouncing for a reference to assess damages in preference to a decree for specific performance apply with at least equal force in the present case, and I have therefore no hesitation in following that decision.\nIn my opinion, the order of the Court of Appeal should be discharged and the judgment of the Common Pleas Division should be varied by striking out the third paragraph and in lieu thereof substituting a declaration of the proper construction of the covenant contained in the indenture of the 3rd November, 1882, respecting the Colborne Street Station in accordance with the opinion regarding the construction before expressed, followed by a direction that it be referred to a master to ascertain what damages had been sustained by the defendants by reason of proper accommodation for the loading and unloading of \u201cfreight,\u201d not having been provided by the railway company, and directing the master in making such enquiry to have regard to the declarations to be inserted in the judgment respecting the construction of the stipulation in question as before indicated, and by which declaration it will of course be made to appear that the defendants are not entitled to compel the plaintiffs to run trains to the station or to keep up a staff of servants and officers there. Subject to the foregoing directions the counterclaim should be absolutely dismissed.\nAs to costs, the plaintiffs should recover the costs of the original action up to the first judgment. There should be no costs of the counter claim, for whilst to some extent the defendants succeed on it, they also to a great extent fail. There should be no costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal as that was rendered necessary by the error in dealing with the counter claim by the judge of first instance. The appellants should recover their costs in this court. The subsequent costs which will be involved in the reference as to damages should be reserved until after the report. FOURNIER J. concurred in the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nHENRY J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Strong with certain differences. I do not think the evidence sufficient to justify a reference, but the counter claim should be dismissed with a reservation to the defendants of their rights.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Upon the facts appearing in evidence I am of opinion that the by-law\u2014the agreement of the railway company with the corporation of the town of Chatham, of the date of the 3rd November, 1882, and the agreement between the railway company and the plaintiff, Bickford, which now bears date the 4th December, 1882, must be all read together for the purpose of determining the true agreement, the fulfilment of the terms of which constituted conditions precedent to the accruing of the right of the railway Co. to receive the debentures of the town of Chatham, authorized by the by-law.\nIt is said that the by-law and the agreement of the 3rd November, 1882, must be read as wholly independent instruments, having no connection with each other, upon the ground that, as is contended, the contract in the by-law is made between wholly different parties from the parties to the agreement of November, 1882, the ratepayers of the municipality being, as is contended, the parties to the by-law, and the municipality in its corporate capacity the parties with whom the agreement of November, 1882, is entered into. But there is no foundation for this contention for although the approval of the by-law by a majority of the ratepayers voting thereon must be obtained before the by-law can have any validity yet the by-law itself is an act of the corporation. It can only become a by-law by the assent of the council of the municipality. It must have the assent of the council before it can be submitted to the ratepayers, it must be first read in the council, and approved by the council to be submitted to the ratepayers and after being approved by the ratepayers it must be read a third time and passed by the council before it becomes a by-law. The corporation of the municipality is therefore the party with whom the contracts in both instruments were entered into. The agreement of November, 1882, recites that it was entered into for the express purpose of obtaining upon the faith of it the assent of the council of the municipality to the introduction of the by-law and to submitting it to the ratepayers and eventually passing it if approved by a majority of ratepayers voting upon it, and, moreover, the evidence shows that this agreement was used as a special lever by which the assent of the ratepayers to the by-law was obtained. It is, however, the council of the corporation which passes the by-law. Both instruments are entered into with the corporation and the one is expressly based upon the other, so that both must, in my opinion, be construed together as forming one complete agreement.\nThe agreement between the railway company and Bickford notwithstanding that it now bears date the 4th December, 1882, was, in truth the foundation upon which the agreement of the 3rd November, 1882, and the by-law rest. The object of passing the by-law in fact appears to have been to give effect to this agreement between the railway company and Bickford. The evidence shews that both this agreement and that of the 3rd November, 1882, were printed and distributed among the ratepayers before the by-law was submitted, and that at a public meeting or public meetings, held in the town for the purpose of inducing the ratepayers to vote for this by-law Mr. Bickford, as indeed he himself admits, assured them that if the bonds should be carried he would perform everything in his agreement with the company (which was then executed conditionally) and in the agreement of the 3rd of November, 1882, and in the by-law. There can, I think, be no doubt that as this was done for the express purpose of influencing the ratepayers in approving the by-law, their approving it is fairly attributable to the matters contained in the agreement, the fulfilment of which was so assured. The by-law referred to in the agreement of the 3rd November was submitted for the consideration of the ratepayers on the 22nd November, 1882, and the day appointed for voting thereon was the 21st December, 1882. A public meeting at which it is established that Mr. Bickford gave the above assurance was held on the 27th November. His agreement with the company which he admits was then already made conditionally was not, it appears, executed under the seal of the company and of Mr. Bickford until the 4th December, of which day it now bears date just seventeen days before the voting on the by-law.\nBy this agreement, after reciting among other things, that the said Bickford had agreed to commence the completion of the said road, (namely a railway which commenced at Rondeau Harbor in the county of Kent, and running from thence to the village of Blenheim, thence to the town of Chatham, thence to the village of Dresden, with a branch to the village of Wallaceburgh) so soon as the municipalities of Chatham, Blenheim, Dresden and Wallaceburg have voted additional aid to the company to the amount of seventy thousand dollars, and upon the understanding that the company should at the time thereinafter mentioned issue and allot to the said Bickford one thousand fully paid up shares of the capital stock of the said company being to the amount of one hundred thousand dollars, and that the said company should agree not to issue any stock beyond the amount then standing in the names of shareholders (but not including that held by Solomon M. Knapp,) and the amount to be issued to the said Bickford as aforesaid without the consent in writing of the said Bickford, and should further agree to hand over to the said Bickford when the same should be received by them, the moneys derived from the government and municipal bonuses or aid, or to authorize the said Bickford to receive the same when payable to the company, and also to deliver first mortgage bonds of the said company to the amount of ten thousand dollars per mile at the time and in the manner thereafter mentioned, the said Bickford covenanted with the company subject to the aforesaid provisions as to the granting of municipal aid and subject to the legislature extending the time as therein provided, that for the consideration therein mentioned he would (among other things) well and truly and in good workmanlike manner, build, construct and finish that portion of the Erie and Huron Railway, commencing at Rondeau and from thence to or near the village of Blenheim, thence via the town of Chatham to or in the village of Dresden, with a branch to the village of Wallaceburg, according to plans and profiles of location already prepared and registered to be one continuous road or line, and that he will furnish and provide such right of way for the said railway in width 50 feet as has not already been purchased, and will also provide the requisite station grounds on said railway at Rondeau, Blenheim, Southern Railway crossing, Chatham, Dresden, Wallaceburg and such intermediate stations as are requisite for the proper working of the said railway as the traffic may demand. And will also build a strong and substantial pier of timber work or masonry for the bridge crossing the river at Chatham, with all suitable approaches on each side of the river for railway crossing (to include a footway along one side thereof of not less than four feet in width) the (bridge to be of iron, steel or wood with all necessary wrought iron stays and braces, &c., &c., and will also build suitable stations at each of the said towns and villages and intermediate places as may be necessary for the traffic of the said railway, with platforms and water closets suitably painted. Also, will build one engine stable and all requisite conveniences for water at Chatham and the company\u2019s workshops suitable to its requirements at the same place; also will build two turn-tables and grade over all sidings of stations and station grounds, and will build and fully complete the said road in a good and workmanlike manner, and erect stations equal to those of the Credit Valley railway. The agreement then after the insertion of claims providing for the consideration to be paid by the company, proceeds as follows:\u2014\nIt is also understood and agreed that notwithstanding anything herein mentioned, the said Bickford shall not be bound to commence the building of the said road or the purchase of the right of way or do anything in connection with this contract unless nor until the additional aid to the amount of $70,000 is granted by the town of Chatham and Dresden and the villages of Blenheim and Wallaceburgh, nor unless the said company shall procure an extension of time until the 1st day of March, 1884, for the completion of that portion of the said road between Rondeau and Dresden, including the Wallaceburgh branch.\nIt is further provided and agreed that it shall be a condition precedent to the said Bickford entering on and completing the said contract that the corporation of the town of Chatham grant the right of way down McGregor street, in said town, and it is hereby agreed that the station and proper buildings shall be erected at the inter- section of the railway with King street in the town of Chatham; provided always that if the corporation of the said town of Chatham desire that said station shall be further up in said town, the station will be so placed if the right to lay the track up Colborne street be granted to the company.\nNow, from this agreement it is obvious that but one station in the town of Chatham which should be suitable for all the requirements of traffic in the town was in the contemplation of the parties to this agreement. The company bargained for and Bickford contracted to provide but one station for the town of Chatham, and it was agreed that such station should be equal to the stations on the Credit Valley railway, and that the sidings of the station grounds, and the stations should be graded, and that Bickford should provide the necessary station grounds, and that such station should be erected at the intersection of the railway with King street only in the event of the corporation of the town not desiring that the said station should be further up in the said town and not granting to the company the right to lay their track up Colborne street; but in the event of the corporation of the town requiring the station to be further up in the town than at the intersection of the railway with King street and of their granting to the company the right to lay their track up Colborne street, then their station for the town of Chatham suitable for all the requirements of the traffic at the town should be placed where the corporation of the town should require it to be placed.\n[His Lordship then read the recitals and conditions of the agreement between the railway company and the town, the material portions of which are set out on page 238.]\nThe agreement as to the station being at or near the corner of Colborne and William street is not mentioned in the by-law, as, indeed, it could not be for the reason pointed out by Mr. Justice Patterson in the Court of Appeal for Ontario, namely, that it rested with the corporation of the town, whether or not they should require the station to be located there, and in case they should, that they had three months after the passing of the by-law within which to pass the necessary by-law granting to the company the right to lay their track up Colborne street for the purpose. But although not in the by-law, it was by the agreement, upon the faith of which the by-law was passed, made an express condition that in case the corporation of the town should grant to the company such right to lay their track up Colborne street, the station should be located there, and by that agreement upon the faith of which the by-law was passed, the location of the station there, in the event aforesaid, became in my opinion as much a condition precedent to the accruing of the company\u2019s right to receive the debentures as if it had been inserted in the by-law.\nIt would, in my opinion, be monstrous if the fulfilment of a covenant entered into for the express purpose of procuring the by-law to be passed should not, on the purpose being obtained, be held to be a condition precedent to the accrual of a right to receive debentures authorized by a by-law which was passed only on the faith of the due fulfilment of the covenant. To say that although the covenant has been broken the corporation of the town has no remedy, but by an action to recover such damages as they may be able to prove that the corporation has sustained would be a mere mockery of justice; for, in such case, such an action could not possibly afford any adequate remedy. All the judges of the courts below are of opinion that the covenant has been broken. The corporation were then entitled to the fulfilment of it, and if entitled to the fulfilment of it, the erection of the station with all necessary conveniences, &c., being a part of the work necessary to the completion of the work, it was necessary that it should have been executed within the time specified for the completion of the road with stations, freight houses, and other necessary accommodation attached and connected therewith before the company became entitled to the debentures. The agreement of the 3rd of November entitled the corporation of the town of Chatham to the station at or near the corner of Colborne and William street conditional upon their granting the right to the company to lay their track upon Colborne street. The corporation did grant to the railway company this right and thereupon became entitled to have the station with all necessary conveniences constructed there, notwithstanding any difficulty or expense there might be attending its being located there. The agreement between the company and Mr. Bickford, of the fulfilment of which the corporation and the ratepayers were assured in order to induce them to pass the by-law, shows what kind of a station was contemplated by the agreement of the 3rd November, between the company and the town, namely, that it was to be the one station to be provided for the town, and that it should be sufficient for the requirements of all the traffic at the town, and that it should be equal to the stations on the Credit Valley Railway. There was no uncertainty whatever as to the character of the station, and the necessary conveniences attached and connected therewith which were to be supplied in order to the due fulfilment of the company\u2019s covenant. The provision as to the certificate of the Government Engineer has no relation to this part of the agreement: that related to the completion of the road in all other respects than those special- ly provided for between the company and the town, and plainly related to a completion of the whole line to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Public Works or as to be capable of being opened for traffic, and to entitle the company to the government subsidy. Now the company in fulfilment of the agreement as to procuring an extension of time for completing the work which Mr. Bickford had in his agreement with the company, made a condition precedent to his undertaking the work, procured an act of the Legislature of Ontario to be passed in the month of February, 1883, granting the required extension of time, 46 Vic., ch. 52.\nThere is a clause in that act which appears to me to have a material bearing upon the circumstance that the whole of the agreement between the company and the town upon the faith of which the by-law was procured to be passed, namely, that part relating to the location of the Chatham station was not inserted in the by-law. I am unable to understand for what purpose the clause could have been inserted unless with intent to have the bearing I have alluded to.\nThe 2nd clause of the act enacts that the several agreements entered into between the said company and the different municipalities passing by-laws granting aid by way of bonus to said company before the passing of such by-laws in consideration or in consequence of which agreements the said by-laws were voted upon or passed and the agreement between the said company and Edward Oscar Bickford for the construction of the said railway are hereby declared to be valid and binding upon all parties thereto from the time of execution thereof.\nIt cannot have been supposed that there was any occasion to pass an act to make valid, agreements between parties competent to enter into the agreements referred to, and it is not suggested that there was anything illegal or ultra vires in the agreements referred to, which rendered necessary legislative interference to make them valid.\nThe clause, however, declares all agreements between the company and municipalities for granting bonuses in consideration of which or in consequence of which by-laws granting such bonuses have been. passed and voted upon and the agreement between the company and Bickford to be valid and binding on all parties thereto.\nNow as it is clear from the evidence that the by-laws of the town of Chatham granting the bonus in question here was submitted to the ratepayers and voted upon and passed by the corporation upon the faith of the agreements of the 3rd November, 1882, and upon the assurance of the plaintiff Bickford that all its provisions as well as all the provisions of his agreement with the railway company should be faithfully fulfilled in every particular if the bonuses should be granted, I think that this clause was inserted for the purpose of assuring municipalities who had passed by-laws upon the faith of such agreements that they should have the same protection as if the provisions of these agreements were inserted in the by\u2011laws.\nHowever that such a clause was at all necessary for such a purpose, I am by no means prepared to admit, for I am of opinion that it is the duty of a court required to administer justice according to equity and good conscience to give effect to all agreements, verbal or written, upon the faith of which the by-law under consideration here was procured to be passed, and but for which it never would have been passed as I think is the true conclusion to draw from the evidence. It is, in fact, the common equity arising out of the fact that the whole agreement is not to be found in one instrument, but in several, or the case of an agreement induced to be entered into by the assurances and promises of the party claiming the benefit of the agreement, which assurances and promises, if not fulfilled, would operate as a designed fraud upon the other party. So thinking, I am of opinion, that the covenant of the railway company as to the station in the town of Chatham at or near the corner of Colborne and William streets has been clearly broken, and that the fulfilment of it was a condition precedent to the accrual of the right of the company, or Mr. Bickford to receive the debentures sued for, and that this condition not having been fulfilled within the time specified for \u201cthe completion of the road with stations and freight houses and other necessary accommodation attached and connected therewith,\u201d all claim upon the town corporation for the debentures is gone.\nI am of opinion, also, that a foot way along side of the bridge over the river Thames has not been supplied within the meaning of the covenant in that behalf. The cutting it short before reaching the high bank of the river and dropping down by steps to flats, which every spring and autumn are covered by the waters of the river is not, in my opinion, a fulfilment of the covenant in respect of a foot way for passengers requiring to cross the river by the bridge. That foot way should, in my opinion, have been made, as is provided in the agreement between the company and Bickford, along the necessary approaches to the bridge as well as along side of the bridge proper.\nOur judgment, in my opinion, should be to dismiss the appeal of the plaintiff with costs, and to allow the cross appeal of the defendants with costs and to order the claim of the plaintiffs in the court below to be dismissed with costs.\nOwing to the difference in opinion among their Lordships the appeal and cross-appeal were dismissed without costs[61].\nSolicitors for appellants: Blake, Lash, Cassels & Holman.\nSolicitors for respondent: Robinson, Wilson, Rankin, & McKeough.\n[1] 14 Ont.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nMarine insurance\u2014Exceptions in policy\u2014Barratry\u2014Proximiate cause of loss\u2014Perils of the seas.\nInsurance in a marine policy against loss \"by perils of the seas\" does not cover a loss by barratry.\nIt is not necessary that barratry should be expressly excepted in a marine policy to relieve the insurers from liability for such a loss.\nPer Strong J. dissenting.\u2014If the proximate cause of the loss is a peril of the seas covered by the policy the underwriter is liable though the primary cause may have been a barratrous act.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] sustaining a verdict on the trial for the defendant.\nThis was an action on a marine policy brought by the mortgagee of the vessel insured. The defence was that the vessel was wilfully sunk and destroyed by the master, and the evidence on the trial showed that holes had been bored in the vessel by the master's directions which caused her to sink. There was no exception in the policy of loss from barratry, nor was barratry expressly insured against, and the only question raised on the appeal was whether the plaintiff could recover as on a loss by the perils of the seas under the ordinary clause in a marine policy. The judgment in the court below, both on the trial and on appeal, was in favor of the company.\nMac Master Q.C. and W. B. Ross for the appellant (The court intimated that they were concluded by the findings in the court below as to the facts, and the counsel did not press the contention set out in the factum that there was no barratry in point of fact.)\nAs to whether or not barratry avoids a policy when there is no express exemption see Hamilton v. Pandorf[2]; Earle v. Rowcroft[3].\nBarratry was not the proximate cause of the loss. Hamilton v. Pandorf[4].\nThe insured being a mortgagee is in a different position from that of an owner. Merchants Shipping Act R. S. C. ch. 72 s. 36.\nMacCoy Q.C. for the respondents. If barratry is not expressly insured against it will relieve the insurers, Cory v. Burr[5]; Waters v. Merchants Louisville Ins. Co.[6]; Parkhurst v. Gloucester Ins, Co.[7].\nAs to barratry being the proximate cause, see Cory v. Burr (4); Arnold on Marine Insurance[8].\nThe insured being a mortgagee can only recover for a total loss and mere submersion is not such a loss.\nAnd see Aspinall's Rep. of Mar. Cas.[9].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The court found barratry committed and, in my opinion, could not find otherwise. Barratry is a peril specially insured against by express words and which was not specially insured against in this case. Mr. Parke, speaking upon insurance upon a ship in any lawful trade says: \"If the captain commits barratry by smuggling the underwriters are answerable, othewise the word barratry should be struck out of the policy.\"\nThis, in my opinion, was not a loss by perils of the sea, but by barratry. The loss, in my opinion, cannot be separated from the barratrous act which was not insured against. Therefore, I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014With much regret, though I cannot say with any doubt, I am compelled to differ not only from the court appealed from, but also from the majority of this court, for I am of opinion that the appeal ought to be allowed. As regards two of the grounds of appeal I am with the respondents. I agree that the evidence, so far as the purposes of the present appeal are concerned, is so strong that the findings of Mr. Justice Smith as to the facts cannot on any recognized principle applicable to the exercise of appellate jurisdiction be now disturbed. I am further of opinion that on authorities which it would be a mere parade of citation to quote the policy sued upon does not cover losses by barratry of the master and crew.\nOn a third ground, however, very distinctly taken in the appellant's factum, I am compelled to differ as well from the learned judges in Nova Scotia as from the Chief Justice and my brethren in this court.\nThe learned judge who tried the case found that the vessel was not lost by any of the perils assured against, but was scuttled by direction of the master. This is in substance the effect of the judgment on the 4th, 12th, 13th and 16th paragraphs of the statement or defence as finally entered by the Supreme Court. I am of opinion that this judgment was erroneous; that on the facts in evidence the loss of the vessel was undoubtedly caused by perils insured against.\nPerils of the seas are within the express terms of the policy, and the appellant insists that the proximate cause of the loss being certain leaks which caused the vessel to founder and sink, the proximate causes of the loss were perils of the seas. It seems to me that whatever may have been the state of the case formerly this identical question is concluded by very high and very recent authority in favor of the appellant. The cases I refer to are those cited by the appellant of Hamilton, Fraser & Co. v. Pandorf & Co. and Wilson & Co. v. Owners of Cargo ex Xantho[10], both decided by the House of Lords on the 14th of July, 1887. By these cases it was decided in the first place that the words \"dangers and accidents of the seas,\" and of course the equivalent expression \"perils of the seas,\" were to receive the same construction, whether used in defining the risks covered by the policy in a contract of marine insurance, or used for the purpose of describing excepted perils in favor of the shipowner in a charter party or a bill of lading. Next it was decided, virtually in both cases but certainly in the case of Hamilton v. Pandorf [11] that when a court is called upon to determine whether a loss has arisen from a \"peril of the sea\" it is to regard, not the remote or originating but only the proximate and immediate cause of the loss. Thus, in the case of Hamilton v. Pandorf (1) it was held that though damage caused to a cargo by rats was not a peril within an exception in favor of the shipowner of dangers and accidents of the seas, yet that when rats had caused a leak the damage thence arising from sea water was within the exception. And in the other case of Wilson v. Owners of Cargo per Xantho (2), it was in like manner held that though a collision was not per se within a similar exception to that before mentioned yet when the collision caused the vessel to founder the loss so occasioned was within the exemption in favor of the shipowner. It follows from these cases, and especially from many passages in the judgments in both of them, that the learned lords who decided them intended that their decisions should apply to policies of insurance, in determining what losses came within the words \"perils of the seas.\" Indeed, in the case of Wilson v. The Cargo, &c.,[12] in the concluding paragraph of Lord Macnaghten's judgment he says this in so many words. It follows that when there is a loss, as in the present case, proximately and immediately resulting from the foundering of the vessel caused by a leak, it is a loss from \"perils of the seas,\" though it may have been barratrously caused by the scuttling of the ship by the master and crew. This, of course, always implies that the assured is free from any complicity in the act of barratry. In such cases it is considered that the immediate cause of damage and loss is the sea, and this is within the contract of the underwriter who has assured against perils caused by the sea.\nThe plaintiff in the present case is a mortgagee, and it is not pleaded or suggested that he was in any way privy to the wilful destruction of the vessel by the master and mariners composing the crew.\nI am of opinion that the appellant is entitled to judgment.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. I think the plaintiff must fail for the reasons given by Mr. Justice McDonald in the court below.\nGWYNNE and PATTERSON JJ. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Otto S.

In trover against the master:\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, Gwynne J. dissenting, that the refusal of the agent after tender of the full freight was a conversion of the cargo for which trover would lie.\nHeld, per Patterson J., that trover would lie, but not against the master who was only the servant of the agent and acting under his directions.\nHeld, also, that an action ex delicto for breach of duty in not delivering the coal according to the bill of lading would not lie.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] affirming a verdict for the plaintiff entered at the trial by consent, with leave to both parties to move.\nThe plaintiff was consignee of a cargo of coal carried in plaintiff's vessel from Cape Breton. The charter party required the master of the vessel to deliver the coal on payment of the specified freight, and the consignee refused to pay the freight before delivery, but offered to pay it ton by ton as the cargo was landed. The customary mode of discharging coal at St. John, N.B., the port of discharge, was by taking it out of the vessel in tubs and loading it into carts in which it was carried away as the consignee should direct.\nThe agent of the owner of the vessel refused to deliver the coal until the full freight was paid, and after some discussion on both sides the coal was landed and \"stored by the agent. When it was all in the warehouse the consignee tendered the full amount of the freight, which was refused unless the costs of storage were also paid. The consignee then brought an action against the master of the vessel, his declaration containing three counts on the bill of lading and a count in trover. The defendant demurred to the former and his demurrer was sustained. On the trial on the trover count a verdict was entered by agreement for the plaintiff for damages assented to, with leave to the plaintiff to move to amend his declaration by adding a count for special damages, and to the defendant to move for a new trial or a verdict. The Supreme Court of New Brunswick affirmed the verdict. The defendant then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada and the plaintiff filed a cross-appeal from the judgment on the demurrer to the declaration.\nWeldon Q.C. for the appellant. The English cases show that the two acts, delivery of the goods and payment of the freight, are concurrent acts, and all that is necessary is that the parties shall be ready and willing to perform their respective acts. Paynter v. James[2]; Kirchner v. Venus[3]; Gilkison v. Middleton[4].\nThe master could not comply with the proposal to pay the freight on each ton as delivered, as he would lose his entire lien by delivering a part of the goods. Neill v. Reed[5]. There was no evidence of conversion, and the plaintiff could not succeed on the count in trover. Jones v. Hough[6]; Milgate v. Kebble[7].\nW. Pugsley and C. A. Palmer for the respondent. There is no right in the vessel to pre-payment of freight. Meyer stein v. Barber[8].\nIn the English cases referred to the goods were out of the vessel and in a position to be delivered as soon as the freight was paid. Paynter v. James[9]. And the American law is precise on the subject. Brittan v. Barnaby[10].\nThe learned counsel also referred to Brown v. Tanner[11].\nEven if the master had a right to retain the goods for his freight he had no lien for the cost of storage. Kerford v. Mondel[12]; Jones v. Tarleton[13].\nThen as to the cross-appeal. By the practice in New Brunswick the form of action in actions ex contract\u00fb and ex delicto is the same[14]. And see Cato v. Irving[15].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J. concurred in dismissing the appeal and affirming the judgment of the court below in every respect.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I see no inconsistency between the charter party and the bill of lading in any respect which is material in the present action. The appellant was bound to deliver the cargo to the holder of the bill of lading at the port of discharge upon such holder paying the freight, and a refusal by the appellant so to deliver upon a tender of the amount due for freight would prim\u00e2 facie be in law a conversion of the property for which the holder of the bill of lading would be entitled to recover damages. It has never been questioned that the title to, and property in, the cargo had vested in the respondent as the indorsee of the bill of lading. Further there never has been any dispute as to the amount properly payable for freight, this being, as is admitted on all hands, $637.10. And it is not disputed that this sum was duly tendered by the respondent to Schofield (in whose charge the appellant had left the cargo when he went away to Digby) and refused by him Schofield claiming in addition to a lien for freight, a lien also for expenses incurred in landing and warehousing the cargo. It is clear upon authority that, in the absence of any statutory provision similar to that which exists in England, authorising the master to land and warehouse the goods and to retain possession for the expenses of so doing, he has no right to a lien, beyond the freight, for the latter charges, though he may be justified in landing the cargo and depositing it in a suitable place, either in the warehouse of the shipowner or in that of a general warehouseman or wharfinger; in either of which cases, however, the master would himself retain the constructive possession and thus be in a position to answer the demand of the holder of the bill of lading[16]. For the charges incidental to such landing and warehousing the master must, however, look to the personal liability of the cargo owner, his right of retention by way of lien being at common law confined strictly to the amount due for freight. The decision of this appeal must therefore depend altogether upon the answer to a single question namely; Was Schofield, whom the appellant placed in charge of the cargo and who also happened to be the managing owner of the vessel, a person for whose acts the appellant was responsible? For if he was there was plainly a conversion for which the respondent was entitled to recover.\nThe appellant, according to well established principles of mercantile law for which it would be a mere parade, serving no useful purpose, to cite authorities, having received the goods in pursuance of a contract, evidenced by the bill of lading which he had signed, had no right to deliver the goods specified in it to any person other than a legal holder of that bill of lading. Then what took place between the appellant and Schofield either amounted to a delivery of the cargo to the latter for purposes inconsistent with the rights of the respondent, or Schofield was merely placed in charge as the custodian of it, the constructive possession remaining vested in the appellant. The appellant in his deposition says in so many words that he \"delivered up\" the cargo to Schofield. If this piece of evidence is literally and strictly construed against the appellant such delivery would of itself have constituted a conversion: the appellant, however, is entitled to a more favorable interpretation of his conduct, and we must therefore regard Schofield as having been placed in possession of the cargo, merely as the agent or caretaker of the appellant who could not lawfully part with the possession of it to any one but the holder of the bill of lading. It follows that the appellant still retained the constructive possession and that he is therefore responsible for the wrongful acts of Schofield, and Schofield having been guilty of a conversion in refusing delivery upon the tender of the freight, the appellant has been rightly held answerable in damages for this wrongful act of his agent. The judgment of the Supreme Court is therefore, in my opinion, in all respects right and should be affirmed with costs.\nThe cross appeal is entirely unfounded. As the declaration was originally framed in contract, it disclosed no cause of action in the respondent, the indorsee of the bill of lading between whom and the appellant there was no privity, and the judgment on demurrer is therefore unimpeachable. The cross appeal must also be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Concurred in affirming the judgment of the court below.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The only question on the principal appeal (of the defendant) is as to the right of the plaintiff to recover upon the count for trover, and I am clearly of opinion that no case whatever of conversion was made out against the defendant. Upon the arrival of the vessel at her destination in St. John, New Brunswick, the vessel and her cargo were delivered over by the master, the above appellant, to Schofield, managing owner of the vessel and with whom the plaintiff had signed a charter party under which the cargo was conveyed to St. John, and thereafter the master never had any control over or possession of the cargo. At the expiration of a week, the cargo not having been taken by the plaintiff and the freight paid (it is unnecessary to refer to what took place between the plaintiff and Schofield in the interim) the managing owner, Schofield, placed the cargo in a storehouse in St. John. Now, the only evidence of conversion offered was of the tender of the freight made by the plaintiff to the managing owner Schofield and a demand upon him for the cargo, and his refusal to deliver it unless the charges attending the storing the cargo should be paid; for this refusal it is sufficient, in my opinion, for the determination of this case to say that the defendant Winchester, who had at that time no control over or possession of the cargo, and to whom the freight was not tendered and upon whom no demand for delivery of the cargo was then made, and who, consequently, did not refuse to deliver what he had not, can not be made responsible. It is idle to say that Schofield, who did make the only refusal of which there was any evidence, and who alone had control over and possession of the cargo, and who, as the person who, as manager and part owner of the vessel, had entered into the charter party with the plaintiff, was acting as the agent of his servant the defendant. The appeal of the defendant must, in my opinion, be allowed, and the cross-appeal of the plaintiff dismissed\u2014both with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The respondent, who is plaintiff in the action, obtained a verdict against the appellant for $1,138.90. The appeal is from the refusal of the court in banc to enter a non-suit, and there is a cross-appeal by the plaintiff from a judgment on demurrer to some counts of his declaration.\nThe defendant was captain of the brigatine Curlew, and was not owner or part owner.\nThe managing owner was Mr. Schofield, of St. John. The plaintiff lives at St. John, and desiring to have a cargo of coal brought from Cape Breton to St. John, he made an agreement with Mr. Schofield, which was set out in a charter party in these words:\u2014\nIt is this day mutually agreed between Mr. S. Schofield, managing owner of the good ship or vessel called the \"Curlew,\" J. R. Winchester master, of the measurement of 330 tons, or thereabouts, now at Sydney, C.B., and Mr. W. L. Busby, of this city, merchant, and charterer, that the said ship being tight, staunch and strong, and every way fitted for the voyage, shall proceed to Little Glace Bay, and there load from charterer or agent a full and complete cargo of coal, under deck, not exceeding what she can reasonably stow or carry over and above her tackle, apparel, provisions and furniture, and being so loaded shall therewith proceed to St. John, n.B., or so near thereto as she may safely get, and deliver the same, on being paid freight, as follows: One dollar and fifteen cents per ton, of 2,240 lbs., mine weight, etc.\nDated 2nd September, 1886.\nIn pursuance of this agreement the Curlew received at Little Glace Bay, C.B., on the 9th of the same month of September, from the Caledonian Coal and Railway Company, a cargo of coal.\nDonald Carmichael is agent at St. John for the Caledonia Company, and is the person mentioned in the bill of lading signed by the defendant, which reads as follows:\u2014\nShipped by the Caledonia Coal and Railway Company for account of D. Carmichael, Esq., in good order, on board the brigantine \"Curlew,\" whereof the undersigned is master for the present voyage, now lying in Glace Bay, C.B., and bound for St. John, N.B. To say:\nFive hundred and fifty-four (554) tons, more or less, of coal from the Caledonia Coal Mine, which I promise to deliver in like good order and condition at the port of St. John, N.B. (the dangers of the seas only excepted) unto D. Carmichael, Esq., or to his assigns, he or they paying freight for the same at the rate of per charter party on the amount so delivered.\nIn witness whereof, the master of the said vessel hath affirmed to four bills of lading, all of this tenor and date, one being accomplished the others to stand void.\nDated at Glace Bay, C.B., this ninth day of September, 1886.\nJ. R. WINCHESTER.\nThe vessel duly arrived with the cargo at St. John, and after her arrival the events happened out of which this action has arisen.\nThe plaintiff, as is not disputed, was owner of the coal and entitled, as between himself and the Caledonia company, to receive it. He had given his note to Mr. Carmichael, \"as usual,\" as that gentleman says, for the cargo, and Carmichael had indorsed the bill of lading to him either on the day the vessel arrived or the day before.\nIt will be worth while to glance at the evidence respecting the date of the arrival of the vessel and the transactions that immediately followed, for there is a little confusion in it. The defendant says he arrived on the 16th of September, and that is borne out by other facts. But he also says that he arrived on Friday, while by the almanac the 16th was Thursday. The discrepancy does not appear to have been detected at the trial, and it is carried into the appellant's factum.\nThe defendant further says he hauled to the wharf on the day of his arrival, which he again calls Friday, and that on Saturday about noon he left for Digby, in Nova Scotia, where he remained four weeks. He must have left on Friday, the day after his arrival, and when (giving his evidence eleven months afterwards) he calls it Saturday, he does so from a lapse of memory, intending to say it was the day after his arrival. He tells us that the bill of lading was not presented to him before he left; that he did not know the plaintiff; and that he does not recollect seeing the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff, on the other hand, says he saw the captain and mate at the vessel on the Saturday morning and spoke to the captain. If the incident occurred, and occurred on Saturday, the plaintiff must have mistaken some one for the captain; but as Saturday was the 18th and as the plaintiff received a letter, which I shall notice, from Mr. Schofield on the afternoon of Friday the 17th, and had also more than one interview with Mr. Schofield's clerk on that afternoon, it is as plain as possible that his recollection is at fault when he says he asked the captain at the vessel on Saturday morning, when on his way to his office, when the vessel would be ready to discharge.\nThe matter deserves attention only in connection with the fact that the defendant took no part, personally, in any of the doings on which the plaintiff founds his action.\nWhether Schofield's sins of commission, if the plaintiff was sinned against, are to be imputed to the defendant, or whether he is chargeable with sins of omission, will have to be considered. When the defendant went to Digby he left the vessel in charge of the managing owner, Mr. Schofield.\nThese are some of his replies to questions put on reexamination by counsel for the plaintiff, by whom the defendant was called as a witness:\u2014\nQ. In whose charge did you leave the vessel? A. Mr. Schofield's.\nQ. There must have been some one on board of the vessel in charge? A. The mate had charge, under Mr. Schofield's direction.\nQ. And you delivered the cargo up to Mr. Schofield, as you have said? A. Yes.\nIt had been arranged between the plaintiff and Mr. Schofield, before the arrival of the vessel and before the bill of lading was indorsed to the plaintiff, that she was to go to Magee's wharf, and not to the next wharf which the plaintiff had leased but which had not sufficient length for the vessel. On Friday the 17th Schofield wrote to the plaintiff a letter which the plaintiff received at 4.30 in the afternoon, stating that the Curlew was then in a discharging berth at Magee's wharf and ready to commence discharging the cargo of coal in accordance with the charter party. Later in the same afternoon, Mr Miller, a clerk of Mr. Schofield's, called on the plaintiff, who showed him the bill of lading which had been indorsed to him. Miller said it would have to be exchanged for the unindorsed bill which Mr. Schofield had, but the plaintiff refused to give up his indorsed bill until he received the cargo. An hour or so afterwards Miller came again and told the plaintiff that if he did not give up the indorsed bill of lading Schofield would demand payment of the freight before the delivery of the coal. At another time, which the plaintiff puts as about 9.30 on Saturday morning, Miller again urged the giving up of the indorsed bill of lading, and the plaintiff still refusing, Miller told him that Schofield might take an indorsed acceptance at ten days for the freight; but that also the plaintiff declined to give, saying it would virtually be paying the freight.\nSchofield then wrote to the plaintiff the following letter:\u2014\nI beg to direct your attention again to the fact that the brigantine 'Curlew' is in a discharging berth at Magee's slip, and ready to deliver the cargo of coal to you in accordance with the charter party.\nI enclose a bill of the freight, amounting to $637.10, and have again to request payment of the same from you.\nI also hereby give you notice that unless the freight is paid to me by five o'clock this evening I shall then make arrangements to land and store the cargo at your expense and risk.\nTo this the plaintiff replied on the same afternoon\u2014Saturday the 18th\u2014having in the mean time been verbally informed by Mr. Miller that they were going to store the cargo:\u2014\nI am in receipt of your favors of the 17th, and also that of the 18th inst., with enclosure as stated; and in reply beg to say that I am, and have been, ready to receive and take delivery of the cargo per brigantine 'Curlew' since nine o'clock this morning, and to pay freight on same, as delivered, to the master, owners, or other persons entitled to receive the same, but up to the present am without any proof that you are entitled to receive the same.\nI now hereby beg to give you notice, that if you land and store the cargo I will hold you and the master and owners of the said vessel answerable for all losses and damages that I, the owner of said cargo, may sustain by your action. And unless the master and owners of the said vessel proceed forthwith to deliver me the said cargo in suitable hours and weather I shall hold them liable for all damages and losses that I may sustain by reason of their failure to deliver me the said cargo in accordance with the terms and conditions of the charter party, dated 2nd September, 1886.\nOn the morning of Monday the 20th the vessel began discharging the coal which was carted to a store-house under Schofield's directions, and the whole cargo was so discharged and stored by the following Friday. There had been no tender of freight in the mean time, though an oral proposal had been made on the part of the plaintiff, but not acceded to by Schofield, that the coal should be delivered to the plaintiff on his paying freight for each ton as delivered. That delivery would have been the delivery from the vessel into the plaintiff's carts.\nThe only tender of freight was when the last cart load was being removed to the store. The plaintiff then tendered $657.10, the full amount originally claimed, and demanded his coal, but Schofield refused unless a further amount for storage, &c., was paid, and he afterwards sold the coal.\nSchofield is not a party to this action which is against Winchester alone.\nThe declaration originally contained three counts, all of them being upon the bill of lading. The first alleges a promise to the Caledonia Coal and Railway Company to deliver the coal to D. Carmichael or his assigns; the other two allege the promise to have been made to Carmichael, differing from each other only in the statement of the consideration for the promise. Each count of the three avers that Carmichael indorsed the bill of lading to the plaintiff, whereby the property in the coal passed to the plaintiff; and each count concluded by alleging that:\u2014\nThe delivery of the said goods, as aforesaid, was not prevented by any of the perils or casualties aforesaid. And all conditions were performed, and all things happened, and all times elapsed necessary to entitle the plaintiff to have the said goods delivered to him at the port of Saint John, N.B., aforesaid, yet the said goods were not delivered to the plaintiff at the port of Saint John, N.B., aforesaid, whereby the same were wholly lost to the plaintiff.\nThese counts were demurred to on the ground that the contract with Carmichael did not pass to the plaintiff by the indorsement of the bill of lading, as it would do in England under 18 and 19 Vic. ch 111, and were held bad on the law laid down in such cases as Thompson v. Dominy[17] and Howard v. Shepherd[18]; the principle being that which was thus tersely expressed by Lord Loughborough when giving the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber in Lickbarrow v. Mason[19]:\u2014\nThe indorsement of a bill of lading differs from the assignment of a chose in action, that is to say, of an obligation, as much as a debt differs from effects.\nOne of the learned judges in the court below was of opinion that the counts might be sustained as counts in tort, and that position has been urged before us. Upon this question it is unnecessary to add to what was said in the court below by the learned Chief Justice, who showed, conclusively, that the contention was untenable. It is not a question of the form of the action but of the allegations of fact; and there is nothing that can be construed into an allegation that the defendant failed in any duty except the duty to fulfil his promise to Carmichael to deliver the goods to him or his assigns.\nThe plaintiff's cross appeal must therefore be dismissed.\nA count in trover was added by the plaintiff by leave of the court, and his verdict is upon that count.\nThe judgment from which the defendant appeals proceeds upon the grounds that the defendant is responsible for the acts of Schofield, as a principal is responsible for the acts of his agent; and that the conduct of Schofield amounted to a conversion of the coal to the use of the defendant.\nWith great respect for the learned judges whose opinions we have now to review, I think they have been led into a fallacious course of reasoning on the first point from regarding the rights of the parties as depending principally, if not altogether, on the bill of lading, and from not attaching sufficient importance to the circumstance that there was a direct contract between the plaintiff and Schofield created by the charter party, and that the defendant, when he left for Digby, after having moored the vessel, did not leave Schofield there as his agent, but, as the plaintiff proved by the evidence I have quoted, and as, under the circumstances, would have been sufficiently evident without formal proof, he delivered over the vessel and her cargo to his employers, leaving them to carry out their contract to deliver the coal to the plaintiff. The defendant's connection with and control over the cargo appears to have ceased as completely as if he had died; or if, as for aught that appears in the evidence may have been the case, he had been discharged by his employers. The idea of his continued responsibility must be due to a lingering impression that he was in some way answerable to the plaintiff upon the contract on which the action was launched.\nNo authority has been adduced for the proposition that, under such facts as we have, the managing owner became the agent of the master, and I have not met with any in the course of my examination of the matter.\nThere certainly was no express delegation. If the responsibility exists, it must be because, by some inference of law, the principle respondeat superior applies, and very convincing authority would be required to warrant its application as contended for by the plaintiff.\nI think that on the ground that no conversion was committed by the defendant, who did nothing with the coal that was in any respect inconsistent with the plaintiff's ownership, or that was out of the direct line of his own duty as captain of the vessel, he is entitled to succeed on this appeal and to have a non-suit entered.\nIf this were not so, and if the defendant could properly be held answerable for Schofield's acts, then I think the verdict should stand on the ground that there was no lien on the coal for anything beyond the freight, and therefore the refusal to deliver from the warehouse on tender of the freight, was not justified, nor, a fortiori, was the subsequent sale.\nUp to the time of that refusal I think Schofield was in the right and the plaintiff in the wrong.\nThe only room for argument to the contrary is derived, as it appears to me, from taking the rights of the parties to be governed by the words in the bill of lading, \"he or they paying freight for the same at the rate per charter party on the amount so delivered,\" and taking those words to import a delivery before payment of the freight.\nI am not prepared to accede to the contention that that is the true effect of the words, and I do not think the cases of Paynter v. James[20] or Black v. Rose[21] which have been so much relied on, go the length required to support that contention.\nThe suggestion that unloading the coal upon the wharf, or any kind of delivery except hoisting the coal in tubs and delivering it over the ship's side into the plaintiff's carts, was contemplated or would have satisfied the contract to deliver, belongs to the region of imagination and not of reality; and it is opposed to the evidence furnished by the plaintiff himself by his conduct as well as by his examination at the trial. To have landed the coal on Magee's wharf, if that had been practicable, would have been a breach in place of performance of the contract.\nIt is clear enough upon the evidence that Schofield was always ready and willing to deliver in the ordinary way if the freight had been paid, and that the plaintiff refused to \"pay in advance\" as he repeatedly calls it in his evidence. Paying in advance means, as he used the term, paying before the coal had reached his possession. This is borne out by the proposal, which from his point of view was a concession, to pay for ton by ton as delivered from the vessel into his carts, paying for none while the lien for the freight remained on it. His original refusal was to pay anything before the whole was delivered. Regarding the cargo as a whole, and the delivery contemplated by the contract as one act, the clear effect of the plaintiffs own evidence is that he was not ready and willing to pay the freight. A question might be raised whether the terms of the bill of lading which made the freight payable on the quantity delivered, would not, on the principle of Black v. Rose[22] where the bill of lading was in similar terms, entitle the consignee to insist on treating each parcel delivered as separable from the bulk. It is not improbable that the question, if raised, would have to be decided adversely to the claim of the consignee, on the ground that the option to have delivery by parcels was with the shipowner and not with the consignee; but we need not trouble ourselves with the question for two reasons.\nOne, is the insufficiency of the evidence of readiness and willingness to pay for each ton as delivered. The plaintiff says nothing about it himself. The proposal was made by a Mr. Cullinan under instructions from the plaintiff's legal adviser, but, so far as disclosed by the evidence, without authority from the plaintiff. The other and the more important reason is that the contract that governs is that which is expressed in the charter party, and not that imported by the bill of lading. How it would be if the coal had been sold to a stranger and the bill of lading indorsed to him (as in Chappel v. Comfort[23]) we need not inquire. Here the plaintiff was the real consignee of the coal, the nominal consignment to Carmichael being obviously for the security of the company he represented in respect of the purchase money. The coal was carried in pursuance of the plaintiffs personal contract with Schofield, evidenced by the charter party. The plaintiff acted upon a perfectly correct apprehension of the matter when, in his correspondence during the dispute, e.g., in his letter of Saturday the 18th of September already quoted, and in another written the following Monday, he spoke of being prepared to pay freight \"in accordance with the conditions of charter party dated September 2nd, 1886,\" not of the bill of lading signed on the 9th of that month. In his evidence he also uses the same expression.\nThe doctrine which applies is stated in the following passage which is found in all the editions of Abbott on Shipping. I read from the 12th edition at p. 214[24]:\nWhen goods are put on board in pursuance of a charter party, the master is to sign for them bills of lading to the effect mentioned in the fourth chapter of this part, the charter party being the instrument and evidence of the contract for the conveyance, and the bill of lading the evidence of the shipping of the particular merchandise to be conveyed in pursuance of the contract.\nSee also Corner on Shipmasters and Seamen[25].\nThat the master has no implied authority to vary the contract made by the principals may be said to be an elementary proposition. It will be found in more than one place in Abbott on Shipping, as at p. 89 of the 12th edition, and it is enunciated and illustrated by many recent cases which have turned on the effect of the two documents, the charter party and bill of lading, when read together as they must be when one refers to the other, as is done by the phrase \"paying freight as per charter party\" or other similar expression.\nSee the judgment of Sir R. Phillimore in The Patria[26]; Chappel v. Comfort[27], particularly the judgment of Willes J.; Barwick v. Burnyeat[28]; Gray v. Carr[29]; Porteus v. Watney[30]; Gullischen v. Stewart[31]; Gardner v. Trechmann[32]; The San Roman[33]. In the last mentioned case the bill of lading had the words: \"The dangers of the seas only excepted,\" while the charter party excepted other dangers, and amongst them \"restraints of princes or rulers.\" These words were held to be imported by reference into the bill of lading and to justify delay caused by the master remaining in a neutral port for fear of capture by French cruisers, France being at war with Germany, the vessel belonging to Hamburg, and her owners being subjects of the North German Confederation.\nBy the charter party before us, the agreement is to deliver the coal on being paid freight at $1.15 per ton of 2,240 lbs. mine weight. This differs materially from the bill of lading, if I correctly understand the expression \"mine weight,\" inasmuch as it calls for payment of freight on the amount acknowledged to have been received on board, which payment would not interfere with any claim in respect of short delivery.\nThat was the freight demanded by Schofield and which the plaintiff refused to \"pay in advance,\" as he phrased it\u2014and it was the amount ultimately tendered after the warehousing of the coal.\nThere can be no question of the right of the shipowner, in the absence of stipulations which are not contained in this charter party, to retain his lien, or in other words to retain possession of the goods until the freight is paid. He must be ready and willing to deliver the goods before his claim for freight is complete, but the freight must be paid before he can be required to part with his possession. That doctrine is affirmed by numberless cases and is laid down in every work of authority on the subject. The appellant refers in his factum to passages from judgments delivered in Cargo ex Argos[34]; Kirchner v. Venus[35]; Black v. Rose[36]; Duthie v. Hilton[37]; Paynter v. James[38]; Perez v. Alsop[39]. Those citations are all in point. The rule is well expressed by the Chief Justice of New South Wales in the judgment which was the subject of appeal in Black v. Rose (3), in a passage which, as correctly printed at p. 660 of Mr. Carver's treatise, seems to have received the approval of the judicial committee.\nWhen there is no express stipulation as to the time and manner of payment of freight, the master is not bound to part with the goods until his freight is paid.\nThe learned author proceeds[40] to discuss the cases where freight is not payable till complete delivery, one instance being found in Brown v. Tanner[41]; there being in those cases no lien for the freight; and[42] he remarks that\nThe shipowner in enforcing his lien for freight may retain possession of all the goods in respect of which it is payable until the whole has been paid.\nCiting Perez v. Allsop[43], and adding, on the authority of Black v Rose[44]:\u2014\nOr be may give delivery by instalments and require the freight on each instalment to be paid concurrently with the delivery of it.\nThe case in the Supreme Court of the United States, Brittan v. Barnaby[45] does not lay down any doctrine on this point inconsistent with the English decisions. A great part of the discussion in the case related to a memorandum which had been stamped in red ink on the back of the bill of lading. That was held not to be incorporated with the bill of lading, which then became simply a contract to carry goods from New York to San Francisco at fixed rates of freight, with primage and average accustomed, with the promise of the shipper to pay the freight. On arrival at San Francisco notice was given to the consignee, in which notice the consignee was required to pay the freight of the goods as they should be landed from the ship on the wharf, with an intimation that if it was not paid and the goods received before four o'clock of the day, such of them as had been landed would be placed in a warehouse for safe keeping, at the expense of the consignee. The goods were landed in parcels during three days, and the consignee was ready and willing to pay the freight on each parcel in conformity with the notice, but that was refused, freight on the whole being demanded before delivery of any part. The goods were warehoused and, as in this case, a tender of the whole freight was afterwards refused because no tender was made of the expenses of warehousing, &c.\nIn deciding against the ship-owner great stress was laid on his having receded from the terms of the notice he had given, and I understand the decision to have really turned on the force given to that notice as settling the rights of the parties. The general law as laid down by the court distinctly affirms the right of the ship-owner to preserve his lien by retaining possession of the whole cargo until the freight is paid or secured.\nIt asserts the right of the consignee to inspect the goods in order to see that the contract to carry has been fulfilled, before the carrier can demand payment of the full freight, but meets the interference with the right of lien which that process would work by affirming the right to security for the payment. The case does not aid the present plaintiff.\nIt was doubtless a matter of prudence on the part of Schofield to warehouse the coal in place of keeping the vessel idle, particularly as he had not stipulated for the payment of demurrage; but he would not, in the absence of an agreement to that effect, have had a lien on the cargo for demurrage, and he had none for the expense incident to the alternative course of warehousing the coal. His right to recover those charges from the plaintiff by action is a different matter.\nThis point is dealt with in Maclachlan on Merchant Shipping[46] in the following passage:\n\"The master may assert his lien for freight by detaining of the goods on board, keeping his ship on demurrage, at all events for a reasonable time. If the port be a British possession where the common law prevails he may discharge the cargo into a warehouse subject to his lien, giving the freighters notice thereof. But as he cannot hold it for the warehouse rent and other charges, he must give it up on payment of the freight and rely on his action for his other demands if not paid. He is, however, under the responsibility, since he assumes the character and functions, of warehouseman. See the elaborate judgment of Willes J. in Meyerstein v. Barber[47]; Mors-le-Blanch v. Wilson[48].\"\nThe plaintiff thus seems to have a right of action for the conversion of the coal; but, on the ground first discussed, I think he has no right against this defendant, and that the appeal should therefore be allowed with costs and a nonsuit entered.\nAppeal and Cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Weldon & McLean.\nSolicitor for respondent: C.

Stats. L.C. ch. 49 sec. 15 Waiver.\nBy a judgment en d\u00e9claration d'hypoth\u00e8que certain property in the possession and ownership of respondents was declared hypothecated in favor of the appellant in the sum of $5,200 and interest and. costs; they were condemned to surrender the same in order that it might be judicially sold to satisfy the judgment, unless they preferred to pay to appellant the amount of the judgment. By the judgment it was also decreed that the option should be made within forty days of the service to be made upon them of the .judgment, and in default of their so doing within the said delay that the respondents be condemned to pay to the appellant the amount of the judgment.\nThis judgment, (the respondents residing in Scotland and having no domicile in Canada) was served at the prothonotary's office and on the respondents' attorneys. After the delay of forty days, no choice or option having been made, the appellant caused a writ of fi. fa. de terris to issue against the respondents for the full amount of the judgment. The sheriff first seized the property hypothecated, sold it and handed over the proceeds to a prior mortgagee. Another writ of \u00f1. fa. de terris was then issued and other realty belonging to the respondents was seized. To this second seizure the respondents filed an opposition a fin d'annuler, claiming that the judgment had not been served on them and that they were not personally liable for the debt due to appellant.\nHeld,\u20141st. Reversing the judgment of the court below, that it is not necessary to serve a judgment en d\u00e9claration d'hypoth\u00e8que on a defendant who is absent from the Province and has no domicile. Art. 476 C.C.P. and Cons. Stats. L.C. ch. 49 sec. 15. 2nd. That the respondents, by not opposing the first seizure of their property, had waived any irregularity (if any) as to the service of the judgment.\n3rd. That in an action en d\u00e9claration d'hypoth\u00e9gue the defendant, may in default of his surrendering the property within the period fixed by the court, he personally condemned to pay the full amount of the plaintiff's claim. Art. 2075 C.C.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, for Lower Canada (Appeal Side) confirming the judgment of the Superior Court maintaining an opposition \u00e0 fin d'annuler fyled by the respondents to a writ of pluries fieri facias issued at the instance of the appellant.\nThe material facts of the case are as follows: \u2014\nBy a judgment of the Superior Court, Quebec, reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench, but confirmed by the Supreme Court, Kidston et al., present respondents, were at the instance of Dubuc, present appellant 'condemned to surrender certain immovables, unless they close to pay Dubuc $5,250. They were also ordered to declare their choice or option to sum render or to pay, within forty days of the service of the said judgment and in default of their so doing within the said delay the court adjudged and condemned them to pay Dubuc the said sum of $5,250, interest and costs.\nThe judgments of the Superior and Supreme Courts having been served on Kidston et al., at the prothonotary's office, on the 23rd December, 1884, and on their attorneys on the 27th of the same month, and no choice or option having been made by them as ordered, Dubuc caused a writ of execution to issue against the Kidstons for the full amount of his judgment. The sheriff seized certain immovables mentioned in the judgment and sold them for $2,270.00. This amount was immediately claimed by an opposition for payment from Kidston et al., as representing two creditors anterior to Dubuc whose mortgages they alleged they had paid. Dubuc then issued another writ and seized a number of other immovables belonging to the Kidstons in order to be paid his judgment.\nTo this second execution the Kidstons fyled an opposition \u00e0 fin d'annuler, praying that the seizure be declared null and the judgment fully satisfied.\nThe grounds of their opposition were:\u2014\n1. That they never had a domicile in the Province of Quebec and that the judgments in question had not been served upon them.\n2. That they had paid the costs on the first action.\n3. That Dubuc had caused the immovables mentioned in the judgment to be seized, and that they did not oppose their sale.\n4. That they had paid two mortgages anterior to that of Dubuc, to wit: the mortgages of O'Sullivan and Hall, amounting to $5000,00.\n5. That by these payments they had been substituted to O'Sullivan and Hall and had the right to be paid in their stead before Dubuc upon the price of sale.\n6. That Dubuc had instituted against them another action for $3200 for deteriorations caused since the bringing of the first suit to the immovables mortgaged in his favor.\nDubuc met this opposition by a special denial and by a plea of exception, in which he says:\n1. That before suing the Kidstons, he had sued his personal debtor, Connolly, who was condemned, not withstanding' a plea of payment, and that this final judgment was res judicata.\n2. That although this judgment had been produced in the present case, the Kidstons met his action with the same plea of payment which was rejected for the second time.\n3. That the judgment in this cause had been served upon them and their agents and attorneys; that they had received notice of the service, and were made aware of that fact before the seizure of the first immovables.\n4. That they had refused to make the choice or option as ordered by the court, and that they had thereby become his personal debtors.\n5. That before and after the seizure the Kidstons had offered him $4,500 in settlement of his judgment and that they became purchasers themselves, adjudi cataires, of the immovables sold, for $2,270.\n6. That they had claimed by opposition, as having paid it to Hall and O'Sullivan, the whole produce of the sale in preference to him.\n7. That the suit for deteriorations on these immovables, could not prevent Dubuc from executing his judgment, it being only an additional remedy.\nAnd after alleging some other facts not material to the issue in the case, he concluded by praying the court to declare that the terms of the judgments are absolute, that they impose upon the Kidstons the obligation to pay him the full amount of the condemnation in default by them of making the option required, and he prayed the dismissal of their opposition.\nBlanchet Q. C. for appellant.\n8. The judgments have been served according to law Arts. 223, 570, 605, 852, 906 C.C.P.\nArt.\u00b784 C. C. P., applies to two cases (1) when a party has no domicile in Lower Canada, (2) or has left it since the beginning of the suit.\nIn this case the bailiff swears that he has made all the necessary searches and enquiries to find the Kidstons, and that he could not find them, as he was credibly informed that they then had not and never had any domicile either in the dirtrict or in the Province of Quebec This is sufficient. See Doutre Code de Procedure ([1]). See also Bioche Dic. de Procedure ([2]).\nBut even if there is any irregularity, respondents have waived their right to urge it against appellant, by becoming purchasers of the property sold under the first writ of execution. Dalloz Repertoire, ([3]).\n2. Are the Kidstons bound to satisfy the condemnation, having failed to declare their option to surrender or pay, and having remained in possession?\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court is in conformity with the following articles of our Civil Code, Arts. 2061, 2075, 2079, 2089. See also Guyot, Repertoire ([4]); Bourjon droit Commun ([5]); Teulet Codes annot\u00e9s, Code Napo l\u00e9on ([6]); Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction v. Bourassa ([7]).\nIrvine Q.C. for respondents.\nNeither the judgment of the Superior Court of the 8th July, 1882, nor the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, of the 23rd June, 1884, was ever legally served upon the respondents. Art. 84, C.C.P.\nBy law and by the terms of such judgment the only personal condemnation against the respondents was in costs, which it is admitted they have paid. Arts. 2168, 2169, C.N. and commentators thereon. Belanger v. Durocher ([8]) :\nIt is established that the judgments in question have been fully satisfied.\nBy law and by the terms of such judgments, even had the same been duly served the appellant's recourse was limited to the judicial sale of the property declared to be hypothecated in his favor, against a curator, in the event of a surrender, and against the respondents in the event of no surrender.\nAppellant has admitted that the judgments are discharged, and is now exercising1 recourse by a special suit in damages against the respondents, inconsistent with their being in force either in whole or in part\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by TASCHEREAU, J:\u2014\n\"We are of opinion to allow this appeal.\nOn the first ground of the opposition, based on the irregularity of the service of this judgment, it is sufficient to say that under ch. 49, C. S. L. C., sec. 15, reproduced in Art 476, C. C. Proc, it is not necessary to serve the judgment en d\u00e9claration d'hypoth\u00e8que on a defendant who is absent from the Province, or who has no domicile therein The opposition alleges that \" The opposants and defendants have not now and never had their domicile in the Province of Quebec, and neither the judgment of the Superior Court of Lower Canada nor the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, both hereinbefore set forth, has ever been lawfully signified to or served upon them.\"\nThe judgment appealed from adopts this contention as a ground to annul this seizure. I assume that, as the above statute and article of the code were not mentioned by either of the parties at the argument before us, and are no where noticed in the factums, they were not brought to the attention of the courts below; otherwise, I take it for granted this consid\u00e9rant of the judgment would have been left out.\nOn the ground of waiver also, this irregularity, if any exists, cannot now be invoked against this second seizure. Having allowed the seizures and sale on a first fi fa., the opposants are too late now to urge as a ground of nullity of a second seizure, an irregularity which, if existing, would have made the judgment non-ex\u00e9cutoire altogether, till duly served. By allowing the first execution they have admitted that the judgment was ex\u00e9cutoire. They have renounced all right to any service at all of the judgment. Now that the mortgaged property has been seized and sold on them, how can they ask that the judgment ordering them to surrender it or pay should now be served on them? The service was a condition precedent to the first execution. How can it now after the execution, the said execution having been acquiesced in, be con tended that the want of service causes the nullity of a second execution?\nBy the second ground of their opposition the opposants virtually attack the judgment rendered against them. This judgment condemned them in the usual form, in default of surrender of the property mortgaged or of payment of the mortgage, to pay to the plaintiff the amount of his demand. Now they have neither paid, nor surrendered the property, and yet they contend that the plaintiff cannot execute his judgment against them, because he has already caused the mort gaged property to be seized and sold, and if his claim was not paid out of that sale that does not concern them as they allege, the plaintiff having no further recourse against them.\nThis contention is untenable, The judgment itself disposes of it, and the judgment as it stands the plain tiff has a right to execute. In law, the opposants could not have demurred to the personal condemnation, in default of payment or option to surrender, asked for by the plaintiff in the conclusion of his declaration.\nArticles 2 75 is clear the defendant is condemned \u201cin default of surrendering, to pay to the plaintiff the full amount of his claim.\"\nSuch is not the law in France; under the Napo- leon. Code there is there no article corresponding too our Art. 2075, and \u201csi l'acquereur ne paie ni ne d\u00e9laisse, les cr\u00e9anciers n'ont pas droit de poursuivre leur paie ment contre lui, mais seulement de l'exproprier de l'immeuble.\" Delvincourt ([9]), Duranton ([10]); Tarrible, cit\u00e9 par Troplong ([11]) : Merlin, Repertoire ([12]) :\nUnder the old law in France, also, I am not pre pared to say that, according to the true principles in the matter there could be a personal condemnation against the Tiers d\u00e9tenteur\n\"Car\"(says Loyseau) ([13])\" peut-on condamner \u00e0 payer celui qui n'a rien, promis, qui n'a point contract\u00e9, et qui n'est pas oblig\u00e9 ni h\u00e9ritier de l'oblig\u00e9.\" Vide Barguet, d\u00e9s droits de justice ([14]).\nHowever, it is unnecessary here to investigate this question. It is clears from Pigeau, ([15]) Guyot, ([16]) and others, that the opinion had for a long time prevailed amongst many that the defendant who did not surrender the property mortgaged might be personally condemned to pay, and following the universal juris prudence and practice in the Province of Quebec, where this view had been adopted the codifiers em bodied it in Art. 2075 on which they remark in their report:\nThe object of the hypothecary action being to have the immovable surreudered and sold, the defendant may make such surrender either before judgment or within the delay prescribed by the judgment, and in default of such surrender the holder is personally bound to the payment of the debt. This personal responsibility may be looked upon as a penalty imposed for contumacy, without however prejudicing in any manner the rights of the prosecuting creditor, who may forthwith seize the hypothecated immovable at the same time as the movables of the debtor and thus obtain satisfaction\nThe opposants may have strong grounds to urge that this should not be law but on that point their adversary has not to join issue with them That such is the law disposes of this contestation.\nThen there are good reasons to support the equity of the view adopted by the codifiers The defendant has only to surrender the property to get rid of the personal condemnation. If he does not choose .to do so he cannot complain. He voluntarily and deliberately remains in possession of the property mortgaged, and enjoys rents, profits and revenues thereof, whilst if he had surrendered it the curator for the mortgagees would have been entitled to these profits rents and revenues. Arts. 535, 536, 537, C. C. Proc. He thus benefits by not surrendering and deprives the mortgagees of what otherwise would have gone to satisfy their claims. To prevent this as much as possible the code enacts that if the defendant does not surrender, if he prefers to retain the possession of the property and to collect and take the benefit of the revenues thereof, he shall then be personally condemned to satisfy the plaintiff's claim.\nWe are of opinion that the plaintiff's judgment is now executory against all the properties of the opposants, and that the opposition must fail.\nThe appeal will therefore be allowed with costs in all the courts, distraits to attorneys of record.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Blanchet, Amyot & Pelletier.\nSolicitors for respondents: W. & A.

C.\nN. D. respondent, owner of a cheese factory, made an agreement with farmers by which the latter agreed to give the milk of their cows to no other cheese factory than to that of N. D. N. D. subsequently sold to G. D. (the appellant) the factory and sous la simple garantie de ses faits et promesses, whatever rights he might have under his agreement with the farmers, for the bulk sum of $7,000. G. D. assigned to B. the factory and the same rights, but excluding warranty, sans garantie aucune, for $7,500. A company was subsequently formed to whom B. assigned the factory and the rights, and one of the farmers to the original agreement having sold milk to another cheese factory, the company sued him, but the action was dismissed, on the ground that N. D. could not validly assign personal rights he had against the farmers. Thereupon G. D. brought an action against N. D. to recover the price paid for rights which N. D. had no right to assign. At the trial it was proved that although the price mentioned in the deed and paid was a bulk sum for the factory and the rights the parties at the time valued the rights under the agreement with the farmers at $5,000. G. D. also admitted that the action was taken for the benefit of the pre sent owners of the factory.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, Strong and Fournier JJ. dissenting, that, inasmuch as the appellant by the sale he had made to B., had received full benefit of all that he had bought from respondent and had no interest in the suit, he could not claim to be reimbursed a portion of the price paid.\nPer Taschereau J.\u2014If any action lay, it could only have been to set the sale aside, the parties being restored to the status quo ante if it were maintained APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), confirming the judgment of the Superior Court sitting at\nThis was an action brought by the appellant to be reimbursed the sum of $5,000, which he claimed to have paid to respondent without consideration.\nThe material facts that gave rise to the suit are the following:\nIn 1881, the respondent being the owner of a newly established cheese factory, in the town of Montmagny, made with a certain number of farmers, an agreement by which the latter bound themselves not to carry the milk of their cows to any other cheese factory than that of the respondent. The object was to protect respondent's establishment against competition.\nThree years after, viz., in 1884, the respondent sold his factory to the appellant, with the ground on which it was erected, and all accessories; and by the same deed specifically transferred to said appellant, all the rights and privileges accruing to him by and in virtue of his agreement of 1881 with the farmers of Montmagny, in the following terms:\n\" C\u00e8de et transporte, sous la simple garantie de ses faits et promesses au dit sieur George Demers, ce acceptant comme susdit, tous ses droits pour le temps qui en reste \u00e0 courir \u00e0 compter de ce jour, tous le droits que le dit sieur Norbert Lema\u00eetre Duhaime peut avoir avec une certaine partie des habitants de St. Thomas, en vertu d'un acte \"\nThe whole was sold for a bulk amount of $7,000.00.\nSubsequently, the appellant sold to Nazaire Bernatchez, for the price of $7,500.00, the same cheese factory with the rights and privileges derived from the original agreement of the respondent with the farmers of Montmagny. The terms of this last mentioned, sale are:\n\"Et il c\u00e8de de plus, sans garantie aucune, au dit acqu\u00e8reur ce acceptant, tous le droits que Norbert Lemaitre Duhaime lui a c\u00e9d\u00e9s et avait droit de lui c\u00e9der, par le susdit acte de vente et que le dit Duhaime a acquis de Louis B\u00e9langer et autres\nAnd later on there was a resale by Nazaire Bernatchez to Numa Bernatchez and others for the same price of $7,500.00.\nIn the mean time a new cheese factory had been started in Montmagny, to which some of the farmers who had bound themselves towards respondent Duhaime were carrying the milk of their cows in contravention of their agreement, and Numa Bernatchez, being in possession of respondent's factory, sought to enforce against them their original agreement, by an action before the Superior Court of Montmagny.\nThe action was sustained by the Superior Court, but dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench.\nThe judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, declared that the deed from respondent to appellant had effected no transfer in favor of the latter of respondent's rights against the farmers of Montmagny, that said rights were purely personal to respondent Duhaime, could not be assigned by him, and consequently could not have passed to the appellant or to his ayants cause.\nLeave to appeal to the Supreme Court from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench was asked and refused, the sum involved being under the appealable amount.\nThe appellant then brought the present action, praying to be reimbursed a part of the price paid, proportional to the value put upon said rights by the parties at the time of the sale, viz., $5,000.00\nThe judgment of the Superior Court dismissed appellant's action, and this judgment the Court of Queen's Bench confirmed\nIrvine Q.C. for appellant and Casgrain Q.C. for res pondent.\nThe points relied on and authorities cited are fully reviewed in the judgments hereinafter given.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think the appeal should he dismissed. I think the judgments rendered in the Superior Court and Court of Appeal should be con firmed.\nSTRONG J. concurred with FOURNIER J.\nFOURNIER, J.\u2014La question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider en cette cause, est de savoir si l'appelant a droit de r\u00e9clamer de l'intime partie du prix de la vente d'une fromagerie, comportant cession de certains droits appartenant au vendeur, sur le principe que le paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait sans cause et par une erreur de droit commune aux deux parties contractantes. L'intim\u00e9, pour s'assurer l'approvisionnement du lait n\u00e9cessaire pour l'exploitation de sa fromagerie avait fait avec un certain nombre de cultivateurs par acte authentique, une convention par laquelle ces derniers s'obligeaient \u00e0 ne pas fournir leur lait \u00e0 aucune autre fromagerie que celle de l\u2019intim\u00e9 afin de lui permettre de continuer son exploitation pendant 20 ans, \u00e0 partir du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1881; 2\u00b0 \u00e0 se conformer aux r\u00e8glements qui leur seraient donn\u00e9s dans l'\u00e9tablissement ou manufacture de fromage.\nEn 1884 l'intim\u00e9 vendit sa manufacture avec tous les droits et privil\u00e8ges qu'il avait acquis des cultivateurs comme susdit. La cession de ces droits est faite en ces termes:\nC\u00e8de et transporte, sous la simple garantie de ses faits et promesses au dit sieur George Demers, ce acceptant comme susdit, tous ses droits pour le temps qui en reste \u00e0 courir \u00e0 compter de ce jour, tous les droits que le dit sieur Norbert Lema\u00eetre Duhaime peut avoir avec une certaine partie des habitants de St-Thomas, en vertu d'un acte authen tique pass\u00e9 \u00e0 St-Thomas, le 8 d\u00e9cembre 1881, par-devant ma\u00eetre Gendreau, notaire.\nLa vente de la manufacture et la cession des droits \u00e9taient faites pour une somme totale de $7,000. Plus tard l'appelant revendit \u00e0 Nazaire Bernatchez pour $7,500, la m\u00eame manufacture avec cession des droits acquis des cultivateurs signataires de l'acte du 8 d\u00e9 cemdre 1881 Dans ce dernier acte la cession des droits est faite en ces termes:\nC\u00e8de de plus, sans garantie aucune, au dit acqu\u00e9reur ce acceptant, tous les droits que Norbert Duhaime lui a c\u00e9d\u00e9 et avait droit de lui c\u00e9der, par le susdit acte de vente et que le dit Duhaime a acquis de Louis B\u00e9langer et autres.\nLa m\u00eame fromagerie est ensuite devenu la pro pri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Numa Bernatchez, pour le prix de $7,500. Peu de temps apr\u00e8s, une nouvelle fromagerie ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, les cultivateurs qui s'\u00e9taient originairement engag\u00e9s par l'acte du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1881, envers Duhaime, au lieu d'aller porter le lait de leurs vaches \u00e0 son cessionnaire, all\u00e9rent le porter \u00e0 la nouvelle manufacture. Numa Bernatchez \u00e9tant alors acqu\u00e9reur de ces droits, et d\u00e9sirant les exercer poursuivit un des r\u00e9fractaires et obtint contre lui un jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, le confirmant dans la possession des droits qu'il avait acquis. Sur appel \u00e0 la cour du Banc de la Reine ce-jugement fut infirm\u00e9 sur le principe que le contrat de vente de l'intim\u00e9 n'avait pas eu l'effet de transf\u00e9rer \u00e0 l'appelant les droits qu'il avait contre les cultivateurs de Montmagny, en vertu de l'acte du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1881; que ces droits \u00e9tant purement personnels \u00e0 Duhaime, celui-ci n'avait Pu les c\u00e9der et qu'ils n'avaient Pu \u00eatre acquis ni par l'appelant ni par ses ayant-cause. Une demande d'appel \u00e0 la cour Supr\u00eame fut refus\u00e9e parce que l'action n'\u00e9tait pas d'un montant suffisamment \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour le rendre appelable \u00e0 cette cour, Maintenant que l'appelant a obtenu par le jugement de la cour du Banc de la Reine, la certitude que les droits acquis de Duhaime \u00e9taient incessibles en droit; que Duhaime n'avait pas le pouvoir de les lui c\u00e9der, que de fait il ne les a pas c\u00e9d\u00e9s, ces droits \u00e9tant toujours demeur\u00e9s attach\u00e9s \u00e0 sa personne, et, qu'il a encore actuellement contre les cultivateurs les m\u00eames droits qu'il avait avant sa cession; qu'en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, il n'a rien c\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant qui se trouve \u00e0 n'avoir re\u00e7u aucune consid\u00e9ration pour la partie la plus importante du prix de vente, celui-ci en demande la restitution comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 sans cause et par erreur de droit.\nLes all\u00e9gations suivantes de sa d\u00e9claration donnent une juste id\u00e9e de la nature des droits d'action que l'appelant entend exercer dans cette cause.\nQue la consid\u00e9ration enti\u00e8re de l'acte de vente du dit d\u00e9fendeur au demandeur \u00e9tait stipul\u00e9e \u00eatre de la somme de sept mille piastres, laquelle le demandeur paya int\u00e9gralement an d\u00e9fendeur lors de la prise de pos session du terrain et de la fromagerie;\nQue pour ce qui est des droits r\u00e9sultant du dit acte du huit d\u00e9cembre mil huit cent quatre-vingt-un, vendus et c\u00e9d\u00e9s par le dit d\u00e9fendeur, le demandeur n'a jamais pu s'en faire mettre en possession. Que ces droits n'\u00e9taient pas transf\u00e9rables, qu'ils \u00e9taient personnels au dit Duhaime d\u00e9fendeur et que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 pour les dits droits l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 sans cause et est sujet \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9tition;\nQue par jugement rendu par la cour du Bane de la Reine, en appel, si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec le ou vers le cinq f\u00e9vrier dernier sur poursuite de Numa Bernatchez et al., cessionnaires du demandeur vs O. Beaubien, l'une des parties \u00e0 l'acte du huit d\u00e9cembre mil huit cent quatre-vingt un il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que le dit acte entre le dit Duhaime et les dits Beaubien et autres n'avaient cr\u00e9\u00e9 que des obligations personnelles entre eux et que le dit Duhaime n'avait pas le droit de c\u00e9der les dits droits et que la dite cession \u00e9tait sans effet l\u00e9gal entre le cessionnaire et les dits Beaubien et autres;\nQue le dit jugement est final et n'est pas susceptible d'appel;\nQue lors de la passation de l'acte de vente du vingt-huit avril mil huit cent quatre-vingt-quatre, le demandeur \u00e9tait sous l'impression que les dits droits \u00e9taient transf\u00e9rables, que la cour de Circuit du district de Montmagny avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 plusieurs fois dans ce sens \u00e0 leur connais sance et que les droits r\u00e9sultant du dit acte constituant une esp\u00e8ce de monopole qui assurait l'existence et la prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9tablissement, entraient pour une grande proportion dans la cause et la consid\u00e9ration du dit contrat.\nQue la valeur du terrain de la fromagerie et des d\u00e9pendances ne d\u00e9passe pas la somme de deux mille piastres courant et que les droits r\u00e9sultant de l'acte du huit d\u00e9cembre mil huit cent quatre-vingt--un et vendus avec la dite fromagerie \u00e9taient \u00e9valu\u00e9s et valaient la somme de cinq mille piastres courant que le dit demandeur n'aurait pas donn\u00e9es et pay\u00e9es, s'il e\u00fbt cru n'acheter que le terrain, la fromagerie et les d\u00e9pendances;\nL'appelant se fondant sur ces all\u00e9gations, r\u00e9clame une diminution du prix pay\u00e9, \u00e9gale \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence entre le prix et la valeur du terrain, fromagerie et d\u00e9pendance dont ii a eu d\u00e9livrance et pris possession, savoir, $5,000; ces $5,000 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es sans cause pour des droits illusoires, dont l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas fait et ne peut pas faire la d\u00e9livrance \u00e0 l'appelant.\nIl all\u00e8gue ensuite que l'intim\u00e9 savait lors de la signature de l'acte de vente que les droits c\u00e9d\u00e9s n'\u00e9taient pas transferables Mais il est juste de dire de suite qu'il n'y a aucune preuve de cette derni\u00e8re all\u00e9gation, et qu'il n'y a pas lieu de revenir plus tard sur cette partie de la cause.\nL'intim\u00e9 Duhaime a plaid\u00e9 qu'il n'a fait par l'acte de vente du 28 avril 1884 qu'une cession des droits qu'il pouvait avoir, sans autre garantie que celle de ses faits et promesses, que l'appelant les a accept\u00e9s \u00e0 ses risques et p\u00e9rils, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence ii n'est pas tenu \u00e0 la restitution du prix de la chose vendue, Il invoque l'exception de l'article 1510.\nLa vente bien que faite pour un seul prix, n'en est pas moins une vente de choses bien distinctes; la premi\u00e9re est la vente de l'immeuble, et la seconde la cession et transport sous la simple garantie de ses faits et promesses des droits acquis des cultivateurs par l'acte du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1881.\nQuoique le prix de vente ne soit pas divis\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 sp\u00e9cifier pour quelle somme chacune des deux choses vendues doit compter pour former la somme totale, il n'en est pas moins \u00e9tabli en preuve que la valeur de chacune a \u00e9t\u00e9 estim\u00e9e sp\u00e9cialement et s\u00e9par\u00e9ment par les deux parties, avant d'arriver \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination du prix de vente. Octave Talbot qui repr\u00e9sentait l'appelant \u00e0 l'acte de vente prouve ce fait positivement\nC'est moi, dit-il, qui ai comparu comme procureur du demandeur dans l'acte du vingt-huit avril mil huit cent quatre-vingt-quatre. Dans le temps, j'\u00e9valuais le terrain, la b\u00e2tisse et les accessoires \u00e0 une valeur de trois mille cinq cents piastres au plus haut, et cela d'apr\u00e8s l'inventaire que j'en fis avec le d\u00e9fendeur lui-m\u00eame.\nQ\u2014Quelle \u00e9tait d'apr\u00e8s vous la valeur des droits vendus par le dit acte ind\u00e9pendamment de la fromagerie et accessoires?\nR\u2014Je consid\u00e8re que ces droits ou privil\u00e8ges valaient plus que la fro magerie et ses accessoires L'\u00e9valuation que j'ai mise sur ces droits d'apr\u00e8s l'inventaire \u00e9tait de trois mille cinq cent \u00e0 quatre mille piastres, c'est sur cette \u00e9valuation qu'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 le prix dans l'acte.\nJe suis positif que M. Demers le demandeur n'aurait pas achet\u00e9 pour le prix qu'il a pay\u00e9 sans la consid\u00e9ration de ces privil\u00e8ges, parceque lui m\u00eame m'a dit qu'il attachait plus de prix aux privil\u00e8ges qu'\u00e0 la fromagerie.\nD'apr\u00e8s ce t\u00e9moignage il est clair que l'intim\u00e9 vendait la fromagerie, c'est-\u00e0-dire l'immeuble, la somme de $3,500.00 et les droits acquis des cultivateurs $3, 500.00 faisant la somme totale de $7,000.\nLa vente faite avec garantie de ses faits et promesses, seulement \u00e0 l'effet de rendre l'intim\u00e9 responsable de l'existence de la chose c\u00e9d\u00e9e, de m\u00eame que le c\u00e9dant de cr\u00e9ances ou autres droits incorporels avec la m\u00eame garantie, ou m\u00eame sans garantie, n'en n'est pas moins tenu de garantir l'existence de la cr\u00e9ance ou des droits c\u00e9d\u00e9s. Le code, article 1576, en contient une disposition expresse.\nArticle 1576: Celui qui vend une cr\u00e9ance ou autre droit, doit garantir qu'elle existe et lui est due, quoique la vente soit faite sans garantie, sauf n\u00e9anmoins l'exemption contenue en l'article 1510. Au cas d'\u00e9viction des droits c\u00e9d\u00e9s le c\u00e9dant, il est vrai, n'est pas tenu \u00e0 des dommages et int\u00e9r\u00e9ts envers l'acqu\u00e9reur mais il est tenu de rembourser le prix de la chose \u00e9vinc\u00e9e, comme l'ayant re\u00e7u sans cause. Cette obligation est impos\u00e9e par le code article 1510.\nDuranton dit:([1]).\nCelui qui vend une cr\u00e9ance ou autre droit incorporel doit en garantir l'existence au temps du transport, quoiqu'il soit fait sans garantie, Article 1693.\nNum\u00e9ro 511. La r\u00e8gle que le vendeur d'une cr\u00e9ance ou autre droit incorporel est tenu d'en garantir l'existence au temps du transport, quoiqu'il soit fait sans garantie cesse toutefois d'\u00eatre applicable, lors que le droit est vendu comme simple pr\u00e9tention, comme droit litigieux, ou aux risques et p\u00e9rils de l'acheteur ou cessionnaire, ou bien aussi lorsque le transport est fait avec stipulation de non garantie, et que le cessionnaire connaissait an temps de la cession l'incertitude du droit du c\u00e9dant ou vendeur.\nLa garantie de l'intim\u00e9 s'\u00e9tendant d'apr\u00e9s les auto rites \u00e0 l'existence de la cr\u00e9ance ou droits incorporels au temps de la cession, il s'ensuit que l'intim\u00e9 devait n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre propri\u00e9taire alors d'un droit cessible. S'il n'avait pas \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque un tel droit, ii se trouve alors dans le cas d'avoir c\u00e9d\u00e9 une chose qui n'existait pas. La loi le rendant au moment de la cession, garant de l'existence du droit c\u00e9d\u00e9, il doit, s'il ne peut en faire la d\u00e9livrance, indemniser l'acqu\u00e9reur. Cette garantie ne s'applique pas qu'aux cr\u00e9ances seule ment, elle s'applique \u00e9galement aux cessions de droits incorporels, comme le font voir les autorit\u00e9s et surtout l'article 1576 de notre code.\nLe cas ne serait pas diff\u00e9rent s'il n'y avait eu aucune stipulation quelconque de garantie, et m\u00eame exclusion de garantie car, ajoute Duranton ([2]).\nDu reste, la simple stipulation de non garantie en l'absence de la circonstance que l'acheteur savait que le droit \u00e9tait incertain, n'aurait pas pour effet selon nous, d'affranchir le vendeur de l'obligation de resti tuer le prix de cession, s'il \u00e9tait ensuite reconnu que le droit n'existait pas.\nMerlin dit sur la m\u00e9me question ([3]).\nObservez aussi que la clause par laquelle on a stipule que le vendeur ne serait oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 aucune garantie, suffit bien pour la mettre \u00e0 l'abri d'une condamnation aux dommages et int\u00e9r\u00e9ts de l'acheteur dans le cas d'\u00e9viction; mais qu'il n'est pas moins tenu de rendre le prix de vente. La raison en est que l'acheteur n'ayant pay\u00e9 ce prix que pour avoir la chose que le vendeur avait promise, et celui-ci n'ayant point accompli sa promesse, il se trouve avoir re\u00e7u sans objet le prix dont il s'agit et par cons\u00e9quent il doit le rendre C. N., article 1679.\nCependant ii y a un cas on le vendeur n'est pas m\u00eame oblig\u00e9 de rendre le prix de la vente quoique l'acheteur soit \u00e9vinc\u00e9. C'est quand il parait que l'objet de la vente a bien moins \u00e9t\u00e9 la chose vendue, que la pr\u00e9tention incertaine que le vendenr avait \u00e0 cette chose, \" ou (comme le dit l'article 1629 C. N.) quand l'acqu\u00e9reur a connu le danger de l'\u00e9viction on qu'il a achet\u00e9 \u00e0 ses p\u00e9rils et risques.\" Une telle vente ressemble \u00e0 un coup de filet.\nCette derni\u00e8re citation de Merlin fait voir que le droit fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, est le m\u00e9me que celui de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Notre article 1510 a r\u00e9gl\u00e9 la question.\nD'apr\u00e8s ces autorit\u00e9s, l'intim\u00e9 ayant c\u00e9d\u00e9 un droit incorporel n'existant pas comme droit cessible au moment de la cession, est tenu d'indemniser l'acqu\u00e9reur auquel il n'a pu faire d\u00e9livrance du droit c\u00e9d\u00e9, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne fasse preuve des circonstances ayant l'effet de l'exempter de cette responsabilit\u00e9. Il n'en a pas m\u00eame tent\u00e9 la preuve.\nIl v a aussi lieu dans le cas de garantie de faits et promesses comme dans le cas de non garantie, (les deux ayant le m\u00e9me effet en loi) \u00e0 la restitution du prix de la chose vendue ou c\u00e9d\u00e9e lorsqu'il y a eu \u00e9viction ou que la chose n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ou n'a pu \u00eatre d\u00e9livr\u00e9e.\nDans le cas actuel il ne s'agit pas d'\u00e9viction, parce qu'il n'y a pas eu d\u00e9livrance des droits, et que cons\u00e9quemment l'appelant n'a pu \u00eatre \u00e9vinc\u00e9 d'une chose dont ii n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en possession. C'est ce d\u00e9faut de tradition qui est la base de la pr\u00e9sente action. Ce d\u00e9faut de tradition est constat\u00e9 par le jugement cite plus haut, de la cour du Banc de la Reine, pass\u00e9 en force de chose jug\u00e9e, d\u00e9clarant les droits en question incessibles.\nL'intim\u00e9 est done l\u00e9galement tenu \u00e0 la restitution demand\u00e9e,\na moins qu\u2019il ne soit prouv\u00e9 (suivant l'article 1510, ) que l'acheteur n'ait connu lors de la vente le danger d'\u00e9viction, o\u00f9 qu'il n'ait achet\u00e9 \u00e0 ses risques et p\u00e9rils.\nIl est important de ne pas perdre de vue que c'est l'exception invoqu\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9, que l'appelant avait accept\u00e9 cette cession \u00e0 ses risques et p\u00e9rils. La question se r\u00e9duit done \u00e0 savoir s'il a fait preuve de cette all\u00e9gation.\nL'intim\u00e9 n'a absolument fait aucune preuve que l'appelant a achet\u00e9 \u00e0 ses risques et p\u00e9rils, ni qu'il a connu lors de la cession le caract\u00e8re incessible des droits c\u00e9d\u00e9s. C'\u00e9tait \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 faire cette preuve comme le veut l'article 1510, et comme le dit positivement l'autorit\u00e9 de Merlin cite ci-dessus\nLoin d'avoir fait cette preuve, ii est au contraire prouv\u00e9 par le t\u00e9moin Talbot que l'appelant n'aurait pas achet\u00e9 sans la consid\u00e9ration des droits et privil\u00e8ges c\u00e9d\u00e9s, parce qu'il attachait plus de prix aux privil\u00e8ges qu'\u00e0 la fromagerie. La m\u00e9me chose est prouv\u00e9e par Monsieur Bernatchez, qui dit:\nSans ces privil\u00e8ges l'appelant n'aurait pas achet\u00e9 d'apr\u00e8s ce qu'il m'a dit, il disait qu'il consid\u00e9rait que c'\u00e9tait le succ\u00e8s de l'\u00e9tablissement, je lui ai parl\u00e9 du prix que j'attachais \u00e0 ces privil\u00e8ges, la raison que j'avais et que je lui donnais, c'est que je consid\u00e9rais que les cultivateurs \u00e9tant li\u00e9s par l'acte de mil huit cent quatre-vingt-un, vu qu'il y avait un jugement en ce sens l\u00e0 \u00e0 la cour de Circuit de Montmagny sans doute que le demandeur Deniers croyait acheter un droit utile contre les personnes, au moins il me l'a dit. Dans mon opinion la fromagerie, avec ses accessoires, au moment de la vente de Deniers valait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e9s deux mille piastres, car le terrain est sujet \u00e0 charge de rente. J'\u00e9value \u00e0 au moins cinq mille piastres les droits on privil\u00e8ges si le demandeur pouvait les mettre \u00e0 effet, Sans ces privil\u00e8ges le reste ne vaut pas deux mille piastres.\nIl est \u00e9vident par ces t\u00e9moignages que l'appelant ne croyait nullement s'exposer au danger d'\u00e9viction, ni encore moins acheter \u00e0 ses risques des droits dont ii savait l'existence confirm\u00e9 par un jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nLa somme consid\u00e9rable de $3500, \u00e0 laquelle ces droits avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s an moment de la vente par l\u2019intim\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame, et par Talbot le procureur de l'appelant, et r\u00e9ellement pay\u00e9s par ce dernier repousse toute id\u00e9e que la transaction ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite avec la connaissance du danger d'\u00e9viction et l'intention d'encourir les risques. La position de fortune des parties qui sont des cultivateurs de moyens ordinaires, ne permet pas de pr\u00e9sumer qu'ils ont voulu faire une transaction al\u00e9atoire un coup de filet comme dit l'autorit\u00e9 ci-dessus d'un montant aussi consid\u00e9rable, pouvant entra\u00eener leur ruine; ils avaient tons deux de justes raisons de croire \u00e0 la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la cession qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par un jugement de la cour de Circuit d'abord, ensuite par un autre jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Il est vrai que plus tard un jugement de la cour du Bane de la Reine a fait conna\u00eetre aux parties, mais longtemps apr\u00e8s l'acte de cession que les droits en question \u00e9taient incessibles. Ce fait, post\u00e9rieur de beaucoup \u00e0 la cession, constate bien que les parties \u00e9taient dans l'erreur sur le droit \u00e0 ce sujet mais ne milite aucunement contre leur bonne foi lors de la vente. L'appelant croyait bien acheter les droits en question et l'intim\u00e9 les lui vendait pour la somme do $3,500.\nIl n'y a certainement pas eu vente aux risques et p\u00e9rils de l'acheteur ; d'abord l'acte de cession n'en fait aucune mention et puis il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait aucune preuve quelconque \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. C'est une pure assertion dont l\u00e5 fausset\u00e9 est \u00e9vidente. Il n'y a en dans cette transaction qu'une erreur commune aux deux parties sur le caract\u00e8re incessible des droits c\u00e9d\u00e9s.\nRien dans les circonstances qui ont accompagne cette transaction ne peut faire pr\u00e9sumer que la cession avait un caract\u00e8re al\u00e9atoire; la stipulation de garantie de faits et promesses qui de sa nature, emporte la garantie de l'existence des droits, contredit absolument toute supposition de ce genre. Les expressions employ\u00e9es pour qualifier les droits c\u00e9d\u00e9s, savoir:\nTous les droits pour le temps qui reste \u00e0 courir, etc .............................\nTous les droits one le dit sieur Norbert Duhaime peut avoir avec une certaine partie des habitants de St-Thomas, en vertu d'un acte ne comportent pas l'id\u00e9e d'incertitude des droits.\nL'acte authentique les \u00e9tablissant n'est cite \u00e9videmment que pour faire voir que l'existence de ces droits n'a rien d'incertain mais qu'au contraire ils existent en vertu d'un bon titre en forme authentique. Ce ne sont donc pas des droits incertains qui sont c\u00e9d\u00e9s. L'expression \" tous les droits qu'il peut avoir \" en ce quelle a de vague et d'incertain, ne s'applique pas \u00e0 l'existence des droits mais seulement \u00e0 leur \u00e9tendue et pour signifier que la cession en est faite sans restriction. C'est l'expression ordinairement employ\u00e9e par les notaires, et elle na pas d'autre signification que celle que je viens de mentionner.\nInd\u00e9pendamment de l'article 1510 donnant clairement le droit de rep\u00e9ter le prix pay\u00e9, l'appelant aurait encore un droit non moins certainement \u00e9tabli de se faire rembourser sur le principe qu'il y a eu erreur dans le contrat de cession. Cette erreur comme ii a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit plus haut est certaine, et repose sur la nature m\u00e9me du contrat intervenu entre les parties sur la substance de la chose qui en fait l'objet. C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 ment ce qui est arriv\u00e9 dans le cas actuel, l'erreur porte sur le caract\u00e8re des droits c\u00e9d\u00e9s qui au lieu d\u2019\u00eatre cessibles comme on le pensait \u00e9taient au contraire incessibles. L'erreur reposant donc sur la nature m\u00e9me du contrat qui n'est pas du tout une cession de droits comme on a voulu en faire une, puisque la loi ne permet pas une telle cession. Ce serait done le cas de faire l'application de l'article 992 C. C.\nL'erreur n'est une cause de nu1lit\u00e9 que lorsqu'elle tombe sur la nature m\u00eame du contrat, sur la substance de la chose qui en fait l'objet, ou sur quelque chose qui soit une consideration principale qui ait engag\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire.\nLa cession en question serait done nulle pour cause d'erreur, mais l'intim\u00e9 ne pourait faire valoir ce moyen que par un amendement de son action de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 la faire concorder avec la preuve. La cour peut accorder cet amendement en vertu de la section 63.\nDans tous les cas cette erreur \u00e9vidente sur la nature du droit c\u00e9d\u00e9, fait voir que les parties avaient l'intention de faire un contrat s\u00e9rieux, n'ayant aucun caract\u00e8re al\u00e9atoire.\nL'intim\u00e9 se trouve ainsi avoir re\u00e7u sans cause ni consid\u00e9ration et par erreur de droit, ce qui ne lui \u00e9tait pas du, ii est en cons\u00e9quence oblige de le restituer d'apr\u00e8s l'article 1047 0. 0.\nMais l'appelant peut se dispenser d'invoquer le moyen d\u2019erreur, car son droit de rep\u00e9ter les deniers pay\u00e9s, fond\u00e9 sur l'article 1510, est suffisant pour lui assurer gain de cause.\nL'intim\u00e9 s'est plaint que l'action ne concluait qu'au remboursement du prix pay\u00e9 pour la cession des droits, sans offrir de lui remettre la manufacture ou fromagerie; il se trouve de cette mani\u00e8re dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 de tirer aucun parti de ses droits. Cependant sa position sons ce rapport est moins difficile que celle de l'appellant qui, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, reste avec la manufacture sans avoir aucun droit de s'assurer le lait n\u00e9cessaire pour l'exploiter, luette position. a paru faire impression, et a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme donnant \u00e0 l'appelant un grand avantage sur l'intim\u00e9. C'est au contraire la position de 1 intim\u00e9 qui est la plus favorable. Rest\u00e9 en possession des droits qu'il n'a Pu c\u00e9der, leur transaction \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e9tant d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle par la cour du 13ane de la Reine, il est n\u00e9cessairement encore investi de tous ses droits \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s ce jugement, il aurait Pu et peut encore sans danger quelconque, \u00e9lever une autre b\u00e2tisse dans la m\u00e9me ville (Montmagny), \u00e0 quelques pas de celle de l'appelant, et continuer la jouissance de ses droits. Ii est impossible, an contraire, \u00e0 l'appelant de le faire, car les cultivateurs qui s'\u00e9taient engages envers Duhaime, le sont encore et doivent lui continuer la fourniture du lait. Il a le droit de les y contraindre, ce que ne poss\u00e8de pas l'appelant. Celui-ci d'ailleurs pouvait-il exercer une autre action que celle qu'il a prise? Dans d'autres circonstances, ii pourrait sans doute y avoir lieu, en vertu de l'article 1517 C. C. \u00e0 l'action en rescision. Mais dans le cas actuel, de quelle utilit\u00e9 pouvait \u00eatre une demande en rescision d'une cession qui n'a pas eu lieu d'apr\u00e8s la cour du Bane de la Reine, et qu'elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle de plein droit? Ii ne lui restait pas d'autres recours que l'action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition que lui reconna\u00eet l'article 1518, C. C, et qu'il a exerc\u00e9 par sa pr\u00e9sente action pour se faire rembourser le prix de la chose vendue les droits) qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9e. C'est \u00e0 l'appelant seul, comme acheteur, qu'il appartient de faire le choix des actions accord\u00e9es parles articles 1517 et 1518 C. C, savoir; de demander la rescision de la vente, ou la valeur de la partie de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 non livr\u00e9e on dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vinc\u00e9, proportionnellement au total du prix.\nOn a pr\u00e9tendu que la preuve testimoniale faite en cette cause est ill\u00e9gale, comme tendant \u00e0 contredire l'acte de vente en forme authentique, et contraire \u00e0 l'article 1234 0.0. C'est une ne erreur qui n'a d'autre cause qu'une m\u00e9prise sur le caract\u00e8re de l'action dont il s'agit. L'action n'est pas une en garantie d\u00e9coulant du contrat, puisque le contrat n'a pas eu lieu pour la partie dont se plaint l'appelant, et elle n'est pas non plus fond\u00e9e sur une convention Elle n'est que la cons\u00e9quence de l'inex\u00e9cution du contrat de l'intim\u00e9. Ii est \u00e9vident qu'il \u00e9tait impossible \u00e0 l'appelant de pr\u00e9voir que l'intim\u00e9 n'ex\u00e9cuterait pas son contrat, et de se procurer d'avance une preuve \u00e9crite pour ce cas. D'apr\u00e8s le paragraphe 5 de l'article 1233, dans le cas d'obligations r\u00e9sultant des quasi-contrats, d\u00e9lits et quasi-d\u00e9lits et dans tous les autres cas o\u00f9 la partie r\u00e9clamante n'a pu se procurer une preuve \u00e9crite, la preuve testimoniale est admise. L'action n'\u00e9tant fond\u00e9e que sur des faits comme l'erreur et le d\u00e9faut de tradition qui peuvent toujours se prouver par la preuve testimoniale, la preuve faite est l\u00e9gale. L'objection \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est tout \u00e0 fait mal fond\u00e9e.\nOn a encore soulev\u00e9 contre l'action la question du d\u00e9faut d'int\u00e9r\u00eat, en se fondant sur la maxime que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat est la mesure des actions Les intim\u00e9s ont insist\u00e9 sur ce moyen dans leur factum et \u00e0 l'audition, bien que la cour du Banc de la Reine n'en ait fait aucune mention dans son jugement. C'est avec raison qu'elle s'est abstenue d'y faire allusion, car ce moyen n'est nullement fond\u00e9.\nL'appelant, interrog\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin a dit, il est vrai:\n\"qu'il ne se connaissai pas d'int\u00e9r\u00eat \" voulant dire qu'il ne se connaissait pas d'int\u00e9r\u00eat actuel. Mais voyons si son explication confirme ce qu'il croit \u00e0 tort, sans aucun doute. Il admet qu'apr\u00e8s avoir achet\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9 l\u2019immeuble en question, ii l'a ensuite revendu, mais sans garantie \u00e0 Nazaire Bernatchez. Ne connaissant pas la signification l\u00e9gale des mots v vente sans garantie, \"il est \u00e9vident que lorsqu'il a r\u00e9pondu comme ii l'a fait ii pensait n'\u00eatre dans aucun cas tenu de rendre le prix re\u00e7u mais on a vu plus haut que les expressions de vente faite sans garantie, ou avec exclusion, ou avec simple garantie de faits et promesses, signifiaient en toi la m\u00e9me chose; et que dans chacun de ces cas, lorsqu'il y a \u00e9viction, le vendeur n'en est pas moins tenu de rendre le prix qu'il a touch\u00e9 Il est \u00e9vident que l'appelant est expos\u00e9 de la part de son acheteur \u00e0 une action semblable \u00e0 celle qu'il exerce en cette causer Pour \u00e9viter le nombre d'actions r\u00e9sultant des ventes successives qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites ii a consenti \u00e0 prendre l'initiative en permettant de porter l'action en son nom H reconna\u00eet toutefois dans son t\u00e9moignage que s'il r\u00e9ussit le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice sera pour les propri\u00e9taires actuels, ce qui aurait l'effet d'emp\u00eacher des poursuites de la part des diff\u00e9rents acheteurs contre leurs vendeurs respectifs en leur faisant \u00e9viter par l\u00e0 m\u00e9me une action de la part de leur acheteur. Il s'exprime ainsi \u00e0 ce sujet.\nR\u2014Le montant du jugement, si jugement est rendu en cette cause, ira je suppose \u00e0 satisfaire les pr\u00e9sents propri\u00e9taires au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de ceux dont ils out achet\u00e9. Les propri\u00e9taires actuels auront le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du jugement au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de ceux qui ont vendu. Je leur ai permis de prendre l'action en mon nom, parce qu'on ma dit qu'il y avait eu une injustice de commise de la part de celui de qui j'avais achet\u00e9.\nIl a \u00e9videmment int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 porter la pr\u00e9sente action, afin d'emp\u00eacher son acheteur, Nazaire Bernatchez, d'en porter une semblable contre lui.\nPour intenter une action il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire (dit Pigeau (1) ) que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat soit actuel, il suffit qu'il puisse un jour se. \u00e9aliser et s'effectuer, pour qu'on puisse actionner \u00e0 l'effet de repousser tout ce qui pourrait nous emp\u00eacher de le recueillir.\nCette action en restitution du prix n'appartenant qu'\u00e0 I'appelant, qui ne peut l'exercer que contre celui avec qui ii a contract\u00e9. Le conseil priv\u00e9 l'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ainsi dans la cause de The Chaudi\u00e8re Gold Mining Company of Boston, vs. Desbaratsi et al ([4]).\nQue le droit \u00e0 la restitution du prix de vente est ind\u00e9pendant de la garantie et n'a d'existence qu'entre les parties imm\u00e9diates. De tout ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de je conclus 1o que l'appelant a un int\u00e9r\u00eat suffisant pour porter la pr\u00e9sente action; 2V qu'elle est bien dirig\u00e9e suivant la d\u00e9cision du Conseil Priv\u00e9; 30 qu'il y a lieu \u00e0 1t restitution du prix paye pour d\u00e9faut de consid\u00e9ration et pour cause d'erreur de droit. Pour ces motifs je suis d'avis d'accorder l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion to dismiss this appeal. The appellant's action was rightly dismissed in the courts below.\nThe very first of his allegations of facts is unfounded. He says that the $7,000, price of the sale by Duhaime to him, were for the factory and the rights that Duhaime had against a certain number of farmers. Now, on the very face of the deed of sale itself that is not so. The sale is of a certain lot of ground and cheese factory, in consideration of which alone seven thousand dollars is agreed upon. It is only by a subsequent clause of the deed that a cession or transfer of Duhaime's rights against certain farmers is agreed upon, without any mention of price.\n2nd. Assuming that this transfer of rights formed part of the consideration for the $7,000, the appellant's action also fails. The respondent received the price and is still in possession of what he sold, says the appellant, citing Iniquum emptorem carere re et pretio. Now, that is not so. The respondent has not got rem et pretium. By the sale of the factory to the appellant the respondent lost all his rights against the farmers under his agreement with them of December, 1881. He got $5,000 for these rights from the appellant, according to appellant's contention, but he lost them by the sale to appellant, so that he did nothing else but to actually sell for $5,000, what to him was worth $8,000. By the sale, however, says the appellant, these rights were extinguished, and I did not get them. That may be or may not be. The Court of Queen's Bench judgment on this is not resjudicata against Duhaime. But assuming it to be so, the sale, as I have remarked, deprived the respondent thereof, though it may not have vested them in the appellant. Duhaime without the factory has no rights against the farmers. Under these circumstances the only action Deniers had against him was one to resiliate the sale altogether, returning him the land and factory. But because Demers has put himself in the impossibility to do so it does not follow that this present action lies. If it did Duhaime would have lost all his rights against the farmers, without compensation and through Demers' fault.\nThen another consideration is conclusive against the action.\nDemers admits that he has no interest in this case, that the action is brought in his name by Numa Bernatchez and others who have bought from Nazaire Bernatchez, to whom he, Demers, had sold.\nNow, Demers sold for $7,500, making a clear profit of $500. And he sold only what Duhaime had a right to sell. \u00a1So that his vendee has no recourse whatever against him if Duhaime had no right to transfer this agreement with the farmers. Under the circumstances, the courts below were decidedly right in holding that Demers' action could not be maintained. Then apart from all this the sale by Nazaire Bernatchez to Numa Bernatchez is not produced. The real plaintiffs have not proven their title.\nI am of opinion to dismiss this appeal with costs in all the courts.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014There is no foundation whatever, in my opinion, for this appeal.\nThe respondent sold a cheese factory and a piece of land to the appellant for the sum of seven thousand dollars, and by the deed conveying it he ceded and transferred to the appellant sous simple garantie de ses faits et promesses, all the rights, whatever they might be, which the respondent could have with a certain portion of the inhabitants of St. Thomas in virtue of a certain deed entered into by and between such persons and the respondent, and bearing date the 8th of December, 1881. What rights the respondent had under such deed, and whether they were capable of passing by assignment to a purchaser of the respondent s cheese factory, was a question of law, the effect and extent of which the appellant was bound to know equally as vas the respondent. The respondent did not guarantee the appellant in the actual receipt from the farmers, parties to the deed of their milk. In the absence of such a guarantee the appellant must be taken to have known that what was ceded to him (in so far as the agreement between the farmers and the respondent as to the milk of the former was concerned), was what the respondent could cede and the appellant could take; and that, therefore, he took an assignment of all the respondent's rights under the deed at his, the appellant's, own risk as to the value to him of such assignment. That it was of value to him and that he got full benefit of all that he bought appears from the fact that he sold what he bought at an advance of $500.\nThe contention that he is liable to his vendees to the same extent that he seeks in the present action to recover from the respondent is a begging of a question supposed to be possible to arise between him and his vendees which it will be time enough to determine if, and when, it does arise. As the matter now stands, it appears that appellant received full benefit of all that he bought from the respondent, for he has sold it at an advance and in such case he has no claim as for reimbursement of a price paid for a thing sold to the appellant, of which he has not received any benefit. Moreover, there was no distinct sum which can be said to have been paid by the appellant as the price of the assignment to him of the respondent's rights under the deed in relation to the milk which can be recovered as a price paid for a thing sold but not delivered.\nThe fact, also, that the appellant admits that he has no interest in this action, and that he has in fact allowed his name to be used by and on behalf of a company, who are at present owners of the cheese factory which the respondent sold to the appellant, but whose interest, if any they have in the agreement as to the milk, does not appear and who are not shown to have been in any manner prejudiced by reason of any thing connected with the contract as to milk, which was entered into between the farmers and the respondent is sufficient in itself to the determination of the present action adversely to the appellant.\nI concur, therefore, in the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Belleau, Stafford & Belleau.\nSolicitor for respondent : Jos.

The plaintiff (appellant) claimed by his declaration $5,000 damages and prayed that the defendants be ordered to enter in the minute book of the Scholl Commissioners the judgment in the cause, and that the same be read at the church door of St. Philippe two consecutive Sundays. The case was tried before a judge without a jury and the plaintiff was awarded $200 damages. The defendants thereupon appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) and the plaintiff did not file any cross-appeal, but contended that the judgment for $200 should be affirmed. The Court of Queen's Bench., setting aside the judgment of the Superior Court, held that a retraction made by the defendants and a tender of $40 for damages and the costs of an action of $40 were sufficient, and dismissed the plaintiff's action for the surplus.\nThe plaintiff thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nLacoste Q.O. and Pagnuelo Q.C. appeared on behalf of the appellant, and Geoffrion Q.C. and Robidoux on behalf of the respondents.\nAt the opening of the argument Taschereau J. raised an objection as to the jurisdiction of the court, the amount in controversy being under $2,000.\nPagnuelo Q.C. argued that the jurisprudence of this court on this question had been settled by the decision of the court in Joyce v.

L, which by its terms had become payable to those entitled to the same, but to one half of which sum rival claims were put in. The appellants, as collateral heirs of the deceased, by a petition claimed the whole of the three thousand dollars, and the respondent (mise-en-cause petitioner), the widow of the deceased, by a counter petition claimed as commune en biens one half; and, in her answer to the appellants' petition, prayed that in so far as it claimed any greater sum than one half, it should be dismissed. After issue joined the Superior Court awarded one half to the appellants, and the other half to the respondent. From this judgment the appellants appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) and that court confirmed the judgment of the Superior Court. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld\u2014That the sum or value of the matter in controversy between the parties being only $1,500, the case was not appealable. R. S. C. ch. 135 sec. 29. (Fournier J. dubitante).\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal side) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe question raised in this case was as to whether the collateral heirs of a deceased husband were entitled to claim the whole of the monies accruing from an insurance effected on his life, as against his widow, who claimed one half of it, as having been commune en biens with him.\nOn the 3rd day of April, 1875, Louis Labelle insured his life at the \u00c6tna Life Insurance Company for the sum of $3,000.00, payable ninety days after his death, to his executors, administrators or assigns. Labelle died intestate and without issue, in December, 1886, and the company, to avoid any responsibility arising out of the conflicting claims on the money, deposited the sum of $3,000.00 in the hands of John S. Honey and others, joint prothonotary of the Superior Court.\nThe appellants who in the absence of children are the collateral heirs of the deceased demanded by their petition that the prothonotary be ordered to pay them the amount so deposited in their hands.\nThe respondent, Emma Barbeau, widow of the deceased Louis Labelle, resisted their demand, on the ground that the insurance policy on which the sum now in the hands of the prothonotary has been paid, having been effected during the community which existed between her and her late husband and the premiums paid by the community, the sum belongs to the community, and she asked for an order on the prothonotary to pay her one half of the said sum of $3,000.00, viz., $1,500.00.\nThe respondent's claim to the $1,500 having been maintained by the courts below the appellants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nTrenholme for respondent moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the amount claimed and in controversy between the parties was only half of the $3,000 deposited in court.\nLaflamme Q.C. contra. The real question is a policy of $3,000, and the court will have to adjudicate upon the whole amount deposited, viz., $3,000. If the company had paid the $1,500 to the wife, we would have claimed the $3000.\n[TASCHEREAU J.\u2014The contestation in this case is only as to wife's share, and that is under the $2000 necessary to give jurisdiction.]\nTrenholme.\u2014The respondent does not dispute the heirs' claim to the $1500 and I cannot see how the case can be brought under section 29 of R. S. C. ch.135.\nSTRONG J.\u2014In this case the opinion of the majority of the court is that we have no jurisdiction. We need not rest our decision upon Allan v.

S. C., ch. 162, sec. 34\u2014R. S. C., ch. 174, sec. 216.\nAn assault on a constable attempting to serve a summons issued by a magistrate on information charging violation of the Canada Temperance Act is an assault on a peace officer in the due execution of his duty and indictable under R. S. C., ch. 162, sec. 34.\nOn the trial of an indictment for such assault the wife of the defendant is not a competent witness on his behalf.\nAppeal from a decision of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved for the Province of New Brunswick, affirming the conviction of the appellant on an indictment for assaulting a constable in discharge of his duty.\nThe constable was entrusted with the service of a summons against the appellant for violation of the Canada Temperance Act. Not finding him at his place of business he went to the appellant's house and met him coming out. It was after dark, and the constable asked appellant to return to the house for a light to enable him to pick out the summons from among others, which appellant refused to do, and walked away from the house. The constable followed, and after proceeding some distance appellant threatened to split his head open with a stick which he carried. After making this threat he knocked the constable down, and his wife, who was with him, kicked the constable as he lay on the ground. A person who had accompanied the constable came to his assistance, and having procured a light the summons was served. Appellant was indicted for the assault, and convicted. The following questions were reserved for the consideration of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved:\n1. Was the service of a duplicate summons a proper service under the Act?\n2. Were the appellant and his wife competent witnesses for the defence on the trial of the indictment?\n3. Was the constable acting in the discharge of his duty when the assault was committed?\nThe first question was abandoned at the argument.\nThe Court of Crown Cases Reserved affirmed the conviction, Palmer J. dissenting, and from their decision the present appeal was brought to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nJ. A. Vanwart for the appellant.\nR. J. Ritchie, Solicitor-General of New Brunswick, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that the defendant was properly convicted and that this appeal must fail.\nThe first point was virtually abandoned on the argument, and very properly so, for there cannot be any doubt that the service of a summons is properly effected by delivering a duplicate or copy to the defendant.\nThat the constable Jones was in the execution of his duty as a constable or peace officer when he was assaulted by the defendant whom he was endeavouring at the time to serve with the summons must, I think, necessarily result from the provision of the statute, which says that the service may be by a constable or peace officer, inasmuch as by the 14th section of the statute, it was made the imperative duty of the constable to serve a summons delivered to him by the magistrate. Then Jones was endeavouring to serve the summons when he was assaulted by the defendant, and therefore he was assaulted when in the course of the execution of his duty. That this duty being one imposed by statute, and not a common law duty of a peace officer, can make no difference as regards the applicability of the statutory provision creating the special offence for which the defendant was indicted, inasmuch as the duty to serve the summons was imposed upon the prosecutor ex officio in his character as a constable or peace officer.\nThe only remaining question is whether the evidence of Jones and his wife, tendered at the trial on behalf of the defendant, was properly rejected, and I am of opinion that upon this point also the ruling of the learned Chief Justice was entirely right. Such evidence under the statute is only admissible where the defendant is charged with simple assault and battery, which must be taken to mean the old common law misdemeanor answering to that description. The defendant was not indicted for this offence, but for the statutory offence of assaulting a peace officer in the execution of his duty. Upon this point the case of Reg. v. Richardson[1] is direct authority against the appeal, and I see no answer to it.\nIn my opinion, there does not exist any reason for doubting that the ruling of the Chief Justice at the trial, and the judgment of the Supreme Court in banc, were correct.\nThe appeal must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed and conviction affirmed.\nSolicitor for appellant: J. A. Vanwart.\nSolicitor for respondent: Solicitor-General of New Brunswick.\n[1] 46 U. C. Q. R. 375.\n"}

Notice of intention to appeal was immediately given but the case in appeal was not filed in the Supreme Court until Feb. 18th, 1889.\nHeld\u2014That the appeal was not brought within sixty days from the date on which the judgment sought to be appealed from was pronounced and there was no jurisdiction to hear it.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court in a proceeding by writ of habeas corpus.\nThe writ was issued by David Smart to obtain the possession of his children from their mother. After the case had been opened before Mr. Justice Ferguson he made an order directing that no further proceedings be taken on the writ but that the matter should be brought before the court by way of petition by the applicant[2]. On appeal from this order the Divisional Court varied it by directing that the writ of habeas corpus should remain in force, and that the questions for trial under the return thereto should be tried at the same time and place as the questions under the petition directed by said order to be filed[3]. The judgment of the Divisional Court was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The mother of the infant children then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, seeking to have the original order of Mr. Justice Ferguson restored.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal was pronounced on Nov. 13th, 1888. Notice of intention to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was given by the mother a few days after, but nothing was done in the way of prosecuting the appeal until Feb. 18th, 1889, when the record was filed in the office of the registrar of the Supreme Court. The appellants obtained no order for the allowance of the appeal, and in a habeas corpus case no security for costs is required.\nOn March 19th, 1889, Gormully moved that the appeal be quashed for want of jurisdiction, or that an early day be fixed for the hearing. The court directed the registrar to have it placed at the head of the Ontario cases for the February session and the motion to quash to stand until the hearing.\nS.H.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, from which the present appeal is brought, was pronounced on the 13th day of November, 1888. Notice of the appellant\u2019s intention to appeal to this court was given within a short time after the judgment, but no actual proceeding in such appeal was taken until the case or record now before us was filed in the office of the registrar of this court, on the 18th day of February, 1889. In appeals in habeas corpus proceedings, no security being required, the first proceeding must necessarily be the filing of the case in the Supreme Court, and that step must be taken within sixty days from the date on which the judgment appealed from was pronounced, there being nothing in the Act of Parliament[4] which governs the jurisdiction and procedure of the court exempting habeas corpus appeals from the operation of the 40th section of the statute. It is therefore impossible to do otherwise than quash the appeal which the court has no jurisdiction to entertain either by enlargement of the time or otherwise.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Blake, Lash & Cassels.\nSolicitor for respondent: H.J.

(Sir W. J. Ritchie C.J. dissenting. )\nPer Strong J.\u2014Every contribution to a public purpose imposed by superior authority is a ''tax\" APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court ([1]). This was an action brought to recover $361.90, the amount of a special assessment for a drain along the property of the defendants.\nThe amount of the taxes was not contested, but by a special plea the defendants contended that their property was exempt from taxation, because the said property was at the time of the construction of the drain as it has since continued to be an educational institution receiving no grant from the Corporation or Municipality of Montreal in which it is situated.\nThe answer to the plea was that the exemption claimed by the defendants did not apply to the taxes and assessments claimed by the action.\nThe facts of the case were admitted by the parties and it was agreed that the city's claim was for a special assessment for a local improvement, and that the property was destined to the purposes of education, and received no subsidy from the municipality.\nOn the 11th October, 1888, Ethier, counsel for the respondent moved to quash the appeal, on the ground that the matter in controversy was under $2,000, and did not come within any of the exceptions in sec. 29 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act. Geoffrion Q.C. contra.\nPer Curiam. The case is appealable as coming within the words\" such like matters or things where the rights in future might be bound \" in par. 6 of sec. 29 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act\u2014If the rate struck was found to be insufficient and another rate imposed, the parties would be bound by the judgment in this case. On the merits-Geoffrion Q.C., for the appellants (defendants) contended that under 41 Vic. ch 6 sec. 26 (P.Q.), every educational institution receiving no grant from the Corporation of the City of Montreal is exempt from all municipal and school taxes and that the words used in the Act include all taxes rates or assessments. See Arts. 19, sec. 22, 712 and 713 Mun. C., Wylie v. City of Montreal ([2]); City of .Montreal v. Christ Church Cathedral ([3]).\nEthier for respondent (plaintiff) contended that the exemption did not extend to special assessments for improvements and that a special assessment levied on an immovable property in proportion to the benefit it derives from a local improvement, is not a tax, in the true sense of the word : it is now acknowledged by the best authorities on municipal taxation that a tax is an impost which is to be borne by all the members of a corporation for the general advantage and in the interest of the public ; on the contrary a special assessment is a certain share the proprietors of a limited locality are called upon to contribute according to the increase in value given their properties by a local improvement numerous decisions based on this distinction have been pronounced by the courts of the neighboring Republic, where, it may be readily conceded, the theory of municipal government is thoroughly understood.\nSee Maxwell on Statutes ([4]) ; Cooley on Taxation ([5]) ; Angel on Highways ([6]) ; Hilliard on Taxation ([7]) ; Burroughs on Taxation ([8]) ; Abbott on Law of Corporations ([9]) ; Potter on Corporations ([10]) ; Kirby v. .Shaw ([11]); Wright v. Boston ([12]); Hayden v. Atlanta ([13]); Municipal Code L. C. O. ([14]) ; Municipal Laws of Montreal, 1865, Grlackmeyer ([15]) ; Municipal Laws of Montreal, 1870, Grlackmeyer ([16]) ; Haynss v.

C. for L. C. arts. 2009 & 2011 ; See also 46 Vic. ch. 78 sec. 21, (Quebec).\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I am of opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG J. The enactment upon which the decision of this appeal turns is that contained in Statute 41 Vic. cap. 6 sec. 26 being an amendment or addition to the Common School Act cap. 15 of Con Stats of Lower Canada.\nIt exempts all educational houses or establishments which do not receive any subvention from the corporation or municipality in which they are situated, from municipal and school assessments (des cotisations) w whatever may be the act in virtue of which such assessments are imposed, and notwithstanding all \" dispositions to the contrary.\"\nWhat is sought to be recovered from the appellants is a contribution or sum assessed in respect of a drain constructed by the corporation in front of the appellants' property situated in the city of Montreal.\nUnder the Act of incorporation of the city of Montreal the appellants, like other property owners, would be liable to pay this contribution, unless they can bring themselves within this exemption in 41 Vic.\nThe appellants receive no subvention or pecuniary aid of any kind from the city. Their exemption, therefore, must depend on the single point whether this assessment or charge in respect of a contribution to the drain is or is not a municipal assessment.\nWith great respect for the Court of Appeal, I think there can be little doubt on this point. The appellants are undoubtedy asssessed\" by the city in respect of the contribution which it is sought to compel them to pay for I understand the word assessment to imply t the assessment of a tax \" Then the appellants are taxed for this drain, for every contribution to a public purpose imposed by superior authority is a t tax \" and nothing less. The city is therefore seeking to compel the payment of this contribution in direct contravention of the terms of the enactment referred to which clearly exempts the appellants.\nFor these reasons, which are fully and ably set forth in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Church in the Court of Appeal and in that of Mr. Justice Loranger in the Superior Court, I am of opinion that we must allow this appeal with costs to the appellants here, as well as in all the courts below.\nFOURNIER J.__Par son action en cette cause l'intim\u00e9e r\u00e9clame des appelants la somme de $361 90. pour taxes et cotisations impos\u00e9es suivant la loi et les r\u00e8glements de la corporation de la cite de Montr\u00e9al, pour la contribution des appelants \u00e0 un \u00e9gout ou canal, construit en 1878, en face do leur propri\u00e9t\u00e9 portant le n 1717, dans le quartier Saint-Antoine de la dite cit\u00e9.\nEn r\u00e9ponee \u00e0 cetee demande les appelants out plaid\u00e9 qu lls poss\u00e9daient et occupaeent cetee propri\u00e9t\u00e9 aux dates mentionn\u00e9es en la declaration et encore actuellement comme maison d'\u00e9ducation et los d\u00e9pendances d'icelle \u2014ne recevant aucune subvention de la corporation ou Municipalite de la dite cite de Montr\u00e9al o\u00f9 cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est situ\u00e9e.\nPar sa r\u00e9ponee \u00e0 ce plaidoyer, l'intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question n'est pas exemptee des cotisations municipales et scolaires et notamment de celles r\u00e9clam\u00e9es en cette cause.\nLa preuve a ete faite au moyen d'une admission couvrant tous les faits Qu'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire d'\u00e9tablir pour la decision du litige.\nAu m\u00e9rite, l'honorable juge Loranger a rendu jugement maintenant l'exemption de taxes invoqu\u00e9e par les appelants, mais son jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9 par la cour du Banc de la Reine pour la raison que l'intim\u00e9e avait le droit de faire cet ouvrage et d'en r\u00e9partir le co\u00fbt parmi les personnes dont les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s devaient en profiter ; et aussi parce que l'ouvrage en question \u00e9tant d'un caract\u00e8re local pour des fins tout \u00e0 fait locales et \u00e0 l'avantage special de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des appelants, la cotisation pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e pour en d\u00e9frayer les d\u00e9penses n'\u00e9tait pas de la natuee d'une taxe municipale conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'acte 41 Vict. ch. 6 sec. 26 mais qu'elle \u00e9tait au contraire d'une nature purement locale.\nLa questinn soueev\u00e9e par cetee contestation est de savoir si l'exemption de taxes municipales et scolaires accord\u00e9e par le l\u00e8me Vict., ch. 6, sec. 26, comprend aussi l'exemption de cotisations sp\u00e9ciales impos\u00e9es sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u0141re pour ameliorations dans une localit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re de la municipalit\u00e9.\nL'exemption dont il s'agtt est \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans les termes suivants '.\n3.

La difference entre les deux causes est que clans la premi\u00e8re les taxes r\u00e9clam\u00e9es, ne comprenaient pas comme celles-ci une cotisation sp\u00e9ciale pour amelioration locale \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re. .La question \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre se r\u00e9duit donc \u00e0 savoir si les expressions de la sec. 26 c cotisations municipales,' comprennent aussi les cotisations speciales dune natuee locale.\nAvant l'adoption de la sec. 26, le principle de lexemption de taxes scolaires en faveur des institutions d'\u00e9ducation \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 introduit dans les lois de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, et notamment dans le ch. 15 del'acte des \u00e9coles communes, sec. 77, para. 2. Ii est aussi \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans plusieues autres statuts, entres autres, le ch. 24, statuts revises, B. C., lacte municipal et des chemins dont la sec. 58 met les maisons d'\u00e9ducation dans la cat\u00e9gorie des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s exemptes de toutes taxes on cotisations impo\u00e9es en vertu de cet acte. Le code municipal, 34 Vict., ch. 68, art. 712, para. 3, dans sa longue \u00e9num\u00e9ration de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s exempess de taxes comprend aussiles institutions d'\u00e9ducation.\nCette exemption de taxes se retrouee encoee dans la 40 Vict. \u00bah. 29, concernant les clauses g\u00e9n\u00e9rales incorporation des cites et villes, \u00e0 la sec. 325, parag. 3. Ce principe d'exemption que l'on retrouee dans tant de statuss paralt avoir ete adopt\u00e9 syst\u00e9matiquement par la legislature comme un moyen d'encouragement pour la cause de l'\u00e9ducation. Le code municipal ne sappliquant quaux municipalit\u00e9s rurales, n affecte pas la cite de Montr\u00e9al dont la charee avant d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9e par la 381 me Vict., ch. 73, ne lui imposait aucune exemption ; mais la section 3 de cet amendement a d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 l'exemption des \u00e9glises, presbyt\u00e8res, palais \u00e9piscopaux, de toutes taxes, et exempt\u00e9 de taxes municipales ordinares et annuelles les \u00e9stablissements occu\u00e9s pour des fins de charit\u00e9. Dans cetee disposition les institutions d'\u00e9ducation n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 comprises \u2014et elles seraient sans doute soumises aux taxes sans la clause 26 de lam\u00e9 Vict, ch. 6, qui les en a exempt\u00e9es. L'intention du l\u00e9gislateur a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9videmment de faire pr\u00e9valoir le m\u00eame syst\u00e9me par toute la province. C'est pour cela qu'il s'est prononc\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re si g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qu'il n'est pas possible d'en limiter l'effet. En d\u00e9clarant que les maisons d'\u00e9ducation seraient exemptes des cotisations municipales et scolaires, quelque soit l'acte ou charte en vertu duquel les cotisations sont impos\u00e9es et ce nonobstant toutes dispositions \u00e0 ce contraire, le but \u00e9tait \u00e9videmment d'atteindre la cite de Montr\u00e9al, qui se trouvait la seule localit\u00e9 de la province qui n'\u00e9tait pas soumise \u00e0 une semblable disposition.

The Supreme Court, by a majority of four to one (Ritchie, C.J., being the dissentient judge), reversed the decision of the queen's Bench for Lower Canada, which was also pronounced by a majority of four to one and restored the judgment of Loranger, J., the judge of first instance\nIn considering applications of this kind, it is necessary to keep in view that the Statute of Canada 38 Vic, ch. 11 which established. the supreme Court of the Dominion doss not give to unsuccessful litigants a direct right either absolute or conditional, to appeal from the decisions of that tribunal. Section 47 expressly declares that no appeal shall he brought from any judgment or order of the Supreme Court to any court established by the Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland by which appeals or petitions to Her majesty in council may be ordered to be heard; hut saves any right which Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to exercise by virtue of her Royal prerogative.\nIt is the duty of their Lordships to advise Her Majesty in the exercise of her prerogative and in the discharge of that duty they are bound to apply their judicial discretion to the particular facts and circumstances of each case as presented to them. In forming an opinion as to the propriety of allowing an appeal, they must necessarily rely to a very great extent upon the statements contained in the petition with regard to the import and effect of the judgment complained of, and the reasons therein alleged for treating it as an exceptional one, and permitting it to be brought under review. Experience has shown that great caution is required in accepting these reasons when they are not fully substantiated, or do not appear to be primu facie. established by reference to the petitioner's statement of the main facts of the case, and the questions\nof law to which these give rise. Cases vary so widely in their circumstances that the principles upon which an appeal ought to be allowed do not admit of anything approaching to exhaustive definition. No rule can be laid down which would not necessarily be subject to future qualification, and an attempt to formulate any such rule might therefore prove misleading. In some cases, as in Prince v. Gagnon,, (8 App. Cas. 103), their Lordship have had occasion to indicate certain particulars, the absence of which will have a strong influence in inducing them to advise that leave should not be given, but it by no means follows that leave will be recommended in all cases in which these features occur. A. case may be of a substantial character, may involve matter of great public interest, may raise an important question of law, and yet the judgment from which leave to appeal is sought may appear to be plainly right, or at least to be unattended with sufficient doubt to justify their Lordships in advising Her Majesty to grant leave to appeal.\nThe exemption which the Supreme Court has sustained in the present instance is a statutory one. The petitioners narrate the 77th section of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, cap. 15, and then proceed to allege that the effect of the judgment will be \" to determine the future liability \" (meaning apparently non-liability) of buildings set apart for \" purposes of education, or of \" religious worship, parsonage houses and charitable and educational institutions and hospitals to contribute to local improvements carried out in their interests and for the benefit of their \"properties.\" Had that statement been well founded, it might have been an important element in considering whether leave ought to be given. But it is plainly erroneous. The statute in question, which relates to (public education, \"exempts the properties above enumerated from educational rates levied for the purposes of the act, and from no other rates, The clause upon which the judgment of the Supreme Court proceeded is section 26 of the statutes of the Province of Quebec, 41 Vic, ch. 6, which is an act to amend the laws respecting public instruction \" It enacts that. \" Every educational institution receiving no grant \" from the corporation or municipality in which they are situated, and the land on which they are erected, and its dependencies, s shall be exempt from municipal and school taxes, whatever may be the act or charter under \" which such taxes are imposed, notwithstanding all provisions to \" the contrary.\"\nThe Seminary of St. Sulpice admittedly does not receive any grant from the Corporation of the City of Montreal, and is therefore within the benefit of the exemption\" created, by section 6, and the only issue raised between the parties is, whether a district rate for drainage improvements, levied from that portion of the municipal area which directly benefits by its expenditure, is or is not a municipal tax within the meaning of the clause.\nThe petition does not set forth the sources from which the petitioners derive their authority to execute such improvements as drainage, and to assess for their cost. Powers of that description are entrusted to municipal bodies, presumably m the interest of the\npublic and not for the interest of private owners, although the latter may be benefited by their exercise. prime facie, their Lordships see no reason to suppose that rates levied for improvements of that kind are not municipal taxes, and at the bearing of the petition their impression was confirmed by a reference to the General Municipal Acts for Lower Canada. The counsel who appeared for the petitioners stated, however, that their powers are derived, not from the General Acts, but from a chater the terms of which were neither referred to nor explained. If the terms of the charter materially differ from those of the General Acts, that deprives the case of any general importance. But it is quite possible that the concluding words of section 6 may have been purposely introduced by the Legislature in order to secure uniformity of exemption, whatever might be the terms in which the power to assess was conferred ; and that, consequently, in construing the clause, the expression municipal taxes ought to be interpreted according to its general acceptation, and not according to the meaning which it might be held to bear in some charter or statures applicable to particular municipalities.\nIn these circumstances their Lordships are not prepared to advise Her Majesty that the petitioners ought to have leave to appeal. If such questions are, as they say, of frequent occurrence in the city of Montreal, they may have the opportunity of obtaining the decision of this Board in another case, upon appeal from the Court of Queen's Bench for the Province. The petition must therefore be dismissed.\n[1] M. L. E. 2 S. C.\" 265.\n[2] 12 Can. S.C.R 384.\n[3] M. L. R. 4 S.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nAssignment\u2014In trust for creditors\u2014Preference\u2014Fraud against creditors\u2014Statute of Elizabeth\u2014Resulting trust.\nA deed of assignment of property in trust for the benefit of creditors provided for the distribution of the assets by the assignee as follows: First, to pay certain named creditors in full.\u2014Secondly, if sufficient assets remained after such payment to pay certain other named creditors in full, or, if the assets should not be sufficient, to distribute the same pro rat\u00e2 among such second preferred creditors.\u2014Thirdly, to divide the remaining assets among all the creditors not preferred in equal proportions according to their respective claims and\u2014Fourthly, to pay the balance remaining after distribution to the assignor. The deed required all creditors executing it to release the assignor from any and every claim of the executing creditor against him, and provided that the assignee should not be liable to account for more money and effects than he should actually receive, nor be responsible for any loss or damage to the trust, except such as should happen through his own wilful neglect. In an action to set aside the deed:\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, Gwynne and Patterson JJ. dissenting, that the deed was one to which it was unreasonable to expect unpreferred creditors to become parties, and therefore, and because it contained a resulting trust in favor of the debtor, it was void under the statute, 13 Eliz. ch. 5.\nIf objection is made to the form of a bond for security for costs on appeal to the Supreme Court it should be by application in chambers to dismiss and if not so made the objection will be held to be waived. Appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] reversing the judgment for the defendants on the trial.\nThe action in this case was brought to set aside a deed assigning to the defendant Whitman, in trust for the benefit of their creditors, all the real and personal property of his co-defendants. The deed preferred two sets of creditors who were first to be paid in full; then the remaining assets were to be distributed in equal proportions among the unpreferred creditors and the surplus, if any, was to be returned to the assignors. The deed provided that the execution by each creditor should release and discharge the debtors from all and every claim of such creditor against them, and that the assignee should not be required to account for more money or assets than he should receive, nor be liable for any loss or damage to the trust estate unless the same should be caused by his own wilful neglect.\nThe trial judge, who tried the case without a jury, gave judgment in favor of the defendants, holding that the deed was not fraudulent under the statute of Elizabeth. The court in banc reversed this judgment and ordered the deed to be set aside. The defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nBorden for the respondents took as a preliminary objection to the hearing of the appeal, that the bond given as security for costs is not in the statutory form and does not provide for the prosecution of the appeal. The court considered the bond insufficient, but held that an application to dismiss should have been made in chambers, and not having been so made, it must be taken to be waived.\nHarrington Q.C. for the appellants cited The Toronto Bank v. Eccles[2]; Ex parte Games[3]; Alton v. Harrison[4]; Boldero y. London, &c., Loan Co.[5].\nBorden and W. B. Ritchie for the respondents referred to Gallagher v. Glass[6]; Slater v. Badenach[7]; Slater v. Spencer[8]; Cornwall v. Gault[9]; Larpent v. Bibby[10]; D'Ivernois v. Leavitt[11].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J. \u2014I am of opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed. It appears to me that the deed of assignment was fraudulent and void under the statute 13 Elizabeth ch. 5, inasmuch as it imposed unreasonable terms on creditors, requiring them either to release their claims if they assented to the deed, and in default of their doing so, not only excluding them from the benefit of the deed, but subjecting any residue of the estate to a resulting trust in favor of the debtor. The concurrence of these provisions in the same deed shows that it was intended to hinder and defeat creditors. I therefore agree in the main with the reasons given in the judgment of the Chief Justice delivered in the court below[12].\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal upon the ground taken by McDonald C.J. in the court below, that the assignors by their deed retained a portion of the assets of the estate, by making such a provision as diverted assets for their own use that ought to go to all the creditors. I think that this assignment is fraudulent and void under the 13th Elizabeth ch. 5, Spencer v. Slater (7). GWYNNE J.\u2014The deed assailed in this case is not, in my opinion, void within the statute of Elizabeth as against creditors by reason of any of the objections which have been taken to it nor, so far as I can see, for any reason. It is not, in my opinion, open to the construction that it enables the trustees, who have accepted the burthen of executing the trusts thereof, to withhold at their pleasure any part of the estate conveyed to them from the creditors, or for the benefit of the debtors; their attempt to do anything of the kind would be a plain breach of trust, for which they would be accountable to the creditors. Neither is it at all correct to say that the deed provides, as did the deed in Spencer v. Slater[13], that a dividend which would be payable to creditors signing shall, in the cases of any not signing, be paid to the debtors; on the contrary, in the event of a creditor refusing to sign his refusal enures to the benefit of those who do sign, and not to the benefit of the debtors. In short between the deed in the present case and that in Spencer v. Slater (1) there is the greatest possible difference. That the deed makes provision for certain preferred creditors is no valid objection within the statute of Elizabeth. Neither is the clause which requires all creditors receiving benefit under the trusts of the deed to release the debtors. What is called the resulting trust in favor of the debtors, and which is complained of as unjust and as making the deed void within the statute, is the ordinary trust contained in every trust deed in favor of the debtors in respect of any residue, if any there should be, after payment of all creditors in full; and to such a trust provision no reasonable objection can be taken; Boldero v. London & Manchester Loan Co[14].\nTrue it is, that if certain creditors should not sign it might happen, but not necessarily, that there might be a surplus, after all who do sign should be paid in full, which would become payable to the debtors, which would not have become payable to them if all should sign; but that would be a result brought about by the default of the creditors themselves in not signing and not by any act of the debtors whose intention, as expressed in the deed, is that all shall sign and that all shall be paid in full before there shall or can be any residue to be paid to the debtors. If there be nothing in the deed which imposes, or affects to impose, an unjust and unreasonable burthen or condition upon those who do sign, a creditor who is unwilling to sign has no basis upon which to found a complaint that the deed is unjust to him. In such a case it is the fact of his not signing which does him prejudice and he cannot attribute such prejudice to any provision in the deed. Now, this deed imposes no condition upon any creditor who signs except that he shall release the debtors, and as this is not a valid objection within the statute, nor is the clause giving preference to some creditors open to objection, I can see nothing in the deed which, viewed in the light of the numerous decisions upon this subject, can be said to avoid the deed within the statute of Elizabeth.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the court of first instance restored with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014A deed of assigment for the benefit of creditors, made by Arthur W. Corbitt and George E. Corbitt, merchants, of Annapolis, in N.S., to the defendant Whitman, has been held to be fraudulent and void under the statute 13 Elizabeth, ch. 5, by the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia from which this appeal is brought. Let us see at the outset what are the precise provisions of the deed.\nIt bears date the 5th of December, 1884, and purports to be made between Arthur W. Corbitt and George E. Corbitt, formerly doing business under the name, style and firm of A. W. Corbitt & Son, of the first part; the Hon. George Whitman, of the second part, \"trustee appointed for the purposes hereinafter mentioned; and the several persons, creditors, indorsers, guarantors, or sureties of or for the said parties of the first part who have or shall hereafter execute or accede to these presents within three months from the date hereof, of the third part.\"\nThe deed then recites that the parties of the first part are at present unable to pay immediate demands upon them, and deem it best and resonable to secure, pay' and indemnify the several persons parties to these presents in manner hereinafter mentioned, and goes on to convey to the party of the second part, his heirs and assigns, certain specified lands, some of which are described as being subject to mortgages,\nBut upon trust that the said party of the second part shall, if he deem it fit and expedient, in a reasonable time, sell and dispose of, at public auction or private sale, for cash or on credit, after due advertisement of the same, the above described lots, pieces or parcels of land and premises for the highest price to be obtained therefor, and to convey the same by deed or deeds to the said purchaser or purchasers, and upon receipt of the purchase money arising from the said sale or sales of the said second lot, to apply the same to the payment of the said mortgages above described, which said mortgages cover the said second lot; and then first to apply the balance of the purchase money arising from the sale of the said real estate, after deducting the expenses of this trust, in payment of the several amounts due and to grow due, the following persons in full as creditors, indorsers, guarantors, sureties, or otherwise of the said parties of the first part, that is to say: [naming six creditors]; and secondly, after paying the said creditors hereinbefore named and the expenses of this trust in full, to apply the balance of the said purchase money in payment of the amounts due and to grow due the following persons in full on account, or as creditors, indorsers, guarantors, sureties or otherwise of the said parties of the first part, that is to say: [naming 24 creditors]; thirdly, after paying the expenses\" of this trust and the creditors hereinbefore named as first and second preferential creditors of the said parties of the first part, and in case there shall be any surplus of the said property or funds after fulfilling the said trusts, then that said party of the second part do and shall divide, distribute and pay over to the other creditors of the said parties of the first part, who shall become parties hereto in manner hereinbefore described ratably and in proportion to the amounts due to each of them respectively, without any preference or priority, and if anything shall remain thereafter the said party of the second part shall convey, deliver and pass over the same to the parties of the first part, their executors, administrators and assigns.\nThen follows a general assignment of stock-in-trade and all personal effects to the party of the second part upon trust to sell with all reasonable speed and to get in debts or other outstanding interest; and forthwith, after deducting the expenses of executing the trust, the cost of preparing and executing the deed of assignment, and his own charges and commission as assignee, to deal with the fund in the same manner as directed with regard to the proceeds of the real estate. This trust is expressed at length, as in the former case, the only difference being the omission of one name from the list of second preferred ereditors. We have then the ordinary power of attorney; power to the trustee to adjust the amounts due to creditors, including power to compound and to arbitrate; proviso that no person shall be entitled to be a creditor under that deed, unless notice shall have been given by him of his debt or demand to the trustee before a final dividend shall have been made of the trust property; a covenant by the trustee with the parties of the first and third parts to execute the trusts to the best of his judgment and discretion,\nProvided always and it is hereby agreed, that the said party of the second part, his executors or administrators shall not be liable or accountable for more money or effects than he shall receive, nor for any loss or damage which he may receive, nor for any loss or damage which may happen in reference to the said trusts, unless it arise by or through his own wilful neglect.\nI may remark, in passing, that this expression \"any loss or damage which he may receive,\" which is not a happy one, looks as if it got there by an error in engrossing the document, perhaps, by erroneously writing in ten words from the word \"damage\" where it first occurs to and including the second word \"damage.\"\u2014I make this observation assuming the document to be correctly printed in the book before me. I am not sure that the words which seem interpolated are not here owing to a misprint, because I find the passage quoted without them in the judgment, as printed, of Mr. Justice McDonald, when he is made to say:\u2014\nThe deed contained a release of all claims against the debtors, together with the following provisions: \"And it is hereby agreed that the said party of the second part, his executors or administrators shall not be liable or accountable for more money or effects than he shall receive, nor for any loss or damages which may happen in reference to the said trusts, unless it shall arise by or through his own wilful neglect.\"\nyet that learned judge in the same judgment treats the clause as if the words were there, and the same reading of it has been made the ground of some argument before us. I apprehend that it makes no difference whatever whether the words are in the original deed or not, because, if they are, they are manifestly governed by the qualification \"unless it shall arise by or through his own wilful neglect.\"\nThe learned judge seems to have fallen into a misapprehension on this point, as I shall further notice by and by.\nThe remainder of the deed is the release clause which I quote in full:\u2014\nAnd the said respective creditors, parties hereto, each and every of them for himself and herself severally and respectively, and for their several and respective executors and administrators, do hereby accept and take the estate and effects hereinbefore assigned in full payment, satisfaction and discharge of all their respective debts, demands, and of all loss or damage to be sustained by reason of any liability aforesaid, and do and each of them doth absolutely remise, release, discharge and quit-claim the said parties of the first part, their executors and administrators, of and from all demands which they or any or either of them now have against them.\nThe issue was tried before Mr. Justice Weatherbee, who found that there was no fraud on the part of the defendants and gave judgment for the defendants.\nThat judgment was reversed by the court in banc. The judgment, which I understand to express the opinions of all the learned judges who heard the motion, except the Chief Justice, was delivered by Mr. Justice McDonald. The Chief Justice concurred in the conclusion, but limited himself to one of the reasons for which the other members of the court held the deed to be void.\nThe deed had attached to it certain statements purporting to show the debts and the assets of the assignors. I think the only allusion to it, contained in the deed itself, is in the following passage from the clause relating to the power of the trustee to adjust claims.\nAnd it is further agreed that the naming of any debt or debts due or owing in any schedule hereto annexed shall not prevent the parties of the first and second part from calling into question or controverting the amount of the same, and if the amount of any creditor shall have been stated as being greater or smaller than it really is, such creditor shall be entitled to the benefits of these presents upon and only upon and for the amount which may be found to be justly due him.\nThe position of the plaintiffs with reference to the estate is thus correctly stated by Mr. Justice McDonald:\nIt appears by the statement attached to the deed of assignment that the plaintiff bank at that time held notes and drafts, indorsed by the debtors, to the amount of $28,500, for which no provision was made except as just mentioned, so that the plaintiff was not only excluded from the list of first and second preferential creditors, but was expected to look for payment of the large sum just named to what appears to be a most uncertain source, and even that upon his becoming a party to a document which released the debtors from all further claims, indemnified the assignee, except as we have seen, and provided that if any balance remained after paying those who became parties to the deed as prescribed the same should be paid over by the trustee to the debtor himself, excluding altogether creditors who did not sign the deed.\nThe decision was that the deed was one which it was unreasonable to expect the plaintiffs to become parties to, and was bad under the statute, by reason of three things: the release clause, the clause that was taken to indemnify the assignee against loss and damages not occasioned by his wilful neglect, and the trust to hand over to the assignors any balance that might remain after paying in full all the creditors who became parties to the deed.\nIt was upon the last ground alone that the learned Chief Justice rested his concurrence.\nNo notice is taken in the judgments of reasons outside of the deed itself on which also it was attacked as fraudulent. I do not think it necessary to say more respecting those extraneous matters than that the attention which I gave to the evidence during the argument, when Mr. Ritchie left nothing unsaid that could aid his contention, and a second careful examination of it, have failed to create any doubt in my mind of the correctness of Mr. Justice Weatherbee's finding.\nI am satisfied that the deed must be dealt with, as it was by the court in banc, upon the effect of what we find within its four corners.\nThe three grounds acted upon are reduced to two by the circumstance that the learned judge overlooked for the moment the qualification of the indemnity clause, which clause, properly construed, is merely the ordinary clause found in every trust deed, and which, if it had not been expressed in this deed, would have been imported into it by the statute R.S.N.S. 4th series, ch. 108, sect. 24. The other objections require a glance at the operation of the statute of Elizabeth as it is to be gathered from decisions.\nWe have always to remember that it does not, like a bankrupt act, contemplate an equal distribution of the assets of a debtor among his creditors. This may be almost a truism. Every one will admit it in terms, without hesitation; but it is not unusual to find arguments on the validity of deeds of this class influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by the notion that to prefer one creditor to another is an offence against the statute, if not a fraud at common law.\n\"All deeds of this sort,\" as observed by Maule J. during the argument in Janes v. Whitbread[15], \"are within the letter of the 13th Elizabeth, ch. 5, sec. 2, which declares that all deeds made to or for any intent or purpose before declared and expressed, shall be void,\u2014that is, all deeds made to or for any of the intents or purposes mentioned in section 1, viz., 'to delay, hinder, or defraud creditors and others of their just and lawful actions, suits and debts, &c.'\" He referred to Pickstock v. Lyster[16], where it was decided that if a man assigns all his property to a trustee simply with the purpose of having it fairly distributed amongst all his creditors, such an assignment, although it may have the effect of hindering and delaying a particular creditor of his execution, is not within the spirit of the act, and therefore is not void,\u2014because it does not deprive any of the creditors of his fair share of the debtor's property if he chooses to become a party to the deed. Then he refers to Owen v. Body[17], in which it was held that creditors could not reasonably be asked to be parties to deeds containing the terms as to carrying on the business which were then in question, and distinguishes from it the deed in Janes v. Whitbread[18] which provided for carrying on the business with the object of winding it up, not as in Owen v. Body[19] for the purpose of making money to pay the creditors who became parties to the deed.\nWe have a key to the spirit of the statute in the full reading of the language \"feigned, covinous, and fraudulent, and contrived of malice, fraud, covin, collusion or guile, to the end, purpose and intent to delay, &c.\"\nThis is noticed in the very instructive judgment of Sir J. B. Robinson in a case in Upper Canada, Bank of Toronto v. Eccles[20]. That judgment and the judgment of Mr. Justice Burns in the same case, as also the judgment of the present Chief Justice of Ontario, then Mr. Justice Hagarty, when the case was before the Court of Common Pleas[21] will be found to contain an exhaustive discussion of the decisions, English and American, down to the year 1862. The deed in that case, like the deed before us, assigned all the estate of the debtor to trustees for the satisfaction of his debts, preferred some creditors to others, and contained a release by the creditors who should execute, providing that those who did not sign should not receive dividends, and excluding all creditors who did not come in within thirty days. The validity of the assignment was sustained by the Court of Error and Appeal, affirming the judgment of the Common Pleas. Two of the learned judges dissented, considering that it was unreasonable to demand a release when the preferences created by that assignment were given. For my own part, I entirely agree with the reasoning and the conclusions of the majority of the court, and with the greatest respect for the opinions of the late Chief Justice of Ontario, then Vice-Chancellor Spragge, by whom the dissenting judgment was delivered, I am obliged to regard that judgment as an example of the occasional tendency, of which I have spoken, to import into the statute of Elizabeth the idea of equal distribution of assets, which is something outside of its contemplation, although it obtains in the administration of estates in equity, and is a principle of bankruptcy law.\nHolbird v. Anderson[22] settled the question of the right of a debtor to prefer one creditor to another without offending against the statute of Elizabeth.\nPickstock v. Lyster[23] was upon an assignment of all the goods of a debtor for the general benefit of his creditors; which was held to be valid on the principle of Holbird v. Anderson. There was no release clause in the assignment.\nIn The King v. Watson[24] the insolvent assigned all his estate to trustees for creditors, stipulating expressly for a release. Counsel pressed on the court that the deed was void under 13th Elizabeth, and the more strongly \"as there was a condition imposed on all who should entitle themselves by signing it, that they should release the debtor from the rest of their demand in consideration of such dividend as they should receive.\" Per curiam\u2014\"There is certainly no fraud in this case affecting the assignment, which has been made for the equal benefit of all creditors. * * * This is a very common arrangement which it would be very injurious to disturb where there has been no commission of bankruptcy.\"\nIn Goss v. Neale[25] certain chattels were assigned for the benefit of certain creditors of the assignor for four years; at the expiration of two years, or sooner if the assignor should so direct, the trustees were to sell and pay the creditors named in the schedule, and there was a covenant that the creditors should not molest the assignor for the space of two years; the deed was held valid against an execution creditor, first by Abbott C.J. and afterwards by the full court.\nWells v. Greenhill[26] may be referred to as an early case upon a deed of all a debtor's property conveyed for distribution among his creditors, but not equal distribution, some who were specified by name to be paid in full; then all creditors for less than \u00a310 to be paid in full; then all other creditors named in the schedule to be paid 5 s. in the \u00a3; then upon the winding-up, respecting which directions were given, the scheduled creditors to be paid the residue of their claims, and the surplus, if any, to be paid over to the debtor. There was a covenant by the creditors to release the debtor at any time after eighteen months if the deed did not become void, under a proviso by which it was to become void if any creditor for over a specified amount should not execute the deed within three months. All the creditors, including the plaintiff who was now attacking the deed under the proviso, executed it within three months with the exception of one of those who were to be paid in full. The decision was that his failure to sign did not avoid the deed. We have nothing to do with the goodness or badness of the reason given, which was that he could not be intended to release the debt which was to be paid to him in full. Still it is not very convincing, because the release, while it discharged the debtor personally, left the creditors' remedy against the assigned estate untouched. See Ellis v. McHenry[27].\nTatlock v. Smith[28] incidentally recognizes the propriety of a debtor, who surrenders all his property for distribution among his creditors, insisting on being released from his debts. There was not in that case any question of preferring one creditor to another. It had been agreed that in order to carry out a scheme of equal distribution the debtor should execute a conveyance to trustees. When the conveyance was tendered for execution he refused to execute it, because it did not contain such a release as he thought he should receive. It was held at the trial at Guildhall of an action by one of the creditors upon a bill of exchange accepted by the debtor, as a defence to which the composition agreement was pleaded, that the defendant's objection to execute the conveyance was reasonable, and in banc Chief Justice Tindal said:\u2014\nIt is unreasonable that debtors who have surrendered so much, and have thereby deprived themselves of any other mode of effecting payment, should remain liable to, hostile proceedings at the suit of their creditors. Their situation itself seems to preclude the possibility of any such intendment.\nThe plaintiff was non-suited on the ground that forbearance to sue was involved in the composition agreement, and that nothing had occurred to remit the creditors to their rights.\nIn Small v. Marwood[29] which was decided in the same year (1829) as Tatlock v. Smith, we have another express, though incidental, recognition of the right to insist, as a condition of admission to share in the estate, on the execution of a release within a limited time. This will sufficiently appear from a passage from the considered judgment of the court pronounced by Bayley J. Then came the following proviso:\u2014\nProvided that the said parties of the second and third parts shall on or before the first day of February next make such proof, if required, and execute these presents. It was contended that the words \"and execute these presents\" constitute a condition, and that the deed having been executed by Barr and Hudson only, and not by the other two trustees, was void for non-performance of that condition; and, being void altogether, that Barr's debt was not extinguished, and therefore was a good petitioning creditor's debt to support the commission. We are of opinion that the effect of those words in the proviso is not to avoid the deed, if the parties therein named shall not execute it, but merely to take away from such parties the right to recover a dividend.\nOwen v. Body[30], in which there was no question of preferences, is a more indirect recognition of the propriety of the release clause by the circumstance that the opinion that it was unreasonable to insist on the creditors becoming parties to that deed was not placed to any extent upon the release which the deed contained, nor was any objection, founded on the release, made in Janes v. Whitbread[31] or Coates v. Williams[32] where the deeds were upheld against objections for which the decision in Owen v. Body (1) was relied on. We do not find the precise terms of the release mentioned in the reports of either of those two cases. In Coates v. Williams (3) the deed is said to be \"in the usual form,\" to be precisely in the same terms as that in Janes v. Whitbread, (2) and to be \"a stereotype, and to be had at any law stationer's in London.\" The statement of the case does not contain the word \"release\" but it is said that the deed contained a proviso that creditors not signing within three months should be excluded from the benefit of the assignment, and the trust was to pay ratably such creditors as should execute the deed. There can be no doubt that the ordinary release was contained in the deeds. The validity of the clause excluding creditors who do not execute within a certain time is recognized in re Baber[33], where Malins V.C. allowed a creditor to come in after the time under special circumstances.\nIn the much litigated case of Cox v. Hickman[34] in which the House of Lords decided that creditors by joining in a deed such as that in Owen v. Body[35] did not become partners in the business that was carried on by the trustees under the deed, there was no question of the validity of the deed. The object of the action was to make creditors who had joined in the deed liable as partners for debts incurred in carrying on the business. We see, however, from the report in 18 C. B. 617 that the deed contained a special release clause, and that the creditors were to share rateably and without preferences.\nAlton v. Harrison[36] was decided in 1869. In that case Lord Justice Giffard, affirming a judgment of Vice-Chancellor Stuart, upheld a mortage made in expectation of the issue of a writ of sequestration, which vested substantially all the property of the debtor in trustees for five of his creditors, and contained a proviso for the debtor remaining in possession for six months, if the sequestration was not issued. It was pointed out that the statute of Elizabeth differed from the bankrupt laws by not having for its object the equal distribution of assets, and that the question was whether the deed was bon\u00e2 fide and not a mere cloak for retaining a benefit to the grantor. Ten years later similar language was used by Pollock B. delivering the judgment of the divisional court in Boldero v. London & Westminster Discount Co.[37].\nWe are here dealing, he said, not with the bankruptcy law, but with the statute of Elizabeth, and without going back to older cases, as Lord Justice Giffard pointed out in Alton v. Harrison, (2) the statute of Elizabeth does not touch the question of equal distribution of assets. This assignment, therefore, though it preferred certain creditors and tended to defeat the others, might be good.\nThe deed which was upheld in that case conveyed the estate to trustees to sell in such manner as. they should think proper, and to divide the residue of the proceeds after paying expenses ratably among the creditors parties to the deed, including, if the trustees thought fit but not otherwise, creditors who refused or neglected to execute, and if the trustees thought fit but not otherwise, to pay the dividends on debts due to non-assenting creditors to the debtors. There does not appear to have been a release clause in the ordinary form. The objections to the deed were chiefly on the ground of provisions for carrying on the trade, Spencer v. Slater[38] being relied on. That case was distinguished by reason of its special circumstances which are described by Pollock B., as being, in the first place, that the deed contained not merely the ordinary resulting trust as to the surplus which would be found in every deed, but a resulting trust under which, at the expiration of twelve months, the debtor might apply to the trustees to be paid the dividends of creditors who neglected or refused to assent to or execute the deed, and then if the creditors did not within seven days assent or execute, the money was to be paid to the debtor. This, the learned baron said, was much beyond the ordinary resulting trust. Then again the primary trust was to carry on the business, while in Boldero's case the principal object was to sell the business, and it was subsidiary to that object that power was given to carry it on till the sale.\nIn that case too, he continued, there was a very special and general indemnity, * * * and from all the circumstances of that case taken together the court came to the conclusion that they ought to draw the inference that the assignment was intended to defeat creditors, and was therefore void under the statute of Elizabeth.\nBut little further reference is necessary to Spencer v. Slater, which was a good deal relied on in the court below, and that little may be made by quoting from the judgment of Mellor J., who puts the turning point of the judgment in these words:\nBy this scheme the trustees may carry on the business, if they think fit, and the creditors, in order to get their dividends, must enter into obligations not required of them in the ordinary course of law, for the executing or assenting creditors are to indemnify the trustees against personal risk and loss. If any creditor refuses to come in there is a resulting trust in favor of the debtor in respect of the dividend that would otherwise have been due to such creditor.\nThe effect of the deed is even more strongly put by Manisty J.\nThe resulting trust in the deed before us would be implied by law, if not expressed in the deed. Nothing results to the grantors until all the creditors entitled to share under the deed are paid in full. If the deed is valid as against the objection founded on the release clause, and the creditors to share under it are therefore only those who execute, it follows that, when they are paid in full and the trust is thus fully executed, the surplus must result to the grantors. The remedy which the non-assenting creditors may have as between themselves and the debtor is an entirely separate consideration.\nIt does not seem to have been necessary in any English case to pronounce upon the validity, in view of the statute of Elizabeth, of a deed in which the two things co-existed\u2014the preference of some creditors, and the execution of a release from all the creditors who were to share under the deed. To that extent it may be said that there is no English case which, like the Upper Canada case of Bank of Toronto v. Eccles[39], is on all fours with that before us. But the principles established by the decisions really cover the whole ground.\nA debtor whose estate is sufficient to pay only one half of his debts is not hindered by the statute from conveying his whole estate to pay off half his creditors, leaving the other half unprovided for. A deed made for the purpose of such payment is safe against any attack by a creditor who is left out, notwithstanding the intention and design to defeat him. That is one well established proposition.\nThen it must be held as the result of the numerous cases in which assignments containing the release clause and excluding all creditors who did not execute, or who did not execute within the time prescribed by the debtor, were upheld, and in which the consistent absence of objection to the clause is as significant as a decision against such an objection, that an assignment is not to be pronounced \"feigned, covinous and fraudulent, and contrived of malice, fraud, covin, collusion or guile, to the end, purpose and intent to delay, hinder or defraud creditors of their just and lawful actions, suits and debts,\" merely because the release is exacted.\nThese two propositions are in effect but one proposition put in two forms. It is the same thing in principle whether the whole assets are made over in full payment of some of the creditors, or whether they are made over to those creditors who will agree to take them in full satisfaction of their demands.\nThe proportion which the assets bear to the debts, when the debts exceed the assets, is not, for the present purpose, a material consideration. The rule must apply to an estate that will pay only ten per cent. as well as to one that will pay ninety per cent. of the debts.\nNor can the position be affected by the fact that the attenuated condition of the estate has been produced by applying the assets in the payment of some creditors in full, when such payments are not struck at by the statute. The corollary follows that what may lawfully be done by satisfying some creditors in full to-day, and by to-morrow assigning what remains for distribution among such of the other creditors as will accept it in full of their demands, may also be lawfully done by the operation of one instrument such as that with which we are dealing.\nThe impulse which may be felt to characterise such arrangements as a fraud upon creditors will mislead, so long as the debtor is under no duty to treat all his creditors alike.\nFor the purpose of bankrutcy laws, where such laws exist, and of laws founded on the same principle, as in Quebec and Ontario, such a duty may be recognised, but, as we have seen, it is not a duty within purview of the statute of Elizabeth.\nIn every case where it was held that an assignment contained something which, by making it unreasonable to expect a creditor to sign evidenced a design to delay, hinder or defraud, that something imposed a burden on the creditors, as e.g., the danger apprehended in Owen v. Body[40] of incurring the liability of a partner, or the covenant in Spencer v. Slater[41] to indemnify the trustees against personal loss; or it has appeared from the deed that the surrender was not for the sole purpose of making the assets available for the payment of the debts. Such was the provision for carrying on the business in Owen v. Body, (1) and such was the trust in Spencer v. Slater (2) to pay over to the debtor, in place of distributing among the assenting creditors, the dividends of the creditors who refused to come in. This feature, by the bye, is not peculiar to the deed in Spencer v. Slater (2), but is found in some others that survived the contest over them. (See Alton v. Harrison[42].) I believe there is no case, not even Spencer v. Slater (2) which certainly did not err on the side of undue leniency towards the assignment, but went so far the other way as to create doubts of soundness of the decision[43], where the presence of the release clause has been made a reason for avoiding the deed at the instance of a non-assenting creditor.\nI may refer, more as a matter of curiosity than for any particulary direct application, to a late case, in re Stephenson[44] where it was contended, with more ingenuity than success, that the release contained in a deed of assignment, which had been treated as an act of bankruptcy, remained valid while the conveyance became void, and, by extinguishing the debt of a creditor who had executed the deed, disabled him from proving under the bankruptcy.\nIn addition to the grounds on which the judgment in the court below proceeded, and in which, for the reasons I have given, I think the court fell into error, some other objections to the deed were urged before us. One of these, and the only one which was founded on anything that appeared in the deed itself, was that the trustee was given power to keep the real estate unsold as long as he pleased. I think the contention went so far as to urge that it was left to his discretion whether it should ever be sold and distributed. It is proved that no such effect was in fact intended, that the discretion intended to be vested in him was merely as to the mode of sale. He did not understand that he had power to defer the sale of the land, and acting on what he supposed to be his duty as trustee, he took steps with reasonable promptitude to make sales, and he sold several parcels, some absolutely, and one subject to the event of this litigation. It must, nevertheless, be held that if, by the legal operation of the deed, the trustee had power to keep from the creditors what the deed seemed to give to them, a creditor could not reasonably be expected to become party to it. The language is \"upon trust that the party of the second part shall, if he deem it fit and expedient, in a reasonable time, sell and dispose of, at public auction or private sale, for cash or on credit, after due advertisement of the same, the above described lots, &c.\"\nThe expression \"if he deem it fit and expedient\" is not well chosen, but it would never be interpreted in the sense on which the objection is founded. The creditors are to have the benefit of the property vested in the trustee. By the concluding clause of the deed, which I have already quoted, they accept and take the estate and effects assigned in full payment, &c. They are the beneficial owners to the extent of their claims, and can enforce the execution of the trusts in their favor. No creditor who executed the deed could be met by the objection that defeated the plaintiff's action in Johns v. James[45] where the trustee was held not to be a trustee for the plaintiff who, though he was to be paid his debt out of money which the trustee was to raise, was not a party to the assignment.\nI see no difficulty in the way of understanding the language as giving the trustee a discretion to decide what should be a reasonable time to sell as well as the best mode of selling, just as if the words were \"as he shall deem it fit and expedient\" in place of \"if he deem it fit and expedient.\"\nIf this does violence to the language it is violence of a gentle character, and may properly be resorted to in order to carry out the intention manifest from the whole instrument and ut res magis valeat quam pereat.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed with costs and the action dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: T.

The appellant was convicted of manslaughter, and his counsel having urged that he was entitled to an acquittal by reason of the variance between the evidence and the indictment, the trial judge reserved the following case for the consideration of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved:\u2014\n\u201cAux s\u00e9ances de la cour du Bane de la Reine, terme du mois de septembre dernier, pour affaires criminelles, Angus Jacobs, autrement appel\u00e9 Skahatati a subi son proc\u00e8s sur accusation de meurtre pour avoir tu\u00e9 Agn\u00e9s Jacobs, autrement appel\u00e9e Kaowakeri Karonhienhawitha.\n\"Joseph Jones, coroner, pour le district de Montr\u00e9al a \u00e9t\u00e9 le premier t\u00e9moin produit, et a prouv\u00e8 a l'en-qu\u00e9te qu'il avait -tenu sur le corps de la victime qui y est design\u00e9e dans le verdict ou rapport du jury sous le nom de Agn\u00e9s Jacob, autrement appel\u00e9e Kaowakeri Karonhienhawiiha.

A. Dorion,\n\"Juge en chef, B. R\n\u201cMontr\u00e9al, 8 novembre, 1888, The Court of Crown Cases Reserved held the evidence sufficient and affirmed the conviction. The prisoner then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nCornellier Q.C. for appellant and Trenholme for the respondent.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The prisoner, Angus Jacobs otherwise called Skahatati\u2014an Iroquois Indian of the Caugnawaga tribe\u2014was indicted for the murder of his wife, who was described in the indictment as Agnes Jacobs otherwise called Kaowakeri Karonhienhawitha. The prisoner having been found guilty of manslaughter the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench before whom the trial took place reserved this case for the opinion of the Court in banc pursuant to the Statute ([1]).\nThe Court of Queen's Bench (Mr. Justice Doherty dissenting) held that the prisoner was properly convicted.\nIt was not proved that the deceased was known by the name of Marguerite Monique; the objection on that score was therefore properly overruled \u2014 and indeed the point reserved by the case does not include any question on that head. The allegation of the name of the deceased in the indictment under an alias was clearly good pleading inasmuch as the names of third persons as well as those of prisoners may be thus laid. In Mr. Justice Stephen's work on Criminal Procedure ([2]) the rule of pleading is thus stated \"The indictment\" must state the Christian name or names and the \"surname of the Defendant and the person against\" whom the offence was committed. If they have gone \" by or acknowledged more names than one they may \" be described as J. S. otherwise called J. T. The deceased being thus properly described in the indictment as \" Agnes Jacobs alias Kaowakeri Karonhienhawitha the proof to support the indictment must of course be secundum allegatum.\nThen it is proved by the sister of the deceased that the latter was known by the Indian name in which under an alias she was described in the indictment, but there is no proof that she was ever known as or called Agnes Jacobs. The sole question is, therefore, whether this proof supports the indictment. On the one hand it is said that when a party is described under an alias it must in order to support the indictment, be proved that he is known by both names, being called sometimes by the one and sometimes by the other. On the other hand it is contended for the crown that when the name of a person mentioned in an indictment is laid in this way it is sufficient to shew that he was known by one of the names stated though there may be no proof whatever of his having been called by the other.\nI am of opinion that the latter is the correct conclusion The literal terms of the allegation in the indictment o otherwise called \" are covered by such proof Which in the case of a prisoner described under an alias has always been held sufficient. I can see no reason why any distinction should be made in this respect between the instance of a prisoner and that of a third person described in this alternative manner In the one as well as the other it is a literal proof of an averment that his name was A otherwise B, to prove that he was called by the name B and by no other name. I find no English case upon the point for the reason probably that the practice was too plain ever to have given rise to doubt. In Dr. Wharton's work on Criminal Evidence ([3]), there is the following passage When the name either of the defendant or a third party is laid with an alias dictus proof of either name will be enough,\nI also find, in the treatise on Criminal Procedure ([4]) by the same learned writer the following passage containing a reference to the same point speaking however of the defendant's name.\nThe surname may be such as the defendant has usually gone by or acknowledged: and if there be a doubt which one of the two names is the real surname the second may be added in the indictment after an alias dictus thus \" Richard Wilson otherwise called Richard Layer.\" Proof of either will be enough\nI am of opinion that the decision of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved holding the prisoner properly convicted was entirely right and that this appeal from it should be dismissed with costs\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The appellant, an Indian, was indicted under the name of Angus Jacobs otherwise called Skahatati for the homicide of one Agnes Jacobs otherwise called Kaowakeri Karonhienhawilha, and pleaded not guilty. At the trial evidence was given identifying the deceased as an Indian woman by the Indian name given to her in the indictment, but no evidence was offered to .how that she was known by the name of Agnes Jacobs. There does not appear to have been any evidence that she had acquired by marriage or otherwise the name of Jacobs or that she was known by that name, or in fact by any other than her Indian name as above stated. It was objected at the trial upon the part of the now appellant that he could not be convicted of the offence charged in the indictment for want of evidence to shew that the deceased was known by the name of Agnes Jacobs. The objection was overruled and the prisoner was found guilty, by the jury, of manslaughter. In view of the above objection the learned judge who tried, the case, reserved, for the consideration of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved in the Province of Quebec where the trial took place, the question whether proof only that the deceased was known by the Indian name given her in the indictment, was sufficient to justify the conviction.\nThe Court of Crown Cases Reserved for the Province of Quebec decided that it was and from that judgment this appeal is taken.\nI am of the opinion that proof of the deceased's Indian name as given was sufficient. In fact, as far as appears, this was her only true name, or that by which she was known. The description as stated in the indictment was just the same as if the Indian name had been stated first, followed by \"otherwise called Agnes Jacobs,\" in which case, on the Indian name being proved the identification would surely be sufficient. No case has been cited in support of the contention that where two or more names are laid under an alias dictus all must be proved. Such a contention is at variance with the use of the form alias dictus the object of which is to enable proof of one or other of the names to be sufficient. The contention that the appellant, if again indicted for the homicide of this same person described by a different name, would be unable to plead his conviction in the present case, has no foundation in point of fact, for in the event of such a contingency, remote if possible, occurring, there would be no difficulty whatever in pleading that the person in such an indictment, charged to have been killed, was an Indian woman, known by the name of Kaowakeri Karonhienhaw\u00eetha of the homicide of whom the accused was convicted on the indictment in the present case This case appears to be quite distinguishable from the case of Reg. v. Frost ([5]) in which proof of some only of the christian names as laid in the indictment of a person necessary to be identified was held to be insufficient, it having been proved that the person had other christian names than those proved. Here the whole of the deceased's Indian name has been proved, and so far as appears she had no other name, so that there can not be said to be any uncertainty as to the person for whose homicide the appellant has been convicted.\nThe appeal must be dismissed.\nPATTERSON J,\u2014The prisoner was indicted for the murder of \"Agnes Jacobs, otherwise called Kaowakeri karonhienhawitha,\" and was convicted of man-slaughter and sentenced, the Chief Justice, Sir A. A. Dorion, reserving for the opinion of the Court of Queen's Bench the question whether sufficient evidence was given of the description of the person alleged to have been murdered to justify the verdict of manslaughter.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench held the evidence sufficient, Mr. Justice Doherty dissenting, and the prisoner has appealed to this court.\nThe facts stated by the learned Chief Justice are that Angus Jacobs was tried for the murder of \"Agnes Jacobs otherwise called Kaowakeri Karonhienhawitha:\" That the coroner proved the inquest on the body of the victim who is described in the verdict or return of the jury under the name of Agnes Jacob otherwise called Kaowakei Karonhienhaw\u00eetha: That the second and the principal witness, Karonhienawi deposed that she knew Kaowakeri Karonhienhaw\u00eetha, her sister and the deceased wife of the prisoner, and that she was present at the assault which caused her death: That the other witnesses did not give the name of the deceased, only describing her as being, when alive, the wife of the accused: That the accused and his wife were Indians, living at Caughnawaga: That the witness, Agathe Karonhienawi and several other witnesses belonged also to Indian tribes and spoke only the language of their tribe, their evidence being given to the jury by means of an interpreter: That after the close of the evidence for the Crown, the accused called several witnesses on his own behalf: That before addressing the jury for his client, the prisoner's counsel called the attention of the court to the fact that the indictment purported that the deceased was called Agnes Jacob otherwise called Kaowakeri Karonhienhaw\u00eetha, and that the evidence was that she was called Marguerite Monique, in support of which proposition he referred to a pretended certificate of baptism which was not proved in the cause: That the jury found the prisoner guilty of manslaughter by a verdict returned on the 20th of September, 1888: That as there was no proof that the victim of the blows inflicted by the accused was called Marguerite Monique, there was no foundation for the objection of his counsel: That on the other hand it was not proved during the proceedings, unless it was by the return of the jury at the coroner's inquest, that the prisoner's wife was called Agnes Jacob, nor that she was known by that name; and that as the variance between the description given in the indictment of the person killed and the proof of the name of that person seemed to him, the Chief Justice, of some importance, he thought it right to reserve for the consideration of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved the question which I have mentioned.\nIf the court should be of opinion that the proof on the point was sufficient the verdict was to stand.\nOn the contrary, if the court should think there was a fatal variance between the name by which, the person killed was described in the indictment and the proof which had been given, the verdict was to be annulled.\nThe term \"variance\" is hardly appropriate. There is no variance. The proof in no way differs from the description in the indictment. As far as it goes, it agrees with that description. The question is, does it go far enough?\nThe evidence is direct that the woman killed by the prisoner was Kaowakeri Karonhienhawitha. It is also directly proved that she was the wife of the convict, whence it follows that her name was Jacobs. Thus the whole description is covered with the exception of the christian name Agnes. lt does not appear that Agnes was not her name. If that had been shown there would have been more reason to talk of a variance. Counsel who took the objection would seem, as I gather from the learned Chief Justice's note, to have been alive to the difference between proving a different name from that given in the indictment and failing to prove what the name was, for he based his objection on the name of Marguerite Monique. The objection in that form was not improperly urged as a variance, but it failed for want of proof that Marguerite Monique was the name of the deceased.\nI have given as full an examination as has been in my power to the question whether the verdict would have been justified if the evidence had gone no further than to prove that the woman killed by the prisoner was called Kaowakeri Karonhienhawitha, and I have not been able to find authority for holding that it would not be justified. The question is one of identity, and it has been properly so treated by Mr. Cornellier in his able and ingenious argument on behalf of the prisoner. The rule, Which is well settled as illustrated by d\u00e9cisions many of which were cited to us, and which is usually enforced with strictness, requires the name, whether of the accused or of a third party, to be proved as laid in the indictment, and the mitigation of the harshness incident, to the operation of the rule, by the extension of the power of amendment, rather affirms than discredits the rule. But the necessity of proving more than one name when alternative names are laid with an alias dictus, is a different thing. I was a good deal impressed by the argument that the substantive description here was Agnes Jacobs, the Indian name being secondary only, and that, whether the latter was proved or not, the identity was not established without proof of the former; but I cannot find authority to support that view with sufficient certainty to warrant an interference with the judgment in appeal.\nThe deceased is not described in the indictment as the wife of the prisoner. Had she been so described, the proof of identity afforded by this evidence would have been complete, without proving that her name was Agnes. One description would have been established sufficient to identify the person described with the person killed, and no conflict of proof would have arisen from the mere absence of evidence touching the alternative description.\nIt may be plausibly argued that that illustration is not quite parallel to the description in hand, but I am unable satisfactorily to distinguish them.\nBut the case is stronger than one where there is no evidence to prove the alternative description. We have, as I have remarked, evidence from the witnesses that the name of the deceased was Jacobs. It was proved before the jury that she was the wife of the prisoner, who therefore knew her real name and who called witnesses, and could by those or some other witness have shown, if the fact was so, that the person called Kaowakeri karonhienhaw\u00eetha was not Agnes. Tee proof of the proceedings before the coroner is to me a new feature in the ordinary evidence at a trial for murder. Whatever was the object of the proof, the effect was that there was before the court and jury a record touching the crime in question, though not an adjudication in any sense binding on the prisoner. In it the deceased was described by both names. That description may be conceded to have been evidence of the faintest kind and of no weight against contradictory evidence adduced at the trial; but the evidence, in place of contradicting, bore out, as far as it went, the allegations of the return; the return itself was put m evidence, without objection, as something relating to the same offence for which the indictment was preferred; and no attempt was made on the part of the prisoner to question, by evidence, the identity.\nOn the whole I am not prepared to say that a specific finding that the deceased was the person called Agnes Jacobs would have been unsupported by evidence.\nIn my opinion we should dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for appellant : Ouimet, Cornellier & Emard.\nSolicitors for respondent : Trenholme, Taylor & Bucihcan.\n[1] See p. 434.\n[2] P. 160.\n[3] Ed 1884 p. 92.\n[4] Ed. 8, pp. 75 and 76. citing (South Car) Reports p. 310.

C. ch. 129\u2014Contributory Calls on\u2014Double liability\u2014Set off\u2014Bank Act R. S. C. ch. 120.\nA contributory of an insolvent company, who is also a creditor, cannot set off the debt due to him by the company against calls made in the course of winding-up proceedings in respect of the double liability imposed by the Banking Act, Revised Statutes of Canada, ch. 120.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick on a special case.\nThe respondent Troop was a shareholder and also a creditor of the Maritime Bank doing business at St. John, N.B. The bank became insolvent in 1887 and is being wound up under the Winding-up Act, R. S. C. ch. 129. The respondent was placed on the list of contributories, but claimed to be entitled to set off the indebtedness of the bank to him against the calls on his stock, and that he is only liable for the difference. The facts were all admitted, and the following question was, by the special case, stated for the opinion of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick:\u2014\nHas the said Howard D. Troop, under the admitted facts, a right to set off the said $5,330.88 against the amount of $10,300 due by him for the calls made upon him? If not, then the order for the payment of the said call is to remain in full force; but, if the said Howard D. Troop has such right, the amount of $5,330.88 is to be deducted from such call as the several instalments fall due, and the order is to remain in force for the difference.\nThe Supreme Court of New Brunswick decided this question in the affirmative and ordered the amount due from the bank to be deducted from the calls. The liquidators of the bank appealed from that decision.\nBarker Q.C. for the appellants.\nThe Bank Act provides for the double liability of shareholders. R. S. C. ch. 120 s. 70. This is a liability which does not arise until the commencement of the winding-up proceedings, and is not within the section relating to set off. R. S. C. ch. 129 s. 57. See Grissell's Case[1]; Black & Co.'s Case[2]; Re Whitehouse[3]; Gill's Case[4]; Sawyer v. Hoag[5].\nThe right of set-off is not extended by sec. 57 of ch. 129, but only preserved where it would exist if the bank was not being wound up.\nJ. A. Vanwart for the respondent.\nThe right of set-off is expressly provided for by the Winding-up Act, R. S. C. ch. 129 ss. 57 & 73. Secs. 44, 46 and 73 of the Bank Act, R. S. C. ch. 120, show that this applies to the double liability.\nThe learned counsel cited In re China Steamship Co.[6].\nHis Lordship the Chief Justice took no part in the decision of this case.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The sole question in this appeal is as to the right of a shareholder in an insolvent bank, in course of being wound up under the Winding-up Act, to set-off a debt due from the bank to himself against calls made upon him by the liquidators in respect of the double liability imposed by the 70th section of the Banking Act, Revised Statutes of Canada, ch. 120. This section is as follows:\u2014\nIn the event of the property and assets of the bank being insufficient to pay its debts and liabilities, the shareholders of the bank shall be liable for the deficiency so far as that each shareholder shall be so liable to an amount over and above any amount not paid up on his shares equal to the amount of such shares.\nIt is clear from the wording of this section, and of section 72 of the same act, that the monies to be obtained from calls made in enforcement of this double liability were to form a fund to pay the debts and liabilities of the bank, and that, therefore, if the double liability was one in course of being enforced, not in a proceeding taken under the Winding-up Act, but under the Banking Act, by the directors, pursuant to sections 71 and 72 of the latter act, there could be no set-off by a shareholder upon whom a call of this kind was made. The obvious reason for such a conclusion being that the fund thus constituted being formed expressly to pay debts and liabilities, it would be in law a fund which the directors would hold in trust for the creditors of the bank, and therefore that mutuality between the cross demands, which is an essential requisite in all cases of set-off, would be wanting. The money which the shareholder would be called on to pay would, in this case, be payable into the hands of the bank or its directors, but it would be so paid to them as trustees for distribution amongst persons who were under no cross liability whatever to the shareholders\u2014namely, the body of creditors of the insolvent bank.\nSuch being, in my opinion, the solution which this question would receive if there had been no winding-up, the question we have to decide is narrowed to this: Does anything contained in the Winding-up Act remove this objection to a set-off proceeding on the ground of want of mutuality? The material section of the Winding-up Act is the 57th, which is in these words:\u2014\nThe law of set-off, as administered by the courts, whether of law or equity, shall apply to all claims upon the estate of the company, and to all proceedings for the recovery of debts due or accruing due to the company at the commencement of the winding-up, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the business of the company was not being wound up under this act.\nI quite agree that the question of set off is regulated by this section, and that all we have to do is to apply the provision contained in it to the state of things as regards the nature of the liability existing under the Banking Act. As I have already shown, the debt due by the shareholders in respect of a call under the double liability clause is, in equity and in substance, a debt due, not to the bank, but to the creditors of the bank\u2014whilst the debt which the shareholder seeks to set-off is a debt due, not from the creditors of the bank\u2014but from the banking corporation itself; consequently they are not in any sense \"mutual debts.\" Then what section 57 requires us to do is to apply \"the law of set-off, as administered by courts of law or equity,\" to this state of things. Now, as regards the statutory right of set-off, which in the province of New Brunswick prevails in courts of law, it is by an express provision[7] of the Consolidated Statutes of that province restricted to \"mutual debts,\" and the doctrine of setoff, as applied by courts of equity according to the general principles of equity, is also invariably restricted to cross debts or demands which are \"mutual.\" Therefore, applying \"the law of set-off,\" which sec. 57 requires us to do, no set-off is admissible in the present case.\nTo put it in another form: \"mutuality\" was and always had been an essential of the law of set-off up to the time of the passing of the Winding-up Act\u2014 and there is nothing in the latter act in any way derogating from this universal principle.\nI have not felt called on to write at greater length, as Mr. Justice King has, in the opinion delivered by him in the court below, stated what I consider to be the correct view of the law with great fulness and accuracy, and I refer to what he has said if any amplification is required.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs to the liquidators, both here and in the court below.\nTASCHEREAU and GWYNNE JJ. concurred.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The question on this appeal is whether a stockholder of the bank who has been placed on the list of contributories under the provisions of the Winding-up Act[8], in respect of his double liability under the Banking Act[9], can set off against calls for that double liability an independent debt due to him by the bank.\nThe question is important, and, having regard to the form of some of the provisions of the Winding-up Act, it is not a matter of surprise that two arguments in the court below failed to secure a unanimous judgment, or that one of the learned judges receded on the second argument from the view of the statute which he entertained after the first.\nThe opinion of the majority of the court was in favor of allowing the set-off, and from that decision the liquidators appeal.\nIt will be convenient in the first place to examine the provisions of the Winding-up Act which bear upon the matter in hand, before referring particularly to those of the Banking Act, although it is under the latter act that the double liability arises.\nThe sections of chapter 129 more directly operative are 44, 46 and 57; others, and especially 73, may have to be also taken into account.\nSection 44 is as follows:\u2014\nEvery shareholder or member of the company, or his representative, shall be liable to contribute the amount unpaid on his shares of the capital, or on his liability to the company, or to its members or creditors as the case may be, under the act, charter or instrument of incorporation of the company, or otherwise; and the amount which he is liable to contribute shall be deemed an asset of the company, and a debt due to the company, payable as directed or appointed under this act.\nAnd section 46: \u2014\nThe liability of any person to contribute to the assets of a company under this act, in the event of the business of the same being wound up, shall create a debt accruing due from such person at the time when his liability commenced, but payable at the time or respective times when calls are made as hereinafter mentioned for enforcing such liability; and in the case of the bankruptcy or insolvency of any contributory, the estimated value of his liability to future calls, as well as calls already made, may be proved against his estate.\nThese sections evidently include the double liability of shareholders in a bank. It is covered by the words of section 44 as a\nLiability to the company, or to its members or creditors as the case may be, under the act, charter or instrument of incorporation or otherwise.\nAnd it is therefore, under section 46, a\nLiability to contribute to the assets of a company under this act, in the event of the business of the same being wound up.\nAnd it creates\nA debt accruing due from such person at the time when his liability commenced, but payable at the time or respective times when calls are made.\nWhether for all purposes of this statute it stands on the same footing as an amount unpaid on shares of capital may have to be considered further on.\nA shareholder in a joint stock company incorporated under our general acts has an undoubted right to set off any debt due him by the company against a call upon his unpaid stock made in the ordinary conduct of the business of the company. In England the same right exists, but there it is well settled that under the clauses 38 and 75 of the Companies' Act, 1862[10], which are essentially like our sections 44 and 46, no set-off against calls can be allowed in a limited company after liquidation has commenced, a different rule obtaining under section 101 when the liability is unlimited. And the same rule is applied whether the calls are made before or after the liquidation proceedings have begun; Grissel's Case[11]; Calisher's Case[12]; Black & Co.'s Case[13]; Barnett's Case[14]; Re Whitehouse[15].\nOne provision of section 133 of the Companies' Act, 1862, is that the property of the company shall (upon a voluntary winding-up) be applied in satisfaction of its liabilities pari passu, and, subject thereto, shall, unless it be otherwise provided by the regulations of the company, be distributed amongst the members according to their rights and interests in the company. Our section 58 has an equivalent provision, not confined, however, to the case of a voluntary winding-up. It does not contain the words pari passu, the language being:\u2014\nThe property of the company shall be applied in satisfaction of its liabilities and the charges incurred in winding up its affairs.\nBut the principle of ratable distribution must be intended, the words pari passu being omitted as unnecessary. \"Property\" here includes unpaid capital as well as other assets; Webb v. Whiffin[16].\nIn Grissel's Case (2) Lord Chelmsford more than once referred to section 133. In one passage he said[17]:\u2014\nThe act creates a scheme for the payment of the debts of a company in lieu of the old course of issuing executions against individual members. It removes the rights and liabilities of parties out of the sphere of the ordinary relation of debtor and creditor to which the law of set-off applies. Taking the act as a whole, the call is to come into the assets of the company in payment of debts. To allow a setoff against the call would be contrary to the whole scope of the act. In support of this view it will be sufficient to refer again to the 133rd section as to the satisfaction of the liabilities of the company pari passu. And the argument against the allowance of a set off, addressed to the court on behalf of the official liquidators, is extremely strong\u2014that if a debt due from the company to one of its members should happen to be exactly equal to the call made upon him he would in this way be paid twenty shillings in the pound upon his debt, while the other creditors might, perhaps, receive a small dividend, or even nothing at all.\nSection 133 referred in terms only to a voluntary winding up, and the winding up in connection with which Grissel's Case[18] arose was not of that character. That circumstance was referred to as detracting from the force of the remarks of Lord Chelmsford in Brighton Arcade Co. v. Dowling[19], where a different rule as to set-off was held to apply when the winding up was voluntary\u2014a decision which would probably not now be followed; see Re Whitehouse & Co.[20]; but the criticism leaves the argument apposite to our section 58, which applies to compulsory winding-up proceedings.\nThe English decisions on the construction of the cognate provisions of the Companies' Act, 1862, are conclusive against the claim to set off a debt against calls on unpaid stock under our statute, unless the right is given by section 57. Let us note the exact terms of the section:\u2014\nThe law of set-off, as administered by the courts, whether of law or equity, shall apply to all claims upon the estate of the company, and to all proceedings for the recovery of debts due or accruing due to the company at the commencement of the winding up, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the business of the company was not being wound up under this act.\nIt is impossible to reconcile the construction of this section contended for by the respondent with the other provisions to which I have referred Thus, reading sections 44, 46 and 58 together, they declare that unpaid capital is an asset of the company and a debt due to the company, accruing due when the shareholder's liability commenced but payable when calls are made, and shall be applied in satisfaction of the liabilities of the company and the charges incurred in winding up its affairs, and what remains shall be distributed among the members or shareholders.\nA shareholder who is a creditor occupies the same position in respect of his debt as a creditor who is not a shareholder, and no better position. That was so held in Grissel's Case[21]. The property of the company is, under section 58, to be applied towards the satisfaction of the company's liability to him, just in the same way as if he were not a shareholder. But, accede to the contention of the respondent, and as pointed out by Lord Chelmsford, he may be paid in full while others get nothing.\nSection 57 does not extend the law of set off to any class of debts to which the statute of George II, or the New Brunswick law, would not apply. The debts must still be mutual debts and in the same right. It preserves the right that would have existed if the business of the company was not being wound up under the act, and in that respect it declares the law as it had been held by Lord Hatherley under the Companies' Act, 1862, in re Agra & Masterman's Bank[22]; but it limits that effect to proceedings for the recovery of debts due or accruing due to the company at the commencement of the winding up.\nThe argument for the respondent makes the two contiguous sections, 57 and 58, inconsistent with each other, because the property of the company, or that part of it which consists of unpaid stock, cannot be applied in payment of the liabilities generally if it goes to satisfy debts due to individual members without regard to the claims of others. The construction we are urged to put upon section 57 is so much at variance with the general scheme of the measure that it cannot be taken to interpret fairly the intention of the legislature. I believe the true understanding to be that the section has no reference to calls made upon shareholders after the commencement of the winding-up.\nThe original statute was 45 Vic. ch. 23 passed in 1882.\nThe provisions now found in the first part of section 56 of the revised statute and section 57 formed together section 60 of the act of 1882, the subject of the section being the proof of debts and claims against the company. The two sections must be read together as in their original connection. What is interposed between them in the revision, as a second part or sub-section of section 56 is a provision introduced in 1886 in favor of clerks, &c., by 49 Vic. ch. 46. By that act it was made a third sub-section to section 60 of the act of 1882, leaving the present section 57 to retain its position as the second sub-section. If any change was proper in making the revision, it would have been more correct to make a separate section of the new clause, which is not on the same subject as the others, relating as it does to the dividend sheet and not to the proof of debts, and to let section 56 truly represent the original section 60 by embracing the provisions which, as section 57, are occasioning so much perplexity.\nSection 60 enacted that:\u2014\nWhen the business of a company is being wound up under this act, all debts payable on a contingency, and all claims against the company, present or future, certain or contingent, ascertained or sounding only in damages, are admissible to proof against the company,\u2014a just estimate being made, as far as is possible, of the value of all such debts or claims as may be subject to any contingency or sound only in damages, or for some other reason do not bear a certain value.\nAll this computation was obviously to have reference to the date of the commencement of the winding up proceedings. Then the section went on to enact \"2. The law of set off, &c.,\" as in the present section 57. The law was to apply to all claims upon the estate of the company. I call attention in passing to this form of expression, as I shall have to refer to it again by-and-by. The provision had immediate reference to the adjustment of claims for proof, and to the date of the commencement of the winding up, as of which data the claims were to be proved, and the express mention of that date in the latter portion of the clause indicates that the debts there spoken of do not include the liability, consequent upon the winding up, to be called on for payment of stock, but only debts ascertained and capable of computation at the commencement of the winding up.\nNo question of the accuracy of this construction would be suggested if it does not conflict as it was considered to do in the court below, and as the respondent now contends that it does, with sections 44 and 46. But if we read those sections, having in mind the scope and policy of the act, which look to the distribution of the assets amongst the creditors without preferring one to another further than, as in the case of clerks and servants, special preferences are given, we shall find no insuperable difficulty created by them.\nSection 44 declares the amount for which a shareholder is liable to be placed on the list of contributories after the commencement of the winding up to be an asset of the company, and section 58 requires the assets to be applied towards the satisfaction of the creditors generally. Section 46 does not describe the debt which it declares the liability to create, in the terms of section 57, as a debt due or accruing due at the commencement of the winding up, but as accruing due when the liability commenced. The whole reliance of the respondent is, and must be, on maintaining that the liability commenced before the winding up, and thus supplying by inference or implication what is not directly stated in the section, so as to give literal application to the language of section 57. I do not think that he can maintain that proposition; but he would also have to maintain that the debt is a mutual debt, and in the same right as that against which it is sought to set it off. The whole argument on which the English decisions against the right of set off proceed, going the length, as in Black & Co.'s Case,[23] of denying the power of the company to give a right of set off by contract with the shareholder, applies against the contention.\nBut we have in the very statutes before us direct proof that the reading contended for would misinterpret the intention of the legislature.\nThe Bank Act[24] under section 70 of which the double liability arises in the event of the property and assets of the bank being insufficient to pay its debts and liabilities, provides in section 72 for the making of calls for the double liability, and by section 74 enacts that:\u2014\nAny failure on the part of any shareholder liable to any such call to pay the same when due shall operate as a forfeiture by such shareholder of all claim in or to any part of the assets of the bank\u2014such call and any further call thereafter being nevertheless recoverable from him as if no such forfeiture had been incurred.\nThe \"claims upon the estate of the company\" which, under section 57 of the Winding-up Act, are brought under the law of set off are, in other words, debts owed by the company; and the \"claim in or to any part of the assets of the bank\" under section 74 of the Bank Act\u2014the statutes being in pari materia\u2014denotes, or includes, a debt owed by the bank to the shareholder who has failed to pay his call. Is the debt to be set off against the call? Section 74 says no. It declares the debt forfeited, and the logical consequence is that, in a proceeding like this for the recovery of the debt for the call, the shareholder has no debt to set off against it. At all events, and this is as far as it is necessary at present to go, the intention is perfectly clear that the call is to be paid without respect to the shareholder's claim in or to the assets of the bank\u2014or, to vary the expression, the one debt cannot be set off against the other.\nThe direct operation of section 74 does not touch calls for unpaid stock, but only for the double liability, which is what in the present case is in question; but the influence of the section is, as I apprehend, more extensive. There is no distinction made in sections 44 and 46 of the Winding-up Act between the double liability of shareholders in banks and the unpaid capital in banks or other companies. The sections apply to unpaid liabilities, however they arise.\nWhen, therefore, section 46 is relied on as leading to the conclusion that the liability for calls attaches as a debt as soon as one becomes a shareholder, and that that is a debt to which the law of set-off is, by section 57, to apply, the effect of section 74 is to add another consideration to those already adverted to in favor of construing section 46 so as to harmonize and not to conflict with the general purpose of the act.\nThe object of section 74 is to impose the penalty of forfeiture if calls for the double liability are not punctually paid. So far, they are treated differently from calls for unpaid capital. But, in recognising the obligation to pay them without regard to counter claims, it does not profess to regard them as an exception from the general range of such liabilities. On the contrary, the calls are, by section 73, to be made as prescribed in the Winding-up Act, where there is no distinction indicated.\nIt matters but little, if it matters at all, in which way these debts are kept away from the operation of the law of set-off\u2014whether by not being due or accruing due at the commencement of the winding up, or by not being mutual debts and in the same right as an ordinary debt due by the company to one of its members.\nI see no reason why the considerations which governed the English decisions against the right claimed are not equally applicable under our law and equally conclusive against the debts being of the character to which the law of set-off applies, or why we should not assume that to have been the opinion of the Legislature, as evinced by section 74 of the Bank Act, and otherwise. Great stress has been laid on section 73 of the Winding-up Act as opposed to this view, and as, in fact, opposed to denying the right of set-off for any reason.\nThat section reads as follows: \u2014\nWhen a debt due or owing by the company has been transferred within the time and under the circumstances in the next preceding section mentioned, or at any time afterwards, to a contributory who knows or has probable cause for believing the company to be unable to meet its engagements, or in contemplation of its insolvency under this Act, for the purpose of enabling such contributory to set up by way of compensation or set-off the debt so transferred, such debt shall not be set up by way of compensation or set-off against the claim upon such contributory.\nThere is no doubt that it is here assumed that a contributory may set off an independent debt against a claim upon him as contributory; all that the clause enacts, however, is that in the specified circumstances the debt transferred to the contributory shall not be set off, and whatever may have been in the mind of the draftsman when he introduced the word \"conributory,\" it will be found that no inference is necessarily to be drawn, or, one might say, none can properly be drawn, from it to affect the conclusions so far arrived at.\nWe need not enter on an exhaustive inquiry as to the force of the word \"contributory.\" It would probably be found only to apply, in strictness, to persons liable to contribute in respect of unpaid capital, or, in the case of a bank, for double liability. But no such limitation of its meaning appears in section 44 where it is made in terms to relate to any liability to the company or to its members or creditors. The same vagueness may attach to the use of the word in this section 73. It is only in connection with section 57 that any force is sought to be given to the section. If section 57 were not in the statute no one would venture to argue that the policy and purpose apparent from the general provisions could be controlled by any inference to be drawn from section 73. But section 57 says nothing of contributories. It is only by argument from the alleged effect of section 46 that it is attempted to bring contributories within the terms of section 57, and I have shown why, in my understanding of the legislation, that section was never meant to apply to contributories, as such, but only to such adjustments of account as would be proper or possible at the commencement of the winding up. I am satisfied that no inference can legitimately be drawn from section 73 opposed to the conclusion that only mutual debts and debts in the same right can be set off under section 57, and that the debts now in question are not of that character.\nWhether the debt created under section 46 by the liability to contribute is to be referred back to the original taking of shares in the company, or should be deemed to have accrued only after the winding up began, is a point of more difficulty. There are some cases which were noticed in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice in the court below that assume the earlier date. Ex parte Canwell[25]; Ex parte Hatcher[26]. The questions that turned on the date of the accruing of the debt in those cases were not allied to those in debate on the present appeal. On the other hand, there is an opinion of Lord Romilly in Ex parte Mackenzie[27], cited by Mr. Justice King, to the effect that the call refers back to the commencement of the winding up, and the same view forms the basis of part of the argument of Lord Chelmsford in Grissel's Case[28], and of Sir George Jessel in Re Whitehouse & Co.[29].\nThe weight of authority, so far as the particular point has been discussed, does not strike me as being so much in favor of dating the commencement of the liability further back than the winding-up proceedings, as to make the conjecture unreasonable that our legislature did not regard the statutable debt created by section 46 as due or accruing due at the commencement of the winding up, within the meaning of section 57.\nBut whatever may have been the views held by the legislature on these points, I am satisfied that the intention to be gathered from the statutes is that a contributory cannot set off against calls made in the course of the winding up, either for capital or double liability, an independent debt owed to him by the company.\nI say nothing of calls for capital which may have been made but not paid before the winding up. It may be open to question whether they are not covered by section 57, and so taken out of the English rule which classes them with calls made under the direction of the court.\nI agree with the conclusions of Mr. Justice King, who dissented in the court below, and think the appeal should be allowed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: F.

Art, 1241 C. C.\nStrong J. was of opinion, in the cases of Holmes v. Carter that upon the facts shown the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench should be affirmed.\nAPPEALS from the judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side) confirming the judgments of the Superior Court:\u20141. In Muir v Carter dismissing an opposition fyled by James Muir in his quality of curator to the substitution created by the will of the late Hon. John Molson; 2. In Holmes et vir v Carter (No. 28) dismissing an opposition fyled by E. A. Holmes et vir; and 3, in Holmes et vir v. Carter (No. 29), dismissing an intervention fyled by E. A. Holmes et vir.\nTha material facts which gave rise to the proceedings in the case of Muir v. Carter are as follows:\u2014\nThe respondent Carter having obtained a judgment against A. Molson issued an attachment by garnishment in the hands of the Molson's Bank, who declared that they held 148 shares standing in the name of A. Molson \"in trust for B. A. M. et al.\" upon which certain dividends were then payable. The defendant, Molson, contested the attachment, as did his wife by an intervention. The contestation and intervention were both dismissed. This judgment was confirmed by the Privy Council in July, 1885. Thereupon the plaintiff issued a rule nisi, calling on the bank to declare what dividends had since fallen due: and also seized the stock itself under execution. The defendant, assisted by Muir, appellant, who was appointed curator to the substitution in place of the defendant, opposed the seizure of 33 of the shares and the sale of the remainder was opposed by defendant's wife, who also intervened again in the attachment proceedings C and contested the declaration of the bank as to the 115 shares. At the trial it was shown the 33 shares were made up of two blocks the larger of which consisted C of 30 shares transferred by E. Ford a stock broker on the 19th of October 1875, to the account of Alex. Molson, in trust for E. A. Molson et al. Mr. Ford had advanced the defendant money on 1,110 shares, 840 shares belonging to the defendant individually and 270 held by him in trust transferred to Mr. Ford on 18th April, 1874. His advances not being repaid, Mr. Ford sold most of the shares pledged to him, 30 being left, being the shares in question in the present suit. Mr. Ford in his evidence stated that it was trust shares he transferred and that he sold first Mr. Molson's own stock, then what was required of trust stock to recoup himself. Mr. Ford explained he had to get the money he lent from financial institutions or capitalists and transfer to them the shares transferred to him and so long as he transferred the same number of shares in the same institution that was all that could be required of him but the shares re-transferred were either the same as those he received or represented and replaced them.\nIt was also proved that these shares had been purchased, when A. Molson was solvent, with moneys belonging to the substitution, and had been originally entered in the books of the bank as shares belonging to \" A. Molson, Esq., in trust.\"\nIn the case of Holmes et vir. v. Carter (No. 28) E. A Holmes fyled an opposition to the seizure of the 115 shares of the capital stock of the Molson's Bank standing in the name of Alex. Molson in trust for E. A M. et. al., claming them as her property. In the case of Holmes et vir v. Carter, (No. 29) E. A. Holmes fyled an intervention to the seizure of the said 115 shares claiming the corpus and dividends of said shares as her property. The evidence showing the dealings with these particular 115 shares is reviewed at length in the judgment of Patterson J. hereinafter given.\nThe evidence and documents of record having been made common to the three cases, it is only necessary to report the argument of counsel in the first case.\nR. Laflamme, Q.C; and Robertson, Q.C. for appellant.\nThe first question for consideration is whether or not the issues raised in the present cause have been already adjudicated upon. A reference to respondent's exhibits, viz. copies of the contestation by the said Alex. Molson of the former saisie-arr\u00eat, of the present respondent's answer thereto and the judgments rendered thereon, shows that the conditions necessary to support a plea of chose jug\u00e9e are not to be found in the present case, even on the issue with Mr. Molson in which the parties are the same. On the contestation of the former saisie-arr\u00eat only the dividends were in question; now it is the corpus of the shares themselves. In the former case dividends were claimed, not on the general ground that they were revenues of shares belonging to the substitution, but on the special ground that they were revenues of the balance of 640 shares belonging to the estate of the late Hon. John Molson, and referred to in an exhibit of respondent as standing in the account of Alex. Molson individually. All that that Mr. Molson ever claimed was that the shares in question, under seizure formed part of these 640 shares and consequently all that was or could possibly have been decided against him was that they did not form part of these 640 shares. But there can be nothing in this to prevent Mr. Molson from making a new claim to the shares on another ground, viz., that they are shares purchased with money belonging to the substitution, which appellants submit is proved by the evidence. Still less can the decision heretofore rendered be any bar to such a claim on the part of the appellant Muir.\nIn support of their position in this issue appellants refer to the words of the Privy Council in the former case ([1]).\"It is not said that any judgment in this suit c can possibly enable the creditor to attach the estates \" which they may eventually take, assuming the \" substitution in their favor to be valid nor is it s \"suggested that anything decided in this suit, between \"the judgment debtor and creditor, with regard to \"the validity of these substitutions would be binding \" upon them as res judicata\"\nThere remains the one question of fact now raised for the first time, viz., do the thirty-three shares seized belong to the substitution created by the will of the Hon John Molson, as claimed by opposants, or do they not? The account in which the shares in question are found being on its face a trust account the burden of proof was on respondent to establish that it was not. But the proof of the ownership and origin of the shares is as clear as it could be made under the circumstances.\nBut apart from the question of fact, we submit that in law Mr. Molson having pledged his own and trust shares for advances to himself any balance remaining up to the full number of the trust shares transferred would be considered trust shares. A man must for his own debts dispose of his own property before he disposes of that in which others have an interest. Sweeny v. Bank of Montreal ([2]).\nIt being established that the 270 shares transferred to Mr. Ford and of which he re-transferred the 30 in question, were trust stock, it remains only to be proved what the trust represented and to whom the stock really belonged. The parties most capable of showing this are manifestly the trustee and such of his employees as acted for him in dealing with the stock. The trustee was Mr. Molson, one of the appellants and his evidence is clear and satisfactory and shows that the shares are an investment made with moneys of the substitution made by Mr. Molson in a natural and legal manner long before he had any transaction with Carter. As institute he had control of the moneys of the substitution, and was by his position the legal trustee for the substitution. The law gives the institute full control of the substituted property, subject to his duty to invest the capital and account for it at the termination of his use ([3]). Consequently there, was no need of any specific appointment as trustee; the common law provides for that.\nABBOTT Q.C. for respondent.\nThe judgment of the Privy Council in the case of Molson v. Carter ([4]) constitutes chose jug\u00e9e against the appellants.\nIt will be seen from the copies of the contestation or plea fyled by the defendant to the original writ of attachment and the answer thereto and the judgments which have been rendered, that the whole question as to the ownership of this stock has been fully gone into and decided by the courts. All the \"pretensions now made by the opposants were made and adjudicated upon under the previous contestation. The proof which has been attempted to be made under the present contestation, namely, that these 33 shares belong to and form part of the substitution, was made under the previous contestation, with the only difference that whereas the defendant in his first opposition said that they formed part of the 640 shares, originally trans- ferred to him as his share in the estate, he now says they are part of 270 shares he bought with the money of the estate. In both the oppositions the object is the same, viz., to have the stocks declared to belong to and form part of the substitution; the reasons, or moyens, alone are different\nOn the question of fact, the learned counsel, after reviewing the evidence, contended that the whole of the shares in question had been accounted for and had been shown without doubt to be the property of the defendant, and always had been treated by him as such: while he had entirely failed to prove by any satisfactory evidence that any portion of the stock seized belongs to the substitution.\nHe contended, also the case of Sweeny v. Bank of Montreal ([5]) did not apply to the facts of this case.\nThe following judgments were delivered in Muir V. Carter\nSir W. J. Ritchie C.J. We all think that this is a case in which the appeal should be allowed.\nThe evidence in this case establishes very clearly the fact that in November 1871 Alexander Molson, when he was perfectly solvent, invested $15,000 of the money belonging to the estate of the late Hon. Mr. Molson, and that out of these moneys he lawfully purchased for the substitution two hundred and twenty shares in Molson's Bank. We think that the evidence of the fact sworn to by Mr. Molson is entirely corroborated by the evidence of Mr. Varey, and is also corroborated by the manner in which the property was dealt with.\nIt appears that when Mr. Molson transferred these shares, rightly or wrongly to Mr. Ford as collateral he gave instructions that when it became necessary to realize upon these shares Mr. Ford should first sell those shares of Mr. Molson's about which there was no question and then if there was any deficiency to sell the shares held \u201cin trust\u201d and if there was any surplus they should be transferred back to the account \"in trust\" Mr. Ford appears to have acted upon that principle, for he did sell first the stock belonging to Mr. Molson and then he sold the shares \u201cin trust\u201d and there being still thirty-three shares left he transferred them back to Mr. Molson \"in trust\" as the property belonging to the substitution, and Mr. Ford thus repaired, at any rate, whatever wrong might have been done originally as regards these thirty-three shares, by putting them back to Mr. Molson's account i in trust.\"\nWith reference to the plea of chose jug\u00e9e\u2014the matter in controversy before the Privy Council was not in reference to the corpus of the shares, but with reference to the dividends; it is not the same subject matter and not between the same parties and, therefore, I do not see the attributes necessary to enable the respondent to succeed on his plea of chose jug\u00e9e.\nUnder all these circumstances the appeal must be allowed.\nSTRONG J.--It is proved beyond all doubt that these thirty-three shares belong to the substitution. These identical shares were bought by Mr. Molson with the monies of the substitution and for the substitution, and at a time when he was perfectly solvent. Therefore, this opposition to the sale of the corpus of these shares is well founded.\nAs regards chose jug\u00e9e, it is out of the question here. The case in appeal before the Privy Council did not relate to the same thing and did not arise between the same parties The curator to the substitution, in which character the present appellant has formed this opposition, was no party in that quality to the former action appealed to the Privy Council, and therefore the plea of res judicata cannot avail the respondent. Indeed, the learned judge in the court below did not found his judgment upon that, but upon the other ground, which, in my opinion, the evidence fails to support, namely, that these shares did not belong to the substitution, but were the property of Mr. Molson himself, and so available to satisfy the demands of his creditors.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nFOURNIER J\u2014I am also of opinion that this appeal should be allowed. The evidence is plain that these thirty shares belonged to the substitution, and that the requisites to sustain the plea of res judicata are wanting.\nTaschereau J\u2014I am of the same opinion.\nPatterson J.I think that in whatever respect the evidence of Mr. Molson might be criticized, it is got over by what must be borne in mind that these shares if they were transferred, should have been put back to the account \u201cin trust\u201d and the evidence being quite consistent with this fact the appeal must be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nIn the two cases of Holmes et vir. v. Garter the following judgments were delivered:\u2014\nSir W. J. Ritchie C. \u2014I have been favored with a perusal of the notes of my brothers Taschereau and Patterson in this case and I entirely concur in the conclusion arrived at. At the close of the argument I would have been prepared to give judgment if the other members of the court had been so disposed. STRONG J. was of opinion that the judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench were in all respects correct and. that the present appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J. concurred with Taschereau J\nTASCHEREAU J\u2014In execution of a judgment against Alexander Molson the respondent seized 148 shares of the stock of the Molson's Bank. It appears that these shares were not registered as Molson's at all, but as Molson's in trust for E.A.M. et al., which is established to be, and has always been understood to be, the appellant's name.\nTo this seizure the appellant filed an opposition claiming 115 of these shares as her property, and alleged that at the time the bank was founded, in 1855, she was proprietor of twenty shares that she has since acquired other shares, and on the 6th October, 1873, she owned 115 shares, which, up to the 6th October 1875 stood in her own name and in the name of Alex. Molson in trust for E. A. Molson (meaning appellant) and were on the last-mentioned date transferred to the account \"Alex. Molson in trust for E. A. M et al.\"\nRespondent contested the, opposition by three contestations, pleading:\n1.Chose jug\u00e9e.\n2.That the shares seized never belonged to Mrs. Molson; that the twenty shares originally subscribed for in her name were subscribed for by the defendant, who had no authority to act for her.\nThat the shares in the name of Alex Molson in trust for E. A. Molson and E. A. M. et al., were his own and so placed for his own benefit and to prevent his creditors having any remedy against the said stock.\nThat about the 2nd October 1878, plaintiff in execution of his judgment against defendant, took a writ of attachment by garnishment in the hands of the Molson's Bank. That the bank declared they held the shares in question among others; that appellant intervened and claimed that said shares belonged to the estate of the late Honorable John Molson, and were insaisissables, and by reason of said claim she is established from now claiming the shares as her own.\n3. A general denial.\nIt is settled by Sweeny v. The Bank of Montreal ([6]) that the shares in question apparently and declaredly belonging, not to Alexander Molson individually, but being held by him for others, the burden of proof is on respondent to show that they are really Molson's. And if Molson ever admitted, while solvent, that the shares were not his, but Mrs. Molson's, such an admission would be for ever binding on him, and consequently on his general creditors, who can have no further rights than himself, in favor of his wife, unless error or fraud be clearly and positively established.\nSuch an admission is made both in the entries in the books of the bank and Molson's own books as proved by Mr. Varey. Molson's evidence in Muir v. Carter forms also part of the present case.\nBut apart from the force of such an admission, appellant's title to the 115 shares is clearly proved.\n1. The marriage contract proves her separate as to property in eighteen hundred and fifty-five, and that she had means of her own.\n2. Her ownership of twenty shares at the date of the opening of the Molson's Bank is proved by Elliot and Exhibit B. of case.\n3. Elliot proves, by statement A. of case, that the shares seized were standing in the name of Alexander Molson in trust for E. A M. et al. That one hundred and fifteen of these were on the 6th of October 1875, transferred from the account Alexander Molson in trust for E. A. Molson. This account produced as Exhibit B., shows shares standing in the bank for this account, back to 1860; that there were, on the 30th June, 1870 seventy-seven shares to the credit of this account and these were increased by allotment to one hundred and fifteen, the other thirty-eight having been allotted to Mrs. Molson and transferred when paid up from the allotment account. That these shares were looked on as held for Mrs. Molson and understood to be hers That Mrs. Molson had shares in another account Exhibit B., in her own name. He proves also Mr. Molson's authority to act for his wife under a power of attorney\u00bb Elliot's evidence is corroborated by that of George Varey, Molson's confidential book-keeper and clerk. He shows clearly that Mrs. Molson was looked on and treated as the owner of stock which her husband used for her, and that as far back as eighteen hundred and sixty-six she was owner of seventy-seven shares. He also proves that Molson was very wealthy up to eighteen hundred and seventy-five, in fact up to the suspension of the Mechanics Bank in the fall of 1875, long after the account of Alexander Molson in trust for E. A. Molson was opened.\nAll this shows clearly that the stock in the accounts \"Eliza Ann Molson\" and \"Alexander Molson in trust for E. A. Molson\" belonged to appellant and was treated as and looked on as hers and must therefore be considered as hers until some proof is made to the contrary. No such proof has been made. The two accounts shown by Exhibit B. ran parallel for five years and the irresistible conclusion is that the stock gradually worked from one to the other for convenience in dealing with it. The analysis of the two accounts together annexed to appellant's factum illustrates how the two accounts were treated as one, the way in which shares coming from one account were returned to the other, for instance 25th April 1861 eight shares were transferred to W. Molson from one account (E. A. M.); the same day twelve shares from the account A. M. in trust for E. A. M the 1st April 1869, W. Molson re-transfer-red forty shares evidently made up of these two Ta accounts. The evidence shows that the shares were transferred as pledges and not as sales and returned to one or other of the accounts upon repayment of the advance, the accounts thus nominally closed being really open, the shares being merely in the hands of pledgees.\nAs to plaintiff's pleas:\n1. Chose jug\u00e9e. That on the attachment of the 2nd October 1878, in the hands of the Molson's Bank above referred to, the present appellant intervened and set up all her rights in said shares as in the present opposition; that her intervention was dismissed and con sequently she cannot raise the same questions again in her present opposition. This plea is not borne out by the facts, and a comparison of the pleadings and judgments on the attachment and intervention referred to with the pleadings in the present cause, will show that the requisties of a plea of chose jug\u00e9e are entirely wanting. Art. 1241 C. C. establishes these requisite:\n\" 1. The authority of a final judgment applies only to that which has been the object of the judgment.\" We must therefore look to the judgment of the Superior Court rendered 30th June, 1881, and the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench and Privy Council, which simply confirmed it head in the light of intervenant's claims in that case, it appears that the only thing decided by the judgment was that the present appellant was not entitled under the will of the Hon. John Molson to claim a privilege on the revenue of the shares seized for alimony nor to rank on her husband's estate as a creditor on the ground of his insolvency.\nIt will be seen on reference to the copies of pleadings, filed as plaintiff's exhibits Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4, printed in the case in the intervention appeal that the cause of the demand in intervention made in 1878 by the now appellant was the bequest under the Hon. John Molson's will. She claimed that the shares seized formed part of the estate and were insaisissables and affected to her under the will, for alimony.\nThe cause on which her present demand is founded is her acquisition of the shares as her own property. No such cause and nothing in any way similar thereto was ever set up by her before. In fact Mr. Justice Papineau, by his judgment of the 30th June, 1881, specially rejected all proof of such a claim on the ground that the allegations of the intervention did not justify it.\n\" 2. Between the same parties acting in the same qualities.\"\n\" 3. For the same thing.\" This requisite too is wanting. By her intervention of the 5th April, 1880, appellant claimed that the dividends on the stock seized not the stock itself were affected for her sup-port as being part of the estate of the late Hon. John Molson. She claimed an alimentary right in the dividends and nothing more. By the present opposition she claims the stock the shares themselves as her own personal property. She never asked for the shares before she never even asked for the dividends but merely a limited and subsidiary interest in the latter. The judgment decided simply that she had no real existing interest to make such a claim. The only possible ground for maintaining that there is chose jug\u00e9e in this respect would be that, having failed in a claim for the revenues, appellant cannot in effect renew her claim by now making a demand for the principal. But appellant in reality never claimed the dividends C or revenues or any right of property in them, but merely that while they belonged to her husband she had a right as depending on them for alimony to C oppose their seizure by her husband's creditors. The Ta authorities are clear that in such cases a judgment refusing the revenue is a bar to a claim for the principal only when the claim for revenue has been founded in a pretended right of property in the principal and this being a second indispensable requisite) the claim for revenue has been rejected on the ground that the claimant had no right or title to the principal. A reference to respondent's exhibits 1, 2, 3 and 4 shows appellant's claim was not met in this way nor does the judgment of the Superior Court show any such ground the question was never even raised.\nThe two courts below have not supported the respondent's plea of res judicata and the authorities cited under Art. 1241 0. C. are clear that it is utterly unfounded.\nNext comes respondent's second contestation, which is in effect that the shares in the name of Alex. Molson in trust for E. A. M. were his own shares so placed to defraud his creditors and especially to prevent respondent's having any remedy against the said stock. It is to be noticed that the account Alex. Molson in trust for E. A. Molson was open in 1860, fifteen years before the date of respondent's mortgage. So that clearly there could have been no intention at the time of defrauding respondent.\nThe whole proof establishes, moreover, that the stock in both accounts \"E. A. Molson\" and \"Alexander Molson in trust for E. A. Molson\" was appellant's stock. Being separate as to property she could own stock and the stock was in her name from the date on which the bank opened its doors. It is true that the respondent shows that the subscription to the original twenty shares was in Molson's handwriting but he does not show that Molson's money paid for them. There is nothing dither unnatural or illegal in Molson's subscribing for his wife, more particularly as he had the full management of her affairs. It is not proved that Molson paid for the shares, and at this late date\u2014thirty years after the purchase\u2014appellant cannot be called on to point out what particular moneys of hers paid for them. She makes the best proof possible considering the lapse of time, viz:\u2014that she had a right to hold shares in her own name and that until the seizure made by the respondent her ownership of them was never questioned If a ratification of her husband's act in subscribing for her was required it is found in the power of attorney, in the handwriting of one of the officers of the bank and witnessed by another. The court below admitted these shares to have been appellant's but held that her account was closed in 1866 and that the power of attorney applied only to the stock in the account in appellant's own name \"E. A. Molson,\" This is true in a sense the power of attorney is dated in 1859, when only one account was in existence, but its terms are full including the right to transfer. The account in Mrs. Molson's own name was nominally closed in 1866 the fact being that the shares transferred from her account were held by those who had made advances on them but the account in the name of Alex. Molson in trust for E. A. Molson had been opened five years before and both accounts had always been treated by Molson and his book-keeper, and had always been considered by the bank, as appellant's. The evidence of Varey and Elliot is clear on this point. Varey's evidence goes further. He proves that Molson carried on an extensive banking business on his own account that in addition he carried on an entirely different business, and one which was kept separate and distinct in his books, by dealing in stock for and on account of his wife. He had control of her stock and he used his power of transfer to borrow money on it but all along he kept the stock, dividends and profits separate. The stock was transferred as security for loans but was always repaid arid in the course of the transfers and re-transfers found its way finally to the account \"Alex. Molson in trust for E. A. Molson\" where on the 1st January, 1871, was a balance to the credit of the account of 77 shares increased by allotment to 115 shares. This balance of 115 shares in this account appears as standing in the name of Alexander Molson in trust for E. A. M. in the published lists of shareholders for the years 1872, 1873, 1874,1875,which lists are filed as opposant's Exhibit G. There was nothing illegal in all this. Mrs. Molson had a perfect right to carry on operations in stock and she had perfect right to employ her husband as her agent and he would be bound to her in the same way as any third party who had been employed by her. Between her and her husband, even had there been no power of attorney, admissions found in his books or in his course of dealing, would have been binding against him, and his creditors can have no better rights than he has. On this point see Laurent ([7]) :\nPeut-on opposer l'aveu aux cr\u00e9anciers de celui qui l'a fait? 'affirmative n\u2019est pas douteuse. Quand les cr\u00e9anciers exercent un droit de leur d\u00e9biteur, ils agissent en son nom, et on peut leur opposer toutes ces exceptions qui peuvent \u00eatre oppos\u00e9es au d\u00e9biteur. Sauf aux cr\u00e9anciers \u00e0 attaquer l'aveu comme fait en fraude de leurs droits. La jurisprudence est en ce sens.\nDalloz ([8]) :\n(1) L aveu fait foi non-seulement contre celui de qui il \u00e9mane mais aussi contre ses h\u00e9ritiers et ayants cause, et notamment contre ses cr\u00e9anciers agissant en vertu de l'art. 1166. Ceux-ci ne pourraient repousser set aveu qu'au cas seulement ou ils 1 attaqueraient comme fait au prejudice de leurs droits. II a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 en ce sens que l'aveu fait par le d\u00e9biteur ou par ses h\u00e9riters qu'il n'est que propri\u00e9taire apparent des titres dont la restitution lui est clam\u00e9e peut\u00eatre oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 ses cr\u00e9anciers intervenant dans l'instance : s'ils ne rapportent point la preuve d'un concert frauduleux entre les parties contendantes.\nAnd it is to be noticed that Carter, the respondent, is a subsequent creditor. These shares were treated as Mrs. Molson's in 1871, on the books of the bank, and as far back as 1866, Molson admitted in his books that seventy-seven shares, the number claimed by the present opposition (together with the 38 allotted her, one for every two held at the date of the allotment as explained by Mr. Elliott), were appellant's. The date of Carter's mortgage is 9th February, 1875, so that the declaration in Molson's books that the stock was the property of his wife, the appellant, could not possibly have been made with any intent to defraud respondent. Nor could there have been any intention of defrauding his creditors generally, for two years afterwards he was worth from two to three hundred thousand dollars. The learned judge of the Superior Court has come to the conclusion that the shares in question were the property of defendant, on the ground that the account in appellant's name was closed in 1866, and that the defendant treated the stock in the other account as his own, and controlled it as such. Mr. Molson had power to sell and transfer, he exercised that power and did transfer and re-transfer the stock but as the evidence shows, and as he was bound to do as an agent, he kept appellant's business separate from his own and her stock where it could always be traced, in effect marked it with appellant's name. Mrs. Molson had stock from the opening of the bank; her husband up to 1873, at least, carried on a large and profitable business both for himself and as agent for her. Is it to be supposed under these circumstances that in 1871 her stock had vanished or is it not much more reasonable to suppose that the apparent state of affairs is the true state and that the stock marked as appellant's, considered by the officials of the bank as Tahers treated as hers by her husband her authorized agent, and by his confidential clerk\u2014and admitted by her husband in his books to be herd (and all this long before respondent was a creditor and while Mr. Molson was still wealthy) is in reality hers? To hold this stock to be Mr. Molson's would be not only to presume fraud, contrary to law, but to presume fraud committed without any definite or immediate object. Moreover, if Molson, at any time, had acted illegally with these shares how could this affect the appellant's rights.\nIn his second contestation, respondent raises another ground against appellant, namely a plea of estoppel, to which the Superior Court in one of the consid\u00e9rants of the judgment appears to attach some weight. The allegation is that appellant in her intervention in the former case, alleged that the shares now claimed by her formed part of the estate of the late Hon. John Molson. She did make such a claim but the judgment of the court rendered 30th June 1881 was against her and decided that the shares in question did not belong to the said estate.\nThere it was decided that the shares did not belong to the estate of the Hon. John Molson. The question to be decided now is a question raised for the first time viz: Who is the owner of the shares under seizure? The authorities on Art. 1351 C. N. (1241 C.C.) are in point on this question of estoppel and show beyond a doubt that a party to a suit who has failed to substantiate his claim under one title may do so under another.\nI resume by saying that both the object and grounds of appellant's present claim are altogether different from the object and grounds of her former claim therefore the plea of chose jug\u00e9e cannot avail against her. On the facts in issue, respondent as a creditor of Alex. Molson can stand in no better position than his debtor, can exercise only his rights and is bound by his admissions unless he proves that such admissions were made in fraud of his rights. Molson admitted the shares claimed by appellant to be her property previous to the date of respondent's claim and under circumstances that negative all suspicion of fraud. Moreover, the burden of proof is on respondent to show fraud. And he has made none. The acts of Molson on which he relies are acts that in themselves are perfectly legal and easily accounted for. Against the appellant herself there is no proof whatsoever. And, even if Molson had acted fraudulently, she, surely, should not thereby be deprived of her property. She is shown to have been the nominal and reputed owner of the shares from the beginning and her husband's control over them is fully explained by his position as her agent.\nWhat is the position of the respondent here? He seizes shares which are registered, as \"in trust.\" Now Sweeny v. The Bank of Montreal, in this court ([9]) and in the Privy Council, \"([10]) is a clear authority that these words \"in trust\" mean \"not for himself, but for others.\" They mean that Molson did not possess these shares anima domini. Now a seizure cannot be had but against goods in possession of the party seized animo domini. Leaving this view of the case aside what are the respondent\u2019s contentions? Does he claim to exercise the action of his debtor Molson, under Art. 1031 C. C. ? If so, he must fail for the simple reason that Molson, it is clear could not question his wife's title to those shares. Does he profess to exercise the C action Pauliana under arts. 1932 et seq? He must there also clearly fail. He has not proved fraud, then, under Art 1039, being a subsequent creditor, he has C not got that action. Moreover the conclusions of his pleas do not ask for the rescision of any contract. He then must fall back on the proof he attempted to make that as a matter of fact these shares do not belong to the appellant. On him was the burden of proof, as per Sweeny v. Bank of Montreal, and that proof in my opinion he has failed to make. The facts themselves are not disputed. Inferences of facts from the evidence adduced, are, here, what we have to determine upon.\nI would allow this appeal with costs distraits. On the intervention, for the same reasons I would also dismiss the appeal.\nPATTERSON J. \u2014 These two appeals which have been argued together, raise the question of the ownership of 115 shares of the capital stock of the Molsons Bank, the contest in one case relating to the shares themselves which have been seized by Carter under an execution issued upon a judgment against Alexander Molson, and the other case relating to the dividends on the shares which have been garnished under the same judgment.\nMr. Carter's claim against Alexander Molson is for a sum of $30000 lent to him on a mortgage of real estate on the 9th of February, 1875. He recovered the judgment, which is for $31,125 on the 17th of April, 1878, on the covenant to pay contained in the mortgage deed.\nThe history of the 115 shares, so far as material may be said to be entirely connected with dates much earlier than the loan from Carter to Molson. According to the evidence before us Mr. Molson was in good circumstances until late in the year 1875.\nIn 1873 he is said to have been worth from $250 000 to $300,000, and his insolvency is attributed by Mr Varey his confidential clerk, either wholly or to a great extent to his connection with the Mechanics Bank which failed in or about the year 1875.\nWe are not told of any debt or liability, or of anything tendering to cast doubt on the perfect solvency of Mr. Molson, until after the loan from Mr. Carter\nThe appellant Eliza Ann Holmes or Eliza Ann Molson, is the wife of Alexander Molson, duly separate as to property. Much of the evidence touching the 115 shares in question is derived from the books of the Molsons Bank where there are several accounts which have been put in evidence showing dealings with the stock of the bank.\nThe earliest of these accounts is in the name of Eliza Ann Molson. It begins on the 1st of October, 1855 with a credit 91 twenty shares \"by subscription.\" That was, as I understand, the date of the opening of the bank. The subscription is said to be in the hand-writing of Mr. Molson, the husband of the appellant, and there is evidence that he acted for his wife in her business transactions. The account contains in all eleven credits of shares acquired and six debits of shares parted with the last debit which bears date the 3rd of April, 1866, closing the account.\nThis account, which is not shown to include any transaction that was not strictly a transaction of Mrs Molson's, is referred to chiefly because a connection is apparent between it and another account through which the 115 shares are directly traced\nThat is an account headed \"Alex. Molson in trust for E. A. M.\" the initials being those of the appellant.\nIt begins with a credit, on the 9th of August, 1860, of ten shares followed on the 13th of the following September by another credit of two shares, and on the 16th of January, 1861, by another of twenty shares. These three credits make thirty-two shares. The first debit entry is of thirty-two shares transferred on the 25th of April, 1861, to W. Molson, and some years C later, but before any other entry appears in the account, viz., on the 1st of April, 1869, W. Molson transfers to the credit of this account forty shares. Now, in the account first referred to which was in Mrs. Molson's own name, we find eight shares transferred to W. Molson on the 25th of April, 1861, the same day of the transfer of the thirty-two shares from the trust account. The explanation suggested, and apparently borne out by the books, is that forty shares were on that day pledged to. W. Molson, eight from the one account and thirty-two from the other, and that those are the forty shares retransferred on the 1st of April, 1869, on the repayment of the loan for which they were pledged. The whole forty going then into the trust account, we perceive the connection between the two accounts The effect of the entry was to place at the credit of A. Molson in trust for his wife, forty shares, eight of which had stood in the name of the wife herself but the other thirty-two of which were as fully hers as the eight. That is what the account indicates and no evidence is given to cast doubt upon the matter This is the only purpose, as I have before said, in referring to these figures namely to confirm the inference that what is noted as held in trust for Mrs. Molson was really her property, because no part of the forty shares are seized or are now in question. They are apparently all gone. But the same trust account contains, on the same date as the retransfer of the forty shares viz. the first of April, 1869, a credit of seventy-seven shares transferred from an account kept in the name of \" Alex Molson in trust.\" We arrive, when we reach this entry of seventy-seven shares at what I understand to be the essential proof of the title of the appellant to the 115 shares, as I now proceed to explain.\nThe account \" Alex Molson, in trust, \" is, like the others, a short account, with eight or ten items on each side. It begins on the 12th of May, 1863; represents transactions with one hundred and eighty-eight shares; and is closed, for the time, by a debit of seventy-seven shares on the 1st of April, 1869, to \" A. Molson, in trust for E. A. M.\"\nWe have seen the corresponding credit in the account so designated Now, these seventy-seven shares so transferred from the general trust account, in April, 1869, to the specific trust for E. A. M., appear to have been at the credit of the general trust account, as early as April, 1866, but thirty-five of them were parted with in 1867, doubtless by way of pledge, and reacquired in March, 1868.\nConnect with this the testimony of Mr. Varey, who shows that Alexander Molson employed the shares belonging to his wife as he did those of others in speculations, and who kept a memorandum, which was put in evidence of stock held to and before the 1st of September, 1866, by his employer, in trust, which memorandum includes seventy-seven shares in trust for E. A. M.\nThe right of the appellant to these seventy-seven shares, dating back to April, 1866, is thus very satisfactorily established.\nIt is sufficient to say that it is prim\u00e2 facie established, for it would of course be open to rebuttal by proof that the reality was not what this evidence indicated. But there has been no such proof, nor any attempt to adduce evidence in that direction. Nor is there any-thing in the further examination of the books to discredit the prim\u00e2 facie inference. It is true that in the account in trust for E. A. M. there appear a few further entries after the 1st of April, 1869, indicating dealings by way of sale or pledge with the forty shares and the seventy-seven shares, or some of them; but the result was the restoration of the whole of the seventy-seven shares, that number remaining at the credit of the account on the 13th of June, 1870. There is nothing P to indicate that these were to any extent bought with the money of Alexander Molson, or that they were not always the separate property of his wife. Had this been otherwise, the result would, I apprehend, have nevertheless been the same, for Alexander Molson was in affluent circumstances without debts and without apprehension of falling into adversity, and could have made a valid gift to his wife, who was separate as to property. However this may be, the onus of proving that the shares were his and liable to seizure for his debts is clearly on those who assert that proposition, and no such proof has been made.\nI have so far traced only seventy-seven of the shares. The other thirty-eight of the 115 are the increment of the seventy-seven, being new stock issued, one share for every two, and placed to the credit of the trust account for E. A. M. on the 31st of May, 1873.\nWhatever foothold there has been for the contention against the appellant seems to have arisen from something to which it is proper to advert, if only for the purpose of showing .that it does not affect the question before us.\nOn the 1st of October, 1875, another account was opened in the stock register of the bank, headed:\" Alex.Molson in trust for E. A. M. et al.\" It contained three items only, viz.:__\n1875, Oct. 1, By A. Molson Shares\n3\n\" 6, \" ' in trust E. A. M\n115\n\" 19, \" E. Ford\n30\n148 The first and last items, making thirty-three shares, are not in question at present. We have had to deal with them in another appeal.\nThe 115 shares ought not to have been transferred to this account. The addition \"et al.\" indicates the children of Mr. and Mrs. Molson. But the transfer from the trust for Mrs. Molson alone to the trust for her and her children does not in any way alter the position so as to let in the judgment creditors of Alexander Molson.\nhaving traced the 115 shares as we have done, it will suffice to touch briefly on some other matters formally placed on the record, and discussed on the argument before us.\nThe Hon. John Molson died on the 12th of July 1860. His will directed is trustees to manage his estate for ten years and then to divide the residue among his five sons, of whom Alexander was one. They were to take their respective shares for life only. After the death of each son his share was to go to his children, subject to the right of his widow, if he should leave a widow to the usufruct during her widowhood.\nThe distribution took place on the 25th of March, 1871, when, amongst other things, 640 shares of Molson's Bank stock were allotted to Alexander.\nAlexander was appointed curator of the substitution of the shares of which he was institute, and tutor of his minor children.\nThe 640 shares were transferred to an account opened in his name in the stock register of the bank, on the 5th of April, 1871, and the result of transactions, in apparent breach of his duty as trustee, was that on the 1st of April, 1875, three shares only remained to the credit of that account. Those were the three shares transferred on the 1st of October, 1875, to the account \"Alex. Molson, in trust for E. A. M. et. al.\" They undoubtedly belonged to that particular trust, though the 115 shares did not.\nWe are not told why Mr. Molson assumed to transfer the 115 from the trust for his wife to that for his \"wife and children. From what we have seen it is apparent that he could not properly do so. But if we were to assume, as the respondent invites us to do, that the 115 shares were his and not his wife's, it is plain that his substitution of them for so many of the 640 that had been lost in his speculations would have been an act of duty and honesty and not a fraud.\nMr. Carter, the respondent, attached on a former occasion the rents of certain premises in Montreal which were part of Alexander Molson's share of his father's estate, and also the dividends on the 148 bank shares.\nThe present appellant intervened in that proceeding and claimed that the shares were part of the estate in which she was interested as substitute.\nIt appeared, as it appears from what I have said, that the 115 shares never formed part of the estate and it was pointed out in the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on appeal from the Court of Queen's Bench Carter v Molso[11]n (), that if they had been part of the estate the dividends, which alone were in question, would belong to Alexander and be attachable for his debts and further or as a consequence of that holding, that the present appellant had not the right to intervene, not being interested in the event of the suit which touched only the dividends ([12]) That decision of the Privy Council has been pleaded and relied on as affording a conclusive answer of res judicatca to the present contention of the appellant. It is obvious from what I have just said, and without going more at large into the subject, that the matter is not res judicata.\nIn my opinion, the judgment of the court below should be reversed and the appeals allowed with costs.\nAppeals allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Robertson, Fleet & Falconer.\nSolicitors for respondents: Abbotts & Campbell.\n[1] 10 App, Cas. 674.\n[2] 12 App. Cas. 617.\n[3] C.

The publication was proved by the editor of the newspaper, who swore that he received the original manuscript, which had been destroyed, from Campbellton, N.B., where both plaintiff and defendant resided, accompanied by a letter requesting its publication; that on the plaintiff complaining of such publication he had written to defendant and received an answer; and that from the signature and writing of this last letter he, the editor, believed the original manuscript to have been written by defendant. This was the only evidence of publication.\nEvidence was also admitted of the defendant's signature in a hotel register and on other occasions, to show that he had altered his usual signature in order to mislead the plaintiff and affect the trial.\nThe jury found a verdict for the plaintiff which the court in banc refused to set aside. The defendant then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe only questions to be decided on the appeal is as to the admissibility of the above evidence.\nWeldon Q.C. and Gregory for the appellant cited Doe Mudd v. Suckermore[1]; Greenleaf on Evidence[2]; Arbon v. Fussell[3]; Tennant v. Hamilton[4].\nHanington Q.C. for the respondent referred to Folkard's Starkie on Libel[5]; Odgen on Libel[6]; Fryer v. Gathercole[7].\nSTRONG J.\u2014At the conclusion of the argument I had formed and was prepared to express the opinion that the appellant had not succeeded in establishing error in the judgment of the court below. Subsequent consideration of the case has not led me to alter this opinion. It seems to me that there was no improper admission of evidence, and the other objections do not, in my judgment, call for any observation. Therefore, without writing more fully which I could only do by repeating, quite unnecessarily, the same reasons as have been already given in the well considered and able judgments delivered in the court below, I may at once state my conclusion to be that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The question which has arisen in this case is one of a very novel character; indeed, it would seem to be one of the first impression, for the industry of the learned counsel has found no reported case directly in point, nor does the precise point appear to have been referred to in any treatise. The action is one of libel. The plaintiff in his declaration alleges that the defendant falsely and maliciously composed and wrote of and concerning the plaintiff, and printed and published, and caused to be printed and published in a certain public newspaper called \"The Daily Transcript,\" published at Moncton, in the county of Westmoreland, in the province of New Brunswick, a certain false, scandalous, malicious and defamatory libel of and concerning the plaintiff, set out at length in two counts of the declaration. The defendant pleaded not guilty, and the sole question was as to the admissibility of the evidence, by which it was sought to be established that the defendant was the author of the article containing the libel and had caused its publication.\nOne Robert McConnell was the editor and publisher of the \"Daily Transcript,\" published at Moncton. In his paper of the 1st April, 1887, he published the article complained of. The plaintiff's name did not appear in the article, but he had no difficulty, from the matters treated of, in recognizing himself as the person alluded to. He received the paper containing the article complained of on the 2nd April, 1887, at Campbellton, in the province of New Brunswick, where he resided; and in about ten or twelve days thereafter he went to Moncton to see McConnell, the publisher of the paper in which the article appeared. In a conversation then had with him, McConnell stated that the defendant was the author of the article, and the plaintiff told him that unless an apology was made by the party who wrote the article, and published as publicly as the article had been, he would proceed against him, McConnell; to which McConnell replied that he would publish the retraction if the writer would agree to it. No retraction having been published, the plaintiff brought two actions for the publication of the libel, one against McConnell and the other against the defendant, and both were entered for trial at the same court, but that against the defendant was the only one tried, the action against McConnell having been withdrawn upon a verdict being rendered against the defendant. In this latter action McConnell was called for the purpose of connecting the defendant with the article, and it is as to the admissibility of McConnell's evidence for that purpose that the question arises.\nHis testimony in substance was, that upon the 31st of March or the 1st of April, 1887, he received by post a paper as coming from Campbellton, having on it the Campbellton post mark. Upon opening it he found in manuscript, in six or seven sheets, the article in question, and he published it in his paper of the 1st of April. After the type was set and he had read the proof he threw the MSS. away into the waste basket, and he stated that in the ordinary course of things it would go into the stove, and be destroyed. He had a distinct recollection of throwing it into the waste basket, and he had never seen it since. Upon the last sheet, or the back, there was, as he said, a request that he should publish the article, and assuring him that the facts could be proved, under which was subscribed the name, \"A. E. Alexander.\" McConnell swore that he did not know the defendant; that he had never, to his knowledge, seen him until he seen him in court upon the trial of the present action; that he had never seen him write; and that he had never had any communication from him until the beginning of May, 1887, when he received from him a letter in answer to one written by McConnell to him in relation to the subject matter of this suit, and except from that letter he had no knowledge whatever of the defendant's handwriting. McConnell's letter to the defendant was written for the plain purpose of endeavouring to obtain from the defendant some admission of his having been the author of the article, so as to relieve himself from responsibility to the plaintiff. He had written a previous letter in April to the defendant, to which he had received no answer, and so upon the 4th May he wrote to him the following letter:\nMr. A. E. Alexander, Campbellton:\u2014\nDear Sir,\u2014You have not replied to my request either to produce proof in support of the statement about Mr. Vye contained in your letter signed \"Facts that can be proved,\" or to publish a disclaimer. If one or other is not done I shall be obliged to give your name and the manuscript of your letter to Mr. Vye, as I do not intend standing in the gap of a libel suit. Please answer at once.\nThat this letter was, to say the least, disingenuous, appears from the fact that the writer had already, as we have seen, named the defendant to the plaintiff as being the author of the article, and had destroyed the manuscript which he threatens in his letter to give up in case the defendant should not come forward and accept the responsibility of the publication. The defendant appears to have known that McConnell had already accused him of being the author of the article and had given his name as such to the plaintiff, and as the letter threatens also to give up the manuscript, of the destruction of which the defendant had no knowledge, he challenges McConnell to proof of his accusation in his reply, dated the 5th May, as follows:\nCampbelltown, May 5, 1887.\nOn the 16th April you gave Yye's lawyer my name. Lately you have shown the document you claim I wrote; all that now remains is for you to prove it if you can.\nA. E. ALEXANDER.\nIt is under these circumstances that McConnell, with an action pending against himself in case he should fail to fix the responsibility for the article upon the defendant, is called as the sole witness to prove that the defendant was the person who wrote and sent to him for publication the article containing the libel complained of; and the question is: Was the knowledge which McConnell could have obtained of the defendant's handwriting by his receipt of this letter sufficient to justify his being received as a witness competent to prove that the manuscript of the article, so as aforesaid published by him (and which he said he had thrown away, and that it had become destroyed immediately after the manuscript was put in type, on the day of its receipt, and therefore could not be produced before the jury), was in the defendant's handwriting? for the learned judge who tried the case received the evidence against the protest of the defendant's counsel, and it was submitted to the jury, notwithstanding the most emphatic denial of the defendant upon his oath that he had written the article, or that he knew anything about it, and that if the writing in it looked like his it was a forgery; and the jury rendered thereon a verdict for the plaintiff, with $400 damages. Upon a motion having been made in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick to set aside this verdict, and for a rule to enter a non-suit for the reception of this evidence, and of other evidence which was also objected to and to which I shall refer later; or for a new trial upon the ground, among others, of misdirection in the learned judge who tried the case telling the jury that it was quite possible that McConnell might be able to carry in his mind the impression produced on him by the character of the handwriting in the communication or note received on 1st April, and so to be able to speak of its similarity to the defendant's handwriting contained in his letter of 5th May, and that McConnell's evidence was sufficient to go to them, for them to exercise their judgment upon it in determining the question in issue before them, namely, whether or not the defendant was the author of and responsible for the libel published in McConnell's paper of the 1st of April; the court refused a rule and maintained the verdict. From the judgment of the court refusing a rule this appeal is taken.\nBentham in his \"Rationale of Judicial Evidence\"[8] calls proof of a document, the execution of which is the point in issue, authentication by circumstantial evidence, of which there are three modes:\u2014\n1st. When the handwriting is proved by similitude of hands, asserted by the testimony of a witness, who, on other occasions, has observed the characters traced by the party in question while in the act of writing. This he calls presumption ex visu scriptionis or presumption from similitude of hands established by view of the act of writing.\n2nd. When the handwriting is proved by similitude of hands, asserted by a witness, who, without having ever seen the party write, is sufficiently acquainted with his hand by correspondence, or by having seen other writings, which, by indications sufficiently permissive appeared to have been written with his hand. This he calls presumption ex scriptis olim visis; and 3rd. When the handwriting is proved by similitude of hands, asserted by a witness, who, without such previous acquaintance with the handwriting of the party, pronounces the handwriting in question to be the handwriting of the party, on a comparison made of it with other specimens of his handwriting now, for the purpose of comparison, produced to him for the first time. This he calls presumption ex comparatione scriptorum or ex scripto nunc viso\u2014or presumption from comparison of hands.\nIn Doe ex dem Mudd v. Suckermore[9] the rule as to the proof of handwriting, where the witness has not seen the party write the document in question, is laid down by Coleridge J. thus:\nEither the witness has seen the party write on some former occasion, or he has corresponded with him, and transactions have taken place between them, upon the faith that letters purporting to have been written or signed by him have been so written or signed. On either supposition the witness is supposed to have received into his mind an impression, not so much of the manner in which the writer has formed the letters in the particular instances as of the general character of his handwriting, and he is called on to speak as to the writing in question by a reference to the standard so formed in his mind. The test of genuineness ought to be the resemblance, not to the formation of the letters in some other specimen, but of the general character of writing, which is impressed on it, as the involuntary and unconscious result of constitution, habit or other permanent causes, and is therefore itself permanent. And we best acquire a knowledge of this character by seeing the individual write at times, when his manner of writing is not in question, or by engaging with him in correspondence, either supposition giving reason to believe that he writes at the time, not constrainedly, but in his natural manner.\nPatteson J. states the rule in somewhat similar language, and referring to the two modes recognized of acquiring knowledge of handwriting, namely, by having seen the person, as to whose handwriting the same is raised, write; or, by having received letters from him. He says: The knowledge (that is, of the character of the person's handwriting) is usually, and especially in the latter mode, acquired incidentally and, if I may say so, unintentionally, without reference to any particular object, person or document.\nThat the rule was as stated by Coleridge and Patteson JJ. was not disputed by the learned judges who differred from them on the point then in judgment. Indeed it was admitted to be well established beyond all controversy, and this same rule is still laid down in all text-books as the prevailing rule, subject to the additional mode of proof since authorised by law, namely, by comparison of the handwriting of the document in question with authentic handwriting of the party whose handwriting the document in question is alleged by his adversary and denied by him to be, by persons skilled in discerning the character of handwriting, although they have never seen the party write, nor had acquired any previous knowledge of the character of his handwriting, being the third mode of authentication mentioned by Bentham.\nNow, the rule in question and its application have hitherto been limited to the case of knowledge of the handwriting of a party, acquired by a witness in one or other of the two modes above described, and applied to the enquiry as to the handwriting of a document produced before the court and jury in respect of which an issue is joined upon the question whether the document so produced is or is not in the handwriting of the person, of whose handwriting the witness had previously acquired the knowledge from which he is asked to give his testimony upon the point so in issue. In no other case than one calling in question the handwiting of a document produced before the court or jury engaged in the trial of an issue in which the handwriting of such document is disputed has the rule hitherto been applied; but it is now, apparently for the first time, contended, and it has been in effect held by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, that the rule is equally applicable to the case of an issue joined as to the handwriting of a document necessary to be proved, but not at all produced, before the court trying such issue; and of which handwriting the only evidence offered or capable of being offered is that of a witness who says that he had destroyed the document almost immediately after its receipt; and who, although he admits that he had no knowledge whatever of the person or of the handwriting of the writer, nor of the defendant or of his handwriting, save that some time subsequently to the destruction of the document in question, he had received from the defendant a letter, which he produces in court, undertakes to say that the destroyed document was, in his opinion, in the same handwriting as is this letter so received from the defendant. But, as it appears to me, it is of the very essence of the rule, and reason and justice require, that it should be confined to these cases for which it was established, and to which alone it has hitherto been applied, namely, the application of the witness's acquired knowledge of the handwriting of the party charged with having written a document produced before the court trying an issue joined in an action wherein the handwriting of such document is necessary to be proved. To extend the application of the rule to cases similar to that now under consideration would result in opening a ready way to the greatest abuse, and in effectually closing the door to all reasonable and intelligent inquiry into the truth of the matter in issue. In every action wherein the plaintiff asserts and the defendant denies that the document upon which an action depends is in the handwriting of the defendant, it is of the utmost importance, in the interest of truth and justice, that the defendant should have the most ample opportunity afforded him of convincing the tribunal charged with the trial of the issue, by persons well acquainted with his handwriting, that the document in question is not in his handwriting. Every such issue may involve a question of forgery; and it is, therefore, essential to the due administration of justice that the defendant should not be prevented from having the fullest opportunity given him to have the question tried under such circumstances that the truth may be reasonably expected to be arrived at, by enabling him to have the disputed document submitted to the strictest scrutiny of persons well acquainted with his handwriting. He has a right to call, and may possibly be able to call, a vast number of witnesses who have had infinitely superior means of acquiring knowledge of his handwriting than had the single witness who, upon such slender means as that possessed by McConnell, undertakes to testify against him. This, it is obvious, would be absolutely impossible unless the document to be proved should be produced in court. If produced it might appear that the handwriting in it did not bear the slightest resemblance to that in the letter which McConnell received from the defendant, and with which he undertook to compare the destroyed document. Without the production of the document in a case like the present, where the document was never seen by any one but McConnell, who had no knowledge whatever of the defendant nor had ever seen his handwriting until some five weeks after the receipt and destruction of the document by him, it is impossible that the issue joined between the parties could be intelligently tried, for no evidence whatever could be adduced to test the truth of McConnell's evidence or the accuracy of his opinion. He was, in fact, free without fear of contradiction to endeavor to shift to the shoulders of another the burthen to which he himself was subjected by reason of his having published in his paper an article transmitted, as he says, to him in a handwriting unknown to him, and subscribed with the name of a person whom he did not know, and which, as soon as published, he destroyed. To apply the rule in question to a case like the present would be to provide means best calculated to prevent rather than to promote the discovery of the truth upon the question in issue. It was agreed that if it may be assumed that a witness who had only once seen a person write may have such an impression formed in his mind of the character of the handwriting of the writer that he may at any distance of time be admitted as a witness to speak as to the handwriting of a document alleged to be in the handwriting of the same person, so likewise an impression may be assumed to be formed in the mind of a person upon his once seeing a written paper of the character of the writing, without knowing any thing of the writer, or who he is, so that he could, at a subsequent time, upon seeing another document under such circumstances as to enable him to know it to be in the writing of a particular individual wholly unknown to him, pronounce the former document to be in the same handwriting as the latter; and that, therefore, his evidence in the latter case should be equally as admissible as that of the witness in the former case. The assumption in the former case may be, and perhaps is, an extravagant one; but it does not in any manner prejudice the party whose handwriting is in question, who is given ample opportunity to test the accuracy of the opinion of the witness who, with only such means of acquiring knowledge of his handwriting, testifies against him; but the assumption in the latter case is more extravagant, and as its necessary effect would be to deprive the party affected of all means of testing the accuracy of the opinion of the witness, there is good reason why it should not be accepted in practice. Between the two cases there appears to be this difference: that in the former case the witness speaks from a knowledge supposed to have been acquired by him of the general character of the handwriting of the person as to whose handwriting he subsequently undertakes to speak; and in the latter case he speaks, not from a knowledge supposed to have been acquired of the general character of the handwriting of any person, but from a knowledge which he assumes to have been acquired of the formation of the letters in the first document, and a comparison of the impression on his mind of such formation of the letters with the subsequently written document; and without any knowledge of the writer of either, he pronounces both to be written by the same person. This, as stated by Coleridge J. in Doe ex dem Mudd v. Suckermore is not the proper test in the authentication of handwriting ex scriptis olim visis, but is simply Bentham's third mode of authentication\u2014namely, mere comparison of handwriting, but very imperfectly instituted, in the absence of the principal document the handwriting in which is the subject of enquiry. McConnell, after receipt of the letter of the 5th May from the defendant, would be an admissible witness to give his opinion as to the handwriting of a document produced in court upon the trial of an issue raising a question whether it was or was not in the handwriting of the defendant. In that case, as already pointed out, the defendant would have ample opportunity to test the accuracy of the opinion and to secure an intelligent trial of the issue; but, for the reasons already given, the interests of truth and justice require that evidence of the nature of that given by McConnell should not be received upon the trial of an issue involving a question as to the handwriting of a document not produced, and which the defendant denies to be his. Reference has been made to the case of an action upon a lost note, but from such a case no argument can be adduced in favor of the plaintiff's contention[10]. Although upon a plea of non-fecit in such an action the defendant cannot insist that the plaintiff cannot recover without producing the note sued upon, if he should prove it to have existed and to have been lost or destroyed; still, the proof of the former existence of the lost or destroyed note in order to admit secondary evidence of its contents, if the substantial defence be that, in point of fact, the note never was made by the defendant, must be equally as sufficient to show it to have been made by the defendant as if the note were before the court and the defendant was bon\u00e2 fide insisting that he had never made it. In such a case, if the evidence offered by the plaintiff should be only of the same nature as that of McConnell in the present case, then, no doubt, the cases would be identical and the same reasoning would be applicable to both. But no such case has as yet arisen in the case of an action upon a lost note, and so no argument in favor of the plaintiff's contention can be founded on the fact that in the case of a lost note the law, notwithstanding the loss or destruction of the note, provides a remedy against the maker. Suppose that, in the present case, the witness had said that the document received by him on the 1st of April contained a promise by the writer to pay for the insertion of the article in his paper, can it be held that he could have recovered in an action against the defendant upon the evidence as given? And again, inasmuch as the evidence in question would have been as admissible and as sufficient in a criminal as in a civil action, does not one's sense of justice revolt at the idea of a conviction on an indictment for libel being sustained upon the evidence of the witness McConnell in the present case?\nThe other question, as to evidence which was objected to but received, arose in this manner: Upon the defendant having been called, and having emphatically denied upon oath that he ever wrote the article in question or that he knew anything about it, the plaintiff's counsel cross-examined him, and he answered as follows:\u2014\nQ. It was the 16th of last April that you knew you were charged with being the author of this communication? A. Yes.\nQ. Then, why have you changed your signature since? A. I have not changed my signature since.\nQ. You got a letter from me or from our firm, did you not? A. Yes.\nA letter is shown to witness and he is asked:\nQ. Is that your signature? A; Yes.\nQ. Tell me why you changed that \"A\" from an \"A\" of that shape to a capital A? A. I don't make any difference.\nQ. Have you not since this thing was charged home to you made all your signatures different? A. No.\nQ. Have you not written your signature like a school boy in the hotel register here? A. If I have, I always do.\nHere an affidavit is shown to witness, and he is asked:\nQ. You made an affidavit to get this trial put off? A. Yes.\nQ. Are not the signatures in answer to our letter and to this affidavit here entirely different from what you swore was your ordinary signature? A. I don't think so.\nUpon this, it appears that the learned counsel for the plaintiff was proceeding to show these documents to the jury\u2014to which counsel for the defendant objected. The learned counsel for the plaintiff then stated his object in submitting the signatures to the jury, thus:\nI offered the account made out by him, which he swore was in his ordinary handwriting, and I offered the signatures of the other two. I don't hesitate to say that since he knew he was accused of writing this communication he has changed his signature.\nThe court allowed the evidence, subject to the objection, and the cross-examination of the defendant proceeded, thus:\nQ. You say that you wrote this letter to McConnell hurriedly in the post office? A. I did not say hurriedly.\nQ. Did you not say you wrote it with a lead pencil? A. Yes, because I had no pen.\nQ. Then, you did not write hurriedly at all; will your swear you did not write it hurriedly in the post office? A. I don't think I did.\nQ. It is perfectly clear that these two signatures (indicating them) are different? A. With reference to that one, Mr. Vye wanted his account right away, and I picked up a pen, which I did not usually write with, and wrote it. In regard to this affidavit, I wrote my name in full, because the commissioner told me to do so, and I make no difference as to the use of the capital and small A.\nThere can, I think, be no doubt that this question, as to the suggested change in the defendant's mode of signing his name, was not a proper one to have been submitted to the jury upon the only issue they had to try. The theory upon which the right to submit the question to the jury was rested was plainly stated by the learned counsel for the plaintiff to be: that since the defendant, on the 16th April, knew he was accused of writing the article which was the foundation of the action, he had changed the character of his signature, for the purpose of insisting, when the document should be produced on the trial of this action, that the signature to it was not in his handwriting. The document not having been produced, the plaintiff, in order to cast discredit on the defendant's denial upon oath that he was the writer of the article, or that he knew anything about it, suggests through his counsel the alteration in the defendant's signatures, and the purpose for which the alteration was adopted, which purpose assumes the defendant to have been the writer of the article in question, and the sender of it to McConnell for publication; and having made this assumption in order to get the question of alteration raised he asks the jury to find the fact of alteration from their own inspection of the documents shown to the defendant and admitted to have his signature, that therefrom they may conclude that defendant did write the article which, in order to institute the enquiry as to alteration of signatures, he was assumed to have written.\nThe singularity of this theory appears further, from this, that the signature to the letter of the 5th May to McConnell, from which alone McConnell spoke as to the handwriting in the document destroyed by him, is one of the signatures which is suggested to have been written, not in defendant's ordinary handwriting, but in a handwritting altered for the purpose suggested. But the question whether the defendant's mode of signing his name was or not different in the documents produced raised a different issue from the only one the jury had to try, and the defendant's answers to the questions put to him upon that subject must be taken as conclusive. The submission of the documents to the jury for them to form their opinion by comparison of handwriting upon the question of the suggested difference was improper, so that for this reason also the appeal must be allowed; but as, in my opinion, McConnell's evidence was inadmissible, the proper order I think to make will be to allow the appeal with costs and to order a rule to enter a non-suit to be issued in the court below.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The court below was, in my opinion, right in holding that there was evidence to go to the jury of publication of the libel by the defendant.\nIt has been urged on his behalf that in admitting the evidence of McConnell, as evidence of the communication to the newspaper being in the handwriting of the defendant, the court went further than any decided case to be found in the reports had gone, because the witness had no knowledge of the defendant's handwriting until after the destruction of the paper which, he says, from his recollection of it, was written by the defendant, or at all events accompanied by a letter or memorandum signed by the defendant. It seems to be true that in no reported case was the position precisely like this; but the principle on which the evidence is admissible is affirmed in many cases, including Doe Mudd v. Suckermore[11], on which the appellant has based a good deal of his argument. The principles there laid down by Coleridge J, and Patteson J., and usually found stated in the text books in the words of the last named judge, as in the passage quoted by the appellant from Greenleaf on Evidence[12], make it proper to hold that such knowledge of the defendant's handwriting as the witness McConnell acquired from the correspondence he had with the defendant after the publication, and after the asserted destruction of the libellous communication, was legally sufficient to enable the witness to say that he knew the handwriting, although he had seen only one or, at most, two specimens of it.\nThat handwriting may be proved in the absence of the paper containing it is established by Sayer v. Glossop[13];\nIn ordinary cases the witness has to compare two things\u2014one existing only in his mind and the other being before him. The mental entity is his recollection of the handwriting of the party, the other is the writing before him. He finds that they correspond, and therefore concludes that the writing before him is by the same person whose hand-writing is the exemplar in his mind.\nThe present case is nearly the converse. There are two things, one mental, being the recollection of the writing the witness threw into the basket after reading the proof, the other before him in the letter from which he became acquainted with the defendant's handwriting. He compares them, and finds that they correspond, concluding therefrom that the same person wrote both manuscripts.\nThere is no difference, that I can perceive, in the principle of evidence as applied to one case or the other.\nIn Sayer v. Glossop[14] Lord Cranworth, then Rolfe B., illustrates the point by the case of a treasonable announcement chalked upon a wall, being thus incapable of being produced in court, and a person recognising the handwriting and giving evidence of it.\nThe case he puts is that of one who recognizes the writing from previous acquaintance with it.\nIt must be the same thing if, after stopping to read the words on the wall as he passed on his way to his place of business, but not knowing in whose handwriting they were, he found awaiting him a letter or other document, and recognised in it the same hand that wrote the words on the wall.\nThe time that elapsed between receiving the mental impression from the one writing and seeing the other, whether ten or fifteen minutes, as we may suppose in the case put for illustration, or a month, as in the present case, touches the value of the evidence not its principle. In any case, the evidence must be weaker and less satisfactory than when the writing to be proved can be produced, but that, as pointed out by Pollock C.B. in Sayer v. Glossop, (1) is a matter of degree, not of principle. Along with this evidence of the handwriting the jury could properly consider the correspondence between McConnell and the defendant. It is, no doubt, susceptible of being regarded as weakening, or at least of not strengthening, the inference that the defendant was the author of the libel, but it may be looked at as having an opposite effect, and it was proper evidence for the jury.\nThere could not, therefore, have been a non-suit. The case had to go to the jury; and, going with the express denial by the defendant under his oath of all concern with the libel, that oath being opposed to evidence which was indirect and by no means of the most convincing character, the jury might have been expected to find for the defendant, unless led to form an unfavorable opinion of his veracity and candor.\nThe plaintiff, of course, directed his efforts at the trial to produce that unfavorable impression. He was probably assisted by the manner in which the defendant gave his evidence, but in the use of certain signatures I think he overstepped the recognised limits.\nThe point avowedly aimed at was to show that after the defendant became aware that he was charged with having written the libel, and while he supposed the manuscript to be in existence, and while, in fact, it was in existence, if McConnell's letter to the defendant, and not his oath at the trial, stated the truth, he prepared to baffle any attempt to prove his handwriting by comparison by changing the character of his signature. For this purpose the plaintiff had provided himself with two or three later signatures of the defendant, which it was urged differed in some particular from something or other, I do not very well know from what, for there was no pretence, as far as I can observe, of proving what was the usual style of the signature, much less of proving anything respecting the general handwriting, apart from the ordinary signature, of the defendant.\nThese papers could not have been given in evidence as part of the plaintiff's case. It is not contended that they could. The case was not proved by comparison by experts of one writing with another, and if that had been the mode of proof attempted it is obvious that the production of several different styles of writing would have embarrassed rather than assisted the proof. And, besides, the avowed purpose in producing these papers was foreign to the issue.\nNor could they have been produced, or the fact that the defendant had, on several occasions since the middle of April, adopted a changed style of signature, have been proved, in reply to the defendant's denial that he wrote the libel. To do that would have been to do what, if admissible, should have been done at first.\nBut it was allowable and regular, for the purpose of affecting the defendant's credibility, to educe from him the fact that he had changed his signature. He stood, however, in the position of any other witness for the defence, as far as the rules of evidence were concerned; and while the questions could not be objected to, the answers had to be taken as he gave them. He denied that he had changed his signature, and denied that those produced differed from his ordinary signature or were intended to differ.\nThe plaintiff could not, upon that, raise a side issue and prove what he could not, either as part of his case or as independent evidence in reply, have been allowed to prove. Yet that is what he was allowed to do when the signatures were submitted to the jury.\nThese propositions are so well established as not to require the citation of authority in support of them. I may, however, refer to Attorney-General v. Hitchcock[15] where the general rules are very fully discussed, and to Palmer v. Trower[16] where the witness was also the defendant; and to three cases where the rule was acted on at nisi prius\u2014McKewan v. Thornton[17]; Fowkes v. Manchester and London Insurance Co.[18]; Regina v. Dennis[19].\nIt is said, and the court below seems to have acted on the idea, that the objection to the reception of the evidence was made too late. I do not so read the notes before us.\nQ. Are not the signatures in answer to our letter and to this affidavit here entirely different from what you swore was your ordinary signature? A. I don't think so.\nMr. Weldon objects to Mr. Hanington showing the papers to the jury till he has put them in evidence.\nMr. Hanington\u2014I offered the account made out by him, which he swore was in his ordinary handwriting, and I offered the signatures of the other two. I don't hesitate to say that since he knew he was accused of writing this communication he has changed his signature.\nCourt\u2014I will allow it, subject to objection.\nThe question here put was, as I have said, a question which could not have been objected to on the cross-examination of the witness. But the plaintiff had to be content with his answer. The irregularity was in putting in the documents in order to contradict the witness or to make substantive evidence of them. That was promptly objected to, and allowed subject to the objection, the plaintiff choosing to take the risk of it.\nI have no doubt that the objection ought to prevail.\nI might adopt the language of Patteson J. in Melhuish v. Collier[20] as almost literally applicable, where he said: \"I think that the point in Winter v. Butt[21] was taken too early; and that the learned judge should have allowed the question, but stopped the enquiry when evidence was called to contradict the witness. Indeed, the question seems to have been put with the view of offering such evidence; and probably both the judge and counsel knew that, and treated the point accordingly.\"\nThe improper reception of evidence does not in all cases necessitate a new trial. It will not have that effect where it is evident it cannot have affected the verdict. Here the object was to discredit the defendant who had directly denied what the plaintiff had given rather slender evidence to prove. The jury did disbelieve the defendant. It may be that they would have done so if this evidence had not been given, but it is impossible for us to say that it did not influence the verdict; and the plaintiff, who pressed it for the purpose of producing that influence, cannot, with a good grace, ask us to hold that it did not accomplish that purpose.\nThe defendant is therefore, in my opinion, entitled to a new trial without costs, and to have the appeal allowed with costs; but as the majority of the court think the appeal should be dismissed, I may add that I should not look upon a new trial as likely to be of much advantage to the defendant.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.*\nSolicitor for appellant: Theophilus Desbrisay.\nSolicitors for respondent: Hanington, Teed & Hewson.\n[1] 5 A. & E. 705.\n[2] 14 Ed. pp. 576-7, 579.\n[3] 3 F. & F. 152.\n[4] 7 C. & F. 122.\n[5] Ed. pp. 318-9.\n[6] P. 560.\n[7] 4 Ex. 262.\n[8] Vol. 3 p. 598.\n[9] 5 A. & E. 703.\n[10] Blackie v.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nMarine Insurance\u2014Constructive total loss\u2014Liability of company\u2014Cost of repairs\u2014One-third new for old\u2014Construction of condition when vessel not repaired.\nA policy of insurance on a ship contained the following clause:\u2014\n\"In case of repairs, the usual deduction of one-third will not be made until after six months from the date of first registration, but after such date the deduction will be made. And the insurers shall not be liable for a constructive total loss of the vessel in case of abandonment or otherwise, unless the cost of repairing the vessel, under an adjustment as of partial loss, according to the terms of this policy, shall amount to more than half of its value, as declared in this policy.\"\nThe ship being disabled at sea put into port for repairs, when it was found that the cost of repairs and expenses would exceed more than one-half of the value declared in the policy if the usual deduction of one-third allowed in adjusting a partial loss under the terms of the policy was not made, but not if it was made.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, Patterson J. dissenting, that the \"cost of repairs\" in the policy meant the net amount after allowing one-third of the actual cost in respect of new for old, according to the rule usually followed in adjusting a partial loss, and not the estimated amount of the gross costs of the repairs forming the basis of an average adjustment in case of claim for partial loss, and therefore the cost of repairs did not amount to half the declared value.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in favor of the defendants on a special case.\nThe policies sued on in these cases were precisely similar, and they came before the court below on the same special case, which was as follows:\u2014\n1. On the 7th day of September, A. D. 1883, the plaintiff effected a policy of insurance with the defendants on the ship \"Minnie H. Gerow\" (of which he is part owner), of which policy the facts material to this case are as follows:\u2014\n2. The ship, laden with guano, was disabled at sea on her voyage from Labos to Falmouth, England, for orders, and put into Valparaiso for repairs.\n3. The cost of repairs and expenses connected therewith at Valparaiso would exceed more than one-half of the value declared in the policy, if the usual deduction of one-third allowed in adjusting a partial loss under the terms of the policy was not made.\n4. If such deduction is made, then the cost of repairs after such deduction would not exceed one-half of the value as declared in the policy.\n5. The said ship, after notice of abandonment, was sold at Valparaiso under circumstances such that a prudent owner, uninsured, would not have repaired her; but the defendants claim that, under the policy, that fact is immaterial.\n6. The defendants contend that under the terms of the policy there is not such a constructive total loss of the vessel as would render them liable to pay for a total loss.\n7. It is admitted that more than six months had elapsed from the date of her first registration when the damage occurred.\n8. The policy in question contained the following clause:\n\"In case of repairs, the usual deduction of one-third will not be made until after six months from the date of first registration, but after such date the deduction will be made. And the insurers shall not be liable for a constructive total loss of the vessel in case of abandonment or otherwise, unless the cost of repairing the vessel, under an adjustment as of partial loss, according to the terms of this policy, shall amount to more than half of its value, as declared in this policy.\"\n9. Either party to be at liberty to refer to the policy of insurance on the argument.\n10. Should the court be of opinion that the contention of the defendant is correct, then a non-suit is to be entered; but if the court is of opinion that under the terms and conditions of the policy and the admitted facts the defendants are liable to pay for a total loss, then the judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for the sum of $2,500, with interest from the first day of January, A.D., 1885, less the amount of premium note and interest, and any other amount due by the plaintiff to the defendants.\nThe decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick on this special case was in favor of the insurance companies. The plaintiff then appealed in each case to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nWeldon Q. C. for the appellants. The former law in the United States was in favor of the plaintiffs' contention here Peele v. The Merchants' Ins. Co.[1].\nThis was a decision of Judge Strong, and in consequence of it a form of policy was adopted, making the amount in such case only what the insurers would have to pay. Parson on Insurance[2], Potter v. The Ocean Ins. Co.[3], Bradlie v. The Maryland Ins. Co.[4].\nThe adjustment is only to ascertain the cost of repairs and distribute it, and the deduction is not made until after the adjustment.\nThe matter is fully discussed in the case of Aitchison v. Lohre[5].\nBarker Q.C. for the respondents, referred to Smith v. Bell[6], Pezant v. The National Ins. Co.[7], Orrok v. The Commonwealth Ins. Co.[8], Allen v. The Commercial Ins. Co.[9].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The only point involved in this case is the construction to be put upon a clause in the policy set out in section 8 of the special case, and which is as follows: \"In case of repairs, the usual deduction of one-third will not be made until after six months from the date of first registration; but after such date the deduction will be made. And the insurers shall not be liable for a constructive total loss of the vessel, in case of abandonment or otherwise, unless the cost of repairing the vessel under an adjustment as of partial loss, according to the terms of this policy, shall amount to more than half of its value, as declared in this policy.\"\nIt is obvious the cost of repairing must be as under an adjustment as of partial loss according to the terms of the policy.\nAnd in case of loss, such loss shall be adjusted in accordance with English practice and the usage of Lloyds (except where otherwise provided for by the conditions of this policy), and authenticated by the agents of the company, if there be one at the place where such proofs are taken, and paid in sixty days after the company shall receive proof and adjustment thereof and proof of interest.\nI think effect must be given to the words \"in case of repairs the usual deduction of one-third after six months,\" from which date the deduction will be made. It is clear the cost of repairing under an adjustment in case of abandonment or otherwise as a partial loss is to be according to the terms of the policy which recognizes the deduction of one-third. If so, how can an adjustment be made up unless one-third new for old be calculated in ascertaining the partial loss?\nI think the construction put on the clause in the court below was the correct one, and the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014These causes, which were argued together both here and in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, involve a question as to the proper legal construction of a particular clause contained in two separate policies of marine insurance. The question was submitted for the opinion of the court below upon a special case stated in each cause by agreement between the parties.\nThis special case was in the following words:\n1. On the seventh day of September, A.D. 1883, the plaintiff effected a policy of insurance with the defendants on the ship \"Minnie H. Gerow\" (of which he is part owner) of which policy the facts material to this case are as follows:\n2. The ship, laden with guano, was disabled at sea on her voyage from Lobos to Falmouth, England, for orders, and put into Valparaiso for repairs.\n3. The costs of repairs and expenses connected therewith at Valparaiso would exceed more than one-half of the value declared in the policy, if the usual deduction of one-third allowed in adjusting a partial loss under the terms of the policy was not made.\n4. If such deduction is made, then the cost of repairs after such deduction would not exceed one-half of the value as declared in the policy.\n5. The said ship, after notice of abandonment, was sold at Valparaiso under circumstances such that a prudent owner, uninsured, would not have repaired her: but the defendants claim that, under the policy, that fact is immaterial.\n6. The defendants contend that under the terms of the policy there is not such a constructive total loss of the vessel as would render them liable to pay for a total loss.\n7. It is admitted that more than six months had elapsed from the date of her first registration when the damage occurred.\n8. The policy in question contained the following clause: \"In case of repairs, the usual deduction of one-third will not be made until after six months from the date of first registration, but after such date the deduction will be made. And the insurers shall not be liable for a constructive total loss of the vessel in case of abandonment or otherwise, unless the cost of repairing the vessel, under an adjustment as of partial loss according to the terms of this policy, shall amount to more than half of its value, as declared ill this policy.\"\n9. Either party to be at liberty to refer to the policy of insurance on the argument.\n10. Should the court be of opinion that the contention of the defendant is correct, then a non-suit to be entered: but if the court is of opinion that under the terms and conditions of the policy and the admitted facts the defendants are liable to pay for a total loss, then the judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for the sum of $2,500, with interest from the 1st day of January, A.D. 1885, less the amount of premium note and interest, and any other amount due by the plaintiff to the defendants.\nAfter argument, the Supreme Court of New Brunswick gave judgment in favor of the defendants, directing non-suits to be entered. From this judgment Mr. Justice Palmer dissented, holding that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment for the amount agreed upon. The judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by Mr. Justice King, and Mr. Justice Palmer has also expressed the reasons for his dissent in a written judgment. In these well-considered judgments the reasons and arguments relied on in support of the opposite views entertained on the question in dispute are set forth in a very full and exhaustive manner. The statement of the case already given shows that no question of law is involved in the appeal, the matter in contest being purely one as to the proper legal construction of the clause relating to the estimation of the cost of repairs in case of loss, as set forth in the case already stated. In other words, the question is, whether under the terms of this provision one-third of the gross amount required to be expended for repairs, in the case (which happened) of a loss, is, upon the principle of \"one-third new for old,\" to be deducted in determining whether there has been a loss amounting to more than one-half of the value of the vessel, as declared by the policy, so as to entitle the assured to claim for a constructive total loss. The point really in controversy may be still further narrowed, for, in fact, it is confined entirely to the meaning to be placed on the words \"cost of repairing\" contained in this stipulation limiting the right of the assured to claim for a constructive total loss. This expression, \"cost of repairing the vessel\" is construed by Mr. Justice Palmer as meaning the estimated amount of the gross cost of the repairs which would form the basis upon which an average adjuster would, if a claim were made for a partial loss, arrive at a final estimate or adjustment of the loss by the deduction of one-third of the amount in respect of the substitution of new for old, and not as meaning the net amount of the loss after that deduction should have been made.\nOn the other hand, Mr. Justice King and the majority of the court hold that, having regard to the context, these words are intended to denote the net amount which would be the result of an adjustment according to the usual rule followed in adjusting a partial loss, that is, by allowing one-third off the actual cost of the repairs in respect of new for old, and that consequently the words \"cost of repairing the vessel\" are to be read and construed as synonymous with \"the amount of the loss.\"\nI am of opinion the latter is the correct construction.\nMr. Justice Palmer asserts and Mr. Justice King concedes that in construing these policies we must give the assured the benefit of the rule that a provision of this kind is to be interpreted most strongly in favor of the assured and against the underwriters; and entirely admitting the soundness of this principle, I have, in arriving at the conclusion stated, endeavored to give the appellant the full benefit of it.\nAlthough, as I have before said, no question of law is involved in this appeal, yet a reference to some general and elementary principles of the law of marine insurance will aid us to solve the question we are called upon to decide.\nThe test resorted to in English law to determine if the assured has a right to abandon and claim for a constructive total loss is well established to be that described in the case of Irving v. Manning[10], cited by Mr. Justice King, namely: \"To consider the policy as altogether out of the question, and to enquire what a prudent, uninsured owner would have done in the state in which the vessel was placed by the perils insured against.\"\nThis rule does not prevail in the United States. There, by a long-established usage, an insured owner claiming to recover in respect of a constructive total loss has to show that the costs of repairing the vessel would exceed half its value, before the loss, as the same may be ascertained either by the policy, if it is a valued policy, or by actual estimation, if the policy should be an open one. This usage is said by Chancellor Kent in his commentaries to have been derived from the law of Continental Europe. Whatever may have been its origin it suffices to say that it has long formed the rule according to which, in the United States, it is determined whether or not an assured has a right to abandon to the underwriters and to claim for a constructive total loss, and that irrespective altogether of any express provision to that effect in the policy. It is thus seen that the English and American law of marine insurance are in this particular of the conditions of a constructive total loss entirely different.\nThe policies now under consideration were executed in New Brunswick by underwriters who are Canadian corporations; they are therefore, of course, to be construed according to English law as prevailing in New Brunswick. It follows that the right of the assured to abandon as for a total loss would, but for the clause now under consideration, have had to be determined according to the established English rule before stated. These special provisions have, however, introduced into these particular contracts of insurance a rule identical with the general rule of American law as applicable for that purpose.\nAs regards the ascertainment of a partial or particular average loss, the rule, so far as it is material for the present purpose, is identical in England and the United States, the adjustment in both countries involving a deduction from the cost of repairs of one-third new for old (at least, in the case of wooden ships of a prescribed age) as a mode of approximating to an amount which should form a sufficient indemnity to the assured without placing him, at the expense of the underwriters, in a better position than he would have been in if no loss had happened.\nThese elementary and familiar principles of insurance law are stated here, not because they have any direct application to the question for decision, but for the reason that both the rules themselves and the language in which they are habitually stated by courts and text-writers have, as it seems to me, a strong, and indeed a conclusive, influence on the interpretation of the clause we are called upon to expound.\nIn applying the same American rule which by these policies the parties have adopted as forming the \"law of their contracts,\" requiring a loss of over fifty per cent. to authorize a claim for a total loss, a judicial controversy early arose regarding the principle on which the costs of repairs should be calculated, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the loss amounted to fifty per cent. or not. On the one hand it was held by the Court of Errors of the State of New York, in American Insurance Co. v. Ogden[11] and by the Supreme Court of Massachussetts, in Hall v. Ocean Insurance Co.[12] that in estimating the cost of repairs for the purpose the rule applied in adjusting a partial loss of deducting one-third new for old should be adopted; whilst, on the other hand, Mr. Justice Story presiding, in the Circuit Court of the United States, in Peele v. Merchants Insurance Co.[13], and the Supreme Court of the United States also, in the case of Bradlie v. Maryland Ins. Co.[14], decided in 1838, held that the deduction ought not to be made. The arguments upon which these conflicting decisions were based have no relevancy here, for what we have to determine is not any question concerning the scope and effect of the rule itself, but the proper legal effect of a clause introduced, as it appears to me, and as I shall endeavor to demonstrate, for the purpose of solving by an express provision the disputed point which, when left to implication, had given rise to the conflict of decision already mentioned. In order to meet the difficulty which the decision of Mr. Justice Story in Peele v. The Merchants Ins. Co.[15] and the other cases agreeing with it had given rise to, it is said by Mr. Parsons' Treatise on Marine Insurance[16] that it became the practice in Massachusetts to insert in the policy a clause worded as follows:\nIt is agreed that the insured shall not have the right to abandon for the amount of damage merely, unless the amount which the insurer would be liable to pay under an adjustment as of a partial loss shall exceed half the amount insured.\nThe same clause is also stated by Mr. Phillips in his Treatise on Insurance[17] as being in general use for the purpose of obviating the effect of the decision in Peele v. Merchants Ins. Co. (1)\nThen, considering that the history and derivation of this clause in its general terms, and apart from any reference to a partial loss, is such as before stated, and also that the law in the United States, from whence it is derived, remains still unsettled, the latest decisions of courts of high authority being in direct conflict as to its effect, is it not a reasonable presumption that these words referring to an adjustment as of a partial loss, the meaning of which form the only subject for decision here, were introduced into these policies for the same purpose for which a clause in words almost identical had been inserted in American policies, viz., to meet the difficulty which had arisen as to the mode of calculating the fifty per cent., and in order to control and explain the provision in such a way as to obviate the ambiguity which would be caused by the conflicting American decisions on the general law as applied in the United States? In other words, is it not fair and reasonable that, finding the parties to have contracted themselves out of the rule of English law, which affords a test for ascertaining whether there has been a constructive total loss, and to have subjected themselves by express agreement to the general rule of the American law, that we should in construing this conventional rule, adopted by the parties, infer that the reference to the adjustment of a partial loss as a guide in the calculation of fifty per cent. was intended to serve the same purpose as that for which a clause, almost identical in its terms, had been introduced into American policies, viz., to anticipate and determine the doubts and disputes which had arisen in applying the rule in the country of its origin? Surely there can be no difficulty in holding that these words:\nUnless the cost of repairing the vessel, under an adjustment as of partial loss, according to the terms of this policy, shall amount to more than half its value\u2014\nare in all respects the equivalent of, and have no larger nor lesser meaning than the corresponding clause in the American policies:\nUnless the amount which the insurer would be liable to pay under an adjustment of a partial loss shall exceed one-half the amount insured.\nI can find no substantial or sensible distinction between the words \"cost of repairs,\" in our Canadian policies now under consideration, and \"the amount which the insurer would be liable to pay\" in the American clause. Both expressions are subject to the condition immediately following \"under an adjustment of a partial loss.\" It is not admissible to say that the words \"cost of repairs\" mean the estimate of the gross expenditure for repairs, upon which the adjustment is based; for it is expressly said that what it is intended to refer to is the expense of repairing \"under the adjustment,\" which can only mean as determined, ascertained or settled by the adjustment, and so necessarily after all deductions usual in the case of a partial loss have been made, which deductions of course include that of \"one-third new for old.\" Thus, the cost of repairs so ascertained by adjustment is the exact equivalent of the amount of a partial loss which the underwriter has to pay. So that whether we consider this clause, derogating from the general law, which the parties have thought fit to import into their contract, in the abstract, and subject it to close verbal criticism and analysis, or whether we investigate its history and construe it in the light thrown upon it by the decisions of courts and the writings of lawyers in the country from which it has been borrowed, we arrive either way at an identical conclusion\u2014that adopted in the judgment under appeal. This alone ought to be conclusive.\nApart, however, from any rigid literal interpretation of the language, I agree with Mr. Justice King that any mercantile man or average adjuster reading these policies with a view to adjusting a claim for a constructive total loss would, as a matter of course, consider the proper mode of proceeding to be to treat the loss in the first instance as a partial loss, and calculate it upon the principle universally applicable to such losses; and this is a consideration which would be of weight, even if the arguments for and against the suggested construction were much more evenly balanced than they are. The argument for the appellant is that we are to ascribe the adoption of these stipulations to an intention to exclude such particular subjects of loss as either under the general law of insurance or under the particular terms of these policies would be excluded altogether, and not brought into account in calculating the amount of a partial loss. The plain answer to this, besides what has been already stated, is that if we were to confine the meaning in this way we should not be giving due and proper effect to the term \"adjustment of partial loss,\" an expression which, taken in its primary signification, clearly imports a completed calculation of the amount due for a partial loss, made according to the general principles of insurance law, which require the deduction of one-third \"new for old.\"\nThe appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that these appeals should be dismissed. I concur in Mr. Justice King's opinion.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that these appeals should be dismissed for the reasons stated in the judgment of the majority of the court below, and in that of my brother Strong in this court. The construction thus put upon the clause in question seems to me to be that which the language used naturally requires.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014This controversy turns on the interpretation to be given to certain words in the policies issued by the defendant companies.\nIn searching for their meaning and effect as terms of the contracts, we have no direct assistance from decisions of our own or other courts. The plaintiffs claim the right to abandon the vessel to the underwriters as a total loss, and the defendants, who are underwriters, deny that right.\nThe vessel was in fact abandoned and sold, as stated in the special case, under circumstances such that a prudent owner, uninsured, would not have repaired her. The ordinary law of marine insurance, apart from these particular contracts, warranted the abandonment as a constructive total loss. But the contracts provided that \"the insurers will not be liable for a constructive total loss of the vessel in case of, abandonment or otherwise, unless the cost of repairing the vessel under an adjustment as of partial loss, according to the terms of this policy, shall amount to more than half its value as declared by this policy.\"\nThe value stated in the policies was $28,000. To repair the vessel would have cost more than half of the amount; but if a deduction was made of one-third new for old, the amount would be reduced to less than half of the valued amount.\nThe defendants insist that the \"cost of repairing the vessel\" must be with the deduction of the one third, and the court below has sustained that contention, Mr. Justice Palmer dissenting.\nThe words \"cost of repairing,\" &c., are those for which we have to find the appropriate meaning and force.\nThe policy, after specifying in the ordinary way the perils insured against, provides that the insurers shall not be liable for any loss or claim arising from a number of causes which are specified in detail\u2014\nNor for any partial loss or particular average, unless it amounts to five per cent., exclusive in each case of all charges and expenses incurred for the purpose of ascertaining and proving the loss.\nThen follows this passage:\nWarranted by the assured free from any claim for charge, damage or loss which may arise from jettison, or loss of deck cargo. In case of repairs the usual deduction of one-third will not be made until after six months from the date of first registration, but after such date deduction will be made. Each passage subject to separate average. And the insurers will not be liable for a constructive total loss of the vessel, in case of abandonment or otherwise, unless the cost of repairing the vessel under an adjustment as of partial loss, according to the terms of this policy, shall amount to more than half of its value, as declared in this policy. The assurers are not liable for copper, metal or other sheathing after it has been on forty months; and not liable for wages and provisions, except in general average, when customary at the port of destination.\nWhenever the cost of repairing a vessel under an adjustment of partial loss, according to the terms of the policy, had to be ascertained, one essential inquiry would be whether the repairs were of damage for which the insurers were liable. Damage from the excepted perils, which might be damage to the hull, tackle or apparel of the ship, must be excluded. So also must repairs to copper, metal or other sheathing, if it had been on for forty months. Those particulars give operation to the words \"under an adjustment as of partial loss according to the terms of this policy,\" and limit the estimate of the cost of repairs as between the underwriters and the insured. On a total loss, actual or constructive, the full value of $28,000 would be the basis of the computation of what each underwriter was to pay. A partial loss would of course be adjusted with regard to the damage only which, under the terms of the policy, was to be made good. Such an adjustment might fall short of half the stated value, while the repairs of all the damage, including that class of damage for which the underwriters were not bound, might exceed the half. In such a case, the estimate on which the right to abandon depended being made \"under an adjustment as of a partial loss,\" there would be no right to abandon. The adjustment or estimate in the present case, which exceeds $14,000, we must, on this special case, understand not to include any subjects of the insurance for which the underwriters are not liable, under the policies, on a partial loss.\nThe view of the dissentient judge in the court below was, as I gather from his judgment, that the clause in question was satisfied by an adjustment on the principle to which I have adverted, and that the full sum arrived at was, within the true meaning of the clause\u2014\"the cost of repairing the vessel under an adjustment as of a partial loss according to the terms of this policy.\" wherefore, he held the condition to be fulfilled upon which the plaintiff was entitled to treat the loss as a constructive total loss. In the judgment of the majority of the court, which was delivered by Mr. Justice King, those provisions of the policies which exclude certain subjects from the liability of the underwriters for particular average are not noticed, and the deduction of one-third, as new for old, is treated as if it were the only matter to which the phrase\u2014\nUnder an adjustment as for partial loss under the terms of this policy\ncould refer. If that had been so, the conclusion arrived at would follow almost of necessity.\nThe deduction of one-third was to be made only after six months from the registration of the vessel, and the special case happens to omit the essential statement that that time had elapsed. We must, however, assume, as no doubt the fact is, that the time had elapsed.\nThe question whether the words\u2014\nThe cost of repairing the vessel, under, &c.\u2014\nare to be read as meaning\nThe amount which would be payable to the insured if the loss were treated as a partial loss\"\nis the question to be decided.\nWhy should the language be read as anything but what the companies have themselves employed?\n\"Cost of repairing\" might, it is true, without much violence, be read as signifying the cost to the underwriters as what they would be liable to pay for repairing, which would be only two-thirds of the cost of repairing. If necessary, in order to give effect to the provision, and ut res magis valeat quam pereat, it might be the duty of the court so to assist the expressed idea by intendment. But when the words in their natural and literal force have full operation, it does not appear consonant with sound principles to extend their meaning in favor of the parties whose language they are. My view may, I think, be supported by a legitimate argument from what we learn of the practice of Insurance in the United States from works of authority, such as those of Parsons and Phillips.\nA clause, cognate with the one before us, has for many years been common in American policies, having been introduced for the purpose of settling or avoiding questions on which there was a conflict of opinion, namely, whether or not the one-third for new in place of old ought to be deducted in computing the amount of damage which would justify an abandonment as for total loss; and whether, if one-third was deducted, the fifty per cent. ought not to be computed on the actual value of the vessel at the time of the loss, irrespective of the value named in the policy[18].\nThe weight of authority seems to have been for either computing the full cost of the requisite repairs without deduction of the one-third, or if the one-third were deducted, then for taking the actual and not the stated value of the vessel as the basis for computation of the fifty per cent.\nThe clause adopted and in use in American policies reads thus:\nIt is agreed that the insured shall not have the right to abandon the vessel for the amount of damage merely, unless the amount which the insurer would be liable to pay under an adjustment as of a partial loss shall exceed one-half the amount insured.\nWe may safely assume that our insurance companies adopted the clause we have now to construe for the same reasons, and in order to avoid the same questions as the American authorities. But what do they say? Where in the United States the amount which the insurer would be liable to pay, or in other words, two thirds of the cost of repairing, is to determine the right to abandon, our policies expressly say the cost of repairing. With the American precedent before them, they have deliberately used different language. Why should we construe the language as if it were the same, and not different? The more reasonable understanding, as it strikes me, is that while the American insurers, choosing between the opposing opinions which existed, adopted the rule that the one-third should be deducted, these companies of ours adhered to the other view, and said that the cost should govern, in both cases the stated value of the vessel, being that on which the fifty per cent. was to be computed.\nThere is another view of the subject which, with me, bears in the same direction upon this question of construction.\nThe right to abandon ordinarily arises when the damage is such that the vessel, if repaired, would not be worth the cost of the repairs, and does not, in principle, depend on the cost of repairing bearing any defined proportion to the value stated in the policy, or even to the actual value.\nThe statement in this special case respecting the sale of the vessel sets forth facts that would seem to justify the abandonment, unless the policy requires something more. The clause in question is a restriction in favor of the insurer. It is not material to consider closely whether its effect might be to entitle the insured to abandon a vessel as a constructive total loss whenever the cost of repairing her would exceed the specified proportion of her stated value. In its form, it is not an entitling provision in favor of the insured, but a restriction which may be to his prejudice, and which would be notably so under the facts before us, if interpreted as contended for by the companies.\nFor this reason, as well as on the principle of the maxim verba chartarum fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem, it should be construed strictly.\nOn these grounds, I agree in opinion with Mr. Justice Palmer, and think the appeal ought to be allowed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Weldon & McLean.\nSolicitors for respondents: Barker & Belyea.\n[1] 3 Mason 27.\n[2] Vol. 2, p. 130.\n[3] 3 Sum. 27.\n[4] 12 Peters 378.\n[5] 4 App. Cas. 755.\n[6] 2 Caine (N.Y.) 155.\n[7] 15 Wend. 453.\n[8] 21 Pick. 467.\n[9] 1 Gray 157.\n[10] 1 H.

Bristol & Exeter Railway Co. v. Collins (7 H.L. Cas. 194) followed.\nSuch a contract being one which a railway company might refuse to enter into, sec. 104 of the Railway Act (R.S.C. c. 109) does not prevent it from restricting its liability for negligence as carriers or otherwise in respect to the goods to be carried after they had left its own line. The decision in Vogel v. G.T.R. Co. (11 Can. S.C.R. 612) does not govern such a contract.\nOne of the conditions in a contract by the G.T.R. Co. to carry goods from Toronto to Portage la Prairie, Man., a place beyond the terminus of their line, provided that the company \u201cshould not be responsible for any loss, mis-delivery, damage or detention that might happen to goods sent by them, if such loss, mis-delivery, damage or detention occurred after said goods arrived at the stations or places on their line nearest to the points or places which they were consigned to, or beyond their said limits.\u201d\nHeld,\u2014That this condition would not relieve the company from liability for loss or damage occurring during the transit even if such loss occurred beyond the limits of the company\u2019s own line.\nHeld per Strong and Taschereau JJ., that the loss having occurred after the transit was over, and the goods delivered at Portage la Prairie, and the liability of the company as carriers having ceased, this condition reduced the contract to one of mere bailment as soon as the goods were delivered, and also exempted the company from liability as warehousemen, and the goods were from that time in custody of the company on whose line Portage la Prairie was situate, as bailees for the shipper. (Fournier and Gwynne JJ. dissenting.)\nAnother condition of the contract provided that no claim for damage to, loss of, or detention of goods should be allowed unless notice in writing, with particulars, was given to the station agent at or nearest to the place of delivery within thirty-six hours after delivery of the goods in respect to which the claim was made.\nHeld,\u2014Per Strong J. that a plea setting up non-compliance with this condition having been demurred to, and the plaintiff not having appealed against a judgment over-ruling the demurrer, the question as to the sufficiency in law of the defence was res judicata.\nHeld also,\u2014Per Strong J., Gwynne J. contra, that part of the consignment having been lost such notice should have been given in respect to the same within thirty-six hours after the delivery of the goods which arrived safely.\nQuaere\u2014In the present state of the law is a release to, or satisfaction from, one of several joint tort-feasors, a bar to an action against the others?\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2], by which a judgment for the defendants (appellants) at the trial was set aside, and judgment entered for the plaintiff.\nThis was an action against the Grand Trunk Railway Co. and the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. jointly for damages occasioned by injury to the plaintiff\u2019s goods shipped on the Grand Trunk for carriage from Toronto to Manitoba. The goods were only carried by the Grand Trunk over a portion of the route and by the Canadian Pacific from Winnipeg to the place of consignment, and they were in the actual possession of the latter company when injured.\nThe damage to the goods was not disputed, but the defendants claimed that they were carried under a special contract, by the terms of which they were relieved from liability. The clauses of the special contract particularly relied on are as follows:\u2014\n10. That all goods addressed to consignees at points beyond the place at which the company has stations, and respecting which no directions to the contrary shall have been received at those stations, will be forwarded to their destination by public carrier or otherwise, as opportunity may offer, without any claim for delay against the company for want of opportunity to forward them, or they may, at the discretion of the company, be suffered to remain on the company\u2019s premises, or to be placed in shed or warehouse (if there be such convenience for receiving the same), pending communication with the consignees, at the risk of the owners as to damage thereto from any cause whatsoever. But the delivery of the goods by the company will be considered complete, and all responsibility of said company shall cease, when such other carriers shall have received notice that said company is prepared to deliver to them the said goods for further conveyance; and it is expressly declared and agreed, that the said Grand Trunk Railway Company shall not be responsible for any loss, mis-delivery, damage or detention that may happen to goods so sent by them, if such loss, mis-delivery, damage or detention occur after the said goods arrive at said stations, or places on their line nearest to the points or places which they are consigned to, or beyond their said limits.\n11. That all property contracted for at a through rate, or otherwise to or from places beyond the line of the Grand Trunk Railway, if shipped by water, shall, while not on the company\u2019s railway, or in their sheds or warehouses, be entirely at the owner\u2019s risk. In case of loss or damage to any goods for which this company or connecting lines may be liable, it is agreed that the company or line so liable shall have the benefit of any insurance effected by or for account of the owner of said goods, and the company so liable shall be subro- gated in such rights before any demand shall be made on them.\n12. That no claim for damage to, loss of, or detention of any goods for which this company is accountable, shall be allowed unless notice in writing, and the particulars of the claim for said loss, damage or detention, are given to the station freight agent at or nearest to the place of delivery, within thirty-six hours after the goods, in respect of which said claim is made, are delivered.\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Company were made defendants to the action and while the proceedings were pending the plaintiff accepted a sum of money in satisfaction of his claim against them which the defendants alleged operated as a release of the whole cause of action and a bar to any further proceedings by the plaintiff in the suit.\nThe plaintiff gave no notice of claim for loss or damage as required by the 12th condition above set out.\nThe plaintiff claimed that the goods were not carried on the special contract, but on a verbal agreement, and on the trial the jury so found, the defendants, in their opinion, having failed to prove the delivery and acceptance of the bill of lading from which the above extracts are taken and the release.\nThe trial judge disregarded the finding of the jury on this point and holding that there was a special contract and that under it the defendants were not liable, gave judgment in their favor.\nThe divisional court reversed this decision, on the ground that although the goods were carried under the special contract, the defendants were precluded from exonerating themselves from liability under it as held in Vogel v. The Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[3] The Court of Appeal affirmed the latter decision, though on different grounds. The defendants then appealed to this court.\nMcCarthy QC. and Nesbitt for the appellants. The evidence shows that the damage to the goods was covered by the consideration of the special contract. Czech v. General Steam Navigation Co.[4]; mentioned in Coggs v. Bernard[5]; Lewis v. The Great Western Ry. Co.[6]; Webb v. The Great Western Ry. Co.[7]; Phillips v. Clark[8]; Bristol Ry. Co. v.

RITCHIE C.J.\u2014(His Lordship was absent when judgment was pronounced but sent a memorandum of his conclusion, that the appeal should be allowed with costs, but giving no reasons.)\nSTRONG J.\u2014The facts material to the present appeal are fully stated in the report of the judgment of Mr. Justice Rose, who tried the action, and of that of the Divisional Court of Queen\u2019s Bench[30], and also, in the report of the case in appeal[31] and need not be repeated here.\nI am of opinion that the appellants are entitled to our judgment.\nI do not discuss the question which was principally in controversy at the trial viz: that as to whether the goods were carried on a verbal contract made by John McMillan with some of the clerks or officers of the Grand Trunk Railway Company at their offices in Toronto, or whether they were carried under the written contract produced at the trial. I agree with the court of appeal that for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Burton and Mr. Justice Patterson the document called a shipping bill or bill of lading, partly written and partly printed, marked as Exhibit D., was that under which the goods were received to be carried by the appellants, as was held by Mr. Justice Rose at the trial.\nThe questions we have to decide arise principally on the construction of certain clauses and conditions contained in this instrument; in addition to which we have to determine what effect is to be attributed to the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance pendente lite of $650 from the defendants, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, in satisfaction and discharge of his claim and right of action against the last named defendants, and of the release executed by the plaintiff in their favor.\nThe first point which we may consider is that which principally engaged the attention of the Court of Appeal, viz: the effect of the 10th condition\nThat condition is in the following words:\n10. That all goods addressed to consignees at points beyond the places at which the company has stations, and respecting which no directions to the contrary shall have been received at those stations, will be forwarded to their destination by public carrier or otherwise as opportunity may offer, without any claim for delay against the company for want of opportunity to forward them, or they may, at the discretion of the company, be suffered to remain on the company\u2019s premises, or be placed in shed or warehouse (if there be such convenience for receiving the same) pending communications with the consignees, at the risk of the owners as to damage thereto from any cause whatsoever. Bat the delivery of the goods by the company will be considered complete, and all responsibility of said company shall cease, when such other carriers shall have received notice that said company is prepared to deliver to them the said goods for further conveyance, and it is expressly declared and agreed that the said Grand Trunk Railway Company shall not be responsible for any loss, mis-delivery, damage or detention that may happen to goods so sent by them, if such loss, mis-delivery, damage or detention occur after the said goods arrive at said stations or places on their line nearest to the points or places which they are consigned to, or beyond their said limits.\nThe case of The Bristol & Exeter Railway Co. v. Collins[32] is an authority which, as regards the general construction of this condition, applies in the respondent\u2019s favor. Upon the authority of that case we must reject the appellants\u2019 contention that this condition restricts their liability to damage or loss happening on their own line and exonerates them from loss occurring after the goods should have left the line of the Grand Trunk Railway Company and been transferred to the hands of other railway companies over whose lines the transit had to be completed, a liability which the appellants must prim\u00e2 facie and apart from any condition or special terms in the contract be deemed to have undertaken simply by contracting to carry to McGregor or Portage Station. We must then hold the Grand Trunk Railway Company to have contracted for the carriage of the goods to their ultimate destination of McGregor (for which Portage la Prairie was afterwards substituted), that is for the whole transitus, so far as it could be completed by railway, and the other companies, on whose lines the goods were to be carried after they left the appellant\u2019s own line, must be considered as mere agents of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, between whom and the respondent there was no direct privity of contract. So far, but no further, this case of the Bristol & Exeter Railway Company v Collins32 is no doubt an authority for the respondent.\nThe Divisional Court of Queen\u2019s Bench held that the construction of the condition to the extent already indicated being thus to carry the whole distance to McGregor, Vogel\u2019s case[33] applied so as to make the restriction contained in the 104th section of the R.S.C. ch. 109 applicable, and thus to incapacitate the Grand Trunk Railway Company from entering into any contract or exacting any condition limiting its liability for negligence or omission, and this not merely as regards its own line, over which the same statute imposed upon it the duty of carrying, but also with reference to losses occurring on other lines over which the goods were to be carried by other railway companies acting as agents of the Grand Trunk Railway Company.\nI entirely agree with the Court of Appeal that this view was erroneous, and that according to the plain construction of the language of the 104th section, and without any reference to the English authority relied on[34], which arose upon a statute different in its terms, the prohibition of any limitation of liability therein contained is only co-extensive with the former part of the same section, which imposes upon railway companies the duties and obligations of common carriers. The literal meaning of the words \u201cevery person aggrieved by any neglect or refusal in the premises,\u201d it is obvious requires this construction and makes any other impossible. Then these duties and obligations were clearly prescribed in respect of a railway company\u2019s own line, and not with respect to other lines over which it might, if it chose, undertake to forward or carry, but in respect of which services its choice to undertake them or not was free and unaffected by any statutory duty whatever. From this it follows that in so far as the contract of carriage here beyond the terminus of their own line was one which the Grand Trunk Railway Company might have declined altogether, there was no statutory or other legal impediment to a contract by them limiting their liability either as carriers or otherwise in respect of the goods to be carried after they had left that company\u2019s own line.\nNext, it is material to enquire whether this 10th con- dition does contain any dispensation of liability in favor of the Grand Trunk Railway Company. I have already said that in common with the learned judges of the Court of Appeal, I am of opinion that so far as this condition is identical in its terms with the 10th condition of the receipt note which was in question in Bristol & Exeter Railway Company v. Collins[35], it has not the effect of restricting the responsibility of the Grand Trunk Railway Company to its own line.\nThe 10th condition in the present case, however, contains a clause not to be found in that which was under consideration in the case of the Bristol & Exeter Ry. Co. v. Collins35. It is at the end of the condition, and is in these words:\nAnd it is expressly declared and agreed that the said Grand Trunk Railway Company shall not be responsible for any loss, mis-delivery, damage or detention that may happen to the goods so sent by them, if such loss, mis-delivery, damage or detention occur after the said goods arrive at said stations or places on their line nearest to the points or places which they are consigned to or beyond their said limits.\nThe words \u201cafter the said goods arrive at said stations or places nearest to the points or places which they are consigned to,\u201d which we find in the condition before us, but which are not found in that which was in question in the Bristol & Exeter Ry. Co. v. Collins35, are in my opinion most material, and entirely distinguish the bill of lading in the present case from the receipt note which the House of Lords were called on to construe in the case referred to.\nFurther, in the case of the Bristol & Exeter Ry. Co. v. Collins35 the goods were destroyed whilst in transitu and during the continuance of the carriers\u2019 liability, but in the present case it is contended that the respondent\u2019s goods were not lost or damaged until after completion of the transitus, when the contract for carriage had come to an end, and when the liability of the appellants, either as carriers or as bailees, had entirely ceased.\nNow in the event which happened, of \u201cPortage Station\u201d being substituted for \u201cMcGregor,\u201d the original destination by agreement between the respondent and the station agent of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company at Portage, the station or place on the appellants\u2019 line, on the arrival at which their responsibility was to terminate, according to this condition was undoubtedly that at Portage, for according to the established construction the line of the appellants\u2019 agents, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company must, for the purposes of this condition, be considered as the appellants\u2019 own line. That it was free to the appellants to enter into any contract or to prescribe any condition they might think fit limiting their responsibility as carriers or otherwise beyond their own line has already been demonstrated. It is, therefore, a consequence of this entire freedom of contracting that the Grand Trunk Railway Company might have limited their liability ultra their own line, not only so as to relieve them from all liability from that onerous responsibility which the law has imposed on common carriers as insurers of goods against all losses, except those proceeding from \u201cthe act of God or the Queen\u2019s enemies,\u201d or inherent vice in the goods themselves, but further and beyond this, from all losses imputable to the negligence of the appellants\u2019 own agents and servants, the subsidiary railway companies who, as agents for the Grand Trunk Railway Company were to complete the carriage from the terminus of their own line to Portage. To exonerate from liability for the negligence of agents and servants, however, so long as the goods should, in fact, remain in the appellants\u2019 own hands as carriers during the transitus, express terms would have been requisite; and, entirely agreeing with what Mr. Justice Patterson has said on this head in connection with the 3rd condition, I do not think the language of this last clause of the 10th condition is sufficient to relieve the appellants from liability for any negligence which may have occurred before the goods arrived at Portage Station, though after they left the appellants\u2019 own line.\nWhilst, however, the appellants might thus have contracted themselves out of their prim\u00e2 facie liability not only as common carriers, but also in respect of negligence, which latter, however, it appears, as just shown, they have not done, they were not confined to this mode of restricting their liability, for it was open to them to limit it another way, viz., as respects time and place, by providing they should not be liable in any way after the goods arrived at a certain point. Thus, for example, there was nothing to prevent them from excluding all responsibility on their part, after the goods should have come into the hands of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, provided they did it in clear unequivocal terms. This they have not done. But, then, a fortiori there was no legal hindrance to their providing for such a cesser of liability immediately upon the termination of the transitus and when the contract of carriage would, in fact, have been completed. The question is, have the appellants not done this when they stipulate, as they in effect do, that they, \u201cshall not be responsible for any loss, misdelivery, damage or detention that may happen to the goods so sent by them, if such loss, mis-delivery, damage or detention occur after the said goods arrive at Portage Station.\u201d\nI read this condition just as if Portage Station had been actually inserted instead of the general description of the terminus in fact contained in the conditions, inasmuch as beyond all doubt Portage Station is by agreement of the parties to be considered as the \u201cstation or place\u201d on the appellants\u2019 line nearest to \u201cthe point or place to which the goods were consigned.\u201d\nThen, what meaning must we attribute to this clause? And what was, if any, the extent of the appellants\u2019 liability after the goods arrived at Portage Station, as the evidence shows they did on the 25th of July, 1882.\nIt is well established by incontrovertible authority that the liability of carriers by railways qu\u00e2 carriers terminates upon the arrival of the goods carried at their destination and the expiration of a reasonable time afterwards for their delivery. Chapman v. G.W Ry. Co.[36] What is a reasonable time must be determined with a due regard to surrounding circumstances. In the case just cited it was held that the railway company were not liable for goods which had arrived at a station on the 25th March, and were destroyed by fire on the morning of the 27th. What would be a reasonable time would, however, be probably held to vary according to the surrounding circumstances; but, making every allowance for that it is not too much to say that by the 28th July, when the respondent for the first time inquired for the goods the liability of the appellants as carriers would, irrespective of condition or special contract, have ceased, and the goods would then, according to the general law, have been held by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, acting either as agents for the appellants, the Grand Trunk Railway Company, or in the quality of principals acting on their own behalf, as warehousemen only, and consequently under a responsibility reduced from that of insurers to one of bailees liable only for neglect of duty.\nWhat then, on this, the state of things which would have resulted, apart from contract or special condition, was the effect of the provision contained in the latter clause of the 10th condition which I have already set forth? I must unhesitatingly answer that it can only be construed as an express contract between the parties that all liability on the part of the Grand Trunk Railway Company should cease when the goods arrived at their destination and the contract for carriage was thus terminated. It appears to me very clear that when the contracts and agreements of the parties are free from legislative interference it is quite competent for a railway company to stipulate that the extended liability which the common law imposes upon carriers beyond that which ordinary bailees have to bear shall cease contemporaneously with the goods carried being deposited at the station to which they are destined, thus relieving the railway company from that time from all liability, save that of ordinary bailees, viz., a liability for negligence. Then that is precisely what was done in the present case. The agreement is that there shall be no liability for loss, damage or detention after the goods arrive at the station, which in this instance is to be read as Portage Station. This to my mind is as clear as words could express it, to show that the intention of the parties was that there was to be no liability as carriers after the goods arrive at the station. To this it may be answered that there would still remain the liability for negligence as warehousemen. The clause in question has, however, a continuing operation, and not only cuts down the contract of carriage to one of mere bailment so soon as the goods arrive, but also exempts the appellants from liability as warehousemen. The goods must consequently be considered from that date as remaining in the possession and custody of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. Then, as regards the subsequent possession of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, if it is to be regarded as that of the last named company as agents for the appellants, the only liability it involved was responsibility for negligence. So that, if the clause in question had a continuing operation, as I maintain it had, and as it must have had to give it due effect, there was no liability on which it could operate, save the liability for the negligence of their servants and agents, and consequently it must be taken as exonerating the appellants from any liability whatever as regards the respondent, leaving him, however, to look to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company who, even if not in privity with the respondent, were actual and de facto bailees, and as such bound by an obligation, irrespective of contract, to take care of the goods in their hands.\nThere is nothing in this construction of the provision in question at variance with Fitzgerald v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[37] and cases of that class. There the clause of exemption was not altogether rejected, but in those cases full scope for its operation was afforded by attributing it to an intention to relieve the railway company from the onerous liability of carriers at common law, leaving them liable only for negligence. Here it is impossible to give the clause any operation whatever, unless it is construed as exempting the appellants, who had become mere wharehousemen, from liability for negligence, and as it is impossible to reject altogether a stipulation of this kind which the parties were free to enter into it must receive this interpretation.\nAnother and, perhaps, more correct way of interpreting this clause and giving it the same practical effect is to consider it as putting an end to all liability on the part of the appellants, either as carriers or ware- housemen after the actual arrival of the goods at Portage, in which case the appellants would be considered, as the agents of the respondent, to hand the goods over upon their reaching that point to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, who would thenceforward have the custody of them as warehousemen and bailees for the respondent.\nThe result is that so soon as the goods were warehoused at Portage Station, or within a reasonable time thereafter, which reasonable time had elapsed before the respondent called for them, either the appellants ceasing to be liable as carriers held them through their agents the Canada Pacific Railway Company as mere bailees for the respondent, but as bailees exonerated from liability for the negligence of their agents and servants or they ceased from that time to have any possession of the goods at all and thenceforward the possession was in the Canada Pacific Railway Company alone as bailees directly for the respondent, the appellants being in the last case considered as the agents of the respondent to hand the goods over to the other railway company. Either one or the other of these alternative constructions, it matters not which, must be attributed to this 10th condition in order to give due effect to the words in which it is expressed.\nConstrued in either way, this 10th condition seems to be most reasonable since it relieves the appellants from liability, not in respect of goods in transit, but in respect of goods which might remain for an indefinite time deposited with bailees at a great distance from the appellants, and over whom they could possibly have no control, whilst the respondent would have every security for the safe-keeping of the property which he could reasonably require, and an efficient remedy in the liability which the Canadian Pacific Railway Company would incur by the mere receipt of the goods as bailees.\nThis conclusion, however, would, it is manifest, have no practical result, if it were not that the evidence, or at least a fair inference from it, shows that the loss of a portion of the goods and the damage to the residue occurred not in transitu, but after the arrival at Portage Station. This appears to have been the view of the Court of Appeal, for Mr. Justice Patterson, who delivered the leading judgment there, says[38]:\nThere is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the goods did not all arrive at Portage, the date being given as the 25th July, and were not all at that time in good order.\nAnd again, at page 26 of the report, the same learned judge says:\nThe conclusion of fact indicated by this evidence is that the injury occurred and the missing packages were lost during these two months, and no account of the goods is given to rebut that inference. The negligence and resulting injury therefore, happened after the transit was over, and when but for the default of the company, the goods would have been in their possession.\nNo dissent from these statements was expressed by any other members of the court, and as they entirely accord with the result of my own consideration of the depositions, which I have read several times, I do not hesitate to accept them as correct conclusions of fact.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the motion for judgment made on behalf of the appellants was properly granted by the learned judge who presided at the trial, although the view I take of the 10th condition is not quite the same as his.\nSecondly. The 12th condition, independently of any other consideration, appears to me conclusive in favor of the appellants. That condition is in the following words:\n12. That no claim for damage to, loss of, or detention of any goods for which this company is accountable shall be allowed unless notice in writing, and the particulars of the claim for said loss, damage or detention, are given to the station freight agent at or nearest to the place of delivery, within thirty-six hours after the goods, in respect of which said claim is made, are delivered.\nThis condition was duly pleaded by the appellants, and this portion of their statement of defence was demurred to as constituting no answer in law. Upon argument, however, the demurrer was over-ruled and the plaintiff was allowed to amend and take issue upon it, which he did by a general denial of its allegations.\nThe result is, that as regards the sufficiency of this defence as an answer in law to the plaintiff\u2019s demand, that question must be taken as concluded and as res judicata between the parties, the plaintiff not having taken any cross-appeal against the decision or demurrer either here or in the Court of Appeal. Then in point of fact the plaintiff has failed to prove that he gave the notice which this 12th condition required, so that the defence set up by paragraph 4 of the statement of claim is completely sustained both in law and in fact. The wording of this condition is not very accurate. It clearly, however, covers the damage to the packages which were delivered. As regards the claim for loss, I think it also applies to that, as the only sensible construction which can be placed upon it with reference to lost goods is that when goods, part of a consignment, are lost, the notice is to be given thirty-six hours after the delivery of those which arrive safely and are delivered. Unless we are to make a new contract for the parties, I am at a loss to conceive any answer to the defence founded on this condition.\nLastly. The appellants rely on the accord and satisfaction, which took place between the respondent and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company pendente lite, and the release executed by the appellants of all causes of action in respect of the loss and damage to the goods in question against the last named company.\nAlthough it appears to me very clear that these two railway companies are sued as joint tort feasors, and that the old law was that a release to, or acceptance of satisfaction from one of several joint tort feasors, was a bar to the action against the others, it has been suggested by text writers that the law in this respect has undergone a change[39], and that a release of one wrong doer is not now a defence for the others, except in cases when the release or satisfaction is expressly given or accepted in bar of the cause of action against all, which certainly does not appear to have been the case here, the intention being manifestly to release the Canadian Pacific Railway Company only; and although this new doctrine does not seem to me altogether consistent with such cases as King v. Hoare[40] and Brinsmead v. Harrison[41], cases which have quite recently been approved of by the House of Lords[42], I do not think it necessary to enter into a fuller consideration of it, as the two first points seem to me quite sufficient to warrant my judgment, which must be for the appellants, thus restoring the judgment pronounced by Mr. Justice Rose at the trial, with costs to the appellants in all the courts.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Was of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed, for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Strong, and would allow the appeal, for the reasons stated in his judgment.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs, upon the grounds on which the Court of Appeal for Ontario proceeded. It is unnecessary to allude to the facts of the case, further than to say, that unless the defendants are exempted from liability by reason of the condition endorsed on the shipping bill which was relied upon, there can be no doubt that they are responsible to make good to the plaintiff all damages by him sustained, as well by the unwarrantable delay which occurred in the conveyance and delivery of what was delivered, and by reason of the ruinous condition in which a large portion was, as by the loss of that portion which never was, delivered.\nThe case of Bristol & Exeter Railway Co. v. Collins, in the House of Lords[43] is, in my judgment, conclusive upon the present case. The Court of Queen\u2019s Bench by their judgment in Zunz v. The South Eastern Railway Co.[44] never intended, even if it had been competent for them, to qualify in any respect the judgment of the House of Lords in the Bristol & Exeter Railway Co. v. Collins43 and the condition relied upon in the present case is less favorable to the support of the exemption from liability relied upon by the defendants than was the condition under consideration in that case, while that upon which Zunz v. S.E. Ry. Co.44 proceeded was framed apparently with the intention of adopting the suggestion made by some of the learned judges in the Bristol & Exeter Ry. Co. v. Collins,43 to the effect that a railway company receiving goods to be conveyed to the place to which they are consigned over another railway, or other railways, extending beyond the line of the receiving company, and wishing to limit their liability to the period of transit upon their own line should frame the condition upon which they should rely for exemption from liability while the goods should be in transit upon such other railway in very different language from that used in the condition relied upon in Bristol & Exeter Railway Co., v. Collins[45] and in fact in such language as should be incapable of being misunderstood by any person dealing with a railway company as a common carrier of goods.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim is:\u2014\nThat he delivered to the G.T.R\u2019y Co.\u2014who were a company doing business as common carriers in Canada and elsewhere, certain goods belonging to the plaintiff, to be safely carried for reward to them in that behalf from the city of Toronto, in the county of York and Province of Ontario to the village of McGregor in the Province of Manitoba, and there to be delivered to the plaintiff within a reasonable time: that the said G.T. Ry. Co. duly received the said goods for the purpose aforesaid, and the plaintiff duly paid them their charges therefor, amounting to $17.20. Yet the said defendants, the said company, did not deliver the said goods to the plaintiff within a reasonable time, nor did they take due and proper care thereof but wholly neglected so to do; and so carelessly, negligently and improperly carried the same and took such bad care thereof, that by their negligence, carelessness and improper conduct in that behalf the said goods were delayed for a long and unreasonable time in transit, and a large portion thereof was greatly damaged and the remainder never delivered at all to the plaintiff.\nNow the statement of defence, which sets up the condition which is relied upon as exempting the defendant\u2019s from liability, is as follows:\u2014\nThe defendants say that the said goods were delivered to them, and they received the same for carriage and delivery upon and subject to the terms of a special contract made by and between the plaintiff and defendants respecting the carriage and delivery thereof; that one of the said conditions was and is, \u201cthat all goods addressed to consignees at points beyond the places at which the company has stations, and respecting which no directions to the contrary shall have been received at these stations, will be forwarded to their destination by public carrier or otherwise as opportunity may offer, without any claim for delay against the company for want of opportunity to forward them; or they may, at the discretion of the company, be suffered to remain on the company\u2019s premises or be placed in shed or warehouse (if there be such convenience for receiving the same) pending communication with the consignees, at the risk of the owners as to damage thereto from any cause whatsoever. But the delivery of the goods by the company will be considered complete, and all responsibility of the company shall cease when such other carrier shall have received notice that the said company is prepared to deliver to them the said goods for further conveyance; and it is expressly declared and agreed that the said Grand Trunk Railway Company shall not be responsible for any loss, mis-delivery, damage or detention that may happen to goods so sent by them if such loss, mis-delivery, damage or detention occur after said goods arrive at said stations or places on their line nearest to the points or places which they are consigned to, or beyond their said limits.\u201d\nThe above condition varies little from that in The Bristol & Exeter Ry. v. Collins,[46] from which it appears to have been taken. The only difference, indeed, appears to lie in an alteration in the first sentence which renders obscure what is clearly enough expressed in that under consideration in The Bristol & Exeter Ry. v. Collins46; with this ambiguity, however, we are not at present concerned, and need not dwell upon it; and in omitting a paragraph which is in the latter condition, namely:\u2014\nAnd the company hereby further give notice that any money which may be received by them as payment for the conveyance of goods by other carriers beyond their said limits will be so received only for the convenience of the consignor, for the purpose of being paid to such other carriers, and will not be received as a charge made by the company upon the goods in the capacity of carriers beyond the extent of their own Railway.\nIt is clear, therefore, that if the condition endorsed on the shipping bill in The Bristol & Exeter Railway Co. v. Collin46 had no application to qualify the contract in that case, although it was a contract for carriage of goods to a point on another railway remote from the terminus of the railway of the contracting company, the condition now under consideration can have no application to the contract in the present case, which in all substantial particulars is identical with that in The Bristol & Exeter Railway v. Collins46. By the shipping bill upon which the defendants rely, (I am assuming that the goods were received by them to be carried under that shipping bill), it appears that the contract the defendants entered into was one entire contract to carry the goods the whole distance from Toronto to McGregor station, Manitoba, for one entire sum, which they received as payment in full for such carriage. This shipping bill, with the conditions endorsed thereon, is the form which has always been and still is in use for shipping goods for transit between any two stations upon the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada, which extends from Portland, in the State of Maine, and from Quebec in the east, to Sarnia, in the Province of Ontario, in the west. Since the present contract was entered into the company appears to have adopted a new form for the transit of goods through the United States west of Sarnia; but the contract under consideration was drawn up on a shipping bill then and still in use for the carriage of goods upon the Grand Trunk Railway proper\u2014as above defined. Now, in executing this contract it appears that from Sarnia, in the Province of Ontario, or Fort Gratiot, across the River St. Clair in the State of Michigan, whichever may be said to be the western terminus of the Grand Trunk Railway proper, the company had two routes, being part of what is called the Grand Trunk railway system, by which the goods could have been forwarded as far as Chicago, in the State of Illinois. From Chicago to St. Pauls there were three railway routes by which the goods could have been forwarded; and from St. Paul\u2019s to St. Vincent one; but whether these routes were, or any of them was, part of the Grand Trunk Railway system did not appear; and from St. Vincent to McGregor station, to which the defendants contracted for the carriage of the goods, there was the Canada Pacific Railway. Now, by the statutes affecting the company they had, prior to the entering into the contract under consideration\u2014\nPower to make working arrangements with any railway company in the United States, or to agree for running powers over the line or lines of any such company, or to lease any such lines of railway, or to make agreements and arrangements with any such company as well as with any railway company in Canada, for the interchange of traffic passing to and from their railways respectively, and for the division and apportionment of tolls, rates and charges in respect of such traffic, and generally in relation to the management and workings of the railways or any part thereof, and of any railway in connection therewith for any term not exceeding twenty-one years.\nIt may be that on the whole route from Fort Gratiot to Manitoba the defendants had agreements or arrangements with railway companies in the United States of the nature of some of those thus authorized, and the arrangements may have been such as to make the whole route by which the goods of the plaintiff were conveyed from the River St. Clair to the Canada Pacific Railway in Manitoba part of which is called the Grand Trunk Railway system. Of this we know nothing, nor does the plaintiff appear to have known anything further than that the defendant had power to make such arrangements. That was information which the G.T. Ry. Co. kept to themselves. The plaintiff knew nothing, so far as appears, as to the route by which the defendants should convey his goods, as they had undertaken to do from Toronto to Manitoba.\nNow if this condition applies, as contended for by the defendants, the plaintiff can have no cause of action against anyone, unless he can show precisely in what part of this long route from Toronto to Manitoba the loss or damage occurred. He could have no action against the defendants unless he could prove that it occurred between Toronto and Fort Gratiot, and he would be deprived of all benefit of the contract he had made with the defendants to carry the goods to McGregor, and for which he had paid, and he might look for redress as best he could from companies in the United States or elsewhere with whom he had entered into no contract, but with whom, no doubt, the defendants had, for the purpose of enabling them to execute their contracts. To my mind it is difficult to conceive anything more preposterous than that the defendants having, as carriers of goods, received payment from the plaintiff for the transport of his goods to McGregor station could relieve themselves from all responsibility by taking the goods to Fort Gratiot, and there putting them in warehouse until they should communicate with the plaintiff at McGregor station, and receive orders from him, or by notifying some of the railway companies having railway communication with Chicago that they might take them to Chicago and forward them from thence as best they could. Whether under the circumstances any condition could be so framed as to have such effect it is unnecessary to inquire; but in order to be construed to have such effect it ought at least, to use the language used in the Bristol & Exeter Ry. Co. v. Collins,[47] to be expressed in terms as to which no person dealing with a railway company as a common carrier could fall into any misapprehension or mistake. Now in Zunz v. The S.E. Ry. Co.[48], the ticket which the defendants had sold to the plaintiff was in three coupons, one, from London to Dover by the defendants\u2019 railway, two, from Dover to Calais by water, and three, from Calais to Paris by the Great Northern and France railway. Whether this was a divisible contract, or one entire contract which was not determined, it is plain that the plaintiff knew he was about to travel to his destination by three distinct routes, precisely determined, so that he could have no difficulty in understanding what was meant by the expression: \u201cWhile the passenger is travelling by the South Eastern Railway Company\u2019s trains and boats,\u201d in connection with that contract. Upon the back of the ticket was printed a condition which expressed in very unmistakable language that the defendants assumed no liability for anything which should happen to the plaintiff on his route, except while the plaintiff should be travelling on the South Eastern Railway Company\u2019s trains and boats. The condition was as follows:\u2014\nThe South Eastern Railway Company is not responsible for loss or detention of, or injury to luggage of the passenger travelling by this through ticket except while the passenger is travelling by the South Eastern Ry. Co\u2019s. trains and boats; and in this latter case only when the passenger complies with the by-laws and regulations of the company; and in no case for luggage of greater value than \u00a36. The South Eastern Railway Company incurs no responsibility of any kind beyond what arises in connection with its own trains and boats in conveyance of passengers being booked to travel over the railways of other companies, such through booking being only for the convenience of the passenger, nor will the South Eastern Company be responsible for the trains and boats whether of this or the other companies over whose lines the ticket extends, being delayed, or not meeting the trains shown in correspondence; nor for any consequence which may result to a passenger thereby.\nThis condition as well as the subject matter to which it relates are very different from the condition and the subject matter to which it related in The Bristol & Exeter Ry. Co. v. Collins[49] and between the two cases there is no conflict.\nFowles v. G.W. Ry. Co.[50] was prior to The Bristol & Exeter Ry. Co. v. Collins49 and is quite consistent with it. The plaintiff declared as upon a contract by the defendants as common carriers to convey plaintiff\u2019s goods from Bristol to Brompton. The delivery note showed that the contract was to convey the goods from Bristol station of the Great Western Ry. Co. to Paddington Station, although the address of the consignee was entered thereon as at Brompton, and the plaintiff had paid for the whole carriage to Brompton under a condition endorsed on the delivery note similar to that in The Bristol and Exeter Ry. Co. v. Collins49 as to any money received by the defendants, as payment for the conveyance of the goods by carriers beyond the defendants\u2019 railway would be received only for the convenience of the consignors for the purpose of being paid to such carriers, and would not be received as a charge made by the company upon the goods in the capacity of carriers beyond the extent of their own railway; and it was held quite in accord with the subsequent judgment of the House of Lords in the Britsol and Exeter Ry. Co. v. Collins49, that this was just the case to which such a condition applied, and that the defendants were not liable for anything which took place beyond the station to which they had contracted to convey the goods, namely, their Paddington station.\nKent v. The Midland Ry. Co.[51] was a case quite different from the present. The question there was as to the construction of the words \u201coff its lines\u201d in the following sentence:\u2014\nThe company does not hold itself responsible for any delay, detention, or other loss or injury arising off its lines.\nAnd it was held that the luggage of a passenger who was travelling to his destination upon two lines of railway under a through ticket, issued by the defendants company was not \u201coff the line\u201d of the defendants until it was delivered into the possession of the other company running in connection with the first. This decision it is obvious has no bearing upon the condition at present under consideration.\nIn Aldridge v. Great Western Ry. Co.[52] the goods had been delivered at the defendants at Hereford to be conveyed to Tiverton, a point on the Midland Railway or its system. The person by whom they were delivered to the Great Western Ry. Co. signed a printed note containing the condition that the company will not be responsible:\nIn respect of goods destined beyond the limits of the company\u2019s railway, and as respects the company their responsibility will cease when such goods shall have been delivered over to another carrier in the usual course for further conveyance.\nNothing had been received by the company for the carriage of the goods. The goods were conveyed by the Great Western Railway Company to Gloucester and there delivered to the Midland Railway and it was held that the Great Western Railway Company were exempt from responsibility, their contract, in effect, terminating at Gloucester, where they were delivered to the Midland Railway Company.\nWilliams J. in pronouncing the judgment of the court says:\u2014\nWe are of opinion the second condition is reasonable, and does protect the defendants; the railway company do not attempt to protect themselves from injuries or delays happening on their own line or through the negligence of themselves or of their own servants, or even on a further line, where they have received any compensation for carriage on that further line.\nAs was the case in Collins v. Bristol & Exeter Railway Company[53], and is the case here. In Rennie v. Northern Railway Company[54] the special contract which was set up by way of defence to an action of trover was held to be a contract of the defendants limited to their carrying to Duluth and delivering the goods there to the Northern Pacific Railway to forward to Fort Garry, and that having done so they had fulfilled their contract and were not liable for anything which took place subsequent to such delivery to the Northern Pacific Railway Company.\nNone of these cases affect, nor has any case been cited which does affect to call in question the soundness of the judgment of the House of Lords in the Bristol & Exeter Railway Company v. Collins[55], which, in so far as this 10th condition is concerned, governs the present case.\nA defence under another condition was pleaded, but does not seem to have been relied upon at the trial, nor to have been alluded to in the Divisional Court, nor in the reasons of appeal from the judgment therein to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, nor in the argument before the latter court, and for this reason alone it should not now be entertained: but, in my opinion, the condition in question has no application to the present case, any more than has the 10th condition. The condition is No. 12\nThat no claim for damage to, loss of, or detention of, any goods for which this company is accountable shall be allowed unless notice in writing and the particulars of the claim for said loss, damage or detention are given to the station freight agent at or nearest to the place of delivery within thirty-six hours after the goods in respect of which the claim is made are delivered.\nNow the \u201cstation freight agent\u201d alluded to in this condition is, in my opinion, clearly to be understood to be a station freight agent on the defendants\u2019 own line proper, not a station freight agent of another unknown company upon another unknown railway in the United States for example, with whom the defendants may have connection and traffic arrangements, it may be at San Francisco or New Orleans, or any other remote place, nor a station freight agent of the Canada Pacific Railway Company at New Westminster or Vancouver or some other place in British Columbia, to which places or stations the defendants may as carriers have received payment in advance for the transportation of goods and may have contracted to convey and deliver them; and this is the construction which the defendants themselves by their statement of defence insist upon, for they allege in breach of the condition that the plaintiff did not give the notice required by the condition to the defendant\u2019s station freight agent at Fort Gratiot, in the State of Michigan, and that this Fort Gratiot is the station on the defendants\u2019 line of railway nearest to the point or place to which said goods were consigned, and that the said village of McGregor is a point or place beyond any place where the defendants have stations, which the plaintiff well knew.\nAnything so absurd as that upon loss or damage appearing to goods received by the defendants as carriers to be carried to, and delivered, it may be, at or near San Francisco or New Orleans or at any other remote place in the United States upon or near a railway with the company owning which the defendants have traffic arrangements of the nature hereinbefore referred to, and which they have power to make, or at New Westminster, or Vancouver, or at any other remote place in British Columbia or elsewhere, and for which carriage throughout the defendants had as such carriers received payment in advance, a consignee should be required as in obedience to this condition to give to the defendants\u2019 station freight agent at Fort Gratiot or Sarnia the notice therein referred to, cannot, in my opinion, well be conceived.\nThe condition, plainly, in my opinion, applies only to the case of goods which have reached a station on the defendants\u2019 own line which by the contract for carriage is designated as the terminus of the contract for carriage by railway and as being the place most convenient for that purpose as the station nearest to the place off the line which is the ultimate destination of the goods\u2014precisely as the 10th condition in Collins v. The Bristol & Exeter Railway[56] was construed.\nThis construction is sensible, while that contended for is the contrary, and impracticable.\nThere remains only the point as to a new trial upon the grounds of the payment made by the Canada Pacific Railway Company, which for all we know may be their fair share of the plaintiff\u2019s loss, which may not have been all sustained while the goods were in their possession. I certainly agree with the view taken on this point by the learned Chief Justice of the Divisional Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, and other learned judges of that court.\nThree weeks before the trial took place the defendants had full notice of this payment, and that it was made upon the basis of a proposal for settlement made to the defendants by the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor about five or six months previously. Yet the defendants never alluded to it at the trial, and they got the benefit of it in reduction of the amount originally claimed by the plaintiff, and in support of which evidence had been taken on commission. Moreover the receipt by the plaintiff of this sum from the Canada Pacific Railway Company could never be set up as a bar to the plaintiffs\u2019 action against the Grand Trunk Railway Company, nor can it in any manner embarrass them in any claim they may have against any of the railway companies whose railways the defendants\u2019 selected as the route by which they should fulfil their contract with the plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s claim against the Grand Trunk Railway Company is under his contract with them, while the defendant\u2019s claim against any of the other railway companies must depend upon a contract between the defendants and such other railway companies, as appearing in their traffic arrangements or elsewhere.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: John Bell.\nSolicitor for respondent: A.C.

Ritchie, C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEENSS BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nPollution of running stream\u2014Long established Industry\u2014Nuisance\u2014 injunction.\nW. acquired a lot adjoining a small stream at C\u00f4te-des-Neiges, Montreal, and finding the water polluted from certain noxious substances thrown into the stream brought an action in damages against C. the owner of a tannery situated 15 arpents higher up the stream. and asked for an injunction. At the trial it was proved that C. aid his predecessors had from time immemorial carried on the business of tanning leather there, using the water for tanning purposes, to the knowledge of all the inhabitants without complaint on their part; that it was the principal industry of the village; that the stream was partly used as a drain by the other proprietors of the land adjoining the stream and manure and filth were thrown in but that every precaution was taken by C. to prevent any solid matter from falling into the creek. W. only acquired the property since C. had been using the stream for the purpose of his tannery, and there was no evidence that the property had depreciated in value by the use C. made of the stream.\nHeld\u2014Affirming the judgment of the court below, that W., under the circumstances proved in this case, was not entitled to an injunction to restrain C. from using the stream as he did.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, for Lower Canada (Appeal side) ([1]) which revised the judgment of the Superior Court granting an injunction ([2]). The appellant, who was plaintiff in the Superior Court alleged in his declaration:\nThat he owned a house and property at the village of C\u00f4te-des-Neiges., where he passed the summer months. This property was traversed by a small stream known as the Ruisseau de la C\u00f4te-des-Neiges, a verbalized municipal watercourse. The plaintiff's auteurs had used this stream for culinary and domestic purposes. The defendant owned a large tannery, built upon this stream, about a quarter of a mile above the plaintiff's house. For five years past, the defendant and his employees had made an illegal use of this stream, to the damage of plaintiff. The defendant in the course of his tanning and dyeing operations, threw into the stream at frequent intervals, various poisonous and noxious matters used by him in his business. The water in which hides had been washed was also constantly emptied into the stream. The defendant also dammed the stream at intervals so as to obtain a greater quantity of water in which to empty his vats of offensive matter The effect of this abuse of the stream by defendant was to deprive plaintiff of his lawful use of the water, to render the water, in fact, unfit for any use whatever; to seriously depreciate the value of plaintiff\u2019s property; and to endanger his health and that of his family, one of his children having already had typhoid fever in consequence of the state of the water.\nBy his conclusions, the plaintiff asked for $2,000 damages, and for a restraining order compelling defendant to carry on his tanning operations in such a way as not to render the neighborhood unhealthy, and not to interfere with the plaintiff's lawful use of the stream.\nThe defendant pleaded that he and his predecessors had from time immemorial. carried on business of tanning in c\u00f4te-des-Neiges with the consent of the inhabitants of C\u00f4te-des-Neiges, that the tanneries supplied a large part of the population with their livelihood and that the inhabitants had consented to the inconveniences resulting from the tanneries, in view of the advantages resulting therefrom. He also pleaded that the stream was more polluted by others than by himself.\nTo this plea the plaintiff demurred, on the ground that it alleged the acquisition of a servitude, without invoking any title. The plaintiff also answered generally.\nThe issues were closed by defendant's replications. The demurrer was argued before Mr. Justice Taschereau, but was reserved for the final hearing. The final judgment condemned the defendant to pay $500 damages, and granted a restraining order in the terms of the declaration.\nThe defendant appealed from this decision, and the Court of Queen's Bench reversed the judgment and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action.\nThe evidence is reviewed at length in the judgments of the courts below ([3]).\nLafteur and Bielle appeared on behalf of the appellant and Laflamme Q. C. and David appeared on behalf of the respondent.\nIn addition to the points relied on and authorities cited in the courts below and which are reported at length ([4]), the learned counsel for the appellant cited Championni\u00e8re, Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des eaux courantes ([5]); Larombi\u00e8re Obligations ([6]); Blair v.

C. ch. 135, sec. 29 (b), 38 Vic ch. 97\u2014 Interference\u2014Damages.\nBy 38 Vic, oh. 97, the plaintiffs, were authorized to build and maintain a toll bridge on the River L'Assomption at a place called \" Port-age \" and \" if the said bridge should by accident or otherwise he destroyed, become unsafe or impassable, the said plaintiffs were bound to rebuild the said bridge within fifteen months next following the giving way of said bridge, under penalty of forfeiture of the advantages to them by this Act granted; and during any time that the said bridge should be unsafe or impassable they were bound to maintain a ferry across the said river, for which they might recover the tolls.\"\nThe bridge was accidentally carried away by ice, but rebuilt and opened for traffic within fifteen months. During the reconstruction, although plaintiffs maintained a ferry across the river, the defendant built a temporary bridge within the limits of the plaintiffs' franchise and allowed it to be used by parties crossing the river.\nIn an action brought by the plaintiffs, claiming $1,000 damages, and praying that defendant be condemned to demolish the temporary bridge on an appeal to the Supreme Court it was\nHeld,\u20141st, that as rights in future might be bound, the case was , appealable under R. S. C, ch. 135, sec. 29 (b).\n2nd\u2014Reversing the judgment of the court below Ritchie C. J. and Patterson J. dissenting.\u2014That the exclusive statutory privilege extended to the ferry and while maintained by the plaintiffs the defendant had no right to build the temporary bridge, but as the bridge had since been demolished the court would merely award nominal damages and costs.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, by which the appellants' action was dismissed with costs.\nThe appellants sued the respondent in the Superior Court, alleging in substance, by their declaration certain powers, privileges, immunities unto them granted under and by virtue of 38 Vic, ch. 97, and that under said statute they built a bridge over the river L'Assomption and kept it in good order; that in the course of the month of April 1885 the said bridge was partly carried away by the ice; that they repaired it within the delay fixed by the Act and had it again opened for circulation on the first of November of the same year, they having during the interval accommodated the public with a sufficient ferry across the said river; that respondent, in the course of May, 1885, erected another toll bridge which was opened for public circulation on the 1st of June 1885 within the limits prohibited by the said Act as being within the appellants privilege, thereby encroaching and infringing upon their said privileges; the appellants praying, by their conclusions, amongst others, that the respondent be ordered to demolish his said bridge that he be prohibited from further troubling appellants in the exercise of their privilege, and that on his default of so doing, the appellants be allowed to demolish respondent's said bridge, and the respondent be condemned to pay to appellants the sum of one thousand dollars damages and costs.\nThe respondent answered the said suit, first, by a defense au fonds en fait, and further, by another plea, stating that his bridge was built Only for his own use, and for such time only as appellants' bridge would remain impassable; that he allowed no stranger to pass thereon, and if any one did pass, it was without his consent and without remuneration and that he thereby did in no way infringe upon any of the appellants' privileges.\nThe appellants specially replied that the respondent by constructing his bridge, had illegally acted and, moreover, violated the privileges of the appellants: that the respondent had built his bridge not only for his personal utility, but even for that of a great number of persons who continued to use it, to his knowledge and with his consent and that he was personally profiting by it.\nAt the trial it was proved that the bridge had been accidentally carried away by ice, but rebuilt and open for traffic within fifteen months, during which time appellants maintained a ferry across the river, and that the respondents' bridge was a temporary bridge within the limits of the appellant's franchise upon which he allowed the public to cross the river, and the bridge was subsequently taken away.\nThe material sections of the statute 35 -Vic. ch. 97 are the following:-\n\" Sec. 5.\u2014At all times, so long as the said bridge is kept in good repair and open for the use of the public, no person whatever shall erect any bridge or bridges, or shall use, for purposes of ferriage, boats of any description whatever, for the passage of any person, cattle or vehicle whatsoever for hire across the said river, within the distance of half a mile from the said river in the direction of the flow of the river and within the distance of two miles in the other direction, such distance being measured along the banks of the said river and following its windings, and any person who shall build any toll-bridge or toll-bridges over the said river within the limits aforesaid, or shall ferry for hire within the limits aforesaid shall, without prejudice to any proceedings which may he instituted against him by the said Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Galarneau and Magloire Cl\u00e9ophas Galarneau before any court, to cause the said bridge to, be destroyed, and to cause their privileges to be otherwise respected, pay to the said Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Galarneau and Magloire Cl\u00e9ophas Galarneau treble the tolls hereby imposed for all persons cattle horses and carriages passing over such bridge or crossing by means of such ferry or ferries.\nSec. 6.\u2014The said Francois Xavier Galarneau and Magloire Cl\u00e9ophas Galarneau to entitle themselves to the benefits and advantages to them by this act granted, shall be bound to put the said bridge into a safe and convenient condition for the passage of travellers, cattle or vehicles and if the said bridge should by accident or otherwise, be destroyed, become unsafe or impassable, the said Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Gralarneau and Magloire Cl\u00e9ophas Galarneau shall be bound to rebuild the said bridge within the fifteen months next following the giving away of the said bridge, under penalty of forfeiture of the advantages to them by this act granted; and during any time that the said bridge shall be un-safe or impassable they shall maintain a ferry across the said river for which they may recover the tolls aforesaid.''\nMcConville for respondent, on the motion to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nThe amount claimed, one thousand ($1,000) does not make the case appealable.\nThe case does not involve the validity of any of the acts mentioned in paragraph (a) of section 29 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\nIt does not relate to any fee of office duty rent revenue or any sum of money payable to Her Majesty, nor to any title to lands\nDoes it relate to any title to a tenement?\nI believe, not, because the franchise granted to the appellants, being for the limited period of 25 years (section 9 ch. 97 38 Vic.) is rather a chattel than a tenement which must be permanent. Blackstone, Kerr's edition (1); Abbott's Dictionary (1); Brown's New Law Dictionary (1); Tomlin's Law Dictionary (1); Bouvier's Law Dictionary (1); Maxwell Interpretation of Statutes (2).\nIs there any annual rent or such like matter or thing where the rights in future might be bound? I respectfully submit that there is no such thing.\nIf the view I have above expressed as to the true construction of the statute 38 Vic., ch 97 is correct, it remains clear that appellants never had in the past, have not actually, and will never have the right by them claimed Until they obtain another act from Parliament they will have no right that might hereafter be bound by the decisions of the courts below.\nLaflamme Q.C. for appellants contra contended that the case came within the sub-section (c) of section 29 of R. S.C.\nThe decision of the court on the question of \"jurisdiction being* reserved the case was then argued on the merits.\nLaflamme Q.C. and Charpentier for appellants con tended that the charter or privilege granted by the general statute 38 Vic, chap 97, is a contract between the public and the grantee, which warrants to the latter, the exclusive right to build a bridge over the River L'Assomption within the limits indicated, and that according to the 5th section of the statute there is an absolute prohibition to construct any other bridge t the limits of the privilege, in favor of the grantees, at all times provided the grantee executes the obligations mentioned in his grant. See Lessee v.Douglass (1); Girard v. Belanger (1).\nAs to the damages, they contended that although it would be difficult to strictly determine the amount it appeared however by the evidence that a great number of travellers had eluded the toll which the appellants had the right to claim, by using the ferry constructed by respondent, which was open to the free circulation of the public. In such a case, the court must consider the determined violation of the law and grant to the injured party exemplary damages, or at least sufficient to cover the \"probable loss that the party may have suffered, and the sum of two hundred dollars would be an extremely moderate amount.\nMcConville for respondent contended that the only reasonable construction to be \"put upon sections 5 and 6 of the statute was that in case of accident the benefits and privileges granted to appellants are suspended during the fifteen months allowed for repairs. During that time they can claim none of such benefits and privileges; and the public, of which respondent is one, may protect themselves in any manner that suits them, if they are not satisfied with the appellants' ferry.\nGrrants of this kind are always strictly construed, are always taken in a most favorable sense for the King and the public, and against the grantee. They are valid only as to what is therein precisely mentioned are not to be extended beyond the terms expressly used. Blackstone, Kerr Edition (1).\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J. I am of opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG and ' TASCHEREAU J J. concurred with FOURNIER J. FOURNIER, J. En vertu du statut 38 Vict. ch. 97 les appelants ont obtenu du parlement du Canada le prill\u00e8ge de construire un pont do p\u00e9age sur la rivi\u00e8re G L'Assomption, dans la paroisse de L'Assomption, \u00e0 1 endroit appel\u00e9 \"portage,\" o\u00f9 cetee rivi\u00e8re est navigable.\nLe statut en leur accordant le droit de construire un pont solide et suffisant \u00e0 la charge de le maintenir et r\u00e9parer \u00e0 leurs frais, les autorise \u00e0 recevoir et exiger les taux de p\u00e9ages sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s dams le dit acte en se conformant aux conditions y mentionn\u00e9es.\nLe privil\u00e8ge accord\u00e9 est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans les termes suivants:\nEn tout temps, tant que \"le dit pont sera tenu en bon \u00e9tat de r\u00e9paration, et ouvert pour l'usage du public, des lors aucune personne quelconque ne pourra \u00e9riger aucun pont on ponts, ni ne pourra faire usage, comme moyens de traverse, de bateaux d'aucune esp\u00e8ce pour le passage d'aucune personne, bestiaux ou voitures quelconques, moyennant retribution sur la distance d'un demimille du pont dans la direction du cours de la rivi\u00e8re et sur la distance de deux milles dans l'autre direction,. et toute personne qui construira un pont de p\u00e9age ou des ponts de p\u00e9age sur la dite rivi\u00e8re dans les dites limites, ou qui traversera des passagers moyennant retribution dans les limites susdites, paiera, en outre des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s que pourront adopter contre lui les dits Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Galarneau et Magloire Cl\u00e9ophas Galarneau devant les tribunaux pour faire d\u00e9truire les dits ponts et faireautrement respecter leur privil\u00e9ge, aux dits Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Galarneau et Magloire Cl\u00e9ophas Galarneau, trois fois la valeur des taux, etc., etc. Et s'il arrivait que le dit pont s'\u00e9croul\u00e2t par accident ou autrement, qu'il fut d\u00e9truit, que sa travers\u00e9e devint dangereuse, on qu'il devint impraticable, les dits Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Galarneau et Magloire Cl\u00e9ophas Galarneau, seront tenus de r\u00e9tablir le dit pont dans les quinze mois \u00e0 dater du jour de l'\u00e9croulement du pont \u00e0 peine d'\u00eatre d\u00e9chus des avantages a eux accordes par le present acte, et pendant le temps que le dit pont sera impraticable et que sa travers\u00e9e sera dangereuse, ils devront entretenir un passage sur la dite rivi\u00e8re, \u00e0 raison duquel ils pourront exiger les p\u00e9ages susdits.\nEn 1883, los appelants ont, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions do ce statut, construit sur la dite rivi\u00e8re L'Assomption, \u00e0 l'endroit appel\u00e9 \" portage,\" un pont, qui fut emport\u00e9 par les glaces. Ce pont ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 reconstruit la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e et entretenu conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi fut de nouveau endommag\u00e9 par la glace dans le printemps de 1885, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 le rendre impraticable. Dans le but de con-' server leur privil\u00e8ge de reconstruire le dit pont dans le d\u00e9lai que leur accorde le statut, les appelants s'empress Crent de se conformer \u00e0 la condition d'entretenir un passage sur la rivi\u00e8re, dans le cas o\u00f9 le pont est devenu impraticable, et l'ont entretenu jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le dit pont e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement r\u00e9par\u00e9 et mis en \u00e9tat d'\u00eatre ouvett au public, ce qui eut lieu longtemps avant l'expiration du d\u00e9lai de quinze mois accord\u00e9 par le statut pour la reconstruciion.\nDaus le mois de juin 1885, pendant que les appelants entretenaient, conform\u00e9ment au dit statut, une traverse suffisante pour les besoins du public, en attendant la reconstruction du pont endommag\u00e9, l'intim\u00e9 a ill\u00e9galement \u00e9rig\u00e9 un pont sur la dite rivi\u00e8re dans les limites du privil\u00e8ge des appelants et a ouvert ce pont au public, en exigeant des p\u00e9ages pour le passage des personnes voitures et bestiaux, au detriment des appelants et en violation de leur privil\u00e8ge exclusif de percevoir des p\u00e9ages dans les limites susmentionn\u00e9es.\nPour obtenir reparation du tort que leur causait l'intim\u00e9, et faire reconna\u00eetre leur privil\u00e8ge exclusif, les appelants intent\u00e8rent leur action en cette cause pour faire ordonner la d\u00e9molition du pont construit par l'intim\u00e9 et lui faire d\u00e9fense de troubler les appelants dans l'exercice de leur privil\u00e8ge et aussi pour faire condamner l'iintim\u00e9 \u00e0 leur payer $100.00 de dommages.\nA cette action l'intim\u00e9 a plaid\u00e9 qu'\u00e9tant resident au village de L'Assomption et propri\u00e9taire d'une terre sur la dite rivilre il est oblig\u00e9 de la traverser souvent et d'y faire traverser ses animaux; qu'apr\u00e8s Ia destruction du pont des appelants il a construit vis-\u00e0-vis sa terre, \u00e0 ses propres frais, un pont temporaire, pour son utilit\u00e9 personnelle, dont ii s'est servi jusqu'au mois de novembre suivant.\nApr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate et audition la cour Sup\u00e9rieure a donn\u00e9 gain de cause \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, et son jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la majorit\u00e9 de la cour du Banc de la Reine.\nLes raisons de ce jugement ne se trouvent que dans les consid\u00e9ranss du jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, qui sont \u00e0 l'effet que l'intim\u00e9 avait droit de construire un pont temporaire, et sont une negation directe et formelle de l'existence du privil\u00e8ge des appelants pendant la reconstruction de leur pont.\nLa preuve a \u00e9tabli d'une mani\u00e8re certaine qu'aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s l'accident les appelants se sont conform\u00e9s \u00e0 la condition qui leur est impos\u00e9e d'entretenir une traverse suffisante pendant la reconstruction, qu'\u00e0 part des accidenss caus\u00e9s par force majeure leur pont a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu en bon \u00e9tat de reparation et ouvert pour l'usage du public. Ils ont aussi prouv\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 a re\u00e7u des profits p\u00e9cuniaires, sous forme de p\u00e9age, de l'exploitation de son pont. Lanegation de ces faits a \u00e9t\u00e9 positivement contredite. La seule question qui s'\u00e9l\u00e9ve en cetee cause est de savoir * si pendant les 15 mois de d\u00e9lai accod\u00e9\u00e9 par le statut pour la reconstruction du pont dans le cas d'accidents, les appelants out encore le privil\u00e8ge d'emp\u00eacher la construction d'aucun pont, dans les limites qui leur sont assign\u00e9es par le statut, en se conformant toutefois \u00e0 la condition de maintenir une traverse tel que le veut le statut en attendant que le pont soit rendu \u00e0 la circulation\nLe jugement dont est appel a ni\u00e9 formellement cette proposition\u2014ainsi que la d\u00e9fense\u2014ce qui a eu l'effet de mettre en question le litre des appelants et partant de rendre la cause appelable comme soulevant une question de titre \u00e0 un immeuble. Cette cause tombe \u00e9videmment sous la section d\u00e9clarant: In any matter which relates to any title to lands or tenements \\where the rights in future might be bound.\netest, partant, appelable \u00e0 cette Cour.\nLa question de droit \u00e0 d\u00e9cider repose enti\u00e8rement sur l'interpr\u00e9tation du statut conf\u00e9rant le privil\u00e9ge dont il est question.\nD'apr\u00e8s la cinqui\u00e8me section, ce privil\u00e8ge doit exister tant que le pont sera en bon \u00e9tat de r\u00e9paration et ouvert au public, et pendant tout ce temps personne ne pourra \u00e9riger aucun pont ni ne pourra faire usage, comme moyen de traverse, de bateaux d'aucune esp\u00e8ce pour le passage des personnes, voitures et bestiaux, moyennant r\u00e9tribution, sur la distance d'un demi mille du pout dans la direction du cours de la. rivilre et sur la distance de deux milles dans l'autre direction. Ce privil\u00e8ge est transmissible aux h\u00e9ritiers et ayans-cause, et doit durer pendant vingt-cinq ans. Ce privil\u00e8ge, qui n'est accord\u00e9 que dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du public, est prot\u00e9ge par l'interdiction de construire aucun pout dans les limites accord\u00e9es et par l'imposition de p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s de trois fois la valeur du taux de p\u00e9age contre ceux qui traverseraient des passagers moyennant r\u00e9tributions La statut leur donne en outre le droit de poursuivre devant les tribunaux pour faire d\u00e9truire les \"ponts qui seraient construits en violation de leur privillge et de faire autrement respecter le dit privil\u00e8ge.\nLa sixi\u00e8me section pourvoit au cas o\u00f9 la communication serait interrompue par accident an pont et declare que dans ce cas les appelants\u2014\nShall be bound to rebuild the said bridge within fifteen months next following the giving away of the said bridge, under penalty of forfeiture of the advantages to them by this article granted, and during the time that the said bridge shall be unsafe or impassable, they shall maintain a ferry across the said river for which they may* recover the tolls aforesaid.\nCette clause loin d'autoriser l'interpr\u00e9tation de 1 cour Sup\u00e9rieure qui justifie la construction temporaire d'un pont par l'intime, pourvoit, au contrarre, \u00e0 la continuation du privil\u00e8ge pendant la construction du pont, en obligeant les appelans \u00e0 le reconstruire dans les quinze mois qui suivront l'accident qui l'aura rendu.F impassable, sous peine de perdre tous les privil\u00e8ges et avantages qui lui sont accord\u00e9s par le statut. Elle l'obige aussi, pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 l'interruption des communications, \u00e0 maintenir une traverse \u2022 pour laquelle elle l'autorise \u00e0 exiger les m\u00eames taux que pour le passage sur le pont. Les appelanss s'\u00e9tant conform\u00e9s \u00e0 cetee condition, leur privil\u00e9ge d'emp\u00eacher la construction d'un pout dans leurs limites n'a pas cess\u00e9 un seul instant. Il doit, d'apr\u00e8s le statut, durer vingt-cinq ans, pourvu que les appelants remplissent les obligations qui leur sont impos\u00e9es. Ils ont fait une preuve compl\u00e8te de l'accomplissement de ces conditions. Si l'iintim\u00e9 avait memo temporairement le droit de construire un pont, ce serait une n\u00e9gation du droit absolu et exclusif des appelants pendant toute la dur\u00e9e qui leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e.\nEn supposant que l'intim\u00e9 n'aurait pas exig\u00e9 de p\u00e9ages sur son pont, il n'en aurait pas moins porte atteinte au privil\u00e8ge des appelants, qui auraient tout de memo le droit d\u0141en demander la demolition pour faire respecter leur privil\u00e8ge.\nCe principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 approu\u00e9\u00e9 par la cour du Banc de la Reine en appel, en 1874, par un jugement unanime, infirmant celui de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure dans la cause de Girard v. B\u00e9langrr et al.\nIl ne para\u00eet pas y avoir de rapport r\u00e9gulier de cette cause, mais on trouve la substance du jugement de la cour d'Appel dans l'ouvrage de feu l'honorable juge Ramsay (Ramsay Appeal Cases) ([1]), o\u00f9 l'honorable juge faitles observations suivantes '.\nWhere a statutory privilege is accorded to construct a toll bridge, and where by the statute according such power it was enacted \" that after said bridge should be open for the public no person should erect or cause to be erected any bridge or bridges or maintain or cause to be maintained any means of communication for the carriage of any person, cattle or carriage whatsoever for hire, across the said branch of the river Yamaska, at the place above mentioned, anywhere within one mile above and one mile and a half below the said bridge, under the penalty of a fine of forty shillings currency for each person, animal or carriage conveyed across the said river on any bridge or means of communication constructed and maintained for hire provided nothing in said act should be constructed to deprive the public of the right of crossing the said river within the limits aforesaid, by fording or in canoes or otherwise without payment.\" A large number of people built a subscription bridge within the limits of the said statutory privilege avowedly with the object of avoiding the use of the toll bridge and depriving the owner of the privilege of his custom. Held that this was an indirect mode of defeating the privilege aforesaid, and that the defendants should be condemned to demolish the bridge by them constructed. Girard v. B\u00e9langer et al. Judgment reversing, September, 1874.\u2014Monk, Taschereau, Ramsay, Sanborn, Belanger, JJ.\nLa doctrine \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans cette decisionest certainement l\u00e9gale et son application \u00e0 la cause actuelle est \u00e9vidente.\nLes appelants sont entr\u00e9s dans une savante dissertation et ont cite un grand nombre d'autorit\u00e9s pour \u00e9tablir qu'ils avaient droit pour la protection de leur privil\u00e8ge, d'emp\u00eacher tout empi\u00e8tement sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 publique dans les limites qui leur sont assign\u00e9es, et qu'ils avaient droit de les faire dispara\u00eetre au moyen de l'action populaire ou en obtenant un bref de prohibition. Il n'\u00e9tait gu\u00e8re utile de ref\u00e9rer \u00e0 toutes ces autorit\u00e9s, car le statut leur donne toute la protection n\u00e9cessaire contre quiconque enfreindrait leurs droits en d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant ce qui suit:\nAnd any person who shall build toll bridge or toll bridges over the said river within the limits aforesaid or shall ferry for hire within the limits aforesaid, shall, without prejudice to any proceeding which may be instituted against him by the said (the appellants) before any court, to cause the said bridge to be destroyed, and to cause their privilege to be otherwise respected.\nCette clause leur ouvre tous les moyens de droit pour la protection de leur propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Bien que Ia preuve alt \u00e9tabli qu'un grand nombre de personnes ait pass\u00e9 sur le pont du d\u00e9fendeur, an prejudice des appelants, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence ceux-ci ont d\u00fb souffrir des dommages; cependant le montant n'en a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin C, l'action ayant pour but principal de faire recona\u00eetre le privil\u00e8ge exclusif des appelants ii ne saurait, dans ces circonstances, \u00eatre accod\u00e9\u00e9 que des dommages nominaux.\nEn cons\u00e9quence, le jugement de cette cour devrait accorder aux appelants les conclusions de leur d\u00e9claration moins la demolition du pout que le d\u00e9fendeur a fait enlever dans l'automne de 1885 et le dit d\u00e9fendeur en outre condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 la somme de $50 de dommages avec int\u00e9r\u00eat et les d\u00e9pens dans les deux causes distraits en faveur du procureur des appelants.\nPATTERSON J. I am unable to understand the statute 38 Vic, chap. 97, in the same way as some of my learned brethren, nor can I see that it ought to mean what they interpret it to mean.\nThe exclusive privilege of maintaining a toll bridge across the River l'Assomption is given to Galarneau, who is protected by the prohibition of all other persons from transporting persons vehicles, &c, across the river for hire, either by bridge or ferry, within the specified limits, so long as the bridge is kept in good repair and open for the use of the public. If the bridge is destroyed or becomes unsafe or impassable Galarneau is bound to restore it within fifteen months on pain of the forfeiture of his privileges, and in the meantime to maintain a ferry\nNow his exclusive privileges are in terms extended only to such times as the bridge is in good repair and open for use to the public. He is bound, it is true, to maintain a ferry while the bridge is not available, but I find no exclusive privilege attached to that nor do I perceive on what public principle there should be such an exclusive privilege. The object of the monopoly is the bridge. The consideration for it is the providing a bridge, not a ferry. The privilege connected with the bridge being preserved to the grantee during the time, not exceeding fifteen months, when there is no bridge there, it is reasonable that he should during the time furnish the public with a ferry which, though not so useful as a bridge, is the best temporary substitute. That is the price of the maintenance of the monopoly given in respect of the bridge, which monopoly, by the terms of the statute as I read them, is suspended while the bridge is not available, but becomes again operative when the bridge is restored.\nThat seems to me the plain reading of the statute, and I do not see why it should be otherwise, or why as soon as the bridge is gone, any one should not be at liberty to build another and use it until the toll bridge is restored. The public was to have a bridge. That was the object and excuse of the monopoly, and I should be surprised to find the statute forbidding the temporary use of another bridge, which temporary use might become permanent if the fifteen months elapsed without the other being restored.\nI think this appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants : M. E. Charpentier.\nSolicitors for respondent : McConville & Renaud.\n[1] P. 550 et seq.\n"}

Bail was given and special bail entered in due course but the bail-piece was not filed, nor judgment entered against J., for some months after. On application to a judge in chambers an order was made for the discharge of the bail on account of delay in entering up judgment, and the full court refused to set aside such order. An appeal was brought to the Supreme Court of Canada entitled in the suit against J., from the judgment of the fall court, and the bond for security for costs was given to J.\nHeld,\u2014That as the bail, the only parties really interested in the appeal, were not before the court and not entitled to the benefit of the bond, the appeal must be quashed for want of proper security.\nHeld also, that the appeal would not lie as the matter was simply one of practice, in the discretion of the court below.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick refusing to rescind an order made by a judge in chambers ordering an exoneretur to be entered on the bail-piece and the bail discharged.\nAn action by Scammell Bros. against James was commenced by writ of capias and defendant appeared, gave bail, and entered special bail in due course. The condition of the bail bond was that the judgment should be satisfied or the defendant would not leave or be absent from the Province within six months after judgment without leave of the court or a judge. No defence was offered to the action, and judgment was signed but not for some months after the entry of special bail. Application was made to a judge in chambers to have the bail discharged for delay in entering up judgment which was granted. The plaintiffs moved the full court to have the judge's order rescinded, which was refused, and an appeal was brought to the Supreme Court of Canada. Such appeal was brought as in the original suit against J. and the bond for security for costs was given to J.\nMcLeod Q.C. and C.A. Palmer for the appellants cited, on the question of jurisdiction, Kandick v. Morrison[1], Gladwin v. Cummings[2], Jones v. Tuck[3], and offered, if necessary, to procure another bond in favor of the bail.\nJack for the respondent was not called on.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The majority of the court are of opinion that the case is not appealable. As for myself I cannot get over the difficulty as to the bond. We have no evidence that the bail knew anything of the proceedings in this appeal or took any part in them. The factum is signed by counsel for the respondent and all the proceedings are in his name. The parties really interested are not before us and have no security for costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I think the want of security is fatal to this appeal. The bail have never had a word of notice. The respondent is the defendant in the original action, the bond is given to him and he is the only person who can avail himself of it. The factum, too, is signed by the counsel for the respondent. The proceeding, therefore, is one in which the real parties are not before us. As to substituting a proper bond in favor of the bail for the one given, that is out of the question, as the time for giving security has elapsed. I also doubt whether the judgment appealed from is a final judgment. I am inclined to consider it a mere matter of practice in which the decision of the court below should be binding. We have in this court to deal with different systems of practice with which the judges of the court below are much more familiar than we can possibly be. In refusing to consider such matters we simply obey the provision of the statute requiring us to follow the practice of the Privy Council when no rule is laid down by the statute itself.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am not prepared to hold that this is not a final judgment. I think it is conclusive, and as to the bond I should be glad if it could be rectified. If the bail knew of it, and accepted it, and came here to argue it, I do not see why we might not hear them.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014 I agree with what has been said as to our not having jurisdiction and cannot see that this is an appealable case. An appeal only lies from a final judgment, which is defined as \"any judgment, rule, order or decision whereby the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding is finally determined and concluded.\" I do not see how we can read these words \"or other judicial proceeding\" so as to include a collateral matter in some other action. There may be no other remedy, but the court below must have control of its own practice and have full power to deal with such cases as these[4].\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: C.

In 1879 C. who had acquired the interests of his co-owners retro-ceded the lot in question to D. In July, 1884. the sheriff of the district at the instance of J. M. D. et al., (appellants) judgment creditors of C. seized, sold and adjudicated the lot in question to G. et al who paid the adjudication and obtained a sheriff's title to the lot in question. D. did not register her deed of retrocession until 3rd October 1884, being a date subsequent to the seizure and sale by the sheriff, but prior to the registration of the deed from the sheriff.\nThereupon D. by a petition en nullit\u00e9 en d\u00e9cret prayed that the seizure, sale adjudication and sheriff's title be set aside and declared null as having been made super non domino. At the trial it was proven that from the date of the deed of retrocession D. had been assessed for the lot in question and paid taxes thereon, and that it was in the possession of one McA. as her tenant at the time of the seizure\nHeld,\u2014Affirming the judgment of the court below, that the seizure and sale in the present instance having been made super non domino et non possidente the sheriff's title was null. Art. 632 C. C. P.\nPer Taschereau J.\u2014The provisions of Arts. 2090 and 2091 C. C. refer to a valid seizure and sale and cannot be invoked against the registration of the deed of retrocession by the respondent.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court by which the appellants' contestation of respondent's petition en nullit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cret was dismissed. This case originated out of a judicial sale of a lot of land, situate in the city of Montreal, belonging to respondent, under a judgment in favor of the appellants against the vacant estate of one Campbell for the sum of $8,388.00.\nThe lot of land in question was sold by the Sheriff of Montreal at the instance of appellants who represented the same, as belonging to the vacant estate of said Campbell, to which one Benjamin Clement had been appointed curator.\nThe resp dent by petition to the Superior Court sitting at Montreal, prayed for and obtained the set-ting aside of the sheriff's decree\nThe circumstances under which the petition to annul the decree was granted are as follows:\nRespondent acquired in February, 1859, by good and valid title a lot of land fronting on Papineau road, subsequently entered upon the cadastre (official plan and book of reference) of St. Mary's Ward of the City of Montreal under the No. 857.\nOn the 19th of November 1874 respondent sold this lot of land to William A. Campbell, Joseph Moise Dufresne and Sim\u00e9on Pagnuelo, who acquired the same, jointly and severally, for the sum of $7,000.00, on which she received $3,000.00, in cash, said purchasers binding themselves to pay the balance of $4000 00, with interest, within ten years from the date of the deed.\nOn the 22nd December 1875 with the consent of Sim\u00e9on Pagnuelo, Joseph Moise Dufresne in first instance, and later on the 1st August 1877 of the said Sim\u00e9on Pagnuelo, sold their respective shares in the said lot of land to their co-purchaser William A. Campbell who undertook to satisfy all the conditions and undertakings of their deed of the 19th November 1874, and more particularly to pay for them to the respondent their share of the balance of the purchase money ($4,000 00).\nOn the same day (1st August, 1877) that the said Sim\u00e9on Pagnuelo thus sold his rights in the said lot of land respondent by another deed executed between her and the said William A. Campbell, agreed to reduce in his favor the said balance of $4000 00 to the sum of $3,000.00 of which last amount the lot of land was to remain mortgaged in favor of respondent.\nSubsequently, on the 22nd April, 1879, William A. Campbell being unable to pay the balance of $3,000.00, and wishing to relieve himself, as well as Dufresne and Pagnuelo, from their liability for said amount, executed another deed in favor of respondent, whereby he retroceded the lot of land in question to respondent, who immediately took possession thereof and continued to occupy and enjoy the same. This deed was duly registered on the 28th of November 1884.\nOn the 27th of June, 1884, the appellants (who are the identical Joseph Moise Dufresne and Sim\u00e9on Pagnuelo, above referred. to) obtained against one Benjamin Cl\u00e9ment, in his quality of curator to the vacant estate of the said William A Campbell who had recently died, a judgment for the sum of $8,388.00, and proceeded to issue execution under said judgment by order of their attorneys, of whom Mr. Pagnuelo, above mentioned was one. They instructed the Sheriff of Montreal to accept from B. Cl\u00e9mentes-qualit\u00e9 a return of nulla bona and ordered him to proceed to the seizure of several immovables, and amongst others the lot of land now in question which had been retroceded, by W. A. Campbell to respondent, on the 22nd April 1879 as well for his benefit as in the interest of the appellants.\nOn the 25th of July 1884 the sheriff seized the lot of land in question but failed to furnish the registrar of the Registration Division of Montreal-East, wherein said lot of land is situate, with the legal notification required by the Statute 43-44 Vict. ch. 25 sects. 3, 5 and 14.\nOn the 3rd of October, 1884, date of the sheriff's sale, said lot of land was adjudicated to Simeon Pagnuelo, already referred to, for the sum of $1,400.00; but he haying declared, as appears by the proc\u00e8s-verbal of he sale, that there was an error in his bid, the property was adjudged to one George W. Parent, for the sm of $1,350.00.\nSeven months after this adjudication, on the 4th of My, 1885, George W. Parent transferred his right of adjudication to the mis-en-cause Alphonse Racine, Thomas Grauthier and Cl\u00e9ophas Beausoleil, who paid the sheriff the adjudication price and obtained their title; and then for the first time respondent was informed that her property had been seized sold and adjudicated at the instance of Joseph Moise Dufresne and Si\u00e9on Pagnuelo.\nThe respondent by her petition to the Superior Court pyed that she be declared to be the true and lawful proprietor of the lot of land in question, and that the seizure, sale, adjudication and sheriff's title granted under the circumstances above mentioned, be set aside a declared null; that the decree be quashed as having len made super non domino, and respondent maintained her possession and proprietorship of the lot of land question notwithstanding said decree.\nPagnuelo C. for appellant contended,\u2014that an un-registered sale of real estate such as the deed of retrocession by Canbell to respondent in this case, is incomplete, Without effect and confers no right of ownership to the buyer against a seizing creditor of the vendor, and that the registration of the deed of sale of such real estate after seizure has no effect when the seizure is followed by judicial expropriation, and cited and commented on Art. 2090, 2091, 2082 C.C.; Arts. 644, 646,597, 652 C.

C. followed on behalf of the appellants and contended: that the respondent had been guild of laches and that under art. 2083 C.C. she could not aim any right to the property against Campbell's creditors until she registered her title, and submitted that under art. 632 C. C. P. the seizure was good as Cambell's estate had remained in possession; toward' third parties, and was in possession animo domino at the time of the seizure.\nThe learned counsel also contended that le judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench should reversed because, supposing respondent to have been proprietor and in possession of the said lot of land, le should have opposed the sale within the time first by law; and in default of so doing, her rights ownership resolve themselves into a privileged claim upon the proceeds of the sale; 1st, because W. A. Campbell's vacant succession was bankrupt, and registration of a deed of sale after bankruptcy was illegal and has no effect; 2nd, because appellants, by registering a demand of separation de patrimoine, secured a privilege on the real estate in question which rendered ineffective the subsequent registration of the respondent's deed of sale, and which could not be affected by such subsequent registration; 3rd, because, supposing that respondent secured against the appellants a right of ownership by registering her deed of sale after the sheriff's sale she should at least pay the costs of the seizure and sale by the sheriff and all damages caused to appellants by such tardy and late registration.\nLacoste Q. C. and Grenier for respondent contended; 1st that the evidence in the case already established the fact that the seizure had been made super non domino et non possidente and consequently was a nullity.

P.\nAnd 2nd that the registration by the respondent of her title (the deed of retrocession by Campbell) sub-sequent to the seizure and sale by the sheriff but prior to the emission of the sheriff's title, and consequently to its registration, is valid as against the claims of the purchasers at sheriff's sale.

Par des actes de 1875 et de 1877, Messieurs Dufresne et Pagnuelo vendirent leur part \u00e0 leur co-propri\u00e9taire Campbell, \u00e0 la charge par ce dernier de payer \u00e0 Madame Dixon, l'Intim\u00e9e, la balance du prix de vente originaire, $4,000.\nLe 1er ao\u00fbt 1877, par une transaction entre Campbell et Mme Dixon cette derni\u00e8re consentit \u00e0 r\u00e9duire cette balance de $4000 \u00e0 $3000 en conservant son hypoth\u00e8que pour cette somme sur l'immeuble en question.\nEn 1879, Campbell, se trouvant incapable de payer \u00e0 Madame Dixon la balance de $3000, a fait acte de r\u00e9trocession de l'immeuble \u00e0 la condition de lib\u00e9rer Messieurs Campbell, Pagnuelo et Dufresne, les appelants cette cause, de la dette en question.\nCampbell est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 plus tard et Benjamin Cl\u00e9ment a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 curateur \u00e0 sa succession vacante.\nEn 1884, les appelants, Dufresne et Pagnuelo, ayant obtenu jugement contre le curateur Cl\u00e9ment firent saisir l'immenble en question qui fut adjuge, le 3 octobre 1884\u00e0 M. Pagnuelo et par d\u00e9claration d'erreur dans l'ench\u00e8re, Geo. W.

Racine, Gauthier et Beausoleil, qui ont pay\u00e9 alors le prix d'adjudication, et auxquels le sh\u00e9rif accorda un titre.\nLa preuve a \u00e9tabli de la mani\u00e8re la plus positive que pendant les cinq ann\u00e9es qui out pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la saisie, l'intim\u00e9e (Maria Dixon) a \u00e9t\u00e9 seule ouvertement et publiquement en possession de l'immeuble en question en cette cause. C'est elle dont le nom est porte sur le role de cotisation de la cite de Montr\u00e9al comme propri\u00e9taire, et c'est aussi elle qui en a acquitt\u00e9 toutes les taxes pendant cette p\u00e9riode.\nPendant ces cinq ann\u00e9es, le t\u00e9moin McAvoy a prouv\u00e9 qu'il avait occup\u00e9 cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 comme locataire de l'intim\u00e9e.\nLe curateur, interrog\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il n'avait jamais fait aucun acte de possession de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ni d'aucune autre appartenant \u00e0 Campbell.\nCette preuve qui n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 nullement contredite \u00e9tablit comme une certitude le fait que le curateur \u00e0 la succession u'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 en possession de cet immeuble, qui n'est pas sorti de celle de l'intim\u00e9e depuis qu'elee en est redevenue propri\u00e9taire par l'acte de r\u00e9trocession que Campbell lui en avait consenti en 1879.\nL'article 632 C.

C., est \u00e9videmment fait pour rencontrer ce cas:\nOn ne peut, dit cet article, saisir les immeubles que sur la personne condamn\u00e9e qui les poss\u00e8de ou est r\u00e9put\u00e9e les poss\u00e9der animo domini.\nLa cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 unanime \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer la saisie en cette cause nulle comme faite contrairement \u00e0 la disposition de cet article\nA l'appui de cette d\u00e9cision, l'autorit\u00e9 suivante de Verdier ([34]) a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e: Par cons\u00e9quent, si l'on suppose que la vente a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la saisie, il est certain que celle-ci est radicalement nulle, puisqu'elle porte sur un bien qui n'\u00e9tait plus dans le patrimoine du d\u00e9biteur. La transcription qui surviendrait ne saurait donner la vie \u00e0 un acte qui est mort-n\u00e9 selon l'expression de M. Dalloz. Elle ne saurait avoir aucune efficacit\u00e9. La saisie, nulle dans l'origine, est comme non avenue. Si la saisie a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la vente la position est la m\u00eame, et les r\u00e9sultats sont identiques. Tant que la saisie n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 transcrite, elle n'enl\u00e8ve pas au saisi le droit de vendre. D\u00e8s lors, s'il a us\u00e9 de cette facult\u00e9, la vente a pour effet imm\u00e9diat de le d\u00e9sinvestir, ainsi que ses ayant-cause. Or, le saisissant, n'ayant aucun droit r\u00e9el qui lui soit propre et ind\u00e9pendant de celui du saisi, n'est qu'un ayant-cause; il est bien oblig\u00e9 de subir la vente. La saisie, dit M. Dalloz, a \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9e de mort par cette vente: son objet lui a \u00e9chapp\u00e9; d\u00e8s lors, la transcription n'a Pu lui rendre ult\u00e9rieurement la vie qu'elle a perdue.\nJe suis d'avis de confirmer le jugement de la cour du Banc de la Reine avec d\u00e9pens.\nTASCHEREAU J \u2014The Superior Court in Montreal granted this petition and annulled the sale thereof on the ground inter alia that the seizure and sale had been made suv6r non domino. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed that judgment\nI am of opinion that these judgments were right. There can be no question as to the law. \" The seizure of immovables\" says Art. 632 C.C.P. \"can only be made against the judgment debtor\" and \" he must be or be reputed to be in possession of the same animo domini.\nPothier Civil Procedure says ([35]).\nOn ne peut saisir r\u00e9ellement que sur la personne qui s'est oblig\u00e9e par l'acte ou qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9e par le jugement en vertu duquel on saisit, car toute ex\u00e9cution cesse par la mort de l'oblig\u00e9 ou condamn\u00e9.\nLa saisie r\u00e9elle doit se faire sur le propri\u00e9taire de l'h\u00e9ritage, une saisie faite super nom domino est nulle. Observez n\u00e9anmoins qu'on entend par propri\u00e9taire, non pas seulement celui qui l'est dans la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 mais encore celui qui poss\u00e8de l'h\u00e9ritage animo dominii soit qu'il en soit v\u00e9ritablement propri\u00e9taire, soit qu'il ne le soit pas, car il est r\u00e9put\u00e9 l'\u00eatre, lorsque le v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire ne r\u00e9clame point. Bugnet in a note on above, says ([36]):\nContre le propri\u00e9taire apparent. sauf le droit de revendication de la part du propri\u00e9taire v\u00e9ritable, qui pourra m\u00eame, en regie generale, demander la nullit\u00e9 de l'adjudication. L'adjudicataire (sur saisie immobili\u00e8re) ne transmet \u00e0 l'adjudicataire d'autres droits \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que ceux appartenant au saisi.\nPigeau ([37]) and D'H\u00e9ricourt ([38]) are also in support of respondent's contention; and Guyot ([39]) says:\nLorsqu'un immeuble a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi r\u00e9ellement sur celui qui n'en \u00eatait pas propri\u00e9taire et que celui a qui il appartenait en est reste paisible possesseur jusqu'\u00e0 l'adjudication, la saisie r\u00e9elle, les cri\u00e9es et l'adjudication ne peuvent faire aucun pr\u00e9judice au v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire, car pour qu'un bien puisse \u00eatre valablement adjug\u00e9 par d\u00e9cret, il faut qu'il soit devenu le gage de la justice et des cr\u00e9anciers de la partie saisie.\nNow as to the evidence in this case the two courts below have found as a matter of fact that the curator to the estate, Campbell, upon whom the sale was made was not then in possession of the immovable in question; and the evidence fully supports that finding of fact. The curator himself, examined as a witness, admits that he never made any act of possession of that property.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs\nI do not allude to the question of registration raised by the appellant as, in my opinion, it cannot affect this case. Even if Mrs. Dixon had never registered the deed of retrocession she would be entitled to get this seizure and sale set aside. Art. 2091 C C. refers to a valid seizure a lawful sale. Here we hold that there has been no sale, that the so-called sale is a nullity.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Pagnuelo, Taillon, Bonin & Duffault.\nSolicitors for respondent: Curran & Grenier.\n[1] No. 318.\n[2] Vol. 2 No. 445.\n[3] 29 Vol. No. 159.\n[4] No. 22.\n[5] 22 L.

J. Ritchie, C.J., and Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nAppeal\u2014Expropriation of land\u2014Order by judge in chambers as to moneys deposited\u2014R.S.G. oh. 135 sec. 28\u201443 Vic. ch. 9, sec. 9, sub-sec. 31 \u2014 Persona designata\u2014R.S.C. ch. 109 sec. 88 sub-secs. 26 and 31.\nThe College of Ste. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se having petitioned for an order for payment to them of a sum of $4,000 deposited by the appellants as security for land taken for railway purposes, a judge of the Superior Court in chambers after formal answer and hearing of the parties granted the order under the Railway Act, R. S. C. ch. 109, sec. 8 sub-sec. 31. The railway company appealed against this order to the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side) and that court affirmed the decision of the judge of the Superior Court.\nHeld, that the order in question having been made by a judge sitting in chambers, and, further, acting under the statute as a persona designata, the proceedings had not originated in a Superior Court within the meaning of section 28 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, and the case was therefore not appealable.\nPer Gwynne and Patterson JJ. That an abandonment of a notice to take lands for railway purposes must take place while the notice is still a notice and before the intention has been exercised by taking the lands. R. S. C. ch. 109, sec. 8 sub-sec. 26.\nThat the proper mode of enforcing an award of compensation made under the Railway Act is by an order from the judge.\nQucere\u2014Whether sub-sec. 34 of sec. 8 of ch. 109 R.S.C. permits possession to be given before the price is fixed and paid of any land except land on which some work of construction is to be at once proceeded with. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench confirming a judgment of the Superior Court at Terrebonne, granting a petition of the respondents for the payment to them of a deposit of $4,000, made by the appellants in the Bank of Montreal under the provisions of the Railway Act R. S. C. ch. 109, the petitioners claiming the right to be paid under an award of arbitrators rendered in certain expropriation proceedings between the parties under the said act.\nThe litigation in question in this case arose out of proceedings taken by the railway company to expropriate a piece of land to be used as a gravel pit. The company gave a notice of expropriation on the 18th August, 1886, expropriating the piece of land in question, and subsequently applied to the court under section 9 sub-section 38 of the Consolidated Railway Act 1879 (sec. 9 Revised Statutes of Canada ch. 109) for a warrant of possession, and deposited, in accordance with the order of the judge granting the warrant, the sum of $4,000 in the Bank of Montreal, as security under the provisions of the last mentioned section. Arbitrators were appointed on both sides and a third arbitrator chosen, and the arbitration proceedings went on; and the proprietors, respondents here, seemed to have closed their evidence, when, on the 11th Oct. 1887 a notice of discontinuance was served upon the proprietors and upon the arbitrators, under the provisions of sub-section 26 of section 8 by which notice the appellants declared they abandoned and desisted from the notice of expropriation, and from all proceedings for the expropriation of the property mentioned therein, declaring their willingness to pay to the respondents all damages and costs by them incurred in consequence of such notice and abandonment; and on the 14th of October the railway company served a notaries notice upon the respondents setting out the fact of their discontinuance, and that tile railway company were removing from the property of the respondents their rails, plant and other materials, in order to restore the possession to them, and notifying the respondents that the railway company abandoned the j possession and occupation of the land in question, and offering to pay all damages together with the value of the use and occupation of the property while in possession of the company, and all costs incurred in the expropriation proceedings. The company took possession but on account of a verbal error made in the first notice of abandonment as to the date of the notice of expropriation a second notice of abandonment was served upon the proprietors and the arbitrators on the 22nd October, and on the same day a second notaries notification and protest was served upon the proprietors, respondents here, setting out all the facts in connection with the case and tendering to the respondents, in full payment of all damages and costs incurred by them, $2,500.\nOn the 25th October, the appellants' instituted an action setting out all the facts in connection with the expropriation proceedings, whereby they declared their willingness to pay the costs and damages incurred by the proprietors, and renewed their tender of $2,500, further praying that it be declared that the functions of the arbitrators had ceased by the service of the notice of abandonment, and that they be prohibited and enjoined from further proceeding with the arbitration. Notwithstanding these proceedings, the arbitrators proceeded to and did render their award on the 27th October by which they gave to the seminary, respondents here $7,500 as indemnity for the land taken by the company and for all loss and damage resulting from its expropriation. Immediately thereafter the company, appellants fyled an incidental or supplementary demand to their action already taken, by which they asked that their award should be declared illegal and invalid and be set aside.\nThe respondents subsequently presented the petition praying that an order should issue to the Bank of Montreal to pay to them the said sum of $4000 in accordance with the terms and in part payment of the award. It is from the judgment granting this petition that the appeal was taken.\nH. Abbott Q.C. for appellants.\n[The learned counsel having stated the nature of the appeal the court raised a question as to their jurisdiction, for the reasons\u20141st, that the original cause of action did not arise in a Superior Court; 2nd, that it was not a final judgment; 3rd, that it was a matter within the judicial discretion of the judge; and counsel was requested to argue the question of jurisdiction.]\nThe statute requires the order to be made by a judge of a Superior Court, and in the Province of Quebec the judicial act of a judge in chambers is the act of the court. Then as an appeal lies to the Court of Appeal in the Province of Quebec it will lie to this court. Wilkins v. Geddes ([1]); Shields v. Peak ([2]); Chevallier v. Guvillier ([3]); Philbrick v. Ont. & Quebec Ry. Co. ([4]); McKinnon v. Kerouack ([5])\nThis order finally disposes of the right to the money in the bank which is a substantial matter between the parties, and it is a final judgment as to that money under the Supreme Court Act. Herring v. Napanee & Tamworth Ry. Co. ([6]); Re Leach ([7]); Horton v. The Canada Central Ry. Co ([8])\nThis is not a matter of judicial discretion. The judge must either make or refuse the order. He could not make a conditional order or impose terms.\nThen as to the merits. The statute expressly gives a right to abandon the expropriation, and reading sections eight and nine together, it is clear that it applies as well in case of land taken for materials as for a road bed, and as well after taking possession as before it. Grimshaw v. G. T. R. Co ([9]) * Moore v. Central Ontario By. Co, ([10]); Cawthra v. Hamilton & Erie Ry. Co. ([11]). At common law appellants had a right to discontinue their proceedings in expropriation without regard to the provisions of the Railway Act, Foisy & D\u00e8ry ([12]); Dillon's Municipal Corporations ([13]); Hudson R.R. Co. v. Cutwater ([14]); in re Anthony Street ([15]); in re wall Street ([16]) * in re Commissioners of Washington Park ([17]); People v. Trustees of Brooklyn ([18]); Mayor v. Musgrave ([19]); Cripps on Compensation ([20]).\nS. Pagnuelo Q.C for respondent.\nThe order as to the money in the bank is to be made by a judge as persona designata. The statute might have directed any person to make the order and the fact of the person being a judge cannot make his act the act of the court.\nThe judge in making the order must exercise his discretion and sec 27 of the Supreme Court Act therefore prohibits an appeal from his decision.\nThis is not a final judgment, for if the award should be set aside the court would then rescind the order and direct repayment of the money.\nOn the merits we contend the order was properly made. It is only in extra judicial awards, that is, where the submission is voluntary that an action is required, here no action on the award was necessary. Arts. 341, 345, 1343, C. C. P.\nUnder the statute only the notice' and not the expropriation itself, can be abandoned, and, moreover, the abandonment contemplated is only in case of the land , being required for a road bed and not when it is for material otherwise the land might be made valueless and the owner have no redress.\nThe owner has a right to compensation in the manner prescribed by the statute for what he has virtually sold, and cannot be deprived of such right by a mere notice of intention to abandon. Art. 1472 C. C. and pothier Vente ([21]).\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE, C.J.\u2014I think this appeal should be quashed on the ground that a judge in chambers in Quebec, before whom the proceedings originated, is not a Superior Court, and therefore the case is not appealable. And I also think that under the Railway Act the judge is a persona designata.\nFOURNIER. J. was of the same opinion.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This appeal must be quashed on two distinct grounds:\u2014\n1. The so called judgment rendered in first instance was merely an order by a judge in chambers. Now no appeal lies to this court but from a judgment rendered in first instance by a court. A judge in chambers does not constitute a court\n2. Under the Railway Act, the judge and not the court has exclusive jurisdiction in the matters now in contestation\nGWYNNE J. concurs with PATTERSON J PATTERSON J.\u2014On the 17th of August, 1886, the company gave notice, under sub-section 38 of the 9th section of the Consolidated Railway Act, 1879, (which sub-section forms section 9 of the Railway Act in R.S. C. ch. 109) of intention to take land of the respondent for the purpose of obtaining gravel, &c, mentioning the price of $100 an acre, and naming an arbitrator to act in case the offer was not accepted. That arbitrator resigned and the company appointed another in his place. On the first of October following, the company obtained an order to enable possession to be at once taken, and on the same day took possession, paying into a bank $4,000 as security in pursuance of the order.\nOn the 28th of October 1886, the two arbitrators appointed by the parties being unable to agree upon a third an order was made by a judge appointing a third arbitrator.\nNearly a year later, namely on the 11th of October, 1887 the company who had in the meantime exhausted the deposit of gravel and found it less in quantity than had been supposed gave notice of abandonment of the notice of August 1886 following up that step by a formal notice given through the agency of a notary, on the 14th of October, and by a tender, also made by the notary on the 22nd of October of $2,500 as compensation for damages sustained. The arbitrators had not yet made their award. They, or rather a majority of them, made an award on the 27th of October, 1887, assessing $7,000 as the price to be paid by the company.\nThe company had three days earlier, viz., on the 24th of October, 1887, instituted proceedings to restrain the arbitrators from making an award, on the ground of the abandonment of the notice, and those proceedings were afterwards made to include a prayer to have the award declared void. The plaintiff, on the 2nd of December, 1887, petitioned for an order for payment to him of the $4,000 deposit and, after formal answer by the company and hearing the parties the order asked for was made by a judge, and an appeal against it to the Court of Queen's Bench was dismissed.\nFrom that decision the company appeals to this court.\nIt is argued on the part of the respondent that the provision authorizing the abandonment of the notice of intention to expropriate lands applies only to lands intended to be used for the railway, and not to lands required for gravel, sand, earth or water under section 9 or the former sub-section 38, and the court below seems to have adopted that construction of the statute.\nThe soundness of that view is seriously questioned, but leaving the discussion of that aspect of the question aside for the present, it is in my judgment very clear that under the circumstances of the transaction before us, the abandonment of the original notice was unauthorized and was entirely nugatory. The fallacy of the argument to the contrary, and as 1 respectfully venture to submit, of opinions expressed in one or two cases in Upper Canada which have been cited to us, arises from want of sufficiently close attention to the language of the statute, which is essentially and almost literally the same as in the General Railway Act of the late Province of Canada 14 and 15 Vic., ch. 51, Con. Stats. Can., ch. 66, and in the Railway Act of Ontario.\nWhat is the notice that the statutes require? It is in the first place and principally a notice of the intention of the company to take land or to exercise some power. Subsidiary to this main object there is the offer to pay for it a certain price with further intimation, conditional on the non-acceptance of the price offered, of the appointment of an arbitrator. The arbittration which, may follow does so by virtue of the statutory mandate.\nThe notice is not correctly styled, as I find it styled in some of the papers before us, a notice to arbitrate. It is a notice of intention to expropriate land or to exercise some power of the company. The rule of the statute, when no special reason for taking the land at an earlier day exists is that the land cannot be taken until the - price has been fixed either by agreement or by arbitration and paid. Upon such payment \u201cthe award or agreement shall vest in the company the power forthwith to take possession of the lands, or to exercise the right, or to do the thing for which such compensation or annual rent has been awarded or agreed upon.\" Sec. 8, subs. 80 R. S. C. ch. 109.\nWhen all this has been done and the land taken, the intention of which notice was given being carried out, the notice disappears. It has served its purpose and is effete.\nSubs. 26 '. \u201cAny such notice for lands as aforesaid (mark the expression; it is notice for lands, not notice to arbitrate)\u2014may be abandoned and a new notice given with regard to the same or other lands and to the same or any other person; but in any case the liability to the person first notified for all damages or costs by him incurred in consequence of such first notice and abandonment shall subsist.\"\nThis abandonment of the notice for lands, or notice of intention to take lands must take place while the notice is still a notice and before the intention has been executed by taking the lands.\nThe abandonment is of the notice, not of the lands, and the damages and costs to which the company remains liable are those consequent on the notice and the abandonment of the notice. Mark again the language\u2014There is not an allusion to damages caused by taking and holding possession of lands that are afterwards abandoned.\nWhen the company becomes entitled, by performance of the condition precedent of paying the price, to take the lane, a judge may, if necessary, issue a warrant to a bailiff to put the company m possession.\nSec. 31:\nSuch warrant may also be granted by the judge, without such award or agreement, on affidavit to his satisfaction that immediate possession \u201cof the lands or of the power to do the thing mentioned in the notice, is necessary to carry on some part of the railway with which the company is ready to proceed.\nThen follow provisions for paying money as security into a bank under direction of the judge, which is not to be repaid to the company or paid to the landowner without an order from the judge, which he may make in accordance with the terms of the award.\nWhen land is taken under this provision in anticipation of the award, but only after payment of a sum supposed to be sufficient to cover the price ultimately awarded, the effect upon the right to abandon the notice appears to me to be precisely the same as in the ordinary case where the land is not taken until after the award.\nThe warrant can be issued only when the land is required for immediate use in carrying on some part of the railway with which the company is ready to proceed The intention to take it to \" do the thing mentioned in the notice,\" as it is expressed with careful adherence to the main object of the notice is carried out and the notice ceases in this as in the other case to exist as a notice. The money may turn out less or more than the price fixed by the award. That contingency touches only the skill in estimating the amount ordered to be deposited. The principle is that the land is to be paid for before it is taken, and that principle is acted on when possession is given under these provisions before the award as well as when the award precedes the taking of possession. The right to abandon the notice after possession is taken cannot, in the one case anymore than in the other be found either in the reading of sub-section 26 or the reason of the enactment. \"The thing mentioned in the notice\" has * been done.\nThe cases referred to in which a difference of opinion was intimated are Grimshaw V. The Grand Trunk Ry. Go. ([22]) and Moore V. Central Ontario Ry. Co. ([23]). The latter of these was decided on the authority of the former, which apart from the respect due to the eminent judges whose decision it was, would be followed as a matter of course in any court of first instance in the province.\nIn both cases, as I understand the reports, possession had been taken by the railway company whose right to desist from its notice before the making of the award was nevertheless affirmed. But I do not understand that in either of the cases possession had been taken under the statutory title acquired by force of the provisions of the provincial acts corresponding to those now in discussion, after paying or securing the price and obtaining the judge's warrant.\nThere is certainly reason to infer from the language of Sir J. B. Robinson in Grimshaw's case, that in his opinion possession, even if taken in pursuance of the st\u00e1tutable permission, would not destroy the right to desist from the notice, and that opinion appears to have been assented to by Sir M. C. Cameron in Moore's case. I may say, however, without at all impugning the correctness of the judgment of the court in either of those cases that the considerations on which I have dwelt and which seem to me to show the fallacy of the views expressed upon the particular point cannot as I apprehend, have been brought to the attention of the learned judges, and that the construction which appears to me to give proper effect to the provision touching \" desisting \" from the notice, as it was originally called, or a abandoning\" the notice which is the equivalent expression in the Dominion Statute, would possibly have been adopted, if the point had been so material as to call for the closer examination of the statute which this case has required\nIn this case the company went far beyond merely taking possession. A considerable part of the property has been deported and distributed as ballast along the line, so that restoration of possession is impossible. Tress have also been cut down and destroyed.\nThese are striking changes in the character of land taken, but they are strictly of the nature contemplated by the statute when it confines the right to this early possession to cases where the land is necessary for immediate use in some work of construction which the company is ready to proceed with, and which may be a cutting which removes the land or an embankment which buries it. This palpable contemplation of a speedy change, which will make it impossible for the company by retiring from possession to restore what was taken in its former condition, strongly confirms the construction of sub-section 26 as applying only when the notice has not been acted on by taking possession\nThe company must therefore fail on the fundamental point of the right, under the circumstances, to abandon the notice, and the judgment of the court below must be affirmed, if the judgment is appealable to this court. In my opinion it is more than doubtful whether the matter was properly before the Court of Queen's Bench or is properly before us. The complaint is of the action of a judge of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec in making the order for the payment to the land owner of $4,000 deposited as security under section 9, sub-sectoin 31. which sum is less than the amount awarded by the 'arbitrators as compensation for the land and damages.\nThe question as to jurisdiction is whether the proceeding is in the Superior Court or merely the act of the judge as one of a class of persons designated by the statute for the particular duty.\nSec. 8 defines the expression \" court \" in that section as meaning a superior court of the district or province in which the lands are situate, and the expression '' judge '' as meaning judge of such superior court. By the general Interpretation Act ([24]) the expression \" superior court' means in the Province of Ontario the Court of Appeal for Ontario and the High Court of Justice for Ontario * in the Province of Quebec the Court of Queen's Bench and the Superior Court in and for the said Province,\" and so on.\nIn section 8 various functions are assigned to \u201cthe judge.\" He may appoint a surveyor ([25]), or an arbitrator ([26]) * issue a warrant to give possession to the company of land paid for according to the terms of an award ([27]); grant a warrant for immediate possession to the company before award of compensation (4); fix fix the amount to be paid in by way of security (4); and after award make an order for payment out of the money ([28]).\nAll these functions may be exercised by any judge of any of the courts embraced by the definition of the expression s superior courts.\" They are functions which from their nature and object must be intended to be exercised in a summary manner and not liable to the delay incident to the appeals from court to court. From these considerations, as well as from the language of the statute, it is plain that the. judge acts as persona designata, and does not represent the court to which he is attached. See Re Sheffield' Waterwords ([29]). It will be noticed that section 8 assigns to \"the court\" certain duties connected with adjudicating upon questions of title ([30]). \u201cThe court \" there meant is, in the Province of Quebec, the Superior Court and not the Queen's Bench, as appears from subsection 37. Whether an appeal would lie to the Queen's Bench from a decision of the Superior Court under these provisions we need not now consider. It is enough to notice the distinction preserved throughout section 8 between \u201cthe judge \" and \" the court.\"\nIn this view of the question of jurisdiction the present appeal should be quashed even if the asserted right to abandon the notice had been well founded.\nThere are one or two other topics which were dwelt on in the argument before us which may be alluded to but which it would be useless to discuss at much length.\nOne is the proper mode of enforcing an award of compensation made under the 8th section. The contention of the company, which was urged somewhat strenuously and on which the appeal was to a great extent based, being that a judgment of the court establishing the validity of the award is an essential preliminary to the power of the judge to make an order for the payment of the money awarded. The contention confounds together two things which are entirely distinct, namely, the effect of the award in determining the rights of the parties, and the enforcement of the rights which are determined by the award. An award determines the rights of the parties, but it can ordinarily be enforced only by an action or other equivalent proceeding. That rule applies to the awards in question, but the proceeding to give effect to them is that which the section provides, namely, the order of the judge.\nThe Railway Act of 1888, section 161, provides for an appeal from future awards exceeding $400, in addition to whatever mode of setting aside awards exists under the law or practice of any province. If proceedings to set aside an award are taken in good faith there must be a method either by the assent of the judge or by the interference of a court, to stay the payment over of money pending the proceedings, but that is a different thing from such an appeal as is attempted in this instance and inasmuch as it would involve merely an exercise of judicial discretion, could not be made the subject of appeal to this court.\nI do not propose to discuss the grounds on which, in the court below, it was considered that sub-section 26 which authorises the abandonment of the notice for lands does not apply under section 9, to lands required for gravel &c. There would be no useful object served by doing so at present. I am sensible of the force of the argument presented by Mr. Abbott in favor of the more liberal reading of the section in cases when possession has not been taken. If the question should again arise it will be necessary to consider whether sub-section 31 permits possession to be given before the price is fixed and paid of any land except land on which some work of construction is to be at once proceeded with. It is not necessary now to enter upon that discussion. Mr. Abbott ingeniously argued that if section 9 has the more limited effect, the respondent can have no right to the order for payment of the $1,000. But the company is the appellant, and cannot reasonably ask the active interf\u00e9rence of the court on the ground that the state of affairs which in its own interest it has brought about is unauthorized and unreal. I think the appeal should be quashed.\nAppeal quashed without costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Abbotts, Campbell & Meredith.\nSolicitor for respondents : S. Pagnuelo.\n[1] 3 Can. S. C.

Q.\u2014Action for damages\u2014Want of probable cause\u2014Damages other than costs.\nWhere a registered shareholder of a company finding the annual reports of the company misleading applies after notice for a writ of injunction to restrain the company from paying a dividend, and upon such application the company do not deny even generally the statements and charges contained in the plaintiffs\u2019 affidavit and petition there is sufficient probable cause for the issue of such writ, and consequently the defendant, who upon the merits has succeeded in getting the injunction dissolved, has no right of action for damages resulting from the issue of the injunction.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side) which confirmed a judgment of the Superior Court dismissing the plaintiffs' action.\nThe plaintiffs (now appellants) sued the defendant for damages, alleged to have been suffered by them in consequence of a writ of injunction issued against them, at his instance, to restrain them from declaring their yearly dividend. The declaration set forth, that on the 7th October, 1886, the defendant presented a petition supported by his affidavit, to the Superior Court at Montreal, alleging that the capital of the Montreal Street Railway Company was impaired, that their financial statement for the preceding year (1885) was at variance with the true state of the company's affairs, exhibiting grossly exaggerated values of the company's property in the attempt to make the capital appear intact, and containing large items of assets which were wholly fictitious, and calculated to deceive the stock-holders; that the directors intended to declare a dividend wholly unjustified by the condition of the company's affairs, and only based on the expectation of future profits and praying that the company and its directors should be restrained from declaring and paying any dividend or bonus for the .financial year 1886, or any other dividend or bonus, so long as their capital remained impaired. The declaration further set forth that on the 9th October, 1886, His Honor Mr. Justice H. T. Taschereau, after hearing the parties by their respective counsel, ordered a writ of injunction to issue as prayed, provided the petitioner gave security to the extent of $10,000; that security was duly lodged, and, a writ issued against the company; that after issue joined on said petition the parties went to trial, and the same judge eventually dismissed the said petition, and dissolved the temporary injunction previously granted by him, holding that the company's capital was not impaired, and that the directors were justified in declaring a dividend for the year 1886. The plaintiffs further charged that the defendant only became the holder of shares in the plaintiffs' company shortly before the institution of said proceedings, and for the sole purpose of taking them; that the said proceedings were unfounded and exatory, malicious, and taken without probable cause, and that the defendant acted in collusion with other parties interested in the depreciation of the company's assets, with intent to injure its credit and financial reputation. Damages were laid at the sum of $20,000 for injury to credit, and for various sums alleged to have been paid to counsel, accountants, and other experts, in order to obtain the dissolution of the injunction.\nThe affidavit filed by the manager Mr. Lusher in answer to the affidavit and petition for the issue of the writ of injunction was as follows:.\u2014\n\"That the said petitioner only became as hareholder in said company of respondents on the fourteenth day of September, now last past, by having twenty-three shares of the capital stock of said company transferred to his name on that day, and that he, Petitioner, was never previous to that date a registered holder of shares in said company.\n\"That the statement of account for the past financial year of the said company, which the directors have to consider and examine before deciding whether or not a dividend shall be declared, have not yet been prepared, nor have the directors been informed of the probable results of said year's business.\"\nThe proceedings were based on the following financial statement of 1885:\n\"General statement of the affairs of the Montreal City Passenger Railway Company on 30th September, 1885.\nASSETS.\nConstruction account of railway\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n$297,3320 60\nReal estate and buildings (as valued in 1877)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n159,2290 37\nRails and track material, stores, &c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n31,046 56\nEquipments\u2014Cars, sleighs, horses, &c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n133,081 49\nCash on hand and in bank\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n1,298 45\nThis amount charged off assets left in suspense since 1877\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\n165,216 77\n$787,254 24\nLIABILITIES.\nCapital stock\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n$600,000 00\nUnclaimed dividends\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n2,296 17\nMortgages\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n1,050 00\nReserved for law, &c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n5,550 00\nDue sundry creditors\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n19,432 50\nReconstruction reserve account\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n89,600 15\nProfit and loss account\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n69,325 42\n$787,244 24\nVerified,\nJNO.

LUSHER,\nAuditor. Manager and Sec'g.\nThe two items of assets alleged to have been misleading were the 1st the construction account of 30 miles of street railway at $297,320.60, and the last item of $165.216.17.\nThe defendant (now respondent) pleaded to this action that he had taken the proceedings referred to in good faith and without malice, believing the same to be in the interest of the shareholders generally, and without any intent to injure the credit or financial reputation of the company, but in the hope of improving the same, and placing it on a more stable basis; that the defendant shared the widespread suspicion existing among business men in the city of Montreal at the time of said proceedings as to the soundness of the company's affairs, and believed that a thorough investigation thereof would be beneficial to the shareholders; that all the allegations made by him in his petition for a writ of injunction were made with reasonable and probable cause, and were based on public records, and more especially on the financial statement submitted by the directors of the said company to their shareholders, at the annual meeting in 1885, which statement was misleading, and justified the defendant in taking his proceedings.; that the plaintiffs them-selves admitted the misleading and incorrect nature of said statement, by publishing a new and altered statement of their affairs during the pendency of the injunction proceedings; that the injunction in question was obtained by defendant after due notice to the company, after an exhaustive argument by their counsel, and upon his making out a prim\u00e2 facie case to the satisfaction of the judge who afterwards dissolved the injunction. The defendant further averred that the company had suffered no damage in consequence of his proceedings, but that on the contrary the result had been to establish its financial credit and standing on a more secure basis than before.\nThe issues were closed in the usual way, and the case was tried before Mr. Justice Johnston who, immediately after hearing the proof, dismissed the action with costs.\nOn appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), the judgment of the Superior Court was unanimously confirmed.\nGeoffrion Q. C. and H. Abbott Q. C. for appellants contended that the allegations contained in respondent's petition for an injunction constituted a libel upon the company, and cited Morawetz on Private Corporations ([1]): Williams v. Beaumont ([2]); Teuton Mutual Ins. Co. v. Perrin ([3]); Metropolitan Omnibus Co, v. Hawkins ([4]); Knickerbocker Ins. Co v. Ecahesine ([5]); 2nd, that courts England while not refusing the right of action to a in person who buys stock for the purpose of taking an injunction, have always looked most unfavorably and animadverted strongly upon such proceedings as were taken by the respondent in the present case, and referred to Seaton v. Grant ([6]); Bloxam v. Metropolitan Ry. Co. ([7]); Robson v. Dobbs ([8]); Forest v. Manchester Ry. Co. ([9]); 3rd, that the reports issued by the company were not misleading and that as there was want of reasonable and probable cause, the present action was sustainable under the civil law of the Province of Quebec; 4th, that under the Provincial statute 41 Vic, ch 14, sec. 4, P. Q., the respondent was responsible for any extra expense the appellants were put to by reason of the issue of the writ of injunction.\nLafleur and Lonergan for respondent contended that the rule which has always been recognized under the French Law, as applicable to actions of damages for vexatory proceedings, whether civil or criminal is that it is not enough to establish that the proceedings complained of were unsuccessful, but that they were rashly and maliciously instituted.\nAncien Denizart ([10]); Nouveau Denizart ([11]); Gruyot, Repertoire ([12]); Merlin, Repertoire ([13]); Ferri\u00eare Dict. de Droit ([14]); Dalloz. R\u00eaperooire ([15]); Pigeau, Procedure ([16]); Domat ([17]); Carr\u00ea et Chauveau ([18]); B\u00eadarride ([19]). The learned counsel then reviewed the evidence, contending that there were misleading statements published in the annual statements of 1888 which were sufficient and \"probable cause for a shareholder applying for a writ of injunction to restrain the company from paying a dividend until these statements were explained.\nThey referred more particularly to items showing, as alleged, an over-valuation of the property and to an item entered merely for the purpose of book-keeping.\nThey contended further that as a matter of fact, the application for the injunction was made upon notice and no answer or explanation was given by the company. Joyce on Injunctions ([20]). Moreover, that the appellants recognized and admitted the justice of the respondent's principle ground of complaint, by altering their financial statements during the pendency of the injunction suit, so as. to accord with his pretensions.\nThat as to extra expenses, the bill of costs paid by the respondent included all that the appellants had a right to recover by law \"Quartz Hill Gold Mining Co. v. Eyre ([21]); Cox v. Turner ([22]).\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014I have listened very attentively to this case, and I was impressed very much with the able argument of Mr. Geoffrion and Mr. Abbott on behalf of the appellant, but since hearing the counsel for the respondent I have come to the conclusion that there is no evidence in this case that any damage was occasioned to the appellant company by reason of the issue of the writ of injunction.\nI think that where a party has notice of an application for the issue of a writ of injunction and does not choose to avail himself of the opportunity to repudiate the statements in the petition and affidavits but leaves them all unanswered if he afterwards suffers damage by the issuing of a writ he brings it on himself. As regards the other count of the action, viz., damages resulting from the statement and charges contained in the petition, assuming that a party has a right to bring an action of damages against another for having taken civil proceedings in such a case appellant's counsel admits it is necessary to show malice and want of reasonable and probable cause and I should be very sorry to come to a different conclusion from that of the judges of all the courts below * and I am not constrained to do so as, so far as I can judge of this case, there was ample cause for the respondent, a registered shareholder of the company, to seek an investigation into all the matters' connected with the affairs of the company. The overvaluation of the property and the item of $165 000 in the statement entered as it is admitted, for the purpose of book-keeping, challenged enquiry. If parties choose to make such entries in their books surely any share-holder has a right to ask for an explanation. I think therefore there is ample evidence to sustain the finding of the courts below that there was no want of reasonable and probable cause. Upon both branches of the case the respondent must succeed and the appeal will therefore be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of the same opinion. I assume all questions of law in favor of the appellants and especially I agree that by the law of the Province of Quebec an action can be maintained by a defendant who has succeeded in a civil action, against one who maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause or in other words, against one who having no real interest has, in bad faith and with the malicious intention of harassing his adversary, unsuccessfully prosecuted the action. The law of the Province of Quebec in this respect differs from the law of England, according to which such an action will not lie unless there has been by means of civil process some unwarrantable interference with the person or property of the party defendant in the original action. Admitting then that the appellants can maintain their action if they can show that the respondent was a plaideur t\u00e9m\u00e9raire who sued without reasonable cause in bad faith and with malice the question we have now to decide becomes one of evidence solely. Now, do the appellants establish by their proofs that the injunction proceedings were instituted by tire respondent maliciously or without probable cause? I am of opinion that this question of fact as to which all the learned judges of the courts below before whom in its different stages this cause has come, are of accord, admits of no doubt. That there was reasonable and probable cause for the proceedings in the injunction action is apparent when we read the deposition of the principal witness for the appellants, their manager and secretary, Mr. Lusher, who admits that in the general statement of the affairs of the company appended to the directors' report and, upon the basis of which the directors were about to declare and pay a dividend, a certain amount, which had been previously put in a suspense account as an amount by which the assets had been over-estimated was included in the list of assets This amounted to the large sum of $165,216.77. There can be no mistake about this for besides Mr. Lusher's statement in his deposition we have the accounts which were appended to the report, filed amongst the exhibits, showing distinctly that this large item was included and dealt with as an asset. It is true Mr. Lusher afterwards says it was a mere matter of book-keeping, and that the amount which was thus made to appear as an asset, was afterwards so charged in the profit and loss account, that it was in reality written off, but all this does not appear on the face of the report made by the directors to the shareholders or in the schedules annexed to it. There remains therefore notwithstanding the manager's explanation for the respondent's justification the fact that this large sum, previously deducted for over-valuation was included as an asset in the statement of the affairs of the company made by the directors to the shareholders. There could be no possible mistake about the matter for not only is it apparent on the face of the directors' report but the witness Lusher being asked \"Do you find in that exhibit B an item of this amount charged of assets left in suspense since 1877; $165.216.77 included in the assets?\" answers \" Yes, I see it there.\"The witness does indeed add to this explanation as to how this item had been manipulated in the book-keeping, which Mr. Justice Taschereau ultimately considered sufficient ground for dissolving the injunction, but these explanations do not appear in the directors' report and were not even given on the original motion for the injunction. On that motion the appellants did not in the affidavits which they produced and read in opposition to the motion oppose to the allegations of the respondent as much as a general denial of their truth much less did they then give the explanation now put forward by Mr. Lusher in his deposition in the present cause respecting this item of over-valuation, but they contented themselves with attacking the respondent's qualification as a shareholder and impugning his motives for instituting the action. In the face of such evidence as this the respondent cannot surely be said to have acted vexatiously and without reasonable and probable cause; on the contrary, he had, as a shareholder, a direct and legitimate interest to have the appellants restrained from paying dividends based on a false and exaggerated estimation of the assets, as prim\u00e2 facie, and according to the admission of their principal officer it appeared from their report they were about to do.\nAs regards the status of the plaintiff as a shareholder, I am of opinion that as the shares in respect of which he qualified himself to institute the action had been regularly transferred into his name it matters not whether he held them in his own right or as a trustee or pr\u00eatenom for others and his motives in acquiring the shares are not a relevant subject of enquiry. This latter proposition has been frequently affirmed in England, and I see no reason why the same rule of law should not be applied to the province of Quebec. More-over, the respondent's quality as a shareholder having a sufficient locus standi to maintain the action for the injunction is res judicator, having been determined in the respondent's favour by Mr. Justice Taschereau in his judgment in the original action.\nas regards the expense to which the appellants were put in having their accounts investigated by expert accountants, that by itself: would constitute no independent ground, of action if there was probable. cause, and any claim on this head is also conclusively answered by the consideration that the appellants ought to have recorded their transactions and kept their books of account in such clear and regular form as. to have enabled them at once and without any prolonged investigation to give any information which a shareholder might reasonably ask for.\nThe appeal appeals to be entirely without foundation and must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I concur. The general rule is \"Lesfrais sont.la peine, et. la seule peine, du plaideur t\u00e9m\u00e9raire.\" But if any o116 institutes or carries on legal proceedings in bad faith, vexatiously and maliciously he is liable to an action of damages. Brown v. Gugy, ([23]) reported on another incident, is an authority upon this point. There Gugy's action had been dismissed on demurrer by the Superior Court, but on appeal this judgment was reversed and the right of action recognized. I refer also to Cayer v. Labrecque ([24]); Poutr\u00e9 v. Lazure ([25]); Laurent ([26]); B\u00e9darride ([27]); Sirey ([28]); and Dalloz ([29]) citing Compagnie a' Assurance c. Cochet.\nIn the present case, however, as a matter of fact found by the two courts below and upon which there can be no doubt, there is no evidence of bad faith or malice in Ritche's proceedings against the company. But it has been strenuously contended on the part of the appellant that a party taking an injunction does it at his risk, and that if the injunction is eventually dissolved he is liable to the damages ensuing therefrom, whether he acted maliciously or in bad faith or not. There is certainly ample ground for that contention as a general principle, and the security for damages required by the statute supports it. But in the present case we find that the company\u2019s own acts and returns justified Ritchie's demand for an injunction.\nThe company brought on these proceedings by its course of dealing's. There are no damages proved resulting from the injunction, and upon that ground the appeal must be dismissed, but, were there any the company itself is the primary cause of them.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that the plaintiff's action is devoid of any foundation, notwithstanding the very able argument of the learned counsel for the appellant which, I must confess was leading my mind to take the worse to be the better part.\nAs to any damages having been sustained which could he recoverable under the statute 4lVic.ch. 14 as sustained by reason of the issue of the writ of injunction no evidence was, in my opinion, offered; and as to the action for malicious institution of the injunction action which, in the unanimous opinion of all the judges before whom this case has been is unsustainable by reason of the failure of the plaintiff to prove malice in the defendant and want of probable cause, it is impossible for us, consistently with the principles upon which we proceed in such a case to pronounce such a judgment upon a mere matter of fact to be erroneous even if we differed from it. For my part I entirely concur in it. It is unnecessary, therefore, to inquire whether the law of the Province of Quebec authorises such an action in a case like the present if the plaintiffs could have succeeded in establishing malice and want of probable cause in the defendant for having taken the proceedings which he did take in the injunction suit. The defendant has already suffered so much by the impounding in court of the $10,000.00 lodged by him in lieu of bail on the writ of injunction issuing that we should not add to his loss by delaying the delivery of judgment on this appeal, which in my opinion should be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014Concurred in dismissing the appeal and mentioned the case of Williams v. Crow ([30]) decided in Ontario, where in an action upon a replevin bond, the plaintiff claimed, as part of his damages by reason of the issue of the writ of replevin his costs between solicitor and client over and above the costs taxed to him in the action of replevin, hut the claim was dis- allowed. The case was not cited as directly applicable to proceedings in the Province of Quebec, but as containing a reference to English cases which might be found to proceed on principles applicable to the construction of the statute 41 Vict, ch, 14.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Abbotts, Campbell & Meredith.\nSolicitor for respondent: M.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau, and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nLandlord and Tenant\u2014Lease\u2014Accident by fire\u2014Arts. 1053, 1627, 1629, C.C.\nBy a notarial lease the respondents .(lessees) covenanted to deliver to the appellant (lessor) certain premises in the city of Montreal at the expiration of their lease in as good order, state, &c., as the same were at the commencement thereof, reasonable wear and tear and accidents by fire excepted.\nSubsequently, the appellant (alleging the fire had been caused by the negligence of the respondents) brought an action against them for the amount of the cost of reconstructing the premises and. restoring them in good order and condition, less the amount received from insurance.\nHeld,\u2014affirming the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side), Ritchie C.J. and Taschereau J. dissenting, that the respondents were not responsible for the loss, as the fire in the present case was an accident by fire within the terms of the exception contained in the lease, and therefore articles 1053, 1627 and 1629 C. C. were not applicable.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side) ([1]) reversing a judgment of the Superior Court, by which the present respondents were condemned jointly and severally to pay to the present appellant the sum of $2,675.\nIn his action the present appellant alleged: \u2014 \"\nThat on the 10th of January, 1882, the appellant was the owner of a certain store and factory, known as numbers 52 and 54 St. Henri street in the city of Montreal.\n\u201cThat on the said 10th. of January 1882. the appellant leased the said premises to the respondents, present and accepting, for the term of ten years from the 1st of May, 1882, at a rental of $2,000 per year for the first five years of the said term and at a rental of $2,400 per year for the remainder of the said term, and all taxes and assessments which might be levied on the said premises during the said term;.\n\u201cThat by the said lease the respondents agreed and bound themselves to deliver the said premises to the appellant at the expiration of said lease in as good order, state and condition, as they were at the commencement of the said lease, reasonable wear and tear and accidents by fire excepted;\n\"That the said premises at the commencement of the said lease were in good order and condition and in a thorough state of repair;\n\"That on the 22nd of June, 1884, the premises so leased were totally destroyed by fire, which originated in the said leased premises, while the same were occupied by the said respondents as tenants under the said lease and said fire was due to and caused by the fault and negligence of the said respondents;\n\u201cThat in consequence of the said premises being totally destroyed, the said lease was terminated at the time of the said fire;\nu That said respondents, at Montreal aforesaid, were indebted to the said appellant in the sum of $288.05, for the rental of said leased premises from the 1st day of May, 1884, up to the 22nd of June, 1884, and in the further sum of $84.00, being the amount of taxes and assessments due by said respondents on said leased premises for the year, from the 1st day of May, 1884, up to the 1st day of May, 1885, and which became due and payable on the 1st day of November, 1884; and in the further sum of $1,211.95, for damages due the appellant estimated at an amount equal to the rental of said premises, from the 22nd of June, 1884, to the 1st day of February, 1885; and in a further sum of $7,500, being the balance of the estimated cost of constructing the said premises, after deducting the amount of insurance thereon realized by the appellant, making m all a sum of $9,084;\n\u201cThat the total estimated value of reconstructing said premises, and necessary to replace and put the said buildings in the same order, state and condition as they were before said fire, and at the commencement of said lease, was $17,500, and it was reasonably worth said sum to reconstruct said buildings, and replace said leased premises in good order and condition; that the said buildings and premises were insured by appellant against loss by fire to the extent of $10,000, which said sum has been paid to said appellant since the occurring of said fire;\n\u201cThat the appellant, on the 1st of August, 1884, through the ministry of Phillips, notary, protested said respondents, and declared his willingness to allow said respondents to reconstruct said buildings and to restore said premises to the state and condition they were in before said fire, the same to be done within a reasonable delay, and to furnish the said respondents with the plans] and specifications upon which said buildings were originally constructed, and to give credit to the said respondents for the amount of insurance on said premises, and should the said respondents elect so to do such reconstruction and restoration to be in lieu of the estimated cost of said reconstruction as aforesaid;\n\u201cThat said respondents did not elect to reconstruct and restore said premises to their former state and condition, and the said respondents refused and neglected to reconstruct said buildings and to restore said premises to the state and condition in which they were before said fire and at the commencement of said lease, though thereto often requested by the said appellant.\"\nTo this action the respondents pleaded, that it is true the respondents leased the said premises from the appellant; that the said lease was terminated on or about the 22nd June, 1884 by the total destruction of the premises, but not by fire, that the respondents, through the ministry of Marler, notary, tendered to appellant the rent of said premises up to the termination of said lease, and respondents declared their willingness to pay the taxes for so much of the current year as had expired, when the same became due, and on the 9th January, 1885, tendered the said rent and taxes, in all the sum of $321.78.\nBy a second plea, respondents further alleged:\u2014\" That as lessees of said premises they at all times used the same as prudent administrators, and exercised the greatest possible care in their use and conservation, according to the purposes for which they were leased; that it' is true a fire broke out in the said premises on or about the 22nd day of June, 1884, but respondents deny that the said fire was caused by their fault or by any person in their employ, and also deny that the said fire was the cause of the destruction of the premises; that the said building was defective, and appellant failed and neglected to maintain the same in a fit condition for the use for which it was intended under said lease; that the said building was imperfectly and improperly built and constructed, as the said appellant well new, and had been frequently notified both by the city authorities and by respondents, and that its destruction, on the date aforesaid, was caused by its faulty and imperfect construction, and not by fire, which might easily have been extinguished had said building been properly and substantially built; that the chimney on the north-west side of said building was faulty and defective and imperfectly built, and was not properly joined to the wall against which it was built, as appellant well knew and had been notified; that by the terms of said lease the said respondents were relieved from liability for loss resulting from accident by fire, and that the fire in question was the result of accident, and could not have been caused by the fault of respondents.\"\nBy a third plea respondents say:\u2014\" That the loss occasioned by said fire was amply covered by the insurance on said building effected by appellant, and which he collected; that if there was any further or other loss in excess of the amount of said insurance the same was not caused by the said fire but by the faulty and imperfect manner in which said building was built; that the appellant failed to keep said premises in a proper state of repair.\"\nBy a fourth plea respondents say:\u2014\" That by the terms of said lease the respondents obliged themselves to pay any and all extra premiums of insurance which the appellant might have to pay by reason of the nature of the business carried on by said respondents that by law and the terms of the said lease the appellant thereby undertook to insure the said premises against loss by fire and to relieve the respondents from any such risk * that during all the term of said lease, the respondents regularly paid said extra premiums of insurance to appellant, who, from time to time, accepted the same.\"\nBy a fifth plea respondents reiterated the allegations contained in their preceding four pleas.\nThe appellant answered generally to the first plea, and further that the rent and taxes for which the respondents were liable under said lease up to the time of said fire amounted to $372.05; that the total destruction of the said premises was caused by the fire while the respondents used and occupied said premises under said lease\nTo the second plea appellant answered generally, and further specially denied that the said buildings so leased were improperly built, but, on the contrary alleged that the said buildings were well and strongly built, and were in a good state of repair at the time of the said fire; that previous to the date of the said lease 10th January 1882\u2014the said respondents had been in possession of the said premises, and used and occupied the same for a period of about nine years immediately preceding the date of said lease, and were well aware at the date of said lease, as well as the time of the said fire that the said buildings were well and strongly built and in a good state of repair; that the chimney mentioned in said plea had been taken down some months before said fire and rebuilt and was well built, and in a good state of repair at the time of said fire; that the respondents had the said leased buildings completely filled with goods, packed up in paper boxes, both goods and boxes being of a very in flammable material, and the consequence was, that when the said fire broke out the whole building was rapidly destroyed, and said respondents are by law, and the terms of said lease, responsible for the loss suffered by appellant, caused by the said fire.\nTo the third plea appellant answered that the said buildings leased were well and strongly built and were in a good state of repair; that the said buildings were destroyed by fire while the respondents used and occupied the same under said lease; that respondents' alleged tender was illegal and insufficient.\nTo the fourth plea appellant answered that the said respondents did not at any time pay, or agree to pay, the ordinary insurance on said buildings, but only the extra insurance on said buildings which the insurance S company in which said buildings were insured might charge by reason of the hazardous nature of the business carried on by the said respondents, and the nature of the material stored in said buildings by the said respondents; that there was no undertaking between said parties by which appellant was obliged to insure said buildings for any fixed amount, nor was appellant obliged to insure said buildings at all under said lease.\nTo the fifth plea appellant answered that the allegations of said plea were false; that the buildings leased were strongly built, and in a good state of repair; that it was not true that respondents used the greatest possible care in and about said premises, but on the contrary, respondents stored and completely filled said premises with immense quantities of goods of an inflammable material, packed in paper boxes; and moreover, said respondents had a fire and machinery in operation on the third and fourth flats of the said buildings at the time of said fire; and appellant prayed acte of the admission of respondents that they had a fire in said premises at the time of the destruction of the said buildings, although it was in the month of June that said fire occurred; and said respondents did not take proper and sufficient care and precaution in regard to the fire they were using at the said time in said buildings; and respondents were not justified in using a fire at the time on said third and fourth flats of said buildings, in close proximity to goods the material of which was of an inflammable nature.\nOn these pleadings the issues were joined.\nThe evidence taken at the trial as to the origin of the fire is reviewed in the judgments hereinafter given. The principal provisions of the lease referred to by the counsel at the argument of this appeal are the following;\u2014\n\"And further that the said lessees shall furnish the said leased premises with a sufficient quantity of household furniture or goods to secure the payment of said rent, pay the cost of the present lease, keep the premises in repairs, reparations locatives, during the said term and deliver the same at the expiration of the present lease, in as good order, state and condition, as the same may be found in at the commencement hereof, reasonable wear and tear and accidents by fire excepted.\n\"The said lessees shall pay all extra premium of assurance that the company, at which the premises now leased may be insured, shall exact in consequence of the business or work done and carried on therein by the said lessees.\n\u201cAnd further, to keep the premises generally, during said lease, and leave the same at the expiration thereof, free from all ashes dirt and snow in accordance with the regulations of police and of the board of health, for the said city of Montreal.\"\nMcMaster, Q. C. and Hutchison for appellants, contended that no amount of care that a lessee may prove to have bestowed upon the premises leased by him can alone relieve him from the legal presumption in favor of the lessor that the loss by fire of the premises was caused by the fault of the lessee, or of the persons for whom he is responsible; and unless he proves the contrary he is answerable to the lessor for such loss; citing Arts. 1627,1628,1629, CO.; Belanger v. McArthur ([2]); Rapin v. McKinnon ([3]); The Seminary of Qu\u00e9bec v Poitras ([4]); Allis v. Foster ([5]); Pilou v. Brunette ([6]); DeSola v. Stephens ([7]); and after reviewing the evidence contended that the proof showed there was no defect in the building, and that there had been negligence on the part of the respondents by keeping ashes from four stoves in an ordinary flour barrel in the upper part of the building, and without any other protection than that afforded by a piece of zinc beneath it, resting upon the wooden floor. The learned counsel also cited Byrne v. Boadle ([8]); Lloyd v. General Iron Screw Collier Go. ([9]); Phillips v. Clark ([10]).\nLacoste Q. C. and Atwater for respondents, contended that the cases relied on by appellant's counsel ignored such a provision in the contract of lease existing between the parties as that contained in the lease existing in the present case, namely, that loss resulting from accidents by fire were excepted from the tenants liability.\nThe insertion of such a provision clearly indicates the intention of the lessor to relieve the tenant from such loss as is the result of an accident, and if the lessee use all the care of a prudent administrator in accordance with his obligations under article 1626 of the Civil Code, and if in spite of this a fire breaks out, it is clearly accident. Such words in a contract must be interpreted in a sense which will have some effect rather than in one which will have none.\nBy article 1626 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada it is provided that the principal obligations of the lessee are:\n1. To use the thing leased as a prudent administrator for the purposes for which it was designed and according to the terms and intention of the lease. 2 To pay the rent or hire of the thing leased.\nArticles 1627 1628 and 1629 C. 0. provide that if the lessee does not use the thing leased as a prudent adminstrator, and is thereby guilty of faute, \u00b0 he is liable for all damages to the building.\nThe word faute occurring in Articles 1627 and 1629 evidently has reference to duty imposed upon the lessee by article 1626 and virtually means default in that duty. The onus of proving that there was no default in his duty is cast by Articles 1627 and 1629 upon the lessee; consequently, all that he has to show is that he used the premises as a prudent administrator.\nThe presumption against him arises, from the fire, that he has neglected his duty as a prudent administrator, but if he shows that he has not so neglected his duty the presumption is destroyed, because the contrary to that which is presumed is proved.\nIn France, in face of the wording of Article 1733, 0. N. which is more precise and severe than that of our article, it is permitted to the tenant to contradict the presumption created by the law by other presumption, and to prove that he exercised the care of a prudent administrator. Marcad\u00e9 ([11]) , Laurent ([12]); Troplong, Louage ([13]); Demante ([14])\nOn the question of negligence the learned counsel contended that every possible care was taken by the defendants as was shown by the evidence; that the theory of the fire originating through a defective chimney was supported by the evidence; and that the lessor, having stipulated to receive extra premiums, tacitly agreed to assume the extra risk or to insure.\nMacMaster Q.C. in reply. Sir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.-I am of opinion the appeal should be allowed, with costs- I agree with Mr. Justice Taschereau in this case.\nSTRONG J. The law imposes upon a lessee the obligation of restoring the thing let to the lessor in as good condition as it was in at the date of the lease ordinary wear and tear excepted; in other words, and in the terms of articles 1627 and 1628 of the Civil Code the lessee is responsible for injuries and loss which may happen to the thing leased during his enjoyment of it, unless he proves that the loss was not occasioned by his fault or by the acts of persons of his family or of his sub-tenants. In case of the destruction of the subject of the lease by fire the lessee does not relieve himself from the responsibility which the law thus imposes on him by shewing that the fire was accidental in the sense that its origin is unknown, for article 1629 expressly declares that in cases of loss by fire there is a legal presumption that it was caused by the fault of the lessee or of those for whom he is responsible and that the lessee must answer for the loss unless he proves the contrary. This article 1629 is said, though differently worded, to be in legal effect the same as the article 1733 of the French Code. A question has arisen under both codes whether a lessee seeking to exonerate himself from responsibility by bringing himself within the terms of the exceptions in the articles in question, is bound to prove affirmatively how the fire occurred, or if it is sufficient that he should prove facts and circumstances shewing that it did not happen through his fault or by the acts of his family or servants. In both France and the province of Quebec the jurisprudence on this point has varied and the opinions of legal treatise writers are also far from being uniform ([15]). This question, however, although much discussed upon the argument, does not seem to me to be at all involved in the decision of the present appeal. The provision of article 1629 is not a law of public order, it is merely declaratory 9f one of the obligations which the law implies in a contract of lease and it is therefore quite competent to a lessor to renounce the benefit which it confess upon him.\nIt being thus open to the parties by their conventions to restrict the responsibility imposed upon lessees by the general law the primary question we have to decide is whether they have done this effectually by the stipulations contained in the lease now before us. The majority of the court of Queen's Bench considered that they have so done by the exception contained in the clause bearing \"that the lessees should keep the premises in repair during the said term and deliver the same at the expiration of the present lease in as good order state and condition as the same may be found in at the commencement hereof reasonable tear and wear and accidents by fire excepted.\" I am of opinion that this was a correct conclusion. The expression a accidents by fire,\" according to the ordinary meaning and interpretation of the words used, includes all losses by fire the origin of which is not ascertainable. It is reasonable to suppose as the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench has pointed out, that the parties meant by this clause to exempt the lessees from the responsibility in respect of fires which the law ordinarily attaches to lessees and this is done by attributing to the word a accidents \" any one of its ordinary and general significations as meaning \" an event that happens when unlooked for, \" \" an unforeseen and undersigned injury,\" or a \" mishap.\" Accepting any of these meanings of the expression a accidents,\" it was beyond all doubt established that the loss in the present case arose from an\" accident by fire,\" and the lessees therefore bring themselves within the terms of the exception of responsibility contained in the clause before set forth.\nArticle 1629 can consequently have nothing to do with a case like the present where the common law is controlled by the convention of the parties. The parties having thus derogated from the ordinary responsibility of lessees, which in the case of destruction by fire throws upon them the burden of exonerating themselves from a presumption of fault, the only remedy open to the appellant was that general one of the action given by article 1053, by which everyone is made responsible for the damage caused to another by his positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of skill. We must therefore consider this action in every respect as one founded on the article last referred to. Then in such an action, according to the ordinary principles of evidence, there is no presumption against the defendant, but the onus of establishing his case rests upon the plain tiff and it is for him to prove the fault of he defendant to which he attributes the damage he has suffered. The enquiry in the present case is thus narrowed to the question of the sufficiency of proof, and all we have to decide is whether the evidence established that the fire was occasioned by the negligence, imprudence, or other fault of the respondents.\nThe pretensions of the appellant in this aspect of the case are that he has succeeded in proving negligence on the part of the respondents in two respects: First, it is said that the respondents were guilty of neglect inasmuch as they placed the ashes taken from the stoves in a barrel which was an unsafe receptacle for them. Secondly, it is contended that they should be held responsible for the loss because they imprudently omitted to keep a watchman on the premises at night. As regards the first of these positions, it is conclusively answered in the way in which it has been met by the learned Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench. To establish the respondents' liability it is not sufficient to prove that they were on some occasions or in some particular respect guilty of positive acts or omissions which would, if they had been found to have caused damage to the appellant have amounted to actionable fault, but these acts or omissions must be so connected by proof direct or circumstantial, with the actual damage complained of as to be fairly considered to have been the causes of the loss the appellant seeks to be indemnified for. Then it is quite out of the question to say that the record before us contains any evidence which would warrant such a conclusion; the utmost which could be said is that the proofs give rise to a conjecture that the cause of the loss may have been ashes in the barrel: but the same may be said of numberless other possible causes of the fire, and it would be quite out of the question to act judicially on such suspicions, or to treat such hypotheses as sufficient legal proof. Further, if we were compelled on the proofs before us to attribute the fire to the most probable cause to which it has been suggested its origin may be traced, I should certainly say that the probability was in favor of the respondents' theory that it was to be attributed to the defective construction of the chimney, a cause for which the appellant was alone responsible. This, however, would also be mere speculation, and I do not desire to rest my judgment upon it. It is sufficient to say that it was incumbent on the appellant to prove that the loss was caused by the respondents' negligence and fault, and that he has entirely failed to do so.\nThe omission to maintain a watchman on the premises at night and on Sundays and holidays cannot by itself and in the absence of any evidence of usage be regarded as such imprudence on the part of the respondents as to make them liable. If the lessor had required such extreme vigilance he should have stipulated for it and have had a clause to that effect inserted in the lease.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIE J.\u2014L'appelant Evans a poursuivi les intimes pour les faire condamner \u00e0 l'indemniser des dommages qui lui out \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s par l'incendie d'une maison qu'il leur avait lou\u00e9e et qu'ils occupaient comme locataires au moment de l'incendie. La maison a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9truite. L'appelant se fondant sur l'article 1529, C. C, pretend que les intim\u00e9s sont responsables des cons\u00e9quences de cet incendie, et r\u00e9clame d'eux la somme de $9084 comme valeur des dommages qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi causes. L'artictle 1529 s'exprime ainsi '.\nLorsqu'il arrive un incendie dans les lieux lou\u00e9s, il y a pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale en faveur du locateur, qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par la faute du locataire ou des personnes dont il est responsable et \u00e0 moins qu'il ne prouve le contraire, il r\u00e9pond envers le propri\u00e9taire de la perte soufferte.\nLes intim\u00e9s out plaide que la pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale \u00e9tablie par cet article a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truite par la preuve qu'ils out faites, que l'incendie en question n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cause par aucune faute ou n\u00e9gligence de leur part, qu'au contraire, ils avaient toujours pris les pr\u00e9cautions n\u00e9cessaires pour se garantir contre les accidents par le feu, que la plus grande partie des dommages avait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par la construction d\u00e9fectueuse de la b\u00e2tisse qui l'exposait particuli\u00e8rement au danger du feu, plut\u00f4t que par l'incendie m\u00eame la b\u00e2tisse s'\u00e9tatt \u00e9croul\u00e9e peu de temps apr\u00e8s le commencement de l'incendie\u2013tandis que si la dite b\u00e2tisse eut \u00e9t\u00e9 solidement construite le feu aurait Pu \u00eatre \u00e9teint avant qu'il n'eut cause de grands dommages, que la dite b\u00e2tisse \u00e9tant assur\u00e9e, le propri\u00e9taire appelant avait retire en vertu de sa police d'assurance tout le montant des dommages causes, qu'enfin il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu par le bail pass\u00e9 entre les parties que les intim\u00e9s locataires rendraient \u00e0 l'expiration du bail les lieux lou\u00e9s en aussi bon \u00e9tat qu'il les avaient re\u00e7us en tenant raisonnablement compte de l'usage qui en aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, et en exceptant les accidents par le feu reasonable wear and tear and accidents by fire excepted. Il fut aussi convenu que la b\u00e2tisse lou\u00e9e serait assur\u00e9e et que dans le cas o\u00f9 un taux plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 d'assurance serait exig\u00e9 en cons\u00e9quence des risques plus consid\u00e9rables auxquels I'industrie particuli\u00e8re des intim\u00e9s pouvaient exposer la b\u00e2tisse, ceux-ci s'obligeaient \u00e0 en payer la diff\u00e9rence, ce qu'ils firent, qu'ii \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement du devoir d'Evans, le propri\u00e9taire, d'assurer sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour sa pleine valeur, et que s'il lui r\u00e9sulte une perte en cons\u00e9quence de l'insuffisance de son assurance, lui seul est tenu de la supporter.\nLa preuve a \u00e9tabli que ha b\u00e2tisse \u00e9tait d\u00e9fectueuse dans une certaine mesure, et surtout en ce qui concernait la chemin\u00e9e qui n'avait qu'une seule brique d'\u00e9paisseur, au lieu de deux qu'elle aurait d\u00fb avoir pour au mur de derri\u00e8re, de plus elle n'\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9e au mur, les joints n'en avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tires. Il y avait entre un des murs de c\u00f4t\u00e9 et celui de derri\u00e8re une crevasse laissant un espace de quatre pouces au troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tage\u2014crevasse qui se prolongeait dans trois \u00e9tages. On pouvait voir d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'autre entre le mur et ha chemin\u00e9e On voyait monter ha fum\u00e9e.\nL'attention de l'appelant ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 plusieurs fois attire sur l'\u00e9tat de ha chemin\u00e9e, et ayant m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 protest\u00e9 par les autorit\u00e9s civiques, il fit quelques r\u00e9parations en 1874 et en 1883 mais tout \u00e0 fait insuffisantes d'apr\u00e8s 1p t\u00e9moignage de Duplessis, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 pour ces ouvrages. L\u2019ouvrier charg\u00e9 de l'ouvrage en pl\u00e2tre, ainsi que l\u2019intim\u00e9 protestaient contre l'insuffisance de ces r\u00e9parations, qui ne s'\u00e9tendaient qu'\u00e0 une partie endommag\u00e9e de la chemin\u00e9e, le reste fut laiss\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tat qu'auparavant. Les planchers s'\u00e9taient retires de la b\u00e2tisse adjoignant d'environ un pouce \u00e0 un pouce et quart, laissant entre les planchers et les plafonds dans les diff\u00e9rents \u00e9tages, un espace dais lequel les \u00e9tincelles montant dans le chemin\u00e9e pouvaient facilement se loger et v br\u00fbler lentement avant d'\u00e9clater.\nLes flammes ne furent d'abord aper\u00e7ues que du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de Shorey, par les fen\u00eatres des troisi\u00e8me et quatri\u00e8me \u00e9tages. Apr\u00e8s la chute de la b\u00e2tisse on pouvait voir la partie r\u00e9par\u00e9e de la chemin\u00e9e qui adh\u00e9rait au mur de Shorey, tandis que celle qui ne l'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait toute tomb\u00e9e et laissait voir des briques noircies et brul\u00e9es sur le mur de Shorey autour de la chemin\u00e9e indiquant que le feu avait d\u00fb originer \u00e0 cet endroit. Cairns, un membre exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 de la brigade du feu, auquel est faite la question suivante:\nDid you notice anything in the debris or on the walls which would indicate to you where and how the fire had commenced?\nA. There was; round were the remaining part of the chimney, round the wall, there were indications on the building, as I would say, that the fire had originated close to that wall, by the blackened and charred color of the brick just around that part.\nQ. Near the chimney?\nA. Yes, just in the vicinity of the chimney, below it was not blackened\nCe t\u00e9moignage est corrobor\u00e9 par ceux de Cowan, Mann et Nolan, tous comp\u00e9tents dans cette mati\u00e8re, qui laissent peu de doute que la chemin\u00e9e d\u00e9fectueuse a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause de l'incendie.\nSi la b\u00e2tisse eut \u00e9t\u00e9 construite plus solidement, le feu aurait pu \u00eatre \u00e9teint avant d'en avoir cause la destruction enti\u00e8re. C'est l'opinion positive d'un autre membre de la brigade du feu Harris:\nQ. From your experience of fires, if the building had not fallen, could the brigade have put that fire out? A. I have no hesitation in saying so. We should have saved the two flats, if it had not fallen; we have done it with other buildings, and we surely could have done it with this.\nInd\u00e9pendamment des vices de construction de la. chemin\u00e9e, il est prouv\u00e9 que les supports de la b\u00e2tisse \u00e9taient insuffisants, qu'elle tremblait chaque lois qu'on v remuait des articles \"pesants et aussi \u00e0 chaque mouvement dans la rue. Les murs de derri\u00e8re et de c\u00f4t\u00e9 avaient consid\u00e9rablement surplomb\u00e9. L'inspecteur des b\u00e2tisses de la cite avait d\u00e9j\u00e0, en 1874 ordonn\u00e9 la d\u00e9molition de la chemin\u00e9e en question\u2014\nAs being in a dangerous condition, or repaired and made secured as regards fire. At present such chimney is in such state that it endangers public safety, &c., &c.\nIl est vrai que c'est longtemps apr\u00e8s cet avis que les r\u00e9parations dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question plus haut ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, mais on a vu aussi qu'elles l'avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d'un mani\u00e8re si insuffisante que la chemin\u00e9e n'avait pas cess\u00e9 d'\u00eatre un danger pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique, et qu'il n'y avait qu'une d\u00e9molition et une reconstruction totale comme le disait l'inspecteur, qui pouvait mettre cette chemin\u00e9e dans un \u00e9tat de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 conforme aux r\u00e8glements de la cite. La b\u00e2tisse \u00e9tait connue comme dangereuse par les hommes de la brigade du feu, qui sont unanimes \u00e0 dire qu'ils n'ont jamais vu une b\u00e2tisse s'\u00e9crouler de cette mani\u00e8re. Le toit n'\u00e9tait pas m\u00eame br\u00fbl\u00e9 et ils sont d'accord \u00e0 dire qu'ils auraient pu \u00e9teindre le feu si la b\u00e2tisse ne se fut pas \u00e9croul\u00e9e aussi promptement. Dans ces circonstances, si l'appelant avait quelque recours contre les intim\u00e9s, il ne pourrait r\u00e9clamer le montant entier de sa perte car si la b\u00e2tisse avait \u00e9t\u00e9 solidement construite, les dommages eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 moins consid\u00e9rables et le montant de son assurance aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 parfaitement suffisant pour l'indemniser.\nL'appelant pr\u00e9tend que la mani\u00e8re dont les cendres \u00e9taient gard\u00e9ss dans la b\u00e2tisse constitue un acte de n\u00e9gligence qui a l'effet de rendre les intim\u00e9s responsables de l'incendie. Le t\u00e9moignage de Donaldson prouve que les cendres apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es dans un baril place sur un plancher recouvert en zinc, \u00e9taient toujours \u00e9teintes avec de l'eau. Il jure positivement qu'il en a agi ainsi le matin du 21 juin 1884. On d\u00e9posait aussi dans ce baril les restes d'emploi d\u00e9lay\u00e9 dont on s'\u00e9tait servi la veille, ainsi que les feuilles de th\u00e9 mouill\u00e9es. Donaldson dit de plus que lorsqu'il enlevait les cendres des po\u00eales et fournaises le matin, elles \u00e9taient refroidies et il pouvait les prendre avec les mains. Le matin m\u00eame de l'incendie, \u00e0 71\/2 heures, pr\u00e8s de 24 heures avant que le feu se fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9, il y avait mis un plein seau d'eau dans le baril aux cendres. D'apr\u00e8s toutes pr\u00e9cautions prises et rapport\u00e9es par Donaldson, il est impossible que le feu ait pris par les cendres.\nLes intim\u00e9s ne se sont pas rendus coupables d'infraction aux r\u00e8glements de la cite en d\u00e9posant les cendres comme ils l'ont fait. L'interpr\u00e9tation que l'appelant a donn\u00e9e au r\u00e8glement n'est point correcte, le r\u00e8glement d\u00e9fend bien de garder les cendres de bois enlev\u00e9es des p\u00f4les dans des boites de bois mais ne fait pas mention des cendres de charbon qui se refroidissent beaucoup plus promptement et sont beaucoup moins dangereuses pour le feu, ainsi qu'il est prouv\u00e9 par plusieurs t\u00e9moins. Il a compl\u00e8tement failli dans sa tentative de prouver que les cendres avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause du feu. D'apr\u00e8s la preuve le feu ne peut gu\u00e8re \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 autrement que comme un accident, dont les intim\u00e9s ne peuvent \u00eatre tenus responsables, parcequ'en vertu de leur bail, ils se sont, par convention sp\u00e9ciale, mis \u00e0 l'abri de la pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale \u00e9tablie par l'article 1629, en stipulant qu'ils ne seraient pas responsables des accidents caus\u00e9s par le feu. Cette stipulation n'ayant rien de contraire \u00e0 l'ordre public ni \u00e0 la morale est parfaitement l\u00e9gitime et doit recevoir son ex\u00e9cution. Appel renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pends.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would allow this appeal.\nThe law of the ease is clear.\nArt. 1053.\u2014Every person capable of discerning right from wrong is responsible for the damage caused by his fault to another, whether by positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of skill.\nArt. 1627.\u2014The lessee is responsible for injuries and loss which happen to the thing leased during his enjoyment of it, unless he proves that he is without fault.\nArt. 1628. He is answerable also for the injuries and losses which happen from the acts of persons of his family or of his sub-tenants.\nArt. 1629.\u2014When loss by fire occurs in the premises leased there is a legal presumption in favour of the lessor that it was caused by the fault of the lessee or of the persons for whom he is responsible; and unless he proves the contrary he is answerable to the lessor for such loss.\nThis fire, therefore, is presumed to have been caused by the respondents' fault. The words \"accidents by fire excepted\u201d in this lease have not the effect to destroy this presumption of law that the fire was caused by the lessee's fault. On him rested the onus to \"plead and to prove that the fire was caused by an accident. This proof he has failed to make. The contention that I remark in his factum, that the word \u201caccident\" may be defined to be an event which is not the result of intention is untenable. Nothing but a criminal and wilful setting on fire of these premises would make this lessee liable according to this contention. Such is not the law. The word \"fault\" in Arts. 1627 and 1629 C. C, means, as in Art. 1053, not only a positive act, but also acts of imprudence or negligence.\nThe respondents seem to think that if they have proved that the cause of the fire is unknown they have proved that it was an accidental fire. But the law is exactly to the contrary. If the cause of the fire is unknown, the presumption is that it was due to the lessee's fault. Bourjon ([16]); Pothier ([17]); Domat, Lois Civiles ([18]); Dalloz ([19]). Bretonnier ([20]) justly remarks, that if the burden of proving that the fire was caused by the lessee's fault or negligence was on the lessor, the lessees would hardly ever be liable, because it would be generally impossible for him to get at the evidence as in the house there is generally only the lessee and his family.\nIn Ancien Denizart ([21]) a case of Aug. 22, 1793, is cited, where a proprietor who had himself lost his house by a fire was obliged to indemnify his neighbors to whose property the fire had extended, upon the only ground that the fire had originated in the defendant's house. This judgment, says Denizart, is based on the principle, that in the event of a fire, the cas fortuit is not presumed, if not proved.\nIn another case, loc. cit. (Quentin's) the defendant was condemned, because the fire had originated on his premises in an unknown manner, sans qu'on p\u00fbt savoir comment.\nI need not refer specially to the authorities under Art. 1733 U.N. They may easily almost all be found under the article in Sirey, Codes annot\u00e9s.\n\u201cAccidents by fire excepted \" in this lease means \" fire not by or through his fault,\u201d so that, for instance, if an incendiary had caused the fire the lessee would not have been responsible. Or, if the fire had been caused by a coal oil lamp accidentally falling from any one's hands, or by a rocket or fire-cracker fired from the street, or anything of that kind, then on the proof of any such fact the respondents would have been exonerated. But otherwise they are liable; the presumption, as I have already remarked, is that they were in fault. They had to rebut that presumption by proving that they were not in fault, that is to say, by proving that the fire was caused by an accident, by a vice de construction or force majeure, or by an incendiary. They do not prove an accident when they prove that the cause is unknown, or no negligence on their part. They in fact contend that the words a accidents by fire excepted \" mean \" loss by fire excepted.\" That construction is untenable.\nAs to the defective chimney, there is nothing to help the respondents. It was a very far-fetched defence. If the chimney was really defective, they should have informed their landlord of it. Then there had been no fire for over twenty-four hours in any of the stoves communicating with it.\nAs to the extra premium clause, I cannot see .that it can in any way be read as removing in any degree from the respondents the liability which, as tenants, the law imposed upon them. The appellants were not even bound to insure at all ([22]).\nThe evidence in the case as to the hot ashes in a wooden barrel, shows the grossest negligence possible on the part of the respondents, and I concur fully with Church J. when he said in the Court of Appeal:\nThe plaintiff has shown more than he was bound to do, for, in my opinion, he has shown gross negligence of the commonest prudence on the part of his tenant, and has afforded satisfactory presumptive evidence of the cause of the fire in the absence of any countervailing proof.\nThe absence of a watchman on the premises, considering the danger that the extreme heat required in the business involved, is also evidence of negligence. It is proved that the premises must have been on fire for a long time before any alarm was given, and that consequently the fire brigade's services were of no use to save the building. Now had there been a watchman there not only could the brigade have been called out in time to save the building and, perhaps, confine the damage to a few dollars but the watchman himself it may be would have checked the fire at its origin with a bucket of water. Merlin Repertoire ([23]); Arr\u00eats de Louet ([24]); Marcad\u00e9 ([25]).\nOn peut d'ailleurs, en certains cas, imputer au locataire d'avoir laisse les lieux sans gardien ([26]).\nThe jurisprudence supports entirely the appellant's case:\nA tenant, in order to free himself from the responsibility of the burning of the leased premises, must show satisfactorily that the fire was not caused by his fault or the fault of those for whom he is answerable. Belanger v Mc. Arthur ([27])\nWhere the leased premises have been injured or destroyed by fire the legal presumption is that the fire is caused by neglect or default on the part of the tenant or those for whom he is responsible unless the contrary is proved. Rapin v. McKinnon ([28]).\nIn order to destroy the presumption declared in Article 1629 of the Civil Code it is not sufficient for the tenant to show that he acted with the care of a prudent administrator and if the fire which destroyed the premises leased could not be accounted for he must show how the fire originated, and that it originated without his fault. The Seminary of Quebec v. Poitras ([29]) confirmed unanimously in appeal.\nThe tenant is responsible for the destruction by fire of leased premises\" from the neglect of his servants, &c. Allis v. Foster ([30]).\nAnd in such case the onus probandi is on the tenant to prove that the fire was not the result of neglect on the part of his servants when the premises are burnt while in their occupation. lb. ([31]).\nAn unreported case of Pouliot v. Turcotte, Superior Court, Kamouraska, June, 1875, confirmed in Review, is in the same sense.\nWith the hardship of the law we have nothing to do. The Code gives no new law on the subject. It does nothing but to re-enact the principles of the Roman law, universally adopted il France, and always held to have been the law of the Province of Quebec. With .a constant and uniform jurisprudence as to its construction before their eyes, the Legislature of Quebec has not seen fit to in any way alter the article. Under these circumstances, can we be asked to modify or deviate from that jurisprudence?\nThen, if there is any hardship on the tenant in that law, would there be no hardship in making the landlord bear the loss in case of the destruction of his preises when occupied by his tenant, or in putting on him the burden of proving facts which necessarily must be in the intimate knowledge of his tenant.\nLa loi ne peut balancer entre celui qui se trompe, et celui qui souffre, (says Bertrand de Grenille). Partout ou elle aper\u00e7oit qu'un citoyen a essuy\u00e9 une perte, elle examine s'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 possible \u00e0 l'auteur de cette perte de ne pas la causer, et si elle trouve en lui de la l\u00e9g\u00e8ret\u00e9 on de l'imprudence, elle doit le condamner a la reparation du mal qu'il a fait.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nGWYNEE J.-Whatever might be the result upon the construction of article 1629, CO., and whether that article is or is not to be read in connection with article 1626, I am of opinion that under the terms of the lease entered into between the parties the defendants are relieved from liability to reinstate the damage done by the fire in the present case which destroyed the leased house. The fire in the present case was clearly, in my judgment, an accident, or casualty by fire, which is the same thing, within the terms of exception in the lease.\nAppeal dismissed with costs\nSolicitors for appellant : Macmaster, Hutchinson, Weir & MacLennan.\nSolicitors for respondents : Atwater & Mackie.\n[1] 31 L.

S. C. c. 135) the matter relating to a fee of office where the rights in future might be bound must be the matter really in controversy in the suit in which the appeal is sought and not something merely collateral thereto.\nThis clause will not give jurisdiction in a case in which the action was brought to recover penalties for bribery under the Quebec Election Act (R. S. Q., Art. 429), even assuming that the effect of the judgment may be to disqualify the appellant from holding office under the crown for seven years.\nMOTION to quash appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench, (Appeal Side) for Lower Canada, for want of jurisdiction.\nThe action in this case was brought to recover penalties for bribery at an election in the Province of Quebec, and resulted in the Court of Review ordering the defendant to pay $400. The defendant was not a candidate at the election. The Court of Queen's Bench affirmed the judgment and the defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, basing his right to appeal on the ground: 1st. That the judgment had the effect of disqualifying him for seven years from holding office under the Crown in Quebec and that his rights in future were, therefore, bound. 2nd. That the matter related to a fee of office as a consequence of the disability to hold office, as to which an appeal is granted by sec. 29 (b) of the Supreme Court Act.\nGormully moved to quash the appeal.\nChristopher Robinson Q.C. contra.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014We do not think this appeal can be entertained. The matter of disqualification was not in question in the action for penalties, and if it had been there are no words in the statute which would give this court jurisdiction to hear the appeal. We think that an appeal, which is unknown to the common law, must be given by statute in such clear and explicit language that the right to appeal cannot be doubted.\nWe will not determine on this motion whether or not the appellant is disqualified for seven years by the judgment rendered against him. We will assume that this is so. But, even if that is so this does not make his case appealable to this court. The fact that in the future, for seven years, he may be incapable of holding any office does not render the case appealable. We have already held that the words \" where the rights in future might be bound\" in sec. 29 of the Supreme Court Act do not mean \" all cases where rights in future might be bound,\" but must be read in connection with the words that precede \"such like matters or things.\"\nNeither is the case appealable as relating to a fee of office where the rights in future might be bound. The appellant may be deprived of a fee of office for seven years, but, if that be so, that is the consequence of the judgment merely, but there is no controversy in the case relating to a fee of office where the rights in future might be bound, as required by said section 29th act.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: A. E. Gervais.\nSolicitor for respondent: C. Fitzpatrick.\n"}

C.\nThe Molsons Bank took from H. & Co several warehouse receipts as collateral security for commercial paper discounted in the ordinary course of business, and having a surplus from the sale of the goods represented by the receipts, after paying the debts for which they were immediately pledged, claimed under a parol agreement to hold that surplus in payment of other debts due by H. & Co. H. & Co. having become insolvent T., as one of the creditors, brought an action against the bank, claiming that the surplus must be distributed ratably among the general body of creditors H. &Co. were not made parties to the suit.\nHeld\u2014affirming the judgment of the courts below that the parol agreement was not contrary to the provisions of the Banking Act, R.S.

(Ritchie C. J. doubting and Fournier J. dissenting).\nPer Taschereau J That H. & Co. ought to have been made parties to the suit\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side) confirming a judgment of the Superior Court in favor of respondents, the defendants in that court\nAppellant sued as creditor of H. Haswell & Co., of which firm Haldane Haswell is sole surviving partner and alleged substantially:\nThat that firm owed him over $13 000 for goods sold and money lent in 1884 and on June 10th, 1884, made a voluntary assignment to A. W. Stevenson, with the acquiescence and express consent of appellant and respondents and that by this insolvency all the property of the said firm became the common gage and pledge of the creditors who were entitled to share ratably in the proceeds.\nThat respondents made advances to the firm on various dates for which notes were taken and warehouse receipts given as collateral security.\nThat the firm becoming insolvent the respondents disposed of the collateral and realized a surplus alleged to amount to $2108.27.\nThat demands had been made on the respondents to account and to pay over the balance to Stevenson, the assignee, the appellant, or such other person as might be entitled thereto to the end that it might be divided ratably amongst the creditors, but that respondents in order to obtain an illegal preference had refused to account or to pay over the balance.\nThe respondents pleaded:\nThat they had for a long time previous, been dealing with H. Haswell & Co. and in the ordinary course of their banking business made not only the advance s mentioned in appellant's declaration, but others upon collateral security of warehouse receipts: but they specially denied that such advances were made upon any understanding that such collateral was only to be held as against each particular advance, but that on the contrary it was agreed before and at the time of making the advances, and at all times during which the firm and the bank were doing business that should the advances not be repaid the bank should have the right to sell the collateral securities and apply the surplus to any other debt the firm might owe, or hold the same as security for their current advances.\nThat the firm failed to repay the advances, and the bank realized on the sale of the collateral securities mentioned more than the direct advances but not sufficient to cover other advances upon collateral security not mentioned in the appellant's declaration. In these cases also the collateral had to be sold leaving a deficit.\nThat in addition the bank made other advances to the firm to the amount of $3981.62, which was obtained on a distinct understanding that any surplus, arising from the sale of security held by the bank, should be applied towards payment of these advances that the advances were made in consideration and on the faith of this agreement, and respondents applied the surplus accordingly as they had a right to do\nBy their second plea the respondents said:\nThat the $2780.27 referred to in plaintiff's declaration had been compensated and extinguished by the balance due on the secured loans and the $3981.62 mentioned above.\nThe respondents also demurred to the action on the following grounds:\n1. No privity of contract between them, and, if any one entitled to an account it would be H. Haswell & Co., and it did not appear that appellant was their legal representative or stood in their right.\n2. The alleged insolvency and voluntary assignment did not affect the right of the firm to sue for an account or give appellant any greater rights in that connection than he had before.\n3. It did not appear by the declaration that the transactions between the respondents and H. Ha well & Co., were fraudulent, or that the creditors were en tilled to have the same set aside and the action was in fact a direct action by a creditor for an account of dealings between his debtor and a third party.\nIt was proved at the trial that the bank had for a long time been discounting the business paper of Haswell & Co. on collateral, and that in March, 1883, long before the insolvency, on being asked to discount accommodation paper, Mr. Thomas, general manager, refused, except on condition that the surplus of all collateral security held or to be held should be applicable on any and all indebtedness to the bank.\nThe following is the form of the collateral security held by the bank:\n\"Montreal, 11th February, 1884.\n\"Manager of\n\"The Molson Bank.\n\"In consideration of the Molsons Bank having discounted for us the under mentioned promissory note, viz:\n\"Note dated 11th February, 1884, falling due 14th June, 1884 for $1900, amounting in all to nineteen hundred dollars, we herewith deposit with you as manager, as collateral security for the due payment of the said note at maturity.\nD.

The whole without prejudice to the ordinary legal remedies upon the said note.\"\n\"H. Haswell & Co.,\n\"per pro. C. J. Binmore.\"\nRobertson Q.C., and Falconer for appellants.\nThe firm of Haswell & Co, our debtors, being notoriously insolvent under art. 1981 0.0. appellant has a right of action in his own name. The case of Boisseau v. Thibaudeau ([1]) supports this view.\nThe firm of Haswell & Co. have not been put en cause, but no exception has been taken to this in the pleadings, and in addition no injury can be done to defendants, inasmuch as Haswell & Co. are admittedly insolvent and therefore have no claim on their own estate. In addition, 4th. Haswell has signed a declaration declaring he puss himself before the court to abide the judgment to be rendered Such a declaration has been held sufficient by the Court of Queen's Bench in an unreported case: Johnson v. The Consolidated Banc, judgment rendered the 25th September, 1885.\nThe judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench in effect turns on a technicality, a mere question of procedure. It cannot be denied that in the absence of any special privilege appellant and respondents are entitled to share alike in all the assets of their common debtor. It is evident also that if the respondents are allowed to retain the moneys in question they will obtain more than their share. There must, therefore, be some remedy. An action by Haswell & Co. would be defeated, as against them the respondents have a good defence, viz., compensation. The assignee cannot succeed, for he, holding under a voluntary assignment, is a transferee of the debtor only and is in no way vested with the rights of the creditors; and, moreover, plaintiff has not abandoned his rights to the assignee. The right to an equitable distribution of the assets is a right belonging to the creditors only and to each of them, and they, therefore, are the proper parties to brins suit. The rights of creditors are not limited by Art. 1031 of the Civil Code referred to in the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, nor is that article applicable to the present case. It provides a means for creditors to increase their debtor's estate by bringing into it assets which the debtor neglects to secure, and has nothing to do with the distribution of the assets actually belonging to him, as in the present action which is brought not to deprive respondents of their rights in Haswell & Co.'s estate, but to secure an equitable distribution.\nAs to the conditions of the advances and respondents' rights to hold the surplus, the written contract between the parties shows clearly that the intention was that each advance should have its own security to apply to it alone. Any attempt to vary the terms of a valid written contract and to extend its stipulations is illegal\u2014Art. 1234 C.C.\u2014and contrary to section 46 of 34 Vic, ch. 5, of the Banking Act. See also Grant on Banking ([2]); Addams v Claxtoni ([3]) Vdndersee v Willis ([4]); and especially Talbot v fr\u00e8re ([5]); Taylor on Evidence ([6])\nIn reply to respondents third plea of compensation, appellant submits that an examination of respondents claims, and a careful comparison of dates clearly shows that the plea of compensation cannot be maintained, inasmuch as the requesters for compensation as set forth in Art. 1188 C.C (and. in connection therewith Art. 1196), are wanting because\u2014\n1st. The debts were not equally liquidated and demandable.\n2nd The right of compensation must have existed previous to the debtors' insolvency to avail against his other creditors, and the evidence shows that up to, and at the time of such insolvency the debts did not have each for object a sum of money of a certain quantity of indeterminate things of the same kind and quality. Perkins v. Ross ([7]).\nGeoffrion Q. C. and H. Abbott Q. C. for respondents. The appellant's s action is apparently taken as representing his debtors, H. Haswell & Co., and such action is only justified by articles 1031 and 1032 C. 0. A comparison of the former article with the corresponding articles of the Code Napoleon (2092, 2093), will show that our codifiers have adopted the view of those commentators on the Code Napoleon, who hold that the neglect or refusal of the debtor is an essential condition precedent to the exercise of his rights by the creditor ([8]).\nThe case of Boisseau v. Thibaudeau ([9]) is clearly distinguishable from this. There the payments were made directly by the insolvent to one of the creditors and to a creditor who had access to their books before the insolvency. The guilty knowledge of the creditor was proved and the case came clearly under art. 1036. The question of putting the insolvent debtor in default to exercise the action was not raised. Nor does it appear that there was any vesting by consent of the rights of the insolvent in the assignee which would have estopped the plaintiffs, and, moreover, the assignment in this case is a mere voluntary assignment.\nThe agreement as alleged is proved, and apart from the points raised by the demurrer three questions remain:\nIs the agreement proved?\nWas this agreement legal, and has the bank a right to retain the money ?\nIf illegal has the bank having the money actually in hand, a right to set it off against the balance due?\nAs to the proof we submit that the evidence is sufficient and that verbal proof is admissible in all commercial matters unless expressly prohibited by law. Between individuals it would undoubtedly be perfectly legal.\nThe Bank Act R.S.C. chap. 120, sec. 53 s. s. 4, provides in effect that the bank shall not acquire or hold a warehouse receipt as collateral for a debt, unless the debt is negotiated or contracted at the time, or upon promise that a warehouse receipt would be transferred.\nThe bank by law to carry out the objects of its existence, has a right to engage in such trade as generally appertains to the business of banking (s. 45).\nAnd by the law, the bank has a general lien on all securities for an unpaid balance of account.\nThe general lien of bankers is part of the law merchant to be judicially noticed, etc.\nUnless there be an express contract, or circumstances showing an implied contract inconsistent with the principle of lien, the bankers have a general lien on all securities deposited with them as bankers by their customers. Grant on law relating to bankers, &\u00e7. ([10]). Bank of Hamitton v. Noye Manufacturing Co. ([11]).\nThe case of Perkins v. Ross ([12]) is also distinguishable. There the agreement gave no privilege on the goods pledged. ([13]).\nThe creditor therefore only had a right under the agreement to set off the balance of the proceeds against an unsecured claim. The money never came into his hands until after the abandonment when by the Insolvent Act it vested in the assignee, and the creditors had to deal with him. The assignee was a party to the suit, exercising his own rights and claiming the money.\nApart from these considerations the money actually came into the hands of the bank no demand for it by the assignee has ever been made and the balance was still due the bank and under these circumstances compensation took place.\nRobertson Q.C. in. reply referred to Larombi\u00e8re ([14]).\nSir W J. RITCHIE C J In this case I have had very considerable doubt, but as the majority of the court are of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed and as my judgment would not alter the result, I do not think it advisable to delay the judgment.\nSTRONG J. concurred in dismissing the appeal.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014L'appelant, cr\u00e9ancier pour une forte somme de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 insolvable de M. Haswell & Co maintenant repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Haswell seul, a poursuvi l'intim\u00e9e la banque Molson en se fondant sur l'article 1981 du Code civil d\u00e9clarant les biens du d\u00e9biteur le gage commun de ses cr\u00e9anciers, dont le prix doit se distribuer par contribution entre eux. Ii all\u00e8gue que li insolvabilit\u00e9 de Haswell & Co. qui remonte \u00e0 la date du 10 juin 1884, \u00e9tait \u00e0 la connaissance de l'intim\u00e9e qui savait aussi qu'ils avaient fait cession \u00e0 A. W Stevenson pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de leurs cr\u00e9anciers. La bauque leur avait fait les avances suivantes:\nF\u00e9vrier 11 1884\n$1900\nAvril 1cr 1884\n2600\nMai 21 1884\n3000\n\" \" \"\n3000\nMai 23 1884\n2200\nElle avait lors de chacune de ces avances, en particulier et \u00e0 leurs dates respectives exig\u00e9 des s\u00fbret\u00e9s collat\u00e9rales de ses d\u00e9biteurs, qui lui avaient transport\u00e9 des re\u00e7us de marchandises en entrep\u00f4t leur appartenant, avec la condition sp\u00e9ciale que chaque s\u00fbret\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9e ne serait une garantie que du remboursement du pr\u00eat particulier auquel elle \u00e9tait affect\u00e9e que dans le cas de d\u00e9faut de paiement des dites avances, les s\u00fbret\u00e9s donn\u00e9es pour chacune d'elles seraient r\u00e9alis\u00e9es et apr\u00e8s remboursement des dites avances la balance en serait remisse \u00e0 la dite soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Cette derni\u00e8re avant fait d\u00e9faut les sret\u00e9s donn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9es et ont report\u00e9 un surplus sur le montant de chacune des avances, produisant en totalit\u00e9 la somme de $2,708277. Ce surplus, vu li insolvabilit\u00e9 des dits Haswell & Co. devrait \u00eatre partag\u00e9 au marc la livre entre leurs cr\u00e9anciers, mais l'intim\u00e9e retient ill\u00e9galement cette somme dans le but de s'assurer au d\u00e9triment des autres cr\u00e9anciers une pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour le paiement d'une balance de compte courant qu'elle r\u00e9clame des dits Haswell & Co. L'action est \u00e0 l'effet d'amener cette somme \u00e0 distribution entre tous les cr\u00e9anciers.\nL'intim\u00e9e a plaid\u00e9 par d\u00e9fense au droit que l'appelant n'\u00e9tait pas partie \u00e0 la transaction entre elle et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, Haswell & Co., et ne repr\u00e9sentant pas l\u00e9galement cette derni\u00e9re, il n'avait aucun droit d'action, que l'insolvabilit\u00e9 de la dite soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne lui conf\u00e9rait pas plus de droit qu'il n'en avait auparavant, et qu'il n'avait pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 fraude. Cette d\u00e9fense en droit a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e.\nPar un autre plaidoyer elle all\u00e8gue qu'en vertu d'une convention sp\u00e9ciale avec Haswell & Co., le surplus qui pouvait r\u00e9sulter de la vente des siret\u00e9s devait \u00eatre employ\u00e9 au paiement de la balance de leur compte courant, que ce surplus se trouve compens\u00e9 par la balance du dit compte courant et d'autres avances non rembours\u00e9es.\nLe \"jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 cette convention sp\u00e9ciale relativement \u00e0 l'emploi du surplus comme prouv\u00e9e, et renvoy\u00e9 l'action en cons\u00e9quence. La majorit\u00e9 de la cour d'Appel ne s'est pas prononc\u00e9e sur ce point, mais elle a confirm\u00e9 ce jugement sur le principe que l'appelant n'avait pas droit d'action \u00e0 moins d'avoir pr\u00e9alablement mis son d\u00e9biteur en demeure. C'est de ce jugement qu'il y a appel en cette cour.\nLes deux seules questions qui s'\u00e9l\u00e8vent sont, I l'appelant a.t-il droit d'action d'apr\u00e9s les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans sa d\u00e9claration; 2\u00b0 la convention verbale que le surplus du produit des s\u00fbret\u00e9s serait affect\u00e9 au paiement de la balance du compte courant est-elle l\u00e9gale et a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement prouv\u00e9e.\nQuand au premier point sur le droit d'action, quoiqu'il y ait eu divergence d'opinion \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, ii me semble que cette question ne peut sufferer difficult\u00e9. L'appelant se fonde principalement sur l'article 1981, C.C. d\u00e9clarant que:\nLes biens du d\u00e9biteur sont le gage commun de ses cr\u00e9anciers et. dans le cas de concours, le prix s'en distribue par contribution, \u00e0 moins qu'il n'y alt entre eux des causes l\u00e9gitimas de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\nL'intim\u00e9e, en retenant le surplus en question, agit en contravention \u00e0 cet article et viole le droit de l'appelant d'\u00eatre admis \u00e0 la distribution de cette somme par contribution. De cette violation du droit conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 tout cr\u00e9ancier par cet article na\u00eet le droit d'action de l'appelant. C'est moins le droit de ses d\u00e9biteurs Haswell & Co. qu'il exerce en vertu de l'article 1031 C.C., que celui que l'article 1981, assure \u00e0 tout cr\u00e9ancier sur les biens de son d\u00e9biteur\nLa faillite de Haswell & Co. a en aussi l'effet l\u00e9gal de mettre au m\u00eame rang tous leurs cr\u00e9anciers qui n'avaient ni privil\u00e8ge, ni hypoth\u00e8que et de faire acqu\u00e9rir \u00e0 ceux-ci le droit d'\u00eatre appel\u00e9s \u00e0 la distribution des biens de leurs d\u00e9biteurs an pro rata de leurs cr\u00e9ances respectives. Cet \u00e9tat de faillite, malgr\u00e9 la r\u00e9vocation des lois \u00e0 ce sujet n'en est pas moins reconnu dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec en vertu de l'article 17 C. C., paragraphe 23, qui le d\u00e9finit ainsi i \"La faillite est l'\u00e9tat d'un commer\u00e7ant qui a cess\u00e9 ses paiemets. Ii est encore admis par l'article 1036 C. C. qui d\u00e9clare nul le paiement fait par un d\u00e9biteur \u00e0 un cr\u00e9ancier qui connt\u00eet son insolvabilit\u00e9 et par l'article 2090 d\u00e9clarant nuls les enr\u00e9gistrements faits dans les trente jours qui pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent la failite. Cet \u00e9tat de faillite rend le d\u00e9biteur incapable de disposer de ses biens an d\u00e9triment de ses cr\u00e9anciers qui out acquis de ce moment le droit d'\u00eatre pay\u00e9s par contribution. Le droit que vent exercer l'appelant existe non seulement en vertu de l'article 1981 mais ii est aussi la cons\u00e9quence l\u00e9gale de ha faillite. A. cette \u00e9poque le 10 juin 1884, date de ha faillite l'appelant avait donc un droit acquis d'\u00eatre admis \u00e0 ha distribution des biens de Haswell & Co., par contribution, et en particulier sur la somme de $2708.00 montant du surplus.\nL'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que du moment qu'elle est devenue d\u00e9bitrice de ce surplus envers Haswell & Co. il s'est alors op\u00e9r\u00e9 de plein droit compensation de cette somme jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence d'autant avec la balance du compte courant qui lui \u00e9tait due par Haswell & Co Mais elle n'a pu devenir d\u00e9bitrice de cette somme que par la r\u00e9alisation qui seule a constitu\u00e9 Haswell & Co. ses cr\u00e9anciers d'une somme ainsi devenue claire et liquide et partant compensable, tandis que jusque l\u00e0 les dits Haswell & Co., n'avaient qu'un droit de se faire rendre compte des valeurs donn\u00e9es comme s\u00fbret\u00e9 collat\u00e9rale droit qui n'\u00e9tait pas susceptible de compensation. Ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s la faillite que la r\u00e9alisation a eu lieu Ce fait important est prouv\u00e9 par le t\u00e9moignage de James Elliott. Avant cette r\u00e9alisation l'appelant avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 acquis le droit \u00e0 la contribution, et la r\u00e9alisation subsecuente en \u00e9tablissant une cran\u00e9e claire et liquide en faveur de Haswell & Co. n'a pu donner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e le droit d'invoquer la compensation an d\u00e9triment du droit d\u00e9j\u00e0 acquis de l'appelant. Le Code civil, article 1196, contient une disposition \u00e0 cet effet.\nLa compensation n'a pas lieu au pr\u00e9judice du droit acquis \u00e0 un tiers.\nDans ces circonstances l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas le droit sous pr\u00e9texte de compensation, de retenir le montant entier du surplus; elle n'a comme les autres cr\u00e9anciers que le droit d'\u00eatre admise \u00e0 la distribution de cette somme entre eux au pro rata de leurs cr\u00e9ances respectives Autrement l'intim\u00e9e obtiendrait une injuste pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence contre les autres cr\u00e9anciers\nPuisque la loi reconna\u00eet \u00e0 l'appelant ce droit \u00e0 la distribution, elle doit certainement lui offrir un moyen de le faire valoir. Bien que le judegment de la cour du Banc de la Reine ait renvoy\u00e9 l'action, la cour n'a cependant pas ni\u00e9 le droit d'action. C'est sur une omission de formalit\u00e9 qu'elle a fond\u00e9 son jugement qui est motive comme suit:\nThat the appellant failed to comply with the necessary requirements according to article 1031 of the Civil Code to entitle him to exercise the action of his debtor who was not put in default before the institution of this action by a demand on him or his representatives.\nCe motif est-il fond\u00e9? Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question je ne crois pouvoir mieux faire que de citer la r\u00e9ponse donn\u00e9e par Sir A. A. Dorion dans ses notes sur cette cause:\nAs to the contention that the appellant had no right to bring this action unless he had previously summoned Haswell & Co., his debtors, to do so it has no foundation whatsoever. The law does not require it for article 1031 of the Civil Code which authorises such an action provides that creditors may exercise the rights and actions of their debtors when to their prejudice he refuses or neglects to do so.\" The mere neglect is sufficient to authorise the bringing of the action, and it is neither necessary to allege nor to prove such neglect. If a prior summons were required it would be necessary to establish a refusal in every case and no action could lie for mere neglect on the part of the debtor to sue although the article of the code expressly authorises it in such case\nThe jurisprudence is well established in France on that point as is shown by Laoombi\u00e8re ([15]). This writer, at No. 21, says:\u2014\"Hors de 'l\u00e0 aucune autre condition n'est exig\u00e9e pour qu'ils (les cr\u00e9anciers) Puissent exercer les droits et actions de leurs d\u00e9biteurs Tl suffit \" qu'ils soient cr\u00e9anciers et que celui-ci n\u00e9glige de les exercer, sans q qu'ils aient pr\u00e9alablement \u00e0 le mettre en demeure d'agir.\nThis jurisprudence has always been followed here, and the fact that a debtor has a right which he does not enforce has been considered as a neglect to perform a duty towards his creditors which authorises them to sue in his stead\nLe droit d'action exerc\u00e9 en cette cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu par la cour du Bane de la Reine dans laa cause de Boisseau v. Thibaudeau et al. (1).\nDans cette cause ii s'agissait de faire prononcer la nullit\u00e9 du paiement fait en contravention de l'article 1036 C. G. par un d\u00e9biteur \u00e0 l'un de ses cr\u00e9anciers qui reconnaissait son insolvabilit\u00e9. La cour a reconnu \u00e0 un autre cr\u00e9ancier l\u00e9s\u00e9 par cc paiement le droit de poursuivre en son nom le cr\u00e9ancier ill\u00e9galement pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 et de demander que la somme ainsi re\u00e7ue fut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en cour pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice commun des cr\u00e9anciers suivant leurs droits respectifs. Alors comme \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent les lois de faillite avaient cess\u00e9 d'\u00eatre en force. Le principe admis par cc jugement doit recevoir son application\n(2) 7 Leg. N. 274. dans cette cause car les faits sont parfaite ment analogues Comme l'a fait observer l'honorable juge Ramsay, dans ses notes sur cette cause, il y a dans notre syst\u00e8me de droit base sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 aucune r\u00e8gle expresse enlevant le droit d'exercer une semblable action.\nL'objection fond\u00e9e sur le d\u00e9faut d'all\u00e9gation defraude ne peut avoir aucune force dans une action oui ii s'agtt de faire rapporter \u00e0. la masse des biens du failli une somme que l'intim\u00e9e veut s'approprier ill\u00e9galement au d\u00e9triment des autres cr\u00e9anciers; la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence quel'in tim\u00e9e vent s'attribuer est \u00e9videmment en fraude de la loi qui r\u00e9gl\u00e9 la distribution des biens du d\u00e9biteur et cela suffit pour donner lieu a l'action du cr\u00e9ancier l\u00e9s\u00e9 '\nQuant \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me question an sujet de la pr\u00e9tendue convention verbale, indiqu\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e comme lui donnant droit de s'approprier le surplus cette convention, si elle a eu lieu est ill\u00e9gale, et n',est pas prouv\u00e9e.\nLa convention entre l'intim\u00e9e et Haswell & Co r\u00e9glant les conditions des avances a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par \u00e9crit Pour chaque avance faite pour garantir le paiement des divers billets ii existe une convention \u00e9crite contenant la condition suivante:i\nShould the above-named note not be paid at muturity the said. Molson's Bank is hereby authorized to dispose of the goods specified in the said warehouse receipt in such manner as it may deem advisable, and to appropriate the proceeds so far as may be necessary towards the payment of said note, and the goods are described as \"collateral security for the due payment of the said note at maturity. \"\nCe contrat fait voir clairement que pour chaque avance il y avait une s\u00fbret\u00e9 qui ne s'appliquait qu'\u00e0 cette avance m\u00eame, et que le surplus, apr\u00e8s r\u00e9alisation, demeurait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Haswell & Co., sans aucune appropriation particuli\u00e8re. Le surplus, arrivant la faillite devenait le gage commun de tons les cr\u00e9anciers et l'intim\u00e9e n'y pouvait pr\u00e9tende plus de droit que les autres cr\u00e9anciers. Aussi, pour soutenir sa pr\u00e9tention, l'intim\u00e9e est-elle oblig\u00e9e d'invoquer une pr\u00e9tendue convention verbale qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite avant l'\u00e9crit, comme lui donnant droit \u00e0 ce surplus. M. Thomas le g\u00e9rant de la banque, \u00e9st produit comme t\u00e9moin pour prouver une telle convention; mais ii ne dit pas que cette convention a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite apr\u00e8s le contrat \u00e9crit. Haswell reconna\u00eet dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'une convention semblable \u00e0 celle plaid\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en 1883 au sujet d'une avance particuli\u00e8re de $5,000, fait en mars 1883, mais il en limite l'effet \u00e0 cette avance particuli\u00e8re. M. Thomas a \u00e9videmment fait une erreur en parlant de cette convention, dont ii ne donne pas la date, comme si elle avait eu lieu en m\u00eame temps ou apr\u00e8s la convention \u00e9crite. \"Son t\u00e9moignage seul contre l'\u00e9crit qui prouve le contraire, ne peut suffire pour prouver cette convention D'ailleurs cette \"preuve est ill\u00e9gale et contraire \u00e0 l'article 1234 C. 0. Si elle \u00e9tait admise elle aurait l'effet de modifier un contrat par \u00e9crit qui dit que les s\u00fbret\u00e9s devront \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es au paiement de chaque billet (said note) en particulier, tandis que la convention verbale en ferait l'application \u00e0 d'autres cr\u00e9ances que celles pour lesquelles les billets ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s Les conversations qui ont pu avoir lieu \u00e0 ce sujet avant les \u00e9crits doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme non avenues, puisque les parties ont mis leur convention par \u00e9crit.\nBien plus, cette convention, m\u00eame si elle \u00e9tait prouv\u00e9e, serait ill\u00e9gale, comme contraire \u00e0 l'acte des Banques, 34 Vic, ch. 5, sec. 46, tel qu'amend\u00e9 par la 43e Vict., ch. 22, sec. 7, d\u00e9clarant:\nThat the bank shall not hold any warehouse receipt to secure the payment of any note or debt, unless such note or debt be negotiated or contracted at the time of the acquisition thereof by the bank.\nLa preuve fait clairement voir que les s\u00fbret\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es pour une autre dette que celle de la balance du compte courant, pour laquelle ii n'en a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 aucune. L'intim\u00e9e ne s'\u00e9tant pas conform\u00e9e aux dispositions de l'acee des banques, elle n'a pu acqu\u00e9rir aucun privil\u00e8ge sur le surplus, et efle le retient \u00e9videmment en violation de l'acte des Banques\nPar tous ces motifs je suis d'avis d'allouer l'appel.\nTASCHEREAU, J. -\u2014It seems to me that Haswell and Company should be a party in this case. The writing fyled in the record signed by Haswell, is irregular and cannot be looked at and moreover Haswell does not legally represent the firm. I have no difficulty how ever in satisfying myself that the judgment of the Superior Court is perfectly right, and that the defendants have fully established the agreement with Haswell & Co. by which they were entitled to keep these monies in payment of their claim. I do not see in this agreement anything against the provisions of the Banking Act.\nPATTERSON, J.\u2014The judgment from which this appeal is brought is that of three of the learned judges of the 'Queen's Bench, from whose opinion the Chief Justice and I Mr. Justice Tessier dissented I think the decision of the majority should be affirmed but at the same time I agree with some views expressed by the dissenting judges.\nThe objections taken to the locus standi of the plain-tiff and given effect to in the judgment of the court do not seem to me to be well founded. The construction put upon article 1031 of the Civil Code by the dissenting judges commends itself to my judgment as more reasonable than that which requires some formal demand by the creditor or some express refusal by the debtor before the debtor can be said within the meaning of the article, to refuse or neglect, to the prejudice of his creditor, to exercise his rights and actions. So far I go with the minority of the court below. I am further prepared to adopt the opinion which I understand to have been held by the minority, that the plaintiffs right of action exists independently of] article 1031. But I agree with the conclusion that the plaintiff has failed to sustain his action for the reasons on which the judgment of the Superior Court, as given by Mr. Justice Taschereau, proceeded.\n\"We have no complicated or disputed facts to deal with.\nThe bank having' taken from Haswell 'several warehouse receipts as collateral security for commercial paper discounted in the ordinary course of business, and having a surplus from the sale of the goods represented by the receipts, after paying the debts for which they were immediately pledged, claims to hold that surplus in payment of other debts due by Haswell, while Haswell having become insolvent the plaintiff insists that the surplus must be distributed ratably among the creditors generally.\n\"With each warehouse receipt the bank took from Haswell a memorandum of the deposit of the receipt as collectual security for the particular note, each memorandum containing these words:\nShould the above named note not be duly paid at maturity, the said The Molsons Bank is hereby authorized to dispose of the goods specified in the said warehouse receipt, in such manner as it may deem advisable and to appropriate the proceeds so far as may be necessary towards the payment of the said note. The whole without prejudice-to the ordinary legal remedies upon the said note.\nThe documents say nothing of the surplus that might remain after a sale of any of the goods, nor was it necessary that they should do so. The surplus must, of course be accounted for to Haswell or to some one entitled through him and, being outside of the written memoranda, could be made the subject of any other agreement or be disposed of by Haswell as he pleased. The argument to the effect that an oral agreement respecting these surplus moneys, such as the agreement proved to have been verbally made between Haswell and the general man-ager of the bank that the bank might retain the surplus, if a surplus there should be, towards the payment of other debts of Haswell was in violation of the rule against varying a written instrument by parol, is founded on a misconception. That agreement in no way varied the agreements evidenced by the writings, but was perfectly consistent with them.\nIt was urged that these surplus moneys having come to the hands of the bank through the medium of warehouse receipts, and the agreement respecting them being made while the bank held the receipts and before the sales under them and the power of the bank in relation to warehouse receipts being defined and limited by the Banking Act, the agreement was illegal and beyond the power of the bank.\nI have not the advantage of knowing the views of any of the learned judges in the courts below upon this contention, except the learned Chief Justice and the learned judges who dissented with him from the judgment of the court It is with some diffidence that I feel myself unable to assent, as they appear to have done, to the contention, but, with great respect, I venture the opinion that the views adopted are founded on a misconception of the effect of the statute.\nThe provisions are now found in the Bank Act, R, S.C., chap. 120, sec. 58, the material parts of which I shall read\u2011\n\"The bank may acqui\u00e8re and hold any warehouse receipt or bill of lading as collateral security for the payment of any debt incurred in its favor in the course of its banking business\u2014\" Pausing here for a moment let us see in what respect the common law is changed. The warehouse receipt is a receipt by a warehouseman for goods in his warehouse. The goods themselves could always have been pledged as security for debts. Whatever was the mode of effecting the transfer of property or possession by which the pledge was made, whether by actual delivery of the goods, or under the English system by deed, the goods could by some mode of conveyance be effectually pledged. But the process was cumbrous and slow, and the statute aims at providing a simpler and speedier way of doing the same thing in connection with the business of banking. we are of course aware that, though this Dominion statute deals only with banks, which are within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion, the principle is made of more general application by provincial legislation. The principle is indicated by the passage which I have read, but the practical enactment follows. The clause proceeds:\nAnd the warehouse receipt or bill of lading so acquired shall vest m the bank from, the date of the acquisition, thereof, all the right and title of the previous holder or owner thereof, or of the person from whom such goods wares or merchandise were received or acquired by the bank, if the warehouse receipt or bill of lading is made directly in favor of the bank instead of to the previous holder or owner of such goods, wares or merchandise.\nIn other words, the warehouse receipt acquired by the bank operates as a conveyance of the goods to the bank. What is done is not so much to create a new right as to provide a new mode of conveyance. I say nothing of bills of lading which need not enter into the present discussion, and which hold a position different from warehouse receipts under the law merchant.\nI shall read only one other passage, which is quoted by one of the learned judges in the court below:\nThe bank shall not acquire or hold any warehouse receipt or bill of lading to secure the payment of any bill, note or debt, unless such bill, note or debt is negotiated or contracted at the time of the acquisition thereof by the bank,\u2014or, &c.\nI do not doubt that if Haswell liad paid up his notes the effect of what I have just read would have been to annul the title of the bank to the goods held under the warehouse receipts and to disable the bank from insisting on holding the goods or the receipts as security for the current account. The bank would not have handled or received actual possession of the goods, and the title under the receipts would have become effete. This was probably the history of the earlier transactions of the kind between Haswell and the bank. But, under events as they have happened, the title to the goods was vested in the bank; the goods were lawfully sold; and the money that remained after applying the proceeds of each sale to its proper note was simply money held to the use of Haswell. It was not held under the warehouse receipts and it had to be accounted for like the excess over the mortgage moneys in the case of Talbot v. Frere ([16]) which the appellant cites in his factum.\nThe plaintiff insists that it must go for ratable distribution among the creditors. The defendants maintain that they have a right to apply it on account of what Haswell owes them, by reason of his agreement that it should be so applied.\nThe testimony of Mr. Haswell and Mr. Thomas establishes an agreement that the surplus moneys from securities, such as the warehouse receipts which we have been discussing, should be security for any debts Haswell owed or should owe the bank. The agreement went further than that for it embraced the advances made on the security of the warehouse receipts, which would not have been made if the disposition of the surplus which might have come into the hands of the bank had not been agreed to. The making of those advances was part of the consideration for the agreement as to the surplus. The accounts given by Haldane Haswell and by Mr. Thomas are substantially alike. I shall read that given by Mr. Thomas.\nQuestion\u2014Have you had any conversation with him (Mr. Haswell) with reference to the application of surpluses which might arise from the realization of collateral security held by the bank towards the payment of other advances that were made by the bank to him, and if so, will you state what such conversations were, and when they occurred?\nAnswer\u2014Yes, I had one, and I imagine it was about the time Mr. Haldane mentioned, in March, eighteen hundred and eighty-three, and I objected to making the advance. Mr. Haldane was in very great need of receiving a certain sum of money, and he asked me to make him an advance on collaterals. I demurred to making the advance as our advances on collaterals were pretty large then at the time, and we had other advances unsecured, the unsecured advances being certain notes, the amount of which I do not remember now, certain notes signed by the firm, and indorsed by the two brothers individually. I wanted in fact to get the whole of those notes entirely covered, but he said he was unable to stave collaterals and did not feel inclined, also to give collaterals enough to cover them, and then I asked him if I made him the advance if he would agree that any surplus arising from that advance or any other collateral existing, or that we might take in the same way, should be applied to the payment of these notes of the firm, indorsed by the partners individually, or any other paper, and in fact to apply to any advance as the bank liked, and he agreed to it, and unless he had agreed to it I would not allow the advances to be made. That was one occasion, but there were several occasions. Mr. Haldane forgets, I believe, two or three occasions in which a somewhat similar conversation occurred. I did it believing at the time that is in March, 1883, that I could have enforced payment by suit.\nIt was only to help him that I agreed to take transfer; it was a verbal one, a transfer of any surplus.\nQuestion\u2014And by those said notes you mean the notes signed, similar to the ones, Exhibits 4 and 7?\nAnswer Yes those notes indorsed by Haldane Haswell and his brother Charles. I think there were more than these running. 1 think the amount originally was about six thousand dollars.\nQuestion\u2014But they were notes of which Exhibits 4 and 7 are renewals? Answer Yes.\nQuestion\u2014Has the bank account of Haswell & Co. been carried on under that understanding ever since ? Answer Yes.\nThese exhibits 4 and 7 are promissory notes dated the 6th of February and the 5th of March, 1884, for the amounts respectively of $1,375 and $1,500, portions of Haswell's debt to the bank.\nThe date given for the first conversation out of which the verble agreement arose, March 1883, is a year earlier than any of the warehouse receipts now in question, which run from the 11th of February to the 24th of May, 1884, but the agreement, as stated, was a continuing agreement applying to any surplus which should come into the hands of the bank. The insolvency of Haswell appears to have occurred, or at all events to have first become notorious in June 1884.\nI see no good reason to differ from the decision of Mr. Justice Taschereau in the court of first instance concerning the agreement respecting these surplus moneys. That judgment was affirmed in appeal on the same grounds, although in the appellate court greater weight seems to have been accorded to the view taken by the majority of the incapacity of the plaintiff to maintain the action; and the judges who would have reversed the decision treated this particular point only with reference to the Bank Act.\nI think we should dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Robertson, Fleet & Falconer.\nSolicitors for respondents: Abbotts & Campbell.\n[1] 7 L; N. p. 274.\n[2] 4th \u00e9d., p. 183.\n[3] 6 Vesey 229.\n[4] 3 Brown C C. 22.\n[5] 9 Oh.

Ritchie C.J. and Founder, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEENS BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nEstoppel\u2014Art. 19 G.G.P.\u2014Right of suit by trustees\u2014Promissory notes given cos colloteral for price of sale\u2014Prescription.\nC.H.(the respondent ) as trustee for certain creditors of the firm of R. M. and sons, sued J. M.M. the appellant), a member of the firm, for $4,720, alleging: 1. A registered notaries transfer from one J.R.M. to him, as trustee, of a similar sum with all rights, mortgages, &c, thereunto appertaining, due by the said appellant to J.R.M. for the price of certain real estate m Montreal; 2. A transfer of certain promissory notes signed by the appellant for the same amount and representing the price of sale of said property, but which were to be in payment thereof only if paid at maturity. The appellant was a party and intervened to the deed of transfer and declared himself satisfied and subject to its conditions.\nThe appellant pleaded that the respondent had no action as trustee under article 19, C.C.P. and that the price had been paid by the two promissory notes which were now prescribed.\nHeld, 1, affirming the judgment of the court below, that article 19 C.C.P. was not applicable. The appellant having become a party to the registered transfer, which gave the respondent as trustee all mortgages's rights, was estopped from denying the efficacy of such deed or of the right of the plaintiff to sue thereunder in his quality of trustee. Burland v. Moffatt 11 Can. S.C.R. 76 and Browne v. prinsonebult 3 Can. S.C. R. 103 distinguished.\n2. That the notes in question having been given as collateral for the price of sale of the property, and the property not having been paid for, the plea of prescription as to the notes could not avail against an action for the price.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, which dismissed the action of the respondent.\nThe suit in this case arose out of a deed of settlement made between the defendant and the plaintiff as trustee for the defendants creditors and bearing date 31st October, 1877.\nOn the 1st December, 1877, J. R. Mitchell transferred for value received to the plaintiff in his said quality of trustee a sum of $4,720.200, with all hypothecary rights, due to him the said J. R. Mitchell by the defendant as the price of certain real estate in Montreal and to secure which sum the defendant had hypothecated the property purchased (bailleur de fonds) as stated in a deed of sale dated 5th January 1877.\nBy the deed of transfer of the 1st December, 1877, J. R. Mitchell also delivered up to the plaintiff two promissory notes amounting to $4,720200 which had been given by the defendant in payment of the purchaee price of the property, provided they were paid at maturity, and produced to be attachdd to the deed, but not otherwise, as appears by the following clause in the deed:\nProvided, always, however, and it is hereby expressly declared, agreed and understood by and betwenn the said parties hereto, that the consideration sum of $4,720.00. or any part thereof, shall not be held to be paid or discharged unesss both said promissory notes are fully paid at maturity, and the said two promissory notes being so paid shall be produced by the said purchaser, his heirs, or assignees, and cancelled and annexed to these presents: when, if requrred by the purchaser, a discharge therefor in notarial form will be granted.\"\nIt was agredd also in this deed of transfer that if a certain sum of $6,000, of Which the said sum of $4,700.20 formed part should be paid as set forth in a deed of settlement; recited in the deed of transfer the plaintiff should re-transfer the amount transferred to J. R. Mitchell, together with the hypothec.\nAnd to this deed of transfer intervened the defendant who declared that he had taken communication of the deed and understood it, and was content and satisfied and accepted signification.\nOn the 8th of January, 1879, when the two promissory notes became due and payable, they were duly presented to the bank, and payment was demanded but was refused.\nOn the 25th September, 1885, the plaintiff in his said quality of trustee, sued the defendant alleging in substance the above facts. He concluded by praying acte of his declaration, that he was ready to restore the notes, and asked for judgment for the said sum of $4,720.20, with interest and costs.\nThe defendant pleaded inter alia; 1 that the plaintiff had no right to sue in his quality of trustee, having no right or standing to appear as such before the court, being merely the mandatary or attorney of the creditors; 2, that the promissory notes which had been given in payment of the purchase price were prescribed.\nMcCord for appellant: The plaintiff had no right to sue in the quality of trustee, having no right or standngg to appear as such before the court, being merely the ' mandatary or attorney of the creditors named, Arts. 13 and 19 C C. P.; Browne v. Pinsoneault ([1]); Burland v. Moffatt ([2]).\nAnd although it might appear, at first sight, that these decisions as bearing on this case have been questiondd in a manner by the Privy Council in the case of Por. teous v. Reynar, ([3]) I contend that this case of Porteous v. Reynar (3) is totally dissimilar to the present one, and that plaintiff's action was rightly dismissed by the Superorr Court. He is not an assignee appointed by any court, or with any status which a court can recognize. The agreement sous seing priv\u00e9, is the only basis on which he could presume to sue. There was no assignment by the insolvent firm to him. There was no necessity for a private assignment, for the Insolvent Act of 1875 was in force. The creditors of the firm of Robert Miitchell & Sons are individually parties to the deed; they accepted a composition, accepted notes in payment thereof, on which each individual could sue and they appointed the plaintfF as their agent to hold the collateral security received from Dame Eliza Lane Mitchell. In the case of Porteous v. Reynar, the plaintiffs, as trustees, derived their title from the official assignee; in this case plaintiff had no authority, except as agent for the creditors, who could have urged their own rights, and cannot plead avec nom d' autrui. See also Huot. Dubean ([4]); Nesbitt v. Turgonn ([5]); May v. Fournier ([6]).\nI also contend that the plaintiff's action must fail also for the $6000 the amount of the composition agreed to and the notes given, must be taken as paid or prescribed. It was clearly the duty of the creditors if they had wished so to do, to have themselves sued on the composition notes. They did not do so and may never have had the intention of doing so. They allowed the notes to be prescribed. The notes were never even produced in this case, and it is to be borne in mind they were never even placed in plaintiff's hands,, His whole function was the passive holding of the collateral notes received by him from Mrs. Mitchell under the deed sons seing priv\u00e9. Once the composition notes were prescribed or paid, viz., on the 8th January, 1884, his functions ceased and he was bound at that date to hand back to Mrs. Mitchell the collateral received by him from her and return the bailleur de fonds or mortgage to James M. Mitchell. It cannot be held for a moment that the composition notes are not merchantable; no class of security could be more so.\nThe collateral receivdd for the security of these mercantile notes was likewise mercantile, and is governed by the prescription of five years.\nAs to the accessory character of the collateral security and of rights of hypothec the learned counsel referred to Laurent ([7]) and Pothier ([8]).\nH. Abbott Q.C., and Lonergan with him for respondent.\nThe defendant is estoppdd by his own acts and deeds.\nHe was a party to the deed by which the plaintf acquired these hypothecary rights upon which this action is based. The plaintiff in his capacity is fully described there, and it is stipulated that:\nThe said Charles Holland is hereby authorized to prbsecuee the recoveyy of the hereby assigned sums of money, in capital and inteeest, either in his name or in the name of said John Ross Mitchell who &c\nTo this deed the defendant intervened and declared:\nThat he has had and taken communication of theee presents and that he understodd the same and is content and satisfied therewith and he did, and doth hereby accept signification thereof, subject to all the conditions and stipulations thereof.\nHe was also a party to the deed sous seing priv\u00e9, produced by himself.\nCan he be heard to deny his deed or oppose its provisions without showing that such an agreement was contrary to public order or the policy of the law?\nIn France, clearly, the plaintiff's action would be maintainable, apart from any questonn of estoppel on a variety of grounds, and it is difficutt to see in what way our law can differ, unless by gradual growth of judicial decision, as there is no legislation which can accoutt for such a difference. Star he v. Henderson ([9]) S. V. (2); Carpenter v. Buller ([10]); Best on Evidence ([11]); Tayorr on Evidence ([12]).\nIn France under the Ordo finance de Commeree and prior to it a similar number of creditors might have formed a Union de Cr\u00e9anciers and appointed a Syndic, or representative, as was done in this case, and this, it is submitted, is still the common law of this country.\nIn France, too, associations of persons not incorporated may appoint a person to exercise rights of action beloging to them all. See S. V. ([13]).\nIt has also been held that apr\u00e9te-nom may sue especially persons who have contracted with him knowing him to be a pr\u00e9te-nom,: that quoad such persons he is owner and mandatory only as regards mandator. See S.V. ([14]); Laurent ([15]); Aubry et Ran ([16]).\nThe decisions of the courss in this country are found in the following cases: Allsopp v. Huot ([17]); Nesbitt v. Turgeon ([18]); Cr\u00e9mazie v. Cauchon([19]); Robillard v. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction ([20]); Vali\u00e8res v. Drapeau ([21]); Browne v. Pinsoneault ([22]); Moffatt v. Burland ([23]).\nIn Browne v. Pinsoneault ([24]) the decision was practically the same as in Alsopp v. Huot (10) above cited, viz. that because an agent, or attorney, concluded a contract, as agent it did not follow that he could sue upon it as agent. Judge Taschereau's remarks ([25]) make this perfectly clear. The next point raised by the pleadings is the question of prescription.\nHas a five years prescription destroydd the original claims of the creditors, or are the notes given in connection with the sale presumdd to be paid.\nOn the first questonn the plaintiff submits that the law is clear; that where a debt exists, and the debtor gives the creditor, or any one on his behalf, a pledge or security the debt can never be prescribed so long as the pledge or security is not redeemed. The reason is simple. Prescription is founded on a legal presumption of payment. Hence, a presumpiion cannot exist in the case given, becauee if payment had been made the debtor would, without doubt, have redeemed the pledge or security, and his allowing it to contnnue in the creditos s possession is considered a perpetual and recurrent acknowledgement of the indebtedness.\nThe justice of the rule is apparent. The creditors cannot acquire the pledge by prescription without inversion of title nor should the debtor be allowed to lull the creditor into a feeling of security by the possession of the pledge and then take advantage of his own conduct to claim a discharge by prescription.

J.\u2014This was an action for the price of land in which two notes were taken as security. The defenee was that the notes were prescribdd. Mr. Justice Taschereau has permitted me to read his reasons for \"judgment, m wrnich he has gone fully into the matter, and I can only say that I think the notes were taken merely as collateral, and thattnis action was for the purchase money to which the defenee cannot be maintained. FOURNIER G-WYNNE and PATTERSON JJ. concurred with TASOHEREAU J.\nTASOHERKATJ J.\u2014I would dismiss the appeal.\nThe action, it appears, was instituted by the respondent, Holland, in his capacity of trustee for certain named creditors of the insolvent firm Robert Mitchell & Sons.\nThe declaration is rather diffusedly drawn, but, however, alleges sufficiently that the respondent claims from the appellant a sum of $4,720, being the price of a sale of certain real estate by one John Ross Mitchell to the appellant, by deed dated the 5th January, with mortgage in the usual form, which sum, still due by the appellant, has, by deed of 1st December, 1877, been transferred and assigned to the respondent. The defendant bases his defence to the action partly on the ground that the plaintiff has no action as trustee under article 19 0. 0. P. 2nd. On. the ground that he has paid the said price of sale, by two promissory notes, which said promissory notes are now prescribed, and, in law, now presumed to have been duly paid.\nAs to this last ground, which I shall dispose of first, a simpee referenee to the deed of sale proves it to be utterly unfounded. It is expressly stipuaated in the said deed, that the said two notes shall be in discharge of the price of sale only when paid, and, in anothrr clause of this deed it is further agreed that:\nProvided, always, however, and it is hereby expressly declaeed, agreed and understodd by, and between the said parties, hereto, that the consideration sum of $4720.20, or any part thereof, shall not be held to be paid or discharged unless both said promissory notes are fully paid at maturity, and the said two promissory notes being so paid shall be produced by the said purchasrr, his heirs or assignees and cancelled and annexed to these presents: when, if required by the purchaser, a discharge therefor in notarial form will be granted.\nNow, not only were these notes not paid at maturity, but they have never been paid at all. The price of sale consequently remains unsatisfied and tlie mortgage on that propertv is in full force and effect. The trans-fer of that mortgage to Eliza Lane Mitchell relied upon for this defenee by endorsement on these promissory notes is invalid and ineffectual. It has not and could not be registered, whilst the transfer to the plaintiff was registered on the 29th April, 1878. The deed sous seing' priv\u00e9 of the 31st October, 1878, was also never registered. Then these promissory notes are produced in court by the plaintiff, with a declaration of his willingness to hand them over to the defendant upon payment of the price of sale. Upon these facts, I cannot see how the defendant can ask the dismissal of the action. They certainly have never paid for this property. The mortgage given in the deed of January 5th, 1877, has certainly never been discharged. It stands in the Registry Office in the plaintiff's name. and can be radiated only by him, or a quittanee from him.\nNow, as to the defendantss contention, that the plaintiff as trustee has no action against him. On this plea, also, I think that the defence fails. The plaintiff was appointed trustee by the sous seing priv\u00e9 deed of 31st October, 1877. To this deed the defendant was a party. Moreovrr, he, the defendant, was a party to the deed of transfer by which the respondent acquired these hypothecary rights upon which this action is based. The respondent in his capaciyy as trustee is fully described there and it is stipulated that t the said Charles Hol-\" land as trustee is hereby authorized to prosecuee the u recovery of the hereby assigned sums of money, in caapital and interest, either in his name or in the name \" of said John Ross Mitchell.\"\nTo this deed the defendant intervened and declared \" That he has had and taken communication of these presents, and that he understood the same and is content and satisiied therewith, and he did, and doth hereby accept signification thereof, subject to ail the conditions and stipulations thereof.''\nThe respondent replied to this plea t that defendant has no right or interest to deny his capaciyy to bring the action and further that defendant having inter vened in the deed of transfer, as set forth above, is estopped from denying the efficacy of the same and the plaintiff's quality as set forth therein.\"\nThe respondentss replication, it seems to me, is unanswerable. If the appellant was satisfidd and contented with a deed which gave the respondent the right to sue him, and intervened to that deed expressly to say so, he must remain contented and satisiied when he is sued accordingly. Moreover, as I have already noticed, this deed of transfer has been registered, and of course registered in favor of the respondent as trustee and that registration is specially alleged in the declaration. He, as trustee, has the mortgagee's rights and hypothec.\nThe appellant relied, in support of this plea, on the cases of Browne y. P insonsatult ([30]) and Buriand v. Moffatt ([31]). But as referenee to these cases will show that they have just as much applicaiion to this case, as they had to Porteous v. Reynar in the Privy Council ([32]) where their Lordships say, after mentioning the fact, that the Court of Queen's Bench had based their judgment, in that case, on the cases of Browne v. Pinsoneault (1) and Burland v. Moffatt (2):\nTheir attention does not appear to have been directed to the totally different circumstances of the present case.\nAnd, later on,\nThe case before their Lordships is sp different, that even if the two preceding decisions were untouched, they would not necessarily affect the decision of their Lordships on the present appeal.\nThe appellant here has also failed to see the distinction between this case and those cases. In the present case, he was a party to the assignment by John Ross Mitchell to the respondent as trustee, and expressly ratified the agreement contained therein, that the respondent would, in default of payment, have a right to sue the appellant. There was nothing of that kind in Browne v. Pinsoneault ([33]) still less in Burland v. Moffatt ([34]) where the gist of the decision of this Court is that the assignee (not under an Insolvency Act) has no more rights than the assignor had. Art. 19 of the C. 0. P. Nul ne pent plaider par procureur, was perhaps unnecssaarily referred to in that case.\nThat an assignee, or a cessionaire, has the rights and actions of the assignor, as held by the Privy Council in Porteous v. Reynar ([35]), this court had expressly recognized in the case of Burlandv. Moffatt (2). Referring to the case of Starke v. Henderson ([36]) where the action taken by the assignee was purely and simply the assignos's action, in Burland v. Moffatt (2), far from questioning the right of the assignee to sue under these circumstances I remarked ([37]);\nOf course, in exercising the assignors action, and. claiming the assignor's rights and debts, the assignee does it in the interest of the creditors as well as of the assisrnor but that is quite different. It is then, as any cessionnaire may do, the actions pertaining to the assignor, the actions that before the assignment or without it, the assignor would himself have had which he the assignee) then brings, whilst here the assignee claims rights pertaining to the creditors alone, and to which his assignor could never have bad any claim.\nThen the case of Prevost v Drolet ([38]) is referred to by me and distinguished ([39]).\nAs the plaintiff there also claimed purely and solely as locum tenens of the assignrr a debt due to the assignor.\nThis, it seems to me, is all that Porteous v. Reynar (3) in the Privy Council determines. There, clearly, the plaintiffs exercised nothing but an action that clearly belonged, before the assignment, to their assignor, Walker, an official assignee under the Insolvent Act. And the privity of contract that, in that case, so clearly existed between the assignees and the defendant, rendered the case still less doubtful.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: David R.

At the time of this transaction the agent informed the plaintiff that the defendants (appellants) composed the said firm of McDonald, Kemp & Co.\nThe plaintiff immediately wrote to the defendants stating the terms of his agreement with the agent. The defendants shipped the shingles and drew on plaintiff for the price; he paid the draft and went to the railway station for the shingles when he found that the freight, some $22, had not been paid and he was obliged to pay it; he drew on the defendants for the amount but they refused to accept the draft and this action was brought to recover the $22.\nThe only question raised in the case which was dealt with on the appeal was whether or not there was sufficient evidence of the defendants composing the firm of McDonald, Kemp & Co. In addition to the statement of the agent that they were the members of that firm, the plaintiff put in evidence letters received by him in answer to letters written to said firm and similar letters received by his solicitors in the course of correspondence about plaintiff's claim. All these letters were written on paper with printed headings containing the firm name and the name \"Thomas McDonald\" in one corner and \"A. E. Kemp\" in the other.\nThe learned judge who presided at the trial thought the evidence of partnership insufficient and on that and other grounds of motion therefor non-suited the plaintiff. On motion to the full court pursuant to leave reserved at the trial the non-suit was set aside and judgment entered for the plaintiff for $22.68.

He hoped it would be the last instance of the kind in this court).\nWe have no doubt at all in this case. Eddy was authorised to sell the singles. The purchaser very properly inquired who were the members of the firm from whom he purchased, and was informed by the agent who they were. He then corresponded with the firm and received replies written on paper containing the names of the different partners. I think the evidence most conclusive, particularly when the defendants did not ttempt to deny the partnership.\nThe other judges concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Weldon & McLean.\nSolicitors for respondent: G.

A. subway is protected and the cattle can go through it without any body to look after them, whilst they cannot cross the line over the embankment without being led by some one, which increases to a large extent the injury to that part of the property.\nThere remains the claim for gravel taken from the property, which was altogether rejected by the Exchequer Court.\nThe Exchequer Court was of opinion that the claimant could only be allowed the value of his land as a gravel pit if he could have used it as such to any more advantage than he could have used it as farming land. This would permit the Government to take from claimant's property, for the small price of $300, a large quantity of gravel that under the most favorable circumstances they could not have got in any other place for less than $1,400 or $1,500. It is true that there is no evidence that claimant's property was ever used as a gravel pit, and it is not likely that he would have ever drawn such a quantity of gravel out of his land to sell in the market if the railway had never been built. But it is equally true that claimant's property was the only one in the vicinity where gravel could be got, and that the market value of gravel to be used on the spot far exceeded the ordinary value of farming lands. Whether that value was derived from the opening of the railway or not does not matter much. The general increase of value, and the advantages which result from the building and putting into operation of a railway, is a public benefit for which everybody pays, and the law does not intend that the railway company should offer that general advantage as a set off against private claims. The increase in value which can be opposed by a railway company as a compensation to a claim for land expropriated and for damages, is the increase which is a benefit peculiar to that very land, not the general benefit resulting from the construction of the railway. For instance, if a railway company expropriates a certain piece of land for the purpose of building a station thereon, the indemnity to be paid can be compensated by the increase in value resulting to the remaining property from the expropriation for said purpose.\nAngers for respondent:\nIf the claimant could have used this piece of land as a gravel pit to any more advantage than he could have used it as farming land he would, I think, be entitled to be allowed its value as a gravel pit. But there is no evidence that it was ever so used by the claimant, or any reason to believe that it would ever have been of any use to him for that purpose.\nUpon the whole case full compensation has been awarded by the court below.\nSTRONG, FOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred with PATTERSON J. GWYNNE J.\u2014In this case the Minister of Railways has taken for the use of the St Charles Branch of the Intercolonial Railway 8 7\/100 arpents off a farm of about 133 arpents belonging to the appellant. The railway, as constructed upon the land so taken, crosses the farm on a curve in such a manner as to divide the farm into three parts. On one is situate the appellant's house and barn which stand a short distance from the northern limit of a public highway which crosses the farm, the southern limit of which highway constitutes the northerly limit of the land taken for the railway as it crosses the farm opposite to the appellant's house and barn, which are thus separated by about the space of three times the width of the public highway from the centre line of the railway track; this piece of the appellant's farm lying north of the railway is called for convenience in the proceedings in the Exchequer Court and here part No. 1. A piece of the same farm called part No. 2, lies between the railway as it crosses the farm opposite to the appellant's house, and the land taken for the railway as it again crosses the farm on the curve near the south-easterly end of the farm where the railway crosses a small stream called the river L'Allemand; the land taken at the south-easterly extremity of this part No. 2 is wider than the land taken in other parts of the farm, having been taken not only for the track, but also as a borrowing or ballasting pit lying alongside of the part whereon the railway track is laid From the highway in front of the appellant's house there has been a communication made under the railway to the part No. 2, but an embankment under which this communication is made destroyed a spring and a well, from the former of which the appellant's cattle, and from the latter his house, were accustomed to obtain water. The farm was used as a dairy farm, and this spring and the river L'Allemand and two small streams or watercourses on part No. 2 constituted the appellant's supply of water for his cattle. From the part No. 2 a farm crossing has been constructed by the Government, across the railway track and the ballast pit, to the residue of the farm which is called part No. 3, through which the river L'Allemand flows. From the above it appears plainly enough that the appellant's farm is undoubtedly injuriously affected by the manner in which the railway is constructed across it. The question is as to the reasonable amount of compensation to be awarded to the appellant as well for the value of the land taken as for the depreciation of the land not taken.\nWe may, I think, start with the assumption that the amount estimated by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court as the full value of the farm with all the buildings on it at the time of expropriation was very liberal indeed, viz.: $7,000.\nThe learned judge says in his judgment:\nFor land such as that expropriated in this cause $40 or $50 per acre would, I think, be a fair price if a considerable number of acres were so taken as not seriously to injure the balance by the manner of severance, but taken in the place and manner in which this was taken I am of opinion that $100 per acre is not an unreasonable value to put upon it.\nand so he allowed this latter sum, $807 in round numbers for the land taken. Now, by the above language of the learned judge, I understand him to mean that the full value of the farm and buildings before, and at the time of, the expropriation was $40 or $50 per arpent for the land taken to cover the actual value of the land taken and to compensate in some degree the damage done to the land not taken by reason of the manner in which the railway severed the farm into three parts, so that one half at least of this sum of $100 per arpent was awarded by way of compensating to some extent the injury done to the land not taken by the mode of its severance; and for further depreciation in value of the land not taken he awarded one-third of its value at the time of expropriation, amounting in the whole to the sum of $2,871.80 to be paid to the appellant.\nThe appellant's claim was for $7,476, that is to say, for the eight arpents taken and depreciation to the residue a sum exceeding by $476 the full value of the farm, and this amount the appellant still claims, not being satisfied with the amount awarded by the learned judge.\nAs to the part No. 1 counsel for the appellant in his factum says:\nWe notice in relation to part 1 another remark of the learned judge to the effect that it is injuriously affected not by construction but by the operation of the railway;\nand he argues from this remark that the learned judge has allowed nothing for any injury to the farm if assignable to the operation of the railway, but on the contrary has excluded from his consideration all such injury; but I do not so understand that portion of the learned judge's judgment in which the passage quoted appears. It seems to me rather that the learned judge was enumerating the several grounds of injury in respect of which the appellant suffered damage with the view of compensating them, not severally by distinct amounts, which would have been very difficult, if not impossible, as some might be incapable of being estimated in advance by any reliable or rational measure, but in the end by the lump sum of one-third of the full value of the land not taken. When the learned judge thought the appellant not to be entitled to any particular item of damage for which he claimed compensation he did not hesitate to say so distinctly. Nothing could be more difficult, if not impossible, than to lay down any rule by which to measure, or any specific amount by which to compensate, for damage not yet arisen but which may possibly in future arise from the operation of the road, and no one can, I think, say that what the appellant charges the learned judge with having excluded from his consideration is not amply covered by the one-third of the full value of the land not taken, which the learned judge has allowed for the whole depreciation in value sustained by the land not taken. The remark extracted from the learned judge's judgment, appears in the midst of an enumeration of the various injuries caused, or claimed to have been caused, to the appellant's farm by the railway having been constructed across it in the manner in which it was. He says:\nBy reference to the plan and the evidence, it will be seen that the farm is divided by the railway into three parts nearly equal in extent. On the north-westerly part are the claimant's house, barn and other buildings. The highway and the railway separate this part from the centre portion, and the latter is separated from the south-easterly portion by the railway, where near the River L'Allemand it again crosses the farm. I shall hereafter refer to these three parts respectively, and in the order mentioned as parts 1, 2, 3.\nPart 1 is injuriously affected, not by construction but by the operation of the railway. The injury as stated by the witnesses, consists in the proximity of the railway to the claimant's buildings. In addition, at a point near the claimant's barn is the western end of a long snow shed from which trains emerge suddenly and without notice or warning, causing the claimant's horses to be much frightened. From part 1 to part 2, which was used principally as a pasture, the claimant has convenient access by a subway. The injury to part 2 consists in this, that by the construction of the railway, a well and spring at the westerly end thereof were destroyed, and that access therefrom to the River L'Allemand was cut off. The claimant's cattle before the expropriation, were accustomed to drink either at the spring or at the river, and the fences of the pasture were always so arranged as to give them access to one or the other. The witnesses for the claimant all agreed that there is not on part 2 any other spring or natural water courses, and that the cattle cannot now be driven to the River L'Allemand, which is on part 3. They have, I think, however, greatly magnified any difficulty there is in procuring water for the cattle. It appears from the evidence of the claimant's son that, there is at the easterly end of part 2 a ditch which is filled with water except in the dry season. When I visited the property in the present month (June, 1888) there was a good stream of water running from this ditch, and it was evident, I think, from the character of the land, that there would be no difficulty, at least by digging a well, in finding at any time an ample supply of water on part 2.\nThen again, in regard to the means of access to the river L'Allemand the witnesses who stated that there were none, were entirely mistaken. It appears that until last winter when the snow shed was extended the claimant had a crossing, but that by its extension that crossing was destroyed; and witness after witness stated that there is now no way of crossing the railway because of the ballast pit. One of the witnesses, Mr. Simard, speaks of making a crossing by constructing a bridge 110 feet long by 13 1\/2 high. It will be observed, however, that the claimant's son does not state that there is no crossing now, and the fact is that there is a fair road across the ballast pit, with a reasonable grade, and a good crossing over the railway. These I saw in the presence of the claimant's attorney, and they bore evidence of having been in use.\nPart 2 then is depreciated in value by the fact that the claimant must either dig a well and pump water for the cattle pasturing there or drive them across the railway tracks for water during the dry season.\nPart 3 is injuriously affected, according to the evidence of the claimant's witnesses, by the absence of any communication between it and part 2. In this, as I have already stated, they are manifestly mistaken. The means of communication are very good, and the depreciation is not, I think, very considerable.\nThe learned judge, thus, as it appears to me, enumerates the several items which he has to consider in estimating the amount of compensation which should be paid by the Government to the claimant.\nOn part 1 he found damage to be compensated for to arise from the operation of the road, which damage being wholly prospective, there was no measure by which it could be estimated with any degree of accuracy. Although it had to be taken into consideration, it was wholly of a speculative character. Then upon parts Nos. 2 and 3 the learned judge by a personal inspection of the premises, satisfied himself that the estimate, as represented by some of the complainant's witnesses, was greatly exaggerated, and in some particulars wholly without any foundation in point of fact, as indeed is a common occurrence in all those claims of compensation for the expropriation of land for public purposes. The learned judge, in consequence found, as he says, great difficulty in concluding how much he should allow, and he seems to me to have resolved that his judgment should not be open to any just complaint upon the ground of insufficiency in the amount awarded. Accordingly, he estimated the land taken at about double its ordinary value, that is to say, for the purpose for which it was used before the expropriation, and the depreciation in market value of the property not taken, upon what appears to me to have been a most liberal scale. For the land taken he allowed $100 per arpent, or at the rate of $13,300 for the whole farm without any buildings on it, while, with its buildings, it was upon a most liberal estimate not worth more than $7,000, and for the depreciation in market value of the land not taken he allowed one-third of the full value of the farm with all its buildings after deduction of the $100 per arpent for the 8.077 arpents of land taken.\nThus, for the land taken in the manner in which it was taken he allowed\n$ 807 70\nAnd for depreciation in value of the remaining land one-third its full value, or\n2,064 10\nMaking in all\n2,871 80\nwith interest thereon from the time of the land having been taken.\nFrom the nature of the injuries actual, prospective and speculative done to the claimant's farm, it is impossible, I think, to say with any degree of certainty, that too much or too little has been awarded, while there can be no difficulty in saying that the demand of the claimant was unconscionable in the extreme.\nAs to the claim urged before us, based upon the contention that it is only by mere sufferance that the claimant has had, or has any communication across the railway from part 2 to part 3, and that he may be deprived of it at any moment at the will and caprice of the Government, or by sale by the Government of the piece taken for and used as a ballasting pit, it is, in my opinion, utterly devoid of the slightest foundation; for it is preposterous, in my judgment, to conceive it to be competent for the Government to divide a man's property, in the manner in which the claimant's property has been divided, by the railway and leaving him the severed parts to deprive him of all right to a crossing over or under the railway from one part to another suitable to the exigencies of the case and the full enjoyment of his farm, as severed into parts by the railway, or having once provided a necessary crossing to deprive the land of the benefit of such crossing.\nIn cases of this description, that is to say the severance by a railway of a man's property into parts requiring a convenient crossing for the full enjoyment of the severed parts, the question is, not whether such a right is conferred upon the owner of property severed by the statute authorizing the railway to be constructed, but whether any statute in virtue of which the railway is constructed has conferred upon the persons constructing it power to deprive against his will the owner of the property severed into parts, of a right so necessary to the full enjoyment of his property as convenient access across the railway from one of the severed parts to another; and in my opinion, as has been already determined by the judgment of this court in the Canada Southern Railway Company v. Clouse[3], the General Railway Act under which all railways, including the Intercolonial, are authorized to be constructed confers no such power either upon the Government or any railway company. No man can against his will be compelled to accept pecuniary compensation in lieu of a crossing, when a crossing is necessary to the full enjoyment of the severed parts and can conveniently be constructed, nor upon the other hand, can the owner of property severed by a railway compel a railway company, or the Government, constructing a railway across his property, to compensate him, against their will, by pecuniary compensation in lieu of a crossing when they are willing to give and can give a suitable crossing; and the ordinary courts of the country, in case the parties can not agree among themselves, and not arbitrators, under the statute in the case of railway companies or the Exchequer Court in the case of a Government railway, are the proper tribunals to be appealed to to have determined what number and what description of crossings would in each case be reasonable and proper to be ordered to be given.\nMy brother Patterson, as I understand him, takes exception to an expression in my judgment in the Canada Southern Railway Company v. Clouse (1) wherein I refer to two Statutes of the State of New York, the one being, ch. 140, sec. 44, of the Acts of 1850, and the other ch. 282, sec. 8, of the Statutes of 1854, as the probable source from which respectively were taken sec. 13 of the Statute of Canada, 14 and 15 Vic., ch. 51, and sec. 13 of ch. 66 of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, and referring to sec. 8 of the above ch. 282 I said: \"In the courts of the State of New York this amendment has not been considered to make any difference in the construction, and that it should not is, I think, the right conclusion.\" I then proceeded to show why, in my opinion, judgment upon sec. 13, of ch. 66 of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada should not be different from the judgment which had been pronounced upon sec. 13 of 14 and 15 Vic., ch. 51. My brother Patterson now says, that sec. 8, of chap. 282 of the New York statute of 1854, was not substitutional for the sec. 44 of the statute of 1850, but additional thereto. That I find upon more particular inspection of the statutes is the case when applied to railways constructed under the statute of 1850, but it applies independently to all railways not constructed under the Act of 1850, and that there are such railways appears, I think, from the case of Purdy v. The New York and New Haven Railway Company[4]. However, the point raised is wholly unimportant as the judgment in Canadian Southern Railway Company v. Clouse[5] was not rested upon the supposed construction put by the courts of the State of New York upon the statutes of that State, but upon principle and the arguments offered in support of the conclusion arrived at, namely that the section as amended in chap. 66 of the Consolidated Statutes is to be construed as regarding \"farm crossing,\" to be a necessary convenience for the use of the proprietors of the lands adjoining the railway when one part of a man's property is separated from the residue by the railway, to which necessary convenience the proprietor is entitled as of right, unless it shall appear that he has released and abandoned that right upon receiving compensation from the railway company, and that the ordinary courts of the country are the courts wherein all differences as to the nature, location and number of the crossings they are entitled to have, and also other matters incidentally arising, are to be adjudicated upon and determined, in support of which latter view I found four cases in the American courts, which I cited.\nIn the case now before us the Government appear to have constructed such crossings as appeared to them to be sufficient. It is not, in my opinion, in the power of the Government by sale of the land which has been used for a ballast pit to deprive the claimant of his right of crossing from one part of his farm to the other over the railway and ballast pit by the crossing supplied by the Government equally after such sale, if any should take place, as before. Assuming it to be possible that the Government could find a purchaser for the ballast pit, to which no access could be given except by the railway, the sale of it would necessarily be subject to the right of the claimant to cross from one part of his farm to the other, to which the land was subject when in possession of the Government, and if the claimant's, his heirs or assigns' rights should at any future time be interfered with by any one, the courts are open to him and competent to give him adequate relief. So that it is quite out of the question, in my judgment, that any compensation should be awarded to the claimant upon the assumption which has been made the basis of his appeal in respect of this crossing.\nIn fine, I can see no ground whatever upon which, as an appellate court, we can with any propriety say that there is any error either in point of law or of fact in the amount as awarded by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court who, having had the advantage of personally inspecting, the premises and judging for himself of the degree of weight to be attached to the several witnesses, has had opportunities of estimating the amount proper to be awarded to the complainant which we have not. We should, therefore, be very careful not to interfere, unless for some manifest error in law, with the judgment of the learned judge in matters of this nature to which no accurate measure of damages can be applied. I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The land of the appellant, taken for the purposes of the St Charles Branch of the Intercolonial Railway is a trifle over eight arpents, 5.10 arpents being taken for the track and 2.977 for a borrowing pit whence gravel for ballast is taken. The expropriation was made, as we are informed, in June, 1882, and not in August as the learned judge of the Exchequer Court understood. The difference of date affects the computation of interest, as the valuation has to be made as of the date of the expropriation[6]. The evidence in support of the claim was not taken till May, 1888. There was therefore ample time to ascertain the extent to which the property of the claimant was affected.\nThe railway crosses the claimant's farm in two places, dividing it into three parts: the north part on which are the claimant's house, barn and other buildings, the centre part, and the easterly part.\nThe claim is for the land taken and for injury by the severance, and in other ways, to the remainder of the land.\nThe learned judge has allowed $807.70 for the land taken, being $100.00 per arpent. This valuation is not complained of so far as the five arpents taken for the track are concerned, and it is not asserted that the three arpents taken for the gravel pit were, as farm lands, of any greater value. But the claimant insists that it shall be valued with reference to the gravel, some 45,000 cubic yards, taken from it, as if he had sold the gravel at so much a yard. The learned judge considered that those three arpents were, to the owner, simply three arpents of his farm, not rendered any more valuable to him by the existence of a bed of gravel under the soil, as there was no market for gravel, and it became of value to the Government only because the railway required it for ballast.\nI do not see any reason for finding fault with that view, and there is no doubt that the price per arpent of $100 was a liberal estimate.\nIn addition to the value of the land taken, the learned judge has allowed for depreciation of the remainder one-third of its value. He bases this calculation on an estimate of $7,000 as the value of the property, land and houses, and considers, rightly I think, the $7,000 an outside value. Then deducting the $807.70, which leaves $6,192.30, he allows one-third of that, or $2,064.10, making his whole amount $2,811.80.\nIt must be an exceptional case in which, on a mere estimate of damage depending on appreciation of the evidence and the exercise of judgment, this court can be expected to interfere with the amount settled by the tribunal primarily charged with the inquiry, and which has facilities for arriving at a correct conclusion that are not possessed by the appellate court. Where the tribunal of first instance has proceeded on correct principles and does not appear to have overlooked or misapprehended any material fact, an appeal against the amount awarded will in most cases resemble an appeal against an assessment of damages in an action, which would be a hopeless proceeding unless some very special reason for the interference of the appellate court can be shown.\nThis appeal is not addressed to the estimate of damages solely, but Mr. Belleau has, in the careful argument of which we have had the advantage, pointed out particulars in which he contends that the learned judge has taken incorrect views of the legal rights of the appellant.\nThe learned judge has not awarded damages for the depreciation of each portion of the land by itself, but he has noted the views he took respecting the effect of the railway or works upon each portion. Thus of the northerly division he says:\nPart I is injuriously affected, not by the construction but by the operation of the railway. The injury as stated by the witnesses consists in the proximity of the railway to the claimant's buildings. In addition, at a point near the claimant's barn, is the western end of a long snow shed from which trains emerge suddenly and without notice or warning, causing the claimant's horses to be much frightened.\nBoth parties understood, as appears from their factums, that these damages from the operation of the railway of which the learned judge speaks were excluded by him in making his award.\nI think they were a proper subject for compensation under the statutes.\nBy the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. ch. 39, sec. 3, sub-sec. (e.), the Minister is empowered to contract for the purchase of any land necessary for the construction, maintenance and use of the public work, and also as to the amount of compensation to be paid for any damages sustained by reason of anything done under and by the authority of that act or of any other act respecting public works or government railways. Sections 10 and 17 in their amended shape under 50-51 Vict., ch. 17, provide for a reference to the Exchequer Court when the Minister fails to agree with any person as to the value to be paid for any land or property taken, or for compensation as aforesaid; and by 50-51 Vict., ch. 16, sects. 30 and 31, some rules are laid down for the guidance of the court in determining the amount to be paid to any claimant for land or property taken for the purpose of any public work or for injury done to any land or property. The terms under which the right to compensation is given are wider than those of the English Lands Clauses Act 1845, where the compensation is for \"lands taken \"or required for or injuriously affected by the execution \"of the undertaking,\" as in sec. 32, the expression being somewhat varied or expanded in other sections, as in sects. 49, 63 and 68; or those of the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, section 6 of which requires the company to \"make to the owners and occupiers \"of, and all other parties interested in any lands \"taken or used for the purposes of the railway or injuriously \"affected by the construction thereof full compensation \"for the value of the lands so taken or used, \"and for all damage sustained by such owners, occupiers \"and other parties by reason of the exercise, as regards \"such lands, of the powers by this or the special \"act, or any act incorporated herewith vested in the \"company.\"\nThe rule now settled as applicable to the English acts in a case where, like the present case, part of the claimant's land is taken and compensation is claimed for injury to his other land by reason of the unavoidable effect of the operation of the railway, may be taken from the language of Lord Chelmsford in Duke of Buccleuch v. Metropolitan Board of Works[7].\nIn Hammersmith Railway Company v. Brand[8] it was held that a person whose land had not been taken for the purposes of a railway was not entitled to compensation from the railway company for damage arising from vibration occasioned (without negligence) by the passing of trains after the railway had been brought into use. And in City of Glasgow Union Railway Company v. Hunter[9] it was held that compensation could not be claimed by reason of the noise or smoke of trains, by a person no part of whose property had been injured by anything done on the land over which the railway ran. In neither of these cases was any land taken by the railway company connected with the lands which were alleged to have been so injured, and the claim for compensation was for damages caused by the use and not by the construction of the railway. But if in each case lands of the parties had been taken for the railway, I do not see why a claim for compensation in respect of injury for adjoining premises might not have been successfully made on account of their probable depreciation by reason of vibration, or smoke, or noise occasioned by passing trains.\nThat rule was acted on in the Duke of Buccleuch's Case[10] by holding that the arbitrators properly took into consideration the traffic, and dust and dirt and commotion and noise which would be the result of the construction of a road upon the Thames embankment, for which a part of his property had been taken.\nThat rule applies in the present case. Whether it would also apply under our statutes if no part of the claimant's property had been taken is a question which does not how arise.\nThe compensation is to be in respect of land taken for the purpose of a railway, and the injury sustained is not simply the deprivation of so many arpents of land, but the establishment upon that land of a railway which cannot be operated without injuriously affecting the property from which the expropriated portion is taken.\nThis is happily put by Mr. Justice Lush in giving his opinion to the House of Lords in Hammersmith Ry. Co v. Brand,[11] where he said,\nIn professing to give compensation for all damage sustained by the owners of the adjacent land by the 'execution of the works,' or 'the exercise of the powers of the Act as regards such lands' (Sec. 6, Railway Glauses Act,') the legislature must, as it appears to me, have had in view the ultimate object aimed at, the works when complete and in operation\u2014the dock, railway or canal\u2014not abstractedly as a mere excavation, embankment or reservoir, but in connection with its appropriate traffic, and with the ordinary incidents of a business undertaking.\nSee also the recent judgment of the House of Lords in Essex v. Local Board of Acton, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal in The Queen v. Essex,[12] which has as yet reached us only in the weekly notes of the 13th inst., and in the Times Law Report[13].\nIt would, therefore, have been proper for the learned judge to have considered the effect upon the northerly or north-easterly part of the claimant's property of the railway as a running concern.\nThere is a late case which shows that the sudden emerging of a train from the snow shed in the ordinary working of the road, though calculated to frighten the claimant's horses, is something of which he must take the risk. It is an incident of the operation of the road differing only in degree from the tendency of a moving train on an exposed railway to frighten horses; and, therefore, is a proper subject for consideration in fixing, once for all, the compensation to be paid in connection with the expropriation of the land. Simkin v. London and North-Western Ry. Co.[14].\nThe injuries in respect of the centre and the eastern portions of the land are in one way associated together. The farm is a dairy farm, and the claimant's cattle used to drink either at a spring in the centre part or at the river Allemand on the eastern portion of the land. The works have destroyed the spring, and the railway has to be crossed to get from the centre to the eastern portion.\nI see no reason to find fault with the principle on which this branch of the claim has been looked at by the learned judge, except with regard to the railway crossing. He gives his opinion that the crossing in use, and which by reason of the extension of the snow shed is the only practicable crossing, is sufficient. It traverses the gravel pit as well as the track. The sufficiency of the way is a matter of fact, on which the opinion of the learned judge who heard the evidence and saw the place is of more value than my opinion could be; but M. Belleau points out in his argument that this way is used on sufferance only, and not under any title which could be asserted against the company if the company should find it to its interest to sell the gravel land, or should decide to fence it in.\nThe point seems to me to be well taken.\nThe right to have a farm crossing over one of our government railways is not, as I understand the law, a statutory right. The only provision on the subject of farm crossings in the Government Railways Act, which is now ch. 38 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, is in section 16, where the Minister is required to erect and maintain on each side of the railway fences at least four feet high and of the strength of an ordinary division fence, with swing gates or sliding gates, commonly called hurdle gates, with proper fastenings at farm crossings of the railway for the use of the proprietors of the lands adjoining the railway, and also cattle guards at all public road crossings, suitable and sufficient to prevent cattle and animals from getting on the railway; and in section 19 which requires that at every road and farm crossing on the grade of the railway the crossing shall be sufficiently fenced on both sides so as to allow of the safe passage of trains.\nThe statute 50-51 Vict., ch. 18, added a definition of hurdle gate, and provided that every gate at a farm crossing shall be of sufficient width for the purpose for which it is intended.\nThere is no direction as to what persons are to have farm crossings, or how many, or what kind of crossing any farmer is to have. The provision simply is that, where there is a farm crossing, it is not to be blocked by the fences of the railway, but is to be furnished with suitable gates. This is the law under the Government Railways Act.\nUnder the general Railway Acts of the Dominion the law was the same down to the year 1888, when a change was made which was not extended to the government railways but which was confirmatory of my interpretation of the law as it previously stood. I shall notice it further on. An amendment had also been made in 1884, by 47 Vict. ch. 11, sect. 9, not extending to government railways, and not altering the law on the particular point in discussion. It enacted that farm crossings which railway companies were bound to make should be made as there specified, but left the obligation to make crossings to depend, as I understand the law to have been, on contract, the farmer making his own arrangement with the company or the Minister, when his land was being expropriated, respecting such crossings as he required, or receiving compensation for the severance of his farm.\nA different rule once prevailed in Ontario owing to the construction put upon the clause respecting \"fences\" as it appeared in the General Railway Act of 1851, 14 & 15 Vict ch. 51. By what seems very like a typographical error the clause which, as it has always been in the Dominion Railway Acts, speaks of gates, &c. at farm crossings of the railway, was worded in the Act of 1851, \"gates, &c., and farm crossings of the road.\nThis expression, appearing though it did in the section whose general subject was fences, and unlikely as it was that so important a subject as the right to a farm crossing, which might be anything from a simple footpath on the level to a costly bridge or culvert, would be dealt with in this incidental way and by an allusion rather than a substantive enactment, was nevertheless acted on by the courts of Upper Canada as a legislative declaration of the right of every farmer whose land was divided by a railway constructed under that act to have, in addition to the purchase money of the land expropriated or voluntarily sold for the purpose of the railway and to the compensation for incidental injury to his other land, one or more farm crossings.\nI am not able to say how the statute was acted on by the courts of Lower Canada.\nThe course of decision continued in Upper Canada until after the consolidation of the statutes of Canada in 1859. In the Consolidated Statute, ch. 66, the word and was changed to at, and the clause appeared in the form it has always assumed in the Dominion acts.\nSingularly enough, this change from and to at was not followed in the French copy of the Consolidated Statutes. I shall refer by-and-by to the later legislation of the Province of Quebec.\nOn the first occasion on which the question came before any court in Upper Canada after 1859, which was in Brown v. Toronto and Nipissing Ry. Co.[15], it was held that there was no longer any statutory obligation upon the railway company to make a farm crossing.\nThe same question was discussed in this court in Canada Southern Ry. Co. v. Clouse[16], upon the construction of the present law of the Province of Ontario, where my brother Gwynne, who had taken part in the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas in Brown's Case, came to the conclusion that that decision was erroneous, and considered that conclusion supported, as I gather from his judgment, by decisions on a statute of the State of New York which was the model from which the act of Canada of 1851 was framed.\nI am relieved from much of the hesitation which I should feel in differing from my learned brother by two considerations: First, that the second thoughts, which I do not on this occasion think the best, are his own second thoughts to which I prefer his first, and secondly, because I am satisfied that his attention cannot have been called to the real state of the law in New York.\nIt is true that the general railway law of New York of 1850 contained the clause, chapter 140, section 44, which was adopted verbatim in the Canadian act of 1851 with the word and\u2014\"and farm crossings of the road.\" It is true also that, by a line of decisions, the courts of that State construed this as a statutory mandate to the railway companies, formed under that act, to make farm crossings, and that the courts of Upper Canada simply followed the New York decisions in so construing the act of 1851.\nIt is true, moreover, that in 1854, a railway law was passed in New York, chapter 282, the 8th section of which enacted that:\nEvery railroad corporation whose line of road is open for use shall within three months after the passage of this Act, and every railroad company formed or to be formed, but whose lines are not now open for use, shall before the lines of such railroad are opened, erect and thereafter maintain fences on the sides of their roads of the height, &c. with openings or gales or bars therein at the farm crossings of such railroads, for the use of the proprietors of the land adjoining such railroad;\"\nand so on; but it is not true, however much this enactment may look like a correction of the clause of 1850, that it superseded that clause. It is regarded as cumulative and not substitutionary. Both clauses will be found at full length in the Revised Statutes of New York of 1875 and 1882. In Revised Statutes of 1875, where the various railroad acts are thrown into one, the act of 1850 being taken as the basis, and the original number of the section given in brackets when the section is taken from that act, these two sections concerning fences are sections 66 (44) and 67. They are at p. 548 of the 2nd vol. The revision of 1882 is on a different system, each act being printed by itself. The clauses are there found at pages 1569 and 1585 respectively.\nNow remembering that section 44 of 1850, continued as it is in its original wording, applies to \"every corporation formed under this act,\" and that the act is the general one under which railroad corporations in New York, as a rule, are formed, it will readily be seen that the law of 1850, under which the first cases were decided, is still the law.\nI have looked at all of the large number of cases on the subject which are mentioned in the notes in the revised act of 1882, as edited by Mr. Montgomery H Throop.\nFour of those cases are referred to by my brother Gwynne in Clouse's Case[17], and they are enough for me to refer to now, as they are, I believe, the latest cases, as well as those which best illustrate the position. They bear out the view of the New York law which I have taken.\nOf the other cases I find one and only one in which the section with at is quoted, but the case was not upon the subject of a farm crossing. The four cases are Clarke v. Rochester, Lockport &c. R. R. Co.[18] which was decided under the act of 1850, and before the passing of the act of 1854; Wademan v. Albany &c. R. R. Co.[19] which, though decided in 1873, was decided under the act of 1850, Johnson, C., expressly saying \"the question in this case arises upon the 44th section of the General Railroad Act of 1850,\"[20]; Smith v. New York & Oswego Midland Railway Company[21] which was also a decision under the act of 1850, no reference being made to the act of 1854.; and Jones v. Seligman[22] which follows Smith's Case. In the judgment delivered by Miller J. the act of 1854 is quoted but with the words in question omitted. Thus: \"with opening gates or bars for the use of the proprietors, &c.\"\nThere is no decision that the change from and to at made or would make no difference, and that question could not easily be raised for decision while the general act under which companies are constituted contains the original form of the clause, nor has the matter ever, so far as I have been able to discover, been a subject of discussion in the courts of New York.\nNew York precedents are thus outside of the lines presented by our legislation. The Dominion Statutes have always been, and the law of the Province of Canada was from 1859 onwards, just as we find it in the Railway Act, and the Government Railways Act in the R. S. C., that is to say with a direction, under the subject of fines, to make gates, &c., at farm crossings, but without any direction on the subject of furnishing crossings. Such a direction, if it were to be found, would properly be looked for under some other heading than \"fences.\"\nL rd Chelmsford remarked in Hammersmith Railway Company v. Brand[23]:\u2014 That the sections of the Railway Clauses Act are arranged under different heads which indicate the general objects of the provisions immediately following, and these may be usefully referred to to determine the sense of any doubtful expression in a section arranged under a particular heading.\nThe same learned lord had used similar language, as had also Bramwell, B. and Lord Wensleydale, in Eastern Counties &c. Companies v. Marriage[24].\nThe Government Railways Act must of course be construed according to the natural and proper meaning of its own language. The considerations which influenced the original decisions in Upper Canada on the Railway Act of 1851 have no place in the discussion, and any interest they have is chiefly historical.\nIn Quebec the legislature has taken a different course, but in departing from the language of the Dominion acts, it recognises the effect of those acts as being what I understand it to be.\nThe Quebec Railway Act, 1869, followed the Dominion Railway Act, 1868, in adopting the language of the English version of the Consolidated Statute, ch. 66, which provided for gates, &c., \"at farm crossings of the railway;\" but this was altered in 1875 by 38 Vic. ch. 42, (Q.) which returned to the original form of words, substituting \"and farm crossings\" for \"at farm crossings,\" and adding a positive enactment which is probably somewhat vague, and the English version of which is translated (not very happily) from the French, that \"farm crossings shall be made and maintained by the company upon the application of any owner of land, present or future, on each such land.\"\nSo the law of Quebec remains as to railway companies incorporated under the General Railway Act of that province[25], and such is now the law applicable under the Railway Act of 1888 to all railways subject to the legislative authority of the Dominion, except government railways.\nThe Railway Act, 51 Vic. ch. 29, sec. 191, declares that\nEvery company shall make crossings for persons across whose land the railway is carried, convenient and proper for the crossing of the railway by farmers' implements, carts and other vehicles.\nWe do not find this enactment associated with the provisions respecting fences in the act of 1888. It properly stands by itself, and I take it to confirm, as I before remarked, my reading of the sections by which gates are required in fences, at farm crossings, as not involving the duty to furnish or construct crossings.\nMr. Belleau was, in my opinion, correct in his contention that the uncertainty of the tenure of the way now used by V\u00e9zina, should have been considered in awarding the compensation, notwithstanding that it may, for the time being, serve his purposes well enough.\nI have no doubt that it is intended that V\u00e9zina shall have a crossing, and that on attention being called to the matter steps will be taken to secure him a sufficient right of way. That being done his claim for damages on this score will cease.\nApart from that question and the other question of damage to the remaining land from the proper use by the railway of that which is taken I should not disturb the award.\nI have felt inclined to remit the matter to the Exchequer Court for further consideration of those two points and to give an opportunity to have the crossing definitely settled. On reflection, however, I am satisfied that it will be better to close the litigation by ourselves adjusting the amounts. I would add to the present award two sums of five hundred dollars each, one being in respect of what has been called the operation of the railway, and the other in respect of the want of a farm crossing. These additions will make the award $3811.30. But in case the Government shall, within three months from the pronouncing of this judgment, confirm to the applicant the farm crossing which he at present uses, or another crossing with which he shall be satisfied, then no sum is to be allowed in respect of the crossing, and the award is to be for $3311.80.\nThe appeal is allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Belleau, Stafford & Belleau.\nSolicitors for respondent: Casgrain, Angers & Hamel.\n[1] 6 ed. pp. 460 et seq.\n[2] 32 L.

Ritchie C.J. and Fournier, Taschereau Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN\u2019S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA, (APPEAL SIDE.)\nArticle 451 G.C.P.\u2014Retraxit\u2014Subsequent action\u2014Document not proved at trial\u2014Consideration of on appeal\u2014Lis pendens and Res judicata Pleas of.\nThe Exchange Bank of Canada, in an action instituted by them against Gr. filed a withdrawal of a part of their demand in open court reserving their right to institute a subsequent action for the amount so withdrawn. The court acted on this retraxit, and gave judgment for the balance. This judgment was not appealed from. In a subsequent action for the amount so reserved:\nHeld\u2014reversing the judgment of the court below, Fournier J. dissenting, that the provisions of Art. 45i C.C.P. are applicable to a withdrawal made outside and without the interference of the court and cannot affect the validity of a withdrawal made in open court and with its permission.\n2. That it was too late in the second action to question the validity of the retraxit upon which the court had in the first action acted and rendered a judgment which was final and conclusive\nA document not proved at the trial but relied on in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for the first time cannot be relied on or made part of the care in appeal Montreal L & M. (Jo v Fauteux (3 Can. S. C. R. 433) and Lyonnais v. Molson\u2019s Bank (10 Can. S. C. R. 527) followed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe questions arising for adjudication in this appeal proceed from a former action between the parties in which the bank sought to recover some $50,000 from the defendant on three distinct causes of action, namely, a balance of $8,000 on a promissory note for $42,000, a promissory note for $15,000 and a running account for some $29,000. On the trial of this action the plaintiffs found themselves unable to prove the items of the open account and also the $15,000 note and they filed the following notice:\nThe plaintiffs hereby declare, in order to avoid difficulties and expedite and obtain a judgment, that they withdraw, in the present action all portions of their demand except that in reference to the check for $420000, under, however, express reserve of their rights to institute actions upon the note for $15,000 ; and upon all the vouchers, documents and claims contained in the Exhibit No. 1, herein filed, and upon all other claims or demands they may have against the defendant, the whole without prejudice.\nAnd then proceeded on the $42,000 note and recovered a judgment for the balance claimed thereon. The court subsequently granted to the plaintiffs ace of their discontinuance and gave them leave to sue on the claims thereby withdrawn.\nIn the action brought pursuant to such leave on the $15,000 note and the running account the defendant pleaded, inter alia, lis pendens and chose jug\u00e9e, and on the trial he contended that the discontinuance had no effect, as part of a plaintiff's claim could not be withdrawn and afterwards sued on though the whole claim might ; or, if the withdrawal could be allowed it could only have effect by the requirements of the code being observed one of which is that the notice must be served on the defendant, which was not done in this case. The Court of Queen's Bench gave effect to this last objection and dismissed the action, reversing the judgment of the trial judge for the plaintiffs who then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMacmaster Q.C. for the appellants contended that article 451 of the Civil Code of Procedure requiring notice of withdrawal to be served is only directory and merely points out one mode of effecting a withdrawal. That there is abundant authority to show that it can be done in open court and then no service is required. Ryan v. Ward ([1]); Dalloz Rep. Gen. ([2]); Carr\u00e9 et Chauveau Proc. Civ. ([3]); Thomine-D\u00e9smazures C.P.C. ([4]); Favard de Langlade ([5]); Pigeau Proc. Civ. ([6]); Talansier c. Loyseau ([7]); Bioche Proc. Civ. ([8]). F. E. Gilman, respondent in person, contended that the authorities cited only applied to an abandonment of the whole cause of action. See articles 450, 451, 452, 453 C.P.C. That there was nothing to show that the discontinuance was filed in open court, and the whole claim was disposed of in the former action and so became chose jug\u00e9e and barred to the plaintiffs in this suit.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C J.\u2011I thinks this appeal should be allowed. I have been favored with a perusal of Mr. Justice Taschereau's notes with which I entirely concur. I think the retraxit was given in open court in the presence of the parties and did not require other notification, and was adjudicated on and allowed by the court and the judgment not appealed from.\nFOURNIER J. was of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons stated by the judges of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side).\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2011The Bank in the present action claims from Gilman $41,627.93 being, as they allege, due to them from Gilman as follows:\nPromissory Note, 12th July. 1832, $15,0000.00.\nAmount to balance Trust Account, 19,956.51.\nOrdinary Account\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u20266,671.42.\nTo this action the defendant pleaded as to the note want of consideration, and as to the other two items a general denial, coupled with an allegation that all that he owed to the bank had long been paid and satisfied. The defendant further pleaded -1st. Lis pendens. that the causes of action in the present suit were part of the cause of action, by plaintiffs, against him in a previous suit, which, he alleged was still pending ; 2nd, that there was chose jug\u00e9e in that first suit of the matters in issue in this suit\nTwo more contradictory pleas than these last two, it is impossible to imagine. If the first action referred to in these pleas is still pending, how can it justify a plea of res judicata ? If on the contrary it is determined, and res judicata, how can it justify a plea of lis pendens?\nThe Superior Court (Torrance J., June 26, 1886) dismissed all of the defendant's pleas, and gave judgment in favor of the bank for the full amount claimed but the Court of Appeal reversed that judgment and dismissed the action on the ground of lis pendens, as appears by the following consid\u00e9rant:\nConsidering that the respondent's declaration of discontinuance of suit, alleged by the respondent, in his answer to the first and second pleas of the said appellant to the present action, was not served upon the said appellant, as required by article 451 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and consequently that the delivery of the same into court and its production in the prothonotary's office was of no effect against the appellant under said article, and the judgment granting acte of such declaration was not acquiesced in by the appellant, nor was it final, nor chose jugee, as regards him, and in fact was afterwards set aside and could not make said discontinuance effective and said demand against the said appellant is still pending and undetermined in the court below From that judgment the bank now appeals. I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed. There was, when this action was instituted, no lis pendens as invoked by the defendant. The facts which gave rise to that plea are as follows:\u2014\nThe Exchange Bank, in January, 1884, sued Gilman for $52,37.92, the action being based\u2014\n1st. On a promissory note for $42,000, on which there remained unpaid a balance of $8,000.\n2nd. A promissory note for $15,000, signed by Mr. Gilman and given the bank for a deposit receipt for $15,000, issued by the bank, to be deposited with the Dominion Government for the execution of a contract.\n3rd. The balance due to the bank in connection with his trust and ordinary deposit accounts, $29,317. 22.\nTo the action so brought, the defendant pleaded that the $42,000 note \" was fully paid and satisfied.\" He pleaded special circumstances regarding the 115,000 which he pretended exempted him from the obligation to pay it and denied that he was indebted to the bank for any portion of the accounts for $29,317.\n3. The case came on for trial at enqu\u00eate and merits on the 30th May 1884 before Mr. Justice Mathieu. On that day and during the trial, the plaintiffs filed a withdrawal of a part of their claim as follows '.\nThe plaintiffs hereby declare, in order to avoid difficulties and expedite and obtain a judgment, that they withdraw in the present action all portions of their demand, except that in reference to the check for $42,000, under, however, express reserve of their rights to institute an action upon the note for $150000 and upon all the vouchers, documents and claims contained in the Exhibit\" No 1, \" herein fyled and upon all other claims or orders they may have against the defendant, the whole without prejudice.\nThe case then went \" en delib\u00e9r\u00e9\" with this withdrawal appearing on the face of the record, and on the 14th June following, 1884, Judge Mathieu gave judgment against Gilman for the $8000 due on the note for $42,000, granting acte, to the plaintiffs, of their withdrawal of the other items of their demand in the following terms :\nThe court having heard the parties by their counsel upon the merits of this cause, examined the proceedings, the evidence and proof of record seen the declaration made and filed by plaintiffs on the third teeth of May last past, whereby they withdraw in the present action all portions of their demand, except that in reference to the check (note) for forty-two thousand dollars, under, however, express reserve of their rights to reinstitute actions upon the note for fifteen thousand dollars, and upon, all the vouchers, documents and claims con tainted in Exhibit No. 1. filed in this cause, and upon all other claims and demands they may have against the defendant, and upon the whole duly deliberated :\nDoth grant cite to plaintiffs of their said declaration of withdrawal of portions of their demand as aforesaid.\nFrom this judgment the defendant appealed to the Court of Review, but that court unanimously confirmed Judge I Mathieu\u2019s decision. This judgment, of the Court of Review was a final judgment, no appeal lay therefrom.\nThe bank on the 4th of December, 1884, instituted the present action for the recovery of the balance of that part of their claim against Oilman which they had withdrawn in the suit determined by Judge Mathieu, under express reserve of their right to institute their present action, as stated above.\nIt is on the case so determined by Judge Mathieu that the defendant grounds his plea of litis pendens upon which the Court of Appeal has dismissed the action.\nIt appears from the extracts of the registers of the court printed in the case, that the withdrawal by plaintiffs of part of their claims in the first action, was made at the trial and in presence of the court. If that is so, it is clear that the procedure is unimpeachable. Art. 451 of the Code of Procedure purports only to permit of a withdrawal outside and without the interference of the court and a r\u00e9f\u00e9rence to section. 25, ch. 82 C.S.L.C. shows by the words therein e even in vacation'' that the enactment was made only for the purpose of allowing a withdrawal outside of the court. A withdrawal in court and with permission of the court, was always legal without that enactment : See Pigeau Proc\u00e9dure Civile ([9]).\nThe commentators under the corresponding articles of the French Code of Civil Procedure, 402, 403, are all unanimous in the conclusion that these articles are permissive only. Carr\u00e9 et Chauveau, Proc\u00e9dure Civile, says ([10]):\nLe d\u00e9sistement et l'acceptation peuvent-ils \u00eatre faits de toute autre mani\u00e8re que celle indiqu\u00e9e par l'article 402?\nL'affirmative parait r\u00e9sulter de ce que l'article est con\u00e7u en termes facultatifs: \"le d\u00e9sistement comme l'acceptation pent, etc., et non doit etc.\" Il peut donc \u00eatre fait de diff\u00e9rentes mani\u00e8res, par exemple : \u00e0 l'audience en pr\u00e9sence du juge qui en peut d\u00e9cerner acte ; mais il faut que le demandeur et le d\u00e9fendeur se trouvent \u00e0 l'audience en personne ou par des mandataires ; alors leur pr\u00e9sence est constat\u00e9e par le juge et sans qu'il soit besoin de signatures.\nLe contrat judiciaire est form\u00e9 parce qu'aucune loi n'exigeant que les parties on leurs fond\u00e9s de pouvoir signent leurs dires nilles arrangements qu'ils font \u00e0 l'audience, l'intervention du tribunal qui atteste et consacre ces arrangements suppl\u00e9e \u00e9minemment les signatures.\nThomine-D\u00e9smazures ([11]).\nIl pourrait encore \u00eatre fait \u00e0 l'audience, par 1 avoue qui demanderait acte du d\u00e9sistement de sa partie, en d\u00e9posant des conclusions d'elle ou de son fond\u00e9 de pouvoir.\nLa seconde condition est que l'acte de d\u00e9sistement soit signifie d'avou\u00e9 \u00e0 avou\u00e9. Cette seconde condition est ind\u00e9pendante de la validit\u00e9 de l'acte : elle ne doit \u00e9videment \u00eatre observ\u00e9e que quand il y a avou\u00e9 constitu\u00e9 de part et d'autre, et elle na pour but et pour effet que d'arr\u00eater le cours de la proc\u00e9dure et les frais ult\u00e9rieurs.\nJournal des avou\u00e9s ([12]).\nLe d\u00e9sistement peut \u00eatre accept\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience, et les juges ont le droit d'en donner acte sans qu'il soit besoin dune signification pr\u00e9alable d'avou\u00e9 \u00e0 avou\u00e9. C'est ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par la cour de Rennes, le 31 janvier 1811 : Attendu que l'article 402 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile, portant que le d\u00e9sistement peut \u00eatre fait et accept\u00e9 par un simple acte, signifi\u00e9 d'avou\u00e9 \u00e0 avou\u00e9, il en r\u00e9sulte que les parties ont la facult\u00e9 de faire et accepter le d\u00e9sistement de toute mani\u00e8re juridique.\nFavart de Langlade Vo.

Loyseau ([15]).\nLes juges peuvent valider un d\u00e9sistement r\u00e9gulier que la partie refuse d'accepter bien que ce refus soit fond\u00e9 sur cc que le d\u00e9sist\u00e2t s'est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 d'intenter une nouvelle action\nI may also refer to Favard de Langlade ([16]). Boncenne ([17]) and to the case of RYAN V WARD ([18]) and to the remarks of the judges therein.\nThe respondent however contends that the withdrawal in question was not made in open court and that consequently it has no effect against him, not having been served upon him under Art. 451 C. C. P.\nI do not attach much importance to this, taking it for granted that it was so. Judgment has been passed upon it in that first action: that judgment is final and conclusive. The withdrawal of a portion of the demand, under reserve of the right of instituting a new action therefor has been sanctioned and allowed by the court. In that case and in that case alone could that question be determined. The judgment of the court in that case cannot be reviewed in this case. The court in that former case might have refused to admit that conditional withdrawal and either remit the case for further evidence or dismiss the action for the part thereof not proved ; but not having done so, and having allowed the plaintiffs' withdrawal, I do not see how in this case we can review that decision. That judgment stands, and to argue that there is lis pendens now because the plaintiffs demand from the defendant that portion of their claim which they withdrew on the first action seems to me untenable. How can a case upon which a final judgment has been passed be said to be pending? And, on the other hand, how can the defendant contend that there is res judicata in his favor as to the claim withdrawn in the first case by permission of the court, with reserve of the right by the plaintiffs to institute a new action thereof? That claim has not been dismissed has never been adjudicated upon. The only claim determined in that first action was the one of $8000.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal alludes to the fact that the judgment on the first action has since been set aside on a requite civile for want of stamps on the promissory note for which the plaintiffs had recovered. I think this fact was erroneously taken into consideration. There is no issue of that kind on the record, and the copy of the judgment as setting aside the first judgment was irregularly introduced in the record in the Court of Appeal. It could not have been invoked in the Superior Court for the good reason that it was rendered on the 22nd December, 1887 more than a year after the judgment of the said Superior Court. And the Court of Appeal could not stave a judgment which the Superior Court could not have given, or take into consideration, as a ground of their judgment, a fact which did not exist when the Superior Court pronounced its judgment ([19]). Moreover, by the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the requite civile, the only case remitted to the court below was the case on the $8,000. The withdrawal as to the other items of the plaintiffs' claim remained in full force. The plaintiffs having instituted the present action as to these items, could not have been allowed in the Superior Court, to desist from that withdrawal.\nAs to the evidence of the plaintiffs' claims, the Superior Court, as I have remarked, has granted them the full amount demanded by the action, $41,627. At the argument, the plaintiffs, however, agreed to take a judgment for $25,000. I think that the evidence fully justifies a judgment for that amount with interest from 4th December, 1884, and costs distrait.\nGwynne and Patterson JJ. concurred with Taschereau J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Macmaster, Hutchinson & MacLennan.\nSolicitor for respondent: J.

After the completion of the bridge a final estimate was given by the chief engineer, and payment thereof made, but S. et al. preferred a claim for the value of work, not included in such final estimate, alleged to have been done in the construction of the bridge, and caused by changes and alterations ordered by the chief engineer of so radical a nature as to create, according to the contention of the claimants, a new contract between the parties.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of Henry J. in the Exchequer, Fournier J. dissenting, that the engineer could not make a new contract binding on the crown; that the claim came within the original contract and the provisions thereof which made the certificate of the chief engineer a condition precedent to recovery, and such certificate not having been obtained, the claim must be dismissed. The Crown having referred the claim to arbitration instead of insisting throughout on its strict legal rights, no costs were allowed.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada (Henry J.)[1], setting aside the award of the official arbitrators, and allowing the respondents (claimants) the sum of $11,393.71,\nThe claim in this case arose out of a contract for constructing a bridge across the Ottawa River at Des Joachims, for the lump sum of $25,300. The bridge was completed by the respondents in the summer of 1885, and in the month of August of that year, the chief engineer of the Department of Public Works made out and certified, under contract, the final estimate of the contractors in respect to the work on the bridge at $41,896.50, and the balance due upon that certificate was paid to the respondents in October of the said year of 1885.\nThe respondents after the completion of the bridge presented a claim to the Department of Public Works, claiming the sum of $81,100.17 as the value of the work done by them, alleging that the chief engineer had made such radical changes in the plan of the work that the original contract was virtually superseded and they requested the department to recommend to the Government of Canada the payment of this sum, after deducting the amount of the said final certificate of $41,896.50, and they asked that in the event of their claim not being so entertained and paid it should be referred to the board of official arbitrators for their award, and on or about the 29th day of December, 1885, the said claim was duly referred by the said Department of Public Works to the board of official arbitrators for investigation and award.\nThe claim was heard by the said arbitrators in the month of November, 1886, when evidence both on the part of the claimants and the crown was submitted, and on the 8th day of December following the arbitrators made and published their award in the matter.\nThe award as made by the arbitrators was for the sum of $44,279.\nThe contractors not being satisfied with the award as made appealed therefrom to the Exchequer Court of Canada, and by their notice of appeal they in effect asked the court to declare that the sum awarded by the official arbitrators, was a balance due them by the crown in respect to the said bridge works, after deducting all previous payments made to them, and they asked to have the award amended in such manner as to carry into effect their request that the amount awarded should be declared a balance due to the contractors over and above all payments already made.\nA cross-appeal was taken on behalf of the crown by which it was contended that the claimants were not entitled to be paid any sum upon their claim, and that it was clear that the amount awarded was intended to be, and was in fact, in full payment and satisfaction of all the work performed on the bridge, and that from the said sum so awarded should be deducted all payments previously made to the contractors, which would leave the amount the arbitrators intended to award to be the sum of $2,382.50, and in support of the latter contention the arbitrators filed affidavits, stating in effect that their intention was that the award was in full of all work done by the contractors on the bridge works, from which was to be deducted the amount of the chief engineer's certificate, leaving the balance only to be paid to the respondents.\nThe appeal and cross-appeal came on for hearing in the Exchequer Court before His Lordship Mr. Justice Henry, when His Lordship stated that he would in the first place hear argument upon the question of the validity of the award which was then proceeded with, and on a subsequent day His Lordship gave his judgment setting aside the award, and he then announced that the case being open he would hear arguments on the whole case and dispose of it on the evidence in the same manner, and as if no award had ever been made, and such argument having taken place judgment was reserved, and on the 10th day of October, 1887, His Lordship rendered his judgment, by which he ordered and adjudged that Her Majesty should pay to the respondents the sum of $11,393.71 in full of all claims against the crown. From this judgment Her Majesty appealed to this court, and contended that the said judgment was not warranted by the evidence in the case or the law respecting it.\nThe respondents filed notice of cross-appeal.\nThe principal clauses of the contract are the following:\u2014\n4. That the several parts of the contract shall be taken together, to explain each other, and to make the whole consistent; and if it be found that anything has been omitted or mis-stated which is necessary for the proper performance and completion of any part of the work contemplated, either in the drawings hereinbefore referred to or the specification hereunto annexed, the explanation and interpretation given by the Chief Engineer shall be received and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the contractors, and the contractors will, at their own expense, execute the same as though it had been properly described, and the correction of any such error or omission shall not be deemed to be an addition to or deviation from the works hereby contracted for.\n5. The engineer shall be at liberty at any time either before the commencement or during the construction of the works or any portion thereof, to order any extra work to be done and to make any changes which he may deem expedient in the dimensions, character, nature, location or position of the works or any part or parts thereof, or in any other thing connected with the works whether or not such changes increase or diminish the work to be done or the cost of doing the same, and the contractors shall immediately comply with all the written requisitions of the engineer in that behalf, but the contractors shall not make any change in or addition to, or omission or deviation from the works, and shall not be entitled to any payment for any change, addition, omission, deviation or any extra work, unless such change, addition, omission, deviation, or any extra work shall have been first directed in writing by the engineer, and notified to the contractors in writing, nor unless the price to be paid for any addition or extra work shall have been previously fixed by the engineer in writing, and approved of by the Minister of Public Works for the time being, and the decision of the engineer as to whether any such change or deviation increases or diminishes the cost of the work, and as to the amount to be paid or deducted, as the case may be, in respect thereof, shall be final, and the obtaining of his decision in writing as to such amount shall be a condition precedent to the right of the contractors to be paid therefor. If any such change or alteration constitutes, in the opinion of the said engineer, a deduction from the works, his decision as to the amount to be deducted on account thereof shall be final and binding.\n6. That all the clauses of this contract shall apply to any changes, additions deviations or extra work, in like manner, and to the same extent as to the works contracted for, and no changes, additions, deviations or extra work shall annul or invalidate this contract.\n7. That if any change or deviation in or omission from the works be made by which the amount of work to be done shall be decreased, no compensation shall be claimable by the contractors for any loss of anticipated profits in respect thereof.\n8. That the engineer shall be the sole judge of work and material in respect of both quantity and quality, and his decision on all questions in dispute with regard to work or material, or as to the meaning or intention of this contract and the plans, specifications and drawings shall be final, and no works or extra or additional works and changes shall be deemed to have been executed, nor shall the contractors be entitled to payment for the same unless the same shall have been executed to the satisfaction of the engineer, as evidenced by his certificate in writing, which certificate shall be a condition precedent to the right of the contractors to be paid therefor.\n25. Cash payments equal to about ninety per cent. of the value of the work done, approximately made up from returns of progress measurements and computed at the prices agreed upon or determined under the provisions of this contract, will be made to the contractors monthly if practicable, on the written certificate of the Engineer that the work for, or on account of which the certificate is granted, has been duly executed to his satisfaction, and stating the value of such work computed as above mentioned, and upon approval of such certificate by the Minister of Public Works for the time being for the Dominion of Canada, and the said certificate and such approval thereof shall be a condition precedent to the right of the contractors to be paid the said ninety per cent. or any part thereof. The remaining ten per cent. shall be retained till the final completion of the whole work to the satisfaction of the chief engineer for the time being, having control over the work, and within two months after such completion the remaining ten per cent. will be paid. And it is hereby declared that the written certificate of the said Engineer certifying to the final completion of said works to his satisfaction shall be a condition precedent to the right of the contractors to receive or be paid the said remaining ten per cent., or any part thereof.\n26. It is intended that every allowance to which the contractors are fairly entitled will be embraced in the Engineer's monthly certificates; but should the contractors at any time have claims of any description which they consider are not included in the progress certificates, it will be necessary for them to make and repeat such claims in writing to the engineer within fourteen days after the date of each and every certificate in which they allege such claims to have been omitted.\n27. The contractors in presenting claims of the kind referred to in the last clause, must accompany them with satisfactory evidence of their accuracy, and the reason why they think they should be allowed. Unless such claims are thus made during the progress of the work, within fourteen days, as in the preceding clause, and repeated in writing every month, until finally adjusted or rejected, it must be clearly understood that they shall be forever shut out, and the contractors shall have no claim on Her Majesty in respect thereof.\n34. It is hereby agreed that all matters of difference arising between the parties hereto, upon any matter connected with, or arising out of this contract, the decision whereof is not hereby specially given to the Engineer, shall be referred to the award and arbitration of the Chief Engineer for the time being having control over the works, and the award of such engineer shall be final and conclusive; and it is hereby declared that such award shall be a condition precedent to the right of the contractors to receive or be paid any sum or sums on account or by reason of such matters in difference.\n35. It is distinctly declared that no implied contract of any kind whatsoever, by or on behalf of Her Majesty, shall arise or be implied from anything in this contract contained, or from any position or situation of the parties at any time, being clearly understood and agreed that the express contracts, covenants and agreements herein contained and made by Her Majesty, are and shall be the only contracts, covenants and agreements upon which any rights against her are to be founded.\nHogg Q. C., for appellant.\u2014The only contract that could be made binding on Her Majesty for such a work as the construction of this bridge, is a contract made in pursuance of the 7th section of the Public Works Act, 31 Vic. ch. 12, which must be \"signed and sealed by \"the Minister of Public Works or his deputy and \"countersigned by the secretary,\" and the contract of the 8th September, 1882, was so executed, so that the contract which the suppliants say superseded the contract of the 8th day of September, 1882, could not, if it ever had any existence, be binding upon Her Majesty. Wood v. The Queen[2]; O'Brien v. The Queen[3].\nUnder the provisions of the contract, the court would have no power to order payment of any sum beyond what the engineer had certified. Emden on building contracts,[4]; Jones v. The Queen[5]. By the 35th clause of the contract, no implied contract can in any way arise between the respondents and the crown in respect to the work. It is therefore quite plain, that the only contract binding on either party, is the contract of the 8th September, 1882. See O'Brien v. The Queen[6]; Sharpe v. San Paulo Ry Co.[7].\nHowever, the evidence shows that the respondents have been liberally paid for all the work done by them upon the bridge, both as regards the work alleged to have been contracted for, and the extra or additional work caused by changes and alterations in the designs and works as finished.\nO'Gara Q. C. for respondents.\u2014The plans and the evidence show there was a radical difference between the bridge contracted for by the contract made in 1882, and the one actually built, and the fact of the department accepting the work and, when the respondents put in their claim, agreeing to refer the matter to arbitration, is evidence that the written contract was set aside.\nBut it is now urged that the respondents should get nothing. 1st. Because there was no contract in writing between the respondents and the Minister authorizing the work or changes. 2nd. There is no certificate of the Government engineers allowing the amount.\nBy the Public Works Act, 31 Vic. ch. 12, secs. 10 and 15, Parliament has entrusted to the Minister of Public Works the absolute control of the erection of bridges, &c. 35 Vic. ch. 24, sec. 1, again repeats this.\n42 Vic. ch. 7, sec. 4, divides the Public Works Department into two departments\u2014Railways and Canals and Public Works\u2014and sec. 5 defines their duties, and to the latter department is again given the absolute jurisdiction to erect bridges, &c.\nSec. 10 defines the duties of the chief engineer, &c.\nThe Minister of Public Works having by these acts the absolute authority to undertake the work, the provisions in the subsequent sections of these acts are only for the guidance and direction of the Minister himself. They cannot take away the power conferred by the previous clauses.\nAs regulations for the working of the department they do not affect the outside public, and even if they did, they could be waived, as they were in this case: 1\u00b0 by the conduct of the department, the chief engineer and the Minister, in making payments on account of the work from time to time.\n2nd. By the Minister and chief engineer advising an arbitration.\n3rd. By the order in council referring to arbitration.\n4th. By the letter of the department enclosing the account to the arbitrators.\nSee Park Gate Co. v. Coates[8], which shows that negative words in a statute do not take away a power conferred by a prior clause, and that the provisions contained in these negative clauses are only directory and may be waived.\nSec. 20 of ch. 12, 31 Vic. provides that tenders are to be always invited unless there is a pressing emergency.\nSec. 6 defines the duty of the chief engineer. Sec. 34 provides for the reference of disputed claims to arbitration.\nSec. 36. No arbitration is allowed where it is the duty of the Minister or of the engineer to determine the matter themselves.\nThe statutes do not declare that there is to be no claim for work done unless there is a writing executed by the Minister.\nSec. 7. No deeds, contracts, documents, or writing shall be deemed to be binding, &c., unless executed in a certain way. The word \"contract\" in that section means, from the context in which the word is found, a writing of some kind on which it might be sought to enforce some claim as for the breach of an executory contract.\nThat clause does not apply here, as this claim is not brought for a breach of an executory contract.\nThe claim being for work done and accepted the Government is liable, because:\n1st. The certificate of the engineer is not necessary. The work is not done under the old contract, and the new agreement made did not require a certificate.\n2nd. The Government engineer, by his certificate of the 5th January, 1885, had certified the value of the work to the department to be $39,000, and having thus, previously to all the work being done, bound himself to a particular sum, with the knowledge and at the request of the department, he has become unfit to act as an unbiassed judge. Kimberley v. Dick[9], Kemp v Rose[10].\n3rd. Even if the old contract applied, it was waived by the department by the reference to arbitration. See Parke Gate Co. v. Coates[11].\n4th. As by section 36 of ch. 12, aforesaid, no arbitration can be allowed where it is the duty of the Engineer or Minister to settle the matter, the allowance of the arbitration by the Minister and Government shows conclusively that the Government and the Minister and his agents did not consider that any certificate was required, or that it was the duty of the Minister to give a final certificate, otherwise they would, by permitting an arbitration, be violating the statute itself, which must not be supposed or should not be urged on their behalf.\n5th. The chief engineer, moreover, shows in his evidence that he made out his prices without ever seeing the work, making any inquiries as to the value of materials there, the difficulties of the place, &c., all which showed such gross carelessness and disregard of the rights of the respondents as to amount to fraud, and such misconduct renders him unfit to be an umpire.\n6th. The chief engineer, in giving his estimate, disregarded the contract, calculating the price of the works at a scale of prices fixed by himself according to measurements, and not the contract price.\nThe respondents then should be allowed to recover, and the amount they are entitled to is a matter of detail, and a final certificate is not required.\nWhen the case was before Mr. Justice Henry in the Exchequer Court that learned judge only allowed the respondents for their expenditure and $3,000 for loss of time.\nOn the cross-appeal, I submit that the claimants should be allowed for their work the prices established, namely: $61,905.85 for the bridge as it stands, and $18,195.22 for their other claims, which they incurred by reason of the changes and the instructions from time to time given to them by the officers of the Department of Public Works. Hogg Q.C., in reply, referred to sec. 41 of the Public Works Act, 31 Vic. ch. 12, which provides, that \"in \"awarding upon any claim arising out of any contract \"in writing, the arbitrators shall decide in accordance \"with the stipulations in such contract, and not award \"compensation to any claimant on the ground that he \"expended a larger sum of money in the performance \"of his contract than the amount stipulated therein;\" and pointed out that while the amount stipulated in this contract was the sum of $25,300, that sum was increased by reason of extra work caused by changes and alterations in the character of the structure, to the sum of $41,896.50, which latter sum must be taken under the provisions of this section to be the amount stipulated in the contract.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J., after stating the facts as hereinbefore set out, proceeded as follows:\u2014\nThe claimants in this case claim that the position of the bridge contracted for was changed and that radical changes were made in the plan of the bridge. There is no doubt that the position of the bridge was changed and that great changes and alterations took place in the character and nature of the works, but it was in consequence of these changes and alterations that the chief engineer made out under the requirements of the contract a final certificate and allowed the contractors $41,896.50 instead of $25,300.\nIt has been contended that the engineer and contractors had altered the original contract, in fact, had put it aside and that there was a new contract. But neither the engineer nor contractor could put an end to the contract and make a fresh verbal contract binding upon the crown. The work clearly was done under the contract and it must be governed by the provisions of the contract. As to the contention that there was an implied contract, there is an express provision declaring that there could be no implied contract. The contract that binds the parties is that of the 8th September, 1882, and under that contract the engineer's certificate is indispensable. These clauses 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 25, 26, 27, 34 and 35 cannot be got over, and the final estimate and certificate having been paid, the contractors can have no further claim.\nThe only objection the crown appears to have raised in the first instance to the award was that the amount of the certificate, $41,896.50, should be deducted from the amount awarded by the arbitrators $44,279.32, leaving a balance of $2,382.82. The contractors claimed that the award was in addition to the certificate and the crown claimed that the payment of the certificate should be deducted, leaving the above amount $2,382.82. Had this been acquiesced in by the contractors, in all probability the controversy would have been at an end. Had the crown intended to rely on its strict legal rights, as it has done throughout this case, this matter should never have been sent to the arbitrators, for in such a case there was nothing for the arbitrators to adjudicate on, and this reference caused all the subsequent litigation. If the circumstances could have permitted me to come to the relief of the respondents, I should have been disposed to allow the contractors the balance of $2,482.82, but the crown insisting on its strict legal rights I am bound to give them. While conceding to these rights which we are bound to do, we can only mark our disapproval of this reference, in consequence of which these claimants have been put to the enormous expenses of this litigation, by depriving the crown of costs in any of the courts. FOURNIER J.\u2014En 1882, les intim\u00e9s ont contract\u00e9 \u00e0 forfait avec le d\u00e9partement des Travaux Publics pour la construction d'un pont sur l'Ottawa au-dessus de Pembroke, aux rapides des Joachims, pour le prix de $25,300. Le pont devait \u00eatre en bois, construit dans un endroit sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9, avec deux cul\u00e9es, six piliers et sept arches (spans), suivant certains plans et sp\u00e9cifications.\nDans l'hiver suivant, les intim\u00e9s se procur\u00e8rent \u00e0 grand frais les mat\u00e9riaux n\u00e9cessaires. Ils se pr\u00e9paraient \u00e0 commencer l'ouvrage dans le mois d'avril suivant, lorsque le d\u00e9partement, \u00e0 la demande des intim\u00e9s, envoya sur les lieux un ing\u00e9nieur pour localiser l'endroit des piliers et des cul\u00e9es du pont. Cet ing\u00e9nieur constata que l'endroit choisi par l'ing\u00e9nieur Austin employ\u00e9 \u00e0 cet effet par le d\u00e9partement ne convenait aucunement et que les plans et sp\u00e9cification qu'il avait faits ne pouvaient nullement servir \u00e0 cette construction, et il en fit rapport \u00e0 l'ing\u00e9nieur-en-chef, qui, avec l'appropation du d\u00e9partement, les changea tellement qu'il fallut faire une construction tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rente de celle originairement projet\u00e9e et beaucoup plus co\u00fbteuse.\nDe nouveaux plans et sp\u00e9cification furent donn\u00e9s aux intim\u00e9s par Perley, l'ing\u00e9nieur-en-chef, avec instruction de s'y conformer dans la construction du nouvel ouvrage\u2014les prix des ouvrages devant \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9s plus tard. En cons\u00e9quence de ce nouvel arrangement, les con tracteurs se mirent \u00e0 l'\u0153uvre et s'acquitt\u00e8rent avec diligence de la t\u00e2che qu'ils avaient ainsi accept\u00e9e.\nPlusieurs t\u00e9moins, ainsi que l'ing\u00e9nieur Perley, prouvent que tel a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'arrangement pour la construction du pont apr\u00e8s que le contrat originaire et les premiers plans et sp\u00e9cification eurent \u00e9t\u00e9 mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9. Si les intim\u00e9s eussent insist\u00e9 sur l'ex\u00e9cution des ouvrages du premier contrat, comme ils en avaient le droit, le gouvernement ne pouvait les faire ex\u00e9cuter \u00e0 cause de l'imperfection des plans et sp\u00e9cification, et aurait eu, dans ce cas, des dommages \u00e0 leur payer.\nC'est alors que sur les repr\u00e9sentations des officiers du d\u00e9partement, ils renonc\u00e8rent \u00e0 ce premier contrat et s'engag\u00e8rent, \u00e0 la demande de l'ing\u00e9nieur-en-chef, \u00e0 construire un pont d'apr\u00e8s des nouveaux plans et sp\u00e9cification qui devaient leur \u00eatre fournis. L'ouvrage a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ces nouveaux plans et sp\u00e9cification, et leur pr\u00e9sente demande a pour objet d'\u00eatre pay\u00e9s de la balance qu'ils r\u00e9clament comme leur \u00e9tant due sur la valeur de ces ouvrages.\nLa construction qu'ils ont eu \u00e0 faire est essentiellement diff\u00e9rente de celle mentionn\u00e9e au premier contrat. Hamel, l'ing\u00e9nieur qui a fait les nouveaux plans, ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, dit \u00e0 ce sujet:\u2014\nThere was evidently an error in the original plans. In September, 1883, I got orders to change the site of the piers. I found original plan would not do.\nPerley dit:\nIn August, 1883, difficulty as to finding centre line, I got Austin to go and pick up centre line and the work proceeded. When we found that Austin's soundings, were wrong we took fresh soundings and revised the bridge and readjusted the spans to suit the altered circumstances. I never saw the work, but I was in the locality before the work was begun. The contractors were paid the progress estimates as the work went on. I never had such radical changes as there was in this contract. Before making out my final estimate, I asked the contracture for a detailed statement of their claim, but I did not get it before making final estimate.\nO'Hanly, l'un des intim\u00e9s qui est lui-m\u00eame un ing\u00e9nieur civil, dit en parlant de ces changements:\nThe whole thing was changed. There was a new location of the piers and abutments, the lengths of the spans and the number of the spans. The result was to put the piers in a much greater depth of water than the original.\nBeing asked to specify the depth, he answers:\nWhere there was five feet of water shown on the plan, there was 20 feet. Of course the bottom was very irregular at the time. I have soundings of the whole to show.\nIl est inutile d'entrer dans le d\u00e9tail des diff\u00e9rences entre les deux plans de construction de ce pont, les diff\u00e9rences sont bien \u00e9tablies par la preuve et mentionn\u00e9es en d\u00e9tail dans l'exhibit du dossier. Elles sont tellement consid\u00e9rables qu'apr\u00e8s les avoir indiqu\u00e9es sp\u00e9cialement, l'ing\u00e9nieur Bell, employ\u00e9 du d\u00e9partement dit:\nThey bear a certain resemblance to each other. They are both made of wood, but they are different structures.\nQ. You could not, in other words, take out of the second plan the first one, say so much is extra and so much is according to the original plan.\nOh, no.\nLa difference dans le co\u00fbt des deux plans est \u00e9galement donn\u00e9e et elle est beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e dans le deuxi\u00e8me (celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9) que dans le premier.\nEn cons\u00e9quence de ces changements, il \u00e9tait absolument impossible d'ex\u00e9cuter le premier plan conform\u00e9ment au contrat. Le d\u00e9lai pour son ex\u00e9cution \u00e9tait m\u00eame expir\u00e9 et le contrat avait cess\u00e9 d'exister lorsque les nouveaux plans et sp\u00e9cification pour l'ouvrage ex\u00e9cut\u00e9, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis aux intim\u00e9s.\nDans cette situation d'affaire, l'intim\u00e9 O'Hanly s'adressa \u00e0 M. Perley, l'ing\u00e9nieur-en-chef, pour conna\u00eetre d'apr\u00e8s quel arrangement se ferait l'ouvrage du deuxi\u00e8me plan. Voici comment il rapporte ses entretiens \u00e0 ce sujet avec Perley:\nQ. What did you say to him?\nA. I said to Mr. Perley, everything being radically changed there was not a shred left of the original design: and I asked him now as we had neither plans nor anything to guide us whether we would have a written order for everything we did.\nQ. What did Mr. Perley say?\nA. Mr. Perley said that the whole design having been entirely recast and radically changed altogether, that now, to go on and do whatever we were ordered verbally or otherwise. Q. And leave the prices to be settled afterward?\nA. There was nothing said about prices; but I wanted to know how we stood, and this is the answer I got.\nBy Mr. Cowan.\nQ. Repeat it.\nA. That work having been entirely changed, and everything in connection with it re-cast, and the designs being set aside, and no designs being yet ready, we were to do whatever we were ordered by the inspector or the engineer in charge.\nBy Mr. O'Gara.\nQ. There is no difficulty between you and Mr. Perley as to that?\nA. I think not; I am not aware of any.\nQ. Will you look at the paper, Mr. Perley's report of the 25th January, 1885, when he was asked to state why the money paid exceeded the original contract?\nA. I have read it.\nQ. That admits the fact that things were changed, and that the original plans were all wrong and had to be recast?\nA. Yes, it admits it; as a necessity they had to do it.\nQ. And that before he had to do the best he could to provide additional money to complete the structure.\nA. Yes. (Report filed as exhibit \"I.\")\nQ. When did you get any plans upon that?\nA. We got no detailed plans at all of any pier from beginning to end. We got a plan of the first span in January 1884; and we got a plan of the remaining spans in the end of March 1884. We never got any plan of the sub-structure at all.\nQ. You have those plans?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Have you got them here?\nA. No.\nQ. When were you made aware of the sizes of the piers and changes in the abutment?\nA. Just as the work went on. Wherever they located it they told us to build there.\nQ. And gave you the description and sizes &c.?\nA. Yes, and sometimes they got no sizes to work on, as the inspector told us. The inspector was changing every day.\nQ. What effect had those changes upon the first material that you got out?\nA. The timber and iron, a great deal of it, was valueless in consequence of the changes, worthless to us.\nQ. And where did you get the material for the new design? A. We had to hunt round everywhere we could, and from the lumbermen principally we got what we required for the design for the new piers.\nQ. You had to pick it up wherever you could?\nA. Yes, from the lumbermen.\nQ. Had you any time to get it cut in the woods?\nA. No, there was no chance of getting it out that season. It was impossible.\nA. You were getting orders gradually, and you had to give the orders gradually for the timber?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Is there any difference in the expense to yourself of timber so acquired and of timber got out regularly by contract in the woods?\nA. There is a great difference, oftentimes double the price besides the loss of time and trouble the expense in hunting round for it, getting a little here and a little there.\nQ. What was the result in this particular case?\nA. It nearly doubled the price.\nQ. What was the effect of it upon your iron?\nA. A great deal of the iron was worthless. We could not use it at all. When the spans were changed, bolts for the one would not do for the other.\nQ. You said that after these changes were ordered and the new piers were to be put in that you saw Mr. Perley and told him about the changes and difficulties that were going to take place?\nA. I do not know if I said difficulties or not.\nQ. You said there was a new class of work which would be more difficult to do, etc., and that he told you to go on and what you were ordered?\nA. Yes, that is the answer he made. He said that the whole work was changed and that we were to carry out the instructions of the inspector and engineer in charge.\nQ. Did he say that you were to carry out the instructions of the engineer and inspector because the work was changed?\nA. Yes; because the work was radically changed, he said.\nQ. Did you infer from that that you were to carry out the orders of the inspector and engineer whether the work was changed or not\u2014under your contract originally?\nA. No, of course we knew that under the contract and specification we had to carry out the instructions of the engineer, but that was another thing altogether.\nQ. I want to get the exact words that Mr. Perley said, that because the work was changed radically you must go and carry out the work under the instructions of the engineer and inspector. A. I went to Mr. Perley specially to ask him whether, as everything had been changed, the whole character of the work changed, would it be necessary for us to have a written order for everything that was to be done. He said, no, in consequence of this entire change, you will have to carry out every instruction that you will get either from the engineer in charge or the inspector. \"All right,\" I said.\nC'est d'apr\u00e8s l'arrangement mentionn\u00e9 dans ce t\u00e9moignage que l'ouvrage en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Plusieurs autres t\u00e9moins font preuve que c'est sous la direction imm\u00e9diate du d\u00e9partement et sans aucun contrat en forme, comme il en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait un pour l'ex\u00e9cution du premier projet, que le deuxi\u00e8me plan a \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9.\nDans un cas semblable, quelle est la responsabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9partement des Travaux Publics vis-\u00e0-vis des intim\u00e9s? Est-il vrai qu'en l'absence d'un contrat par \u00e9crit entre le ministre des Travaux Publics et les intim\u00e9s, ceux-ci n'ont droit de rien r\u00e9clamer pour la valeur de leur ouvrage et des mat\u00e9riaux fournis? Est-il n\u00e9cessaire, dans le cas actuel, qu'ils produisent comme condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l'exercice de leur action, un certificat de l'ing\u00e9nieur-en-chef des travaux en question?\nA cette derni\u00e8re question, je r\u00e9pondrai de suite qu'on ne peut exiger dans ce cas la production d'un tel certificat, parce qu'il n'y a eu aucune condition \u00e0 ce sujet dans l'arrangement en vertu duquel les travaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits. Il est vrai qu'il en existait une dans le premier contrat, mais ce contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement abandonn\u00e9 et remplac\u00e9 par une entreprise toute diff\u00e9rente, dont les travaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s sous la direction imm\u00e9diate du d\u00e9partement et sans contrat par \u00e9crit.\nEn outre, il n'est pas inutile de faire remarquer que l'ing\u00e9nieur-en-chef d\u00e9clare dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il n'a eu aucune connaissance personnelle des ouvrages.; qu'il n'est all\u00e9 sur les lieux qu'une seule fois, et ce avant le commencement des travaux. Quel certificat pouvait-il donner? Heureusement pour les intim\u00e9s que ce certificat n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire dans le cas actuel et qu'on ne peut leur opposer les d\u00e9cisions rendues en d'autres cas, o\u00f9 il existait une condition \u00e0 ce sujet.\nL'autre question semble au premier abord beaucoup plus difficile \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre, en cons\u00e9quence de certaines dispositions des actes concernant les travaux publics. Elle s'est toutefois d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e devant la cour d'Echiquier, dans la cause de Wood v. La Reine,[12] dans laquelle Sir William Richards ex-juge en chef de cette cour se fait deux questions tendant \u00e0 d\u00e9finir la responsabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9partement des Travaux Publics.\nElles \u00e9taient pos\u00e9es comme suit:\u2014\nCan the crown in this Dominion be made responsible under a petition of right, on an executory contract entered into by the Department of Public Works, for the performance of certain works placed by law under the control of that department, when the agreement therefor was not in writing, nor signed or sealed by the Minister of Public Works or his Deputy, or countersigned by the secretary?\nIf work had been done for and at the request of the Department, will a petition of right lie for the value of such, which causes an expenditure not previously sanctioned by Parliament?\nLa loi alors en force, la 31 Vict. ch. 12, est encore la m\u00eame, avec certaines modifications faites par la 42 Vict. ch. Y, qui a divis\u00e9 en deux le d\u00e9partement des Travaux Publics pour en faire le d\u00e9partment des canaux et chemins de fer et celui des Travaux Publics.\nLa section 11 de ce dernier acte d\u00e9clare bien qu'aucun contrat, document, ou \u00e9crit ne sera obligatoire pour l'un ou l'autre de ces deux d\u00e9partements, ou ne sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9 l'acte de tel d\u00e9partement \u00e0 moins d'\u00eatre sign\u00e9 et scell\u00e9 par lui ou son d\u00e9put\u00e9, et contresign\u00e9 par le secr\u00e9taire ou autre personne autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 cet effet. Cette disposition qui est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s la m\u00eame que la 31 Vict. ch. 12, est con\u00e7ue en ces termes:\u2014\nSec. 7. No deeds, contracts, documents or writings shall be deemed to be binding upon the Department, or shall be held to be the acts of the said Minister, unless signed and sealed by him or his deputy, and countersigned by the Secretary.\nLa comparaison des deux textes fait clairement voir que la loi n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9e en ce qui concerne la responsabilit\u00e9 du d\u00e9partement.\nL'honorable juge apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le contrat all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par Wood n'\u00e9tait pas obligatoire pour le d\u00e9partement, et que le p\u00e9titionnaire n'avait pas droit \u00e0 des dommages pour avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9 de l'ex\u00e9cuter, s'exprime comme suit sur la deuxi\u00e8me question qui est la m\u00eame que celle soulev\u00e9e en cette cause[13].\nI do not think, however, that the 7th section would prevent the suppliant recovering for the actual value of the work done by him and accepted by the department. I see no reason why the law may not imply a contract to pay for the work done in good faith, and which the department has received the benefit of. Suppose, instead of work done the contract had been to furnish a quantity of lumber, the lumber had been supplied and worked up by the workmen of the department in finishing one of the the public buildings; suppose for some reason the department repudiated the verbal contract and refused to be bound by it, could it be said that the property of the suppliant could be retained and used for the purposes of the department, and he not be paid for it, because the statute said the contract on which it was furnished was not deemed binding on the department. I should say not. The contract which is binding is that which arises from the nature of the transaction; having received the benefit of the contractor's property he ought to be paid for it\u2014under the new contract which the law implies. For the same reason, for the value of all services actually rendered by the suppliant, before he was notified not to do any further work, he ought to be paid. If only the 7th section were considered, I should, as at present advised, say the suppliant is entitled to recover what the services rendered by him were worth under the implied contract. It may be, that on further consideration my views as to the suppliant's right on this point would be less favorable.\nL'honorable juge, par ces derni\u00e8res expressions, fait allusion \u00e0 la 15\u00e8me section, d\u00e9fendant au ministre des travaux publics d'autoriser des d\u00e9penses qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9alablement sanctionn\u00e9es par le Parlement. La clause est en ces termes:\nThe minister shall direct the construction, maintenance and repairs of all canals, harbors, roads, or parts of roads, bridges, slides or other public works, or building in progress, or constructed or maintained, at the expense of Canada, and which by this Act are, or shall hereafter be, placed under his management and control; but nothing in this Act shall give authority to the minister to cause expenditure not previously sanctioned by Parliament, except for such repairs and alterations as the necessities of the public service may demand.\nL'honorable juge, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents et la pratique suivie en Angleterre \u00e0 ce sujet, en vient \u00e0 la conclusion qu'en vertu de cette section, si le Parlement n'a pas autoris\u00e9 la d\u00e9pense, il n'y a pas lieu \u00e0 la p\u00e9tition de droit pour ouvrage fait \u00e0 la r\u00e9quisition du d\u00e9partement des Travaux Publics, \u00e0 moins que ce ne soit pour des ouvrages de r\u00e9parations, et de changements rendus n\u00e9cessaires par les exigences du service public:\nUnless it be for work done in connection with repairs and alterations which the necessities of the public service demanded.\nThat in this case, if Parliament has made appropriations for these works and so sanctioned the expenditure, and if the work done was of the kind that might properly be executed by the officers and servants of the department, under section 20 of said Act, then no written contract would be necessary to bind the department, and suppliant could recover for work so done.\nLe principe ainsi pos\u00e9 par l'honorable juge est d'une application parfaite aux faits de la pr\u00e9sente cause On a vu que la preuve \u00e9tablit positivement que, en ao\u00fbt 1883, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s l'expiration du d\u00e9lai pour l'ex\u00e9cution du premier contrat, on s'est aper\u00e7u que les plans et specifications de cet ouvrage ne convenaient aucunement pour l'endroit o\u00f9 il fallait construire. En cons\u00e9quence, de nouveaux plans et de nouvelles sp\u00e9cifications devinrent n\u00e9cessaires et furent ordonn\u00e9s et pr\u00e9par\u00e9s. La saison \u00e9tant alors avanc\u00e9e, l'ouvrage \u00e0 faire \u00e9tant d'une haute importance pour le public, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 des communications \u00e0 \u00e9tablir entre les deux rives de l'Ottawa, urgente, et comme il n'y avait plus le temps n\u00e9cessaire pour demander de nouvelles soumissions pour l'ex\u00e9cution des nouveaux plans et sp\u00e9cifications,\u2014il fut alors d\u00e9cid\u00e9, comme on l'a vu plus haut, de faire faire les ouvrages en question sous la direction du d\u00e9partement des travaux publics.\nLes circonstances justifiaient cette action en m\u00eame temps qu'elles dispensaient de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de nouvelles annonces.\nDans la cause de Wood o\u00f9 il n'y avait comme dans celle-ci ni contrat par \u00e9crit ni annonces, Sir William Richards s'exprime ainsi sur le droit de recouvrer du d\u00e9partement en pareil cas.\nOn the broad question whether the suppliant can recover, and in the view I take of the 15th section the suppliant can only recover if the work and services rendered come under the exception referred to in that section, and in which necessity would also justify the omitting to advertize for tenders under the 28th section.\nL'honorable juge termine ses notes par l'observation suivante au sujet de l'autorisation de la d\u00e9pense par le parlement:\nIt was contended on the agreement, that Parliament has made appropriations for those work and so sanctioned the expenditure. If that be so, and the work done was of that kind, that might properly be executed by the officers and servants of the department, then I apprehend no contract would be necessary to bind the department for work done, and so suppliant should recover for work so done; and in every view also for the work actually done, if the expenditure was previously sanctioned by Parliament.\nDans cette cause, l'autorisation du parlement n'est pas mise en question; non-seulement les deniers pour la construction du pont des Joachims ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vot\u00e9s, mais ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9, en grande partie, pay\u00e9s par le d\u00e9partement; ce qui reste \u00e0 payer n'est que pour la diff\u00e9rence entre l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux des derniers plans et ceux des premiers. Les circonstances ont impos\u00e9 aux officiers du d\u00e9partement la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de se charger de la direction des travaux et les ont justifi\u00e9s de ne pas demander de nouvelles annonces. Je consid\u00e8re que sous tous les rapports cette cause est analogue \u00e0 celle de Wood et La Reine, et que l'on doit y faire l'application des principes pos\u00e9s par Sir William Richards dans le jugement dont j'ai donn\u00e9 de si copieux extraits.\nPar tous ces motifs, je suis d'opinion que les requ\u00e9rants ont droit \u00e0 la confirmation du jugement rendu en leur faveur par feu l'honorable juge Henry.\nTaschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ. concurred with Sir W. J. Ritchie C. J.[14].\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nCross-appeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for appellant\u2014O'Connor and Hogg.\nSolicitors for respondent\u2014O'Gara and Remon.\n[1] See vol. 1 of the Exchequer Court Reports shortly to be issued.\n[2] 7 Can.

Ritchie C.J., and Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT IN EQUITY OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nForeign corporation\u2014Telegraph company\u2014Doing business in Canada\u2014Exclusive right\u2014Contract for\u2014Restraint of trade\u2014Public interest.\nIn 1869 the E. & N. A. Ry. Co. owning the road from St. John, N.B. westward to the United States boundary, made an agreement with the W. U. Tel. Co. giving the latter the exclusive right for 99 years to construct and operate a line of telegraph over its road. In 1876 a mortgage on the road was foreclosed and the road itself sold under decree of the Equity Court of New Brunswick to the St. J. &. M. Ry. Co., which company, in 1883, leased it to the N.B. Ry. Co. for a term of 999 years. The telegraph line was constructed by the W. U. Tel. Co. under the said agreement, and has been continued ever since without any new agreement being made with the St. J. & M. Ry. Co. or the N.B. Ry. Co. The W. U. Tel. Co. is an American company, incorporated by the State of New York, for the purpose of constructing and operating telegraph lines in the State. Its charter neither allows it to engage, or prohibits it from engaging, in business outside of the State.\nIn 1888 the C.P. Ry. Co. completed a road from Montreal to St. John, a portion of it having running powers over the line of the N.B. Ry. Co., on which the W.U. Tel. Co. had constructed its telegraph line. The N.B. Ry. Co. having given permission to the C.P.R. to construct another telegraph line over the same road, the W.U. Tel. Co. applied for and obtained an injunction to prevent its being built. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the decree of the Equity Court granting the injunction\u2014\nHeld, 1. That the agreement made in 1869 between the E. & N. A. Ry. Co. is binding on the present owners of the road. 2. That the contract made with the W.U. Tel. Co. was consistent with the purposes of its incorporation, and not prohibited by its charter nor by the local laws of New Brunswick, and its right to enter into such a contract and carry on the business provided for thereby is a right recognized by the comity of nations.\n3. The exclusive right granted to the W.U. Tel. Co. does not avoid the contract as being against public policy, nor as being a contract in restraint of trade.\nHeld, per Gwynne J. dissenting, that the comity of nations does not require the courts of this country to enforce, in favor of a foreign corporation, a contract depriving a railway company in Canada of the right to permit a domestic corporation, created for the purpose of erecting telegraph lines in the Dominion, to erect such a line upon its land, and depriving it of the right to construct a telegraph line upon its own land.\nAppeal by consent from the judgment of a judge of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, sitting in equity, making perpetual an injunction restraining the defendants from erecting telegraph poles on the line of the New Brunswick Railway, between Vanceboro', in the State of Maine, and the City of St. John, N.B.\nThis road was originally built and operated by the European and North American Railway Company for extension from St. John, N.B., westward, and an agreement was entered into in 1869 between that company and the respondents, the Western Union Telegraph Co., by which the latter company was granted the exclusive right for 99 years to erect and maintain one or more lines of telegraph upon the said line of railway, and upon the lands of the said railway company, with all the necessary powers and privileges to the telegraph company, their successors and assigns, to enable them to construct and maintain such lines.\nThis road is now known as the St. John and Maine Railway, and is now under lease to the appellants, the New Brunswick Railway Co. No new agreement has ever been made between the Western Union Telegraph Co. and the New Brunswick Railway Co., in respect to the telegraph lines over the said road, although agreements have been made similar to the above with the New Brunswick Railway Co. in regard to its own road, and with other railway companies in New Brunswick. The Western Union has continued to operate the telegraph lines over the road in question under the original agreement.\nIn 1888 the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. undertook the construction of a line of telegraph between Montreal and St. John, N.B., which they wished to place over the line of the St. John and Maine but on the opposite side of the track from that of the Western Union. The latter company then applied for and obtained a perpetual injunction restraining the Canadian Pacific from building the said line, as being a violation of their exclusive right to operate telegraph lines over the said road. From the judgment granting such injunction this appeal was brought.\nThe principal grounds upon which the appellants claimed that the injunction should be set aside are, that the Western Union is incorporated in the State of New York, for the purpose of building and operating telegraph lines in the State or beyond it, and this gives them no power to operate such lines in Canada; if it does it should be shown that the preliminary proceedings were taken to build such road as directed by the charter; that by its charter the European and North American Railway Co. had no power to enter into the agreement; and that the agreement is void as being in restraint of trade and against public policy.\nWeldon Q.C. and Ferguson for the appellants. A foreign corporation cannot invoke the aid of the courts in Canada to have an agreement enforced giving them a monopoly of a particular business in any part of the Dominion. Bank of Augusta v. Earle[1]; Bank of Montreal v. D. Bethune[2]; Howe Machine Co. v. Walker[3]; Newby v. Colt's Patent Firearms Co.[4]; Lindley on Joint Stock Companies[5]; Westlake on Private International Law[6].\nBy their charter the plaintiffs could not operate outside of the State of New York; acts of 1851, 1853, 1855; acts of 1862, ch. 425; acts of 1870, ch. 568.\nThe original company had no power to enter into the agreement.

RITCHIE C.J. \u2014 The comity of nations distinctly recognises the right of foreign incorporated companies to carry on business and make contracts outside of the country in which they are incorporated, if consistent with the purposes of the corporation, and not prohibited by its charter, and not inconsistent with the local laws of the country in which the business was carried on, subject always to the restrictions and burthens imposed by the laws enforced therein; for there can be no doubt that a state may prohibit foreign corporations from transacting any business whatever, or it may permit them to do so upon such proper terms and conditions as it may prescribe. With respect to foreign corporations generally, the statutes of New Brunswick provide for the service of process on foreign corporations carrying on business by agents in the Province \"whose chief place of business is without the limits of the Province, and if established by the law of any other place,\" and provision is made for the proof of contracts by foreign corporations. Chapter 46 sec. 16, C. S. N. B., provides:\n16. Upon any trial of any cause before any court in this Province, wherein it shall be necessary to prove any contract or engagement entered into by any foreign corporation, or body politic or corporate, doing business in this Province, or which contract or engagement may have been entered into in this Province, it shall only be necessary for the party or parties, plaintiff or plaintiffs, defendant or defendants, seeking to prove such contract or engagement, or to put the same in evidence before such court, to prove that such contract or engagement has been duly signed or issued by the accredited agent or officer of such foreign corporation, body politic or corporate, in this Province; and upon such proof having been given, the court before which such trial shall be had shall admit the same in evidence, and the same shall be considered as duly proved without any other or further evidence of the execution thereof by such foreign corporation, body politic or corporate, any law, usage or custom to the contrary notwithstanding.\nProvision is also made for the assessment of foreign corporations by chapter 100, sec. 27:\n27. A foreign corporation having a place of business within the Province shall be assessed in respect of its personal property within the Province, and upon its income derived from its business within the Province, in the same manner as to personal property as a joint stock or other corporation referred to in the twenth-fourth section, and as to its income as an inhabitant of the Province.\nIn the absence, as in this case, of any prohibition or restriction, no intention to exclude can be presumed. Why then should the telegraph company be prohibited from carrying on business in New Brunswick? The establishment of a telegraphic line through New Brunswick connected with a telegraphic system of the United States is neither repugnant to the policy nor prejudicial to the interests of the Province of New Brunswick or the Dominion On the contrary, the legislation in New Brunswick shows that such was a matter of great importance and highly desirable. We find in the recital of the act incorporating the New Brunswick Electric Telegraph Company, which it was admitted on the argument is now leased to the Western Union Telegraph Company, the following language used[29]: \u2014\nWhereas the speedy transmission of information by means of electric telegraph has become a matter of great importance, and it is highly desirable that lines of communication by such telegraph should be established in this Province, and that the same should be connected with other lin es in Nova Scotia, Canada and the United States; and whereas certain persons are desirous of being incorporated for the purpose of establishing such communication * * *\nIt cannot be denied that the Western Union Telegraph Co., before and at the time when this contract was entered into, was carrying on its business as a telegraphic company in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia without let or hindrance, and was dealing, and being dealt with, from and before that time, as an existing company for certainly more than twenty years, and was recognized and taxed by the local authorities as a corporation legally carrying on such business under the provincial act to which I have referred; and the right of this company to exist and do business in this Dominion may be said to have been recognized by the Dominion Government, as it is well known, though not, I think, in proof in this case, that all the telegraphic business over the Intercolonial Railway, through New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, is done through the instrumentality of special agents over the line of this company, the Intercolonial having no telegraph line of its own,\nThere was no law in force to prohibit or restrain this company from doing business in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and it is obvious they were doing business consistent with their charter, and by which they were, by their charter and the law of New York, authorized to transact and do outside of the State in which they were incorporated. The provision of the act of the State of New York in evidence in this case is as follows:\nCHAPTER 425.\nAn Act further to amend the Act entitled \"An Act to provide for the Incorporation and Regulation of Telegraph Companies,\" passed 12th of April, eighteen hundred and forty-eight.\nPassed April 22nd, 1862; three-fifths being present.\nThe people of the State of New York, represented in Senate and Assembly, do enact as follows:\u2014\nSection 1.\u2014Any telegraph company which is duly incorporated under, and in pursuance of the Act entitled \"An Act to provide for the Incorporation and Regulation of Telegraph Companies,\" passed 12th April, eighteen hundred and forty-eight [which the present plaintiffs were], may construct, own, use and maintain any line or lines of electric telegraph not described in their original certificate of organization, whether wholly within, or wholly or partly beyond, the limits of this State, and may join with any other corporation or association in constructing, leasing, owning, using or maintaining such line or hues, and may own and hold any interest in such line or lines, and may become lessees of any such line or lines, upon the terms and conditions and subject to the liabilities prescribed in said act, so far as such provisions are applicable to the construction, using, maintaining, owning or holding of telegraph lines, or any interest therein pursuant to the provisions of this act.\nThe Western Extension Railway Company, with whom the original contract was made, having been empowered to construct and operate a line of railway from St. John to the boundary line of the United States, had as incident to and necessary for the safe operation of the road the right and power to erect a line of telegraph, and had the exclusive right to do so along their line of railway, and having themselves such exclusive right I can see no reason why they should not confer such exclusive right and the other privileges mentioned in the contract whereby they were enabled to secure ample telegraphic services for the operation of the road, instead of erecting and equipping a line of telegraph for themselves. I think the contract was, at the time it was made, most fair and reasonable, and this, to my mind, is conclusively shown by the fact that it has existed and been acted on from 23rd February, 1869, to the present day, notwithstanding the road was for two years in the hands of and operated by receivers appointed by the court in certain foreclosure proceedings taken for the foreclosure of a mortgage made by the Western Extension Railway Co., and after the sale in the foreclosure suit on the 23rd August, 1878, to the St. John & Maine Railway Co., and by that company from the 31st August, 1878, to the 21st May, 1883, and the New Brunswick Railway Co. leased it and have since that time operated the railway to the present day, during all which time the agreement has never been inpugned or questioned, but, on the contrary, during the whole period has been recognized and acted upon by all parties; that the New Brunswick Railway Company deemed an agreement of this character reasonable, is shown by the fact that they made a similar agreement with the respondent in reference to a line of railway built by them; and after they had leased the line from Vanceboro' to Fairville they made another agreement with the respondents, dated 25th June, 1884, by which further concessions were given and the previous agreements were ratified, and not the slightest difficulty appears to have arisen, nor a suggestion made, that the agreement was not reasonable, valid and binding until the Canadian Pacific Ry. Co., who are not shown to have any interest in the line from Vanceboro' to St. John, along which they desire to erect a telegraph line, appear for the first time to have put forward the claim which is now contended for.\nIf, then, there is a reasonable valid contract, what is more just and proper than that the plaintiffs should be protected in their rights under it, and above all from the acts and doings of the Canadian Pacific Ry. Co., who have shown no right whatever to interfere with either the railway or the line of telegraph erected thereon?\nThe main objections seem to be that this agreement creates a monopoly, and its provisions are against public policy?\nIf the railway company deem it in the interest of the company that there should be only one telegraphic line on the right of way, why may they not give an exclusive right to a telegraph company to occupy the right of way, and prohibit other telegraph companies from interfering with such exclusive right except by consent of the company to whom the exclusive right is given? If the railway company can give a right at all, why may it not give an exclusive right? A telegraph along the line may be, and no doubt is, indispensable for the safe working of the road. The financial condition of the railway company may render it impossible for it to work the telegraph line for itself, and assuming that no telegraph company could be found who would erect it without the exclusive privilege, and so be protected against competition, what law is there to prevent the railway company from securing the line by granting such an exclusive privilege? I know of none. I fail entirely to see how this creates a monopoly and prevents competition. It certainly prevents the erection of another telegraphic line on the roadway, but how does it prevent the erection of a line on either side of the track, if the parties can secure the privilege of doing so over adjoining lands? If they cannot do so, in what different position are they than if the railway had erected this line for their own exclusive use, and refused to grant the privilege to any other person or company?\nThat there was no monopoly is abundantly clear from the fact proved on the trial and admitted on the argument, that the Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. have, at this very time, built their line on the railway track, having their poles just beside the right of way between Vanceboro' and St. John, ranging in places from twenty-five to thirty feet from the track.\nThe argument that an exclusive right to erect a telegraphic line along the line of railway is against public policy would seem to rest necessarily on this delusion, if it has any foundation at all, that the public generally have a right to erect telegraphic lines along and on the line of railroad, and therefore their exclusion of any such right may cripple and prevent competition, and tend to create monopolies; but as the public have clearly no such rights, and as there is nothing to prevent telegraph lines from being erected contiguous to and parallel with railroads, provided the right of way is secure, how can it be said to cripple and prevent competition and tend to create monopolies any more than the erection of the line of telegraph unconnected with the railway by private individuals for their own exclusive use on a line they have procured at their own expense would prevent competition, on a line parallel or contiguous thereto? What is there to prevent the erection of a dozen different lines by a dozen different companies for their own exclusive use respectively?\nWhen the Western Extension Railway Company and the New Brunswick Railway Company recognized the Western Union as a telegraph company existing and doing business as a telegraph company in New Brunswick, and induced the Western Union, under a valid agreement, to erect this line on the line of railway, are they or any parties claiming under them, who have recognised and acted on the agreement, in a position to repudiate the contract as void and, as a consequence, appropriate the line to their own use, on the ground that a foreign corporation, specially incorporated for the purpose of constructing telegraph lines, has no power whatever to construct or manage telegraph lines within any part of the Dominion of Canada; and, therefore, such a corporation cannot enforce any contract for the purpose of acquiring an interest in the Dominion, in order to enable it to construct or manage telegraph lines therein. Assuming that the Western Extension had itself built the telegraph line and leased it to the Western Union, would the New Brunswick Railway Company not be bound by such a contract, and could not such a contract be enforced in the courts of this Dominion? Or suppose that the New Brunswick Railway Company had sold the line so erected by it to the Western Union and received the price, could the New Brunswick Railway Company keep the line and the money on the ground that the Western Union had no right to own or maintain a telegraph line in New Brunswick, and could not enforce any contract for acquiring such an interest?\nI should not have discussed the matter at this length but that I understand it to be the view of one of the members of this court that a foreign corporation cannot own or maintain telegraph lines in this Dominion, and that all contracts in reference thereto are void. But the defendants do not venture to go so far as this. Their contention, as I understand it, is not that the Western Union and the railway company cannot contract, but that in a contract between them they cannot agree to prohibit and exclude all other lines from the track of the roadway. By paragraph seven of the appellant's factum this is very clearly put forward:\n7. It must be remembered that this controversy does not arise upon any effort to displace the lines of wire established by the Western Union, nor in any way to interfere with the free use and enjoyment thereof, but arises upon an interference, as is claimed, with its exclusive right to occupy the entire right of way\u2014that is, that no other telegraph company, except by its consent, shall ever use or occupy any part of the right of way.\nBut would it not be most unreasonable and unjust that having contracted for a good and valuable consideration to give the Western Union an exclusive right over the railway they could, in defiance of their contract, ignore the exclusive right, and grant similar privileges to other companies? What could be more natural and reasonable than that the railway company and the Western Union, dealing legally with the subject matter of the contract, the former should debar themselves from the right practically to destroy the subject matter dealt with by the contract, and that the latter should insist, as an essential condition of entering into the contract, that the exclusive use of the road should be secured to them?\nThe following authorities, both English and American, may be cited to establish the principles before indicate\nThe law of Domicile. A. V. Dicey. Rule 42, p. 198;\nThe existence of a foreign corporation duly created under the law of a foreign country is recognized by our courts.\nThe principle is now well established that a corporation duly created in one country is recognized as a corporation by other States. Thus it is a matter of daily experience that foreign corporations sue and are sued in their corporate capacity before English tribunals.\nStory on Conflict of Laws, ch. 4, sec. 106:\nThe power of a corporation to act in a foreign country depends both on the law of the country where it was created and on the law of the country where it assumes to act. It has only such powers as were given to it by the authority which created it. It cannot do any act by virtue of those powers in any country where the laws forbid it so to act. It follows that every country may impose conditions and restrictions upon foreign corporations which transact business within its limits. Liverpool Insurance Co. v. Massachusetts[30]; Attorney General v. Bay State Mining Co.[31]; Bard v. Poole[32]; Phoenix Insurance Co. v. Commonwealth[33] Erichsen v. Last[34].\nLindley J.\u2014I am of opinion that the company are liable to pay income-tax upon the annual profits which they receive in this country. It appears that the company is a foreign corporation resident in Denmark, and having its principal place of business there, so that in one sense in which the phrase is used it would be held \"to carry on its business\" abroad. It further appears that the company have three marine cables in connection with this country, and that these cables are brought into communication with telegraph wires belonging to the post office at Aberdeen and Newcastle.\nWatkin Williams J.\u2014I. am of the same opinion. This company, although not resident in England, nevertheless carry on trade here. They make their contracts and demand and receive payments in respect of them in this country. The ownership of the different cables by which they forward their messages is for the present purpose immaterial, for the only matter for our consideration is whether they carry on business in this country.\nIn Merrick v. Van Santvoord[35] Porter J. says:\u2014\nWe think the policy of this State is in harmony with that of the country, and that it would be neither provident nor just to inaugurate a rule which would unsettle the security of corporate property and rights, and exclude others from the enjoyment here of privileges which have always been accorded to us abroad.\n* * * * *\nThe rules of comity are subject to local modification by the lawmaking power; but until so modified, they have the controlling force of legal obligation. The franchises and immunities which they secure it is the duty of the courts to respect, until the sovereign sees fit to deny them. The rights of a foreign suitor or defendant, so far as they are unabridged by legislation, are as imperative and absolute as those of the citizen. These rules have their place in every system of jurisprudence.\n* * * * *\nThe rights of foreign corporations have been protected in the English courts on the same general principle of public law. The Nabob of Carnatic v. The East India Co.[36]; The Dutch West India Company v. Henriquez[37]; The King of Spain v. Hullett[38]. We had the benefit of the rule in the suit instituted in Great Britain, in the case of The United States v. Smithson's Executors. Indeed, the law of international comity in the interest of commerce, which has so long prevailed in that country, is recognised in a provision of Magna Charta, which elicited from Montesquieu the encomium, that the English have made the protection of foreign merchants one of the articles of their own liberty.\n* * * * *\nIt was a suggestion in answer to the argument that, inasmuch as the corporation could not migrate, it could neither contract nor sue, except in the State of its domicile. He admitted its incapacity to migrate, but held that it did not follow that its existence there would not be recognised elsewhere. It was accordingly adjudged, in that case, that contracts made in the city of Mobile, between citizens of Alabama and a Georgia bank, a Pennsylvania bank and a Louisiana railroad company respectively, could be enforced under the general law of comity as contracts within the scope of their respective charters, though unauthorised by the State of Alabama. The Chief Justice expressed the opinion that no valid reason can be assigned for refusing to give effect to the contracts of foreign corporations \"when they are not contrary to the known policy of the State, or injurious to its interests. It is nothing more than the admission of the existence of an artificial person, created by the laws of another State, and clothed with the power of making certain contracts. It is but the usual comity of recognising the law of another State\"[39]. The concession referred to was reiterated in the same sense by Judge Thompson, and in answer to a similar argument in the case of Runyan v. Costar, in which it was adjudged that a coal company organised in New York, for the purpose of mining coal in Pennsylvania, could exercise its franchise by purchasing and holding lands in the latter State; and though, by a statute of Pennsylvania, lands so acquired were subject to forfeiture, the title of the company was good so long as the forfeiture was not enforced by the State.[40].\nIn Bank of Augusta v. Earle[41] Taney C.J. says:\u2014\nIt is very true that a corporation can have no legal existence out of the boundaries of the sovereignty by which it is created. It exists only in contemplation of law, and by force of the law; and where that law ceases to operate, and is no longer obligatory, the corporation can have no existence. It must dwell in the place of its creation, and cannot migrate to another sovereignty. But although it must live and have its being in that State only, yet it does not by any means follow that its existence there will not be recognized in other places; and its residence in one State creates no insuperable objection to its power of contracting in another. It is indeed a mere artificial being, invisible and intangible; yet it is a person for certain purposes in contemplation of law, and has been recognized as such by the decisions of this court. It was so held in the case of The United States v Amedy[42] and in Beaston v. The Farmer's Bank of Delaware[43]. Now, natural persons through the intervention of agents are continually making contracts in countries in which they do not reside, and where they are not personally present when the contract is made; and nobody has ever doubted the validity of these agreements. And what greater objection can there be to the capacity of an artificial person, by its agents, to make a contract within the scope of its limited powers, in a sovereignty in which it does not reside; provided such contracts are permitted to be made by them by the laws of the place?\n* * * * *\nAdopting, as we do, the principle here stated, we proceed to inquire whether, by the comity of nations, foreign corporations are permitted to make contracts within their jurisdiction; and we can perceive no sufficient reason for excluding them when they are not contrary to the known policy of the State, or injurious to its interests. It is nothing more than the admission of the existence of an artificial person created by the law of another State, and clothed with the power of making certain contracts. It is but the usual comity of recognizing the laws of another State. In England, from which we have received our general principles of jurisprudence, no doubt appears to have been entertained of the right of a foreign corporation to sue in its courts since the case Henriquez v The Dutch West India Company, decided in 1729[44]. And it is a matter of history, which this court are bound to notice, that corporations, created in this country, have been in the open practice, for many years past, of making contracts in England of various kinds, and to very large amounts; and we have never seen a doubt suggested there of the validity of these contracts by any Court or any jurist.\n* * * * *\nIt has been decided in many of the State courts, we believe in all of them where the question has arisen, that the corporation of one State may sue in the courts of another. If it may sue, why may it not make a contract? The right to sue is one of the powers which it derives from its charter. If the courts of another country take notice of its existence as a corporation, so far as to allow it to maintain a suit, and permit it to exercise that power, why should not its existence be recognized for other purposes, and the corporation permitted to exercise another power which is given to it by the same law and the same sovereignty\u2014where the last mentioned power does not come in conflict with the interest or policy of the State? There is certainly nothing in the nature and character of a corporation which could justly lead to such a distinction; and which should extend to it the comity of suit, and refuse to it the comity of contract. If it is allowed to sue, it would of course be permitted to compromise, if it thought proper, with its debtor; to give him time, to accept something else in satisfaction, to give him a release, and to employ an attorney for itself to conduct its suit. These are all matters of contract, and yet are so intimately connected with the right to sue that the latter could not be effectually exercised if the former were denied.\n* * * * *\nWe think it is well settled that by the law of comity among nations a corporation created by one sovereignty is permitted to make contracts in another, and to sue in its courts; and that the same law of comity prevails among the several sovereignties of this Union.\n* * * * *\nBut we have already said that this comity is presumed from the silent acquiescence of the State. Whenever a State sufficiently indicates that contracts which derive their validity from its comity are repugnant to its policy, or are considered as injurious to its interests, the presumption in favor of its adoption can no longer be made.\n* * * * *\nWe have already shown that the comity of suit brings with it the comity of contract, and where the one is expressly adopted by its courts, the other must also be presumed according to the usages of nations, unless the contrary can be shown.\nThe result, then, is that the comity of nations and the express legislation of New Brunswick recognizes the right of foreign corporations to carry on business and make contracts outside the country where incorporated, consistent with the purposes of its incorporation, and not prohibited by its charter, and not inconsistent with the local laws of the country in which the business is carried on: but the plaintiffs have shown the business to be carried on consistent with their charter, and expressly permitted to be carried on outside the limits of the place of incorporation; that the contract in this case is binding on the New Brunswick Railway Company, does not create a monopoly, and is not contrary to public policy or the laws of New Brunswick or the Dominion, nor inconsistent therewith; that the carrying on business in New Brunswick and Noya Scotia has been recognized alike by the local and Dominion authorities, by the local by assessing the company for the business so carried on, and by the executive of the Dominion in contracting and dealing with the company for the use of their line over the Intercolonial Railway, which is an historical fact; that the New Brunswick Railway Company are estopped, by acquiesence and adoption of the contract, with full knowledge, from raising any objection to the contract, and the Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. have shown no locus standi to interfere with it; and I feel constrained to add that I think it would be a sad scandal on the administration of justice if this court should hold that this company, having brought in an enormous amount of capital in this Dominion, and without let or hindrance, in peace and quietness, carried on the large business, in fact, the entire electric telegraph business between St. John and the United States for a period of twenty years, and throughout all portions of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia for still longer periods, constructing, leasing, managing telegraphic lines, and otherwise carrying on the telegraph business for which they were incorporated, and having paid their scot and lot with others doing business in the Dominion, should now be told, at this day, that they had no rights the courts of this Dominion would recognize and protect.\nFOURNIER J. concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I concur with the Chief Justice that this appeal should be dismissed. I do not think that the appellants have the right to put in view, in this case, the right of the respondent to enter into the contract in question.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs, upon the simple ground that an act of incorporation passed by the Legislature of a foreign country, incorporating certain persons for the purpose of constructing telegraph lines in the foreign country, confers no power whatever upon the corporation to construct a telegraph line within any part of this Dominion, and that therefore the foreign corporation cannot enforce any contract for the purpose of acquiring an interest in land in the Dominion in order to enable it to construct and maintain a telegraph line therein. The right of foreign corporations to bring actions in the courts of this country is recognized only upon the principle of the comity of nations, and that comity does not require the courts of this country to enforce a contract of the nature of that before us in the present case, which purports to deprive the New Brunswick Railway Company of the right to permit a domestic corporation created for erecting telegraph lines in the Dominion, to erect such a line upon any of its land, and to deprive the railway company of the power of constructing a telegraph line upon their own land. Such a power vested in a foreign corporation might be very prejudicial to the interests of the Dominion and its inhabitants, and of the railway companies, nationally and commercially, and should not therefore be recognized or given efficacy in the courts of this country.\nFor these reasons, I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nPATTERSON J. concurred in the judgments dismissing the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Weldon & McLean.\nSolicitors for respondents: Barker & Belyea.\n[1] 13 Peters 587.\n[2] 4 U.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nLibel\u2014Newspaper publication\u2014Innuendoes\u2014Trial of action\u2014Direction to jury\u2014Consideration of innuendoes\u2014Withdrawal of from jury\u2014Effect of misdirection\u2014Excessive damages.\nW., a judge of the Supreme Court of B. C., brought an action against H., editor, for a libel contained in the following article published in his paper :\u2014\n\" THE MCNAMEE-MITCHELL SUIT.\n\" In the sworn evidence of Mr. McNamee, defendant in the suit of McKenna v. McNamee, lately tried at Ottawa, the following passage occurs : ' Six of them were in partnership (in the dry dock ' contract) out in British Columbia, one of whom was the Pre-' mier of the Province.' The Premier of the Province at the time referred to was Hon. Mr. Walkem, now a judge of the Supreme Court. Mr. Walkem's career on the bench has been above reproach. His course has been such as to win for him the admiration of many of his old political enemies. But he owes it to himself to refute this charge. We feel sure that Mr. McNamee must be laboring under a mistake. Had the statement been made off the stand it would have been scouted as untrue ; but having been made under the sanctity of an oath it cannot be treated lightly nor allowed to pass unheeded.\"\nThe innuendoes alleged by the declaration to be contained in this article were :\u2014\n1. That W. corruptly entered into partnership with McNamee while holding offices of public trust, and thereby unlawfully acquired large sums of public money.\n2. That he did so under cloak of his public position and by fraudulently pretending that\nhe acted in the interest of the Government. 3. That he committed criminal offences punishable by law.\n4. That he continued to hold his interest in the contract after his elevation to the bench.\nHeld, that the article was susceptible of the first of the above innuendoes, but not of the others which should have been, but were not, distinctly withdrawn from the consideration of the jury at the trial.\nOn the trial the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, with $2,500 damages.\nHeld, per Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ., that the case was improperly left to the jury but the only prejudice sustained by the defendant thereby was that of excessive damages, and the verdict might stand on the plaintiff consenting to the damages being reduced to $500.\nHeld, per Ritchie C. J., that there had been a mistrial, and the consent of both parties to such reduction was necessary.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, sustaining the verdict at the trial in favor of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff (respondent) in this case was Mr. Justice Walkem, of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, who brought an action against the defendant, editor of the British Colonist a newspaper published in Victoria, B.C., for publishing in said paper an article which plaintiff considered libellous. The alleged libel and the innuendoes charged to have been contained therein were set out as follows in the declaration in the action :\u2014\nThe defendant in his said newspaper, dated the 20th of November, 1885, falsely and maliciously printed and published of and concerning the plaintiff, and of and concerning the official conduct of the plaintiff, while a member of the Government, and holding therein offices of public trust and confidence, the following libellous and defamatory words :\n\" THE MCNAMEE\u2014MITCHELL SUIT.\n\" In the sworn evidence of Mr. McNamee,\" (meaning Frances Bernard McNamee, above mentioned) \" defend- ant in the suit of McKenna v. McNamee, lately tried at Ottawa, the following passage occurs :\n\" ' Six of them' meaning the witness McNamee and five other persons), were in partnership in the dry dock contract,' (meaning the contract of the 4th of October, 1880, (' out in British Columbia, one of whom was the Premier of the Province.'\n\" The Premier of the Province at the time referred to was Hon. Mr. Walkem,\" (meaning the plaintiff) now a Judge of the Supreme Court,\" (meaning the Supreme Court of British Columbia). \" Mr. Walkem's career on the bench has been above reproach. His course has been such as to win for him the admiration of many of his old political enemies. But he owes it to himself \" (meaning to the judicial character thus acquired as well as to his character generally) to refute this charge \" (meaning the charge implied in the above statement that he had been guilty of corruption in having been a partner with the contractors in the said dry dock contract). \" We feel sure that Mr. McNamee must be laboring under a mistake. Had the statement \" (meaning the said charge of corruption) \" been made off the stand it would have been scouted as untrue ; but having been made under the sanctity of an oath it cannot be treated lightly nor allowed to pass unheeded.\"\nMeaning and intending it to be believed, by the said false and malicious libel, that at the time the plaintiff held the several offices of public trust and confidence mentioned he secretly, and by corrupt means, and for corrupt and unworthy considerations of personal gain and profit, and in betrayal of such trust and confidence, acquired and held a partnership interest conjointly with the said contractors \" F. B. McNamee and Company,\" in their said dry dock contract of the 4th of October, 1880, and that as such secret partner with them he fraudulently and unlawfully obtained large sums of public money, and made large gains and profits at the expense of the Province, in respect of work done, or pretended to have been done, on the dock under the said contract ; and that he procured the award which was made of the said contract, and thereupon executed the contract, and thereafter obtained the said public moneys, and made the said profits in manner mentioned, under cloak of his position and influence in the Government, and especially of his office and authority as Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works, and by falsely and fraudulently pretending that he was acting as such officer in the premises solely on behalf of and in the interests of the Government, and not on his own personal behalf, as was the fact ; and that he had by reason of the premises committed criminal offences punishable by law, which should not be \" treated lightly nor allowed to pass unheeded ;\" and further, that the plaintiff, actuated by the corrupt and unworthy motives and considerations above mentioned, continuously held his said secret partnership in the contract while the latter remained in force, that is to say, for a considerable period before and after his resignation of office, and his appointment to his present position on the bench.\nAt the trial. at the close of the plaintiff's case, defendant's counsel offered evidence of other publications in defendant's newspaper favorable to the plaintiff. The evidence was rejected, whereupon the counsel asked the trial judge if the words of the alleged libel were capable of bearing the meaning set out in the innuendo, and the learned judge replied as follows :\u2014\n\" Court.\u2014I certainly think that the main libel, viz., the alleged report of McNamee's testimony, may bear the full meaning attributed to it. Whether the added remarks in the defendant's editorial necessarily imply the full meaning as expressed in the subsequent innuendo is another question. I think they may bear that meaning, though they may also bear a meaning less than that the plaintiff actually pocketed money ; they may mean that he hoped to pocket money. But I cannot conceive that the whole, the alleged extract from McNamee's testimony, and the defendant's comments thereon, bears a neutral meaning or other than a derogatory meaning.\"\nIn his charge to the jury the learned judge does not appear to have referred to the innuendoes set out in the declaration, but simply directed them to find whether the publication was or was not a libel, and, if it was, whether it was true or untrue. The jury returned as their verdict : \" We find that it is a libel. Damages $2,500.\"\nThe defendant made two motions against this verdict before the full court, one for the verdict to be set aside and a non-suit entered ; the other for a new trial. Both motions were refused and the defendant was allowed, by order of a judge of the court below, to bring two appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nChristopher Robinson Q.C. and Bodwell for the appellant.\nWhether or not the publication was susceptible of the innuendoes alleged was a question for the judge at the trial and should have been distinctly withheld from the jury. Capital and Counties Bank v. Henty[1]; Hunt v. Goodlake[2].\nThere was nothing to justify the amount of damages awarded ; Massie v. Toronto Printing Co[3]; Cook v. Cook[4]; Ontario Copper Lightning Co. v. Hewitt[5].\nS. H. Blake Q.C. and Gormully for the respondent. The trial judge dealt with the publication as a whole, and so left it to the jury.\nThe innuendoes can be fairly inferred from the publication ; Watkin v. Hall[6]; Barrett v. Long[7].\nSir W J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014It is clear that an innuendo may not introduce new matter or enlarge the natural meaning of the words. The innuendo in this case violates both of these principles, and the declaration is therefore objectionable.\nMr. Justice McCreight says\u2014\nIt is true, indeed it seems to have been taken for granted at the close of the plaintiff's case, and certainly at the end of the trial, that the innuendoes were to be disregarded. The Chief Justice but once refers to them in his charge and then only casually, and on the jury retiring he told them they might disregard them. No allusion is made to them in the questions submitted to the jury. The question put to them was : \" Is it a libel ?\" and their answer was : \" We find it is a libel.\" It is agreed that they took the Colonist newspaper with them on retiring, and I have no doubt they found their verdict upon a perusal of it ; and it is very unlikely that they troubled themselves with pleadings and innuendoes when no one invited them to do so.\nI think the very opposite appears. At the close of the plaintiff's case, as shown in the extract from the record[8] I think the learned counsel raised this objection that the publication was incapable of the innuendo at the proper time, namely, at the close of the plaintiff's case, and the learned judge having decided against him he was bound by such decision, and I cannot discover in the record of the judge's charge submitted to this court that the Chief Justice even casually referred to the objectionable innuendoes or that on retiring he told the jury they might disregard the inuendoes. Had he done so I think it would have been an insufficient direction. The jury should have been told that they must disregard the innuendoes, which should have been specifically withdrawn from their consideration, and more particularly so after it had been adjudged that the words might bear the meaning attributed to them in the objectionable innuendo. I do not think it is sufficient to say, as Mr. Justice McCreight does, that it is very unlikely that they, the jury, troubled themselves with pleadings and innuendoes when no one invited them to do so. I cannot think the jury could have assessed the damages at so large an amount had the matter of the objectionable innuendoes been clearly and distinctly withdrawn from their consideration. The finding of the jury is general, and it is impossible to say the damages have not been given on the whole declaration as it continued throughout the trial and still continues on the record. I find it impossible to say that the damages given were for that part of the declaration only which may be unobjectionable.\nI do not wish it to be understood that the jury were not fully justified in finding that the alleged publication was libellous, and could I discover that the matter contained in the innuendo had been distinctly withdrawn from their consideration I should have had great difficulty in disturbing the verdict, though I think the damages were, in the language of the late Mr. Justice Gray, \" severe, and unnecessarily severe.\"\nI think we have no right arbitrarily to assess the damages in this case\u2014a right which belongs to the jury and to the jury alone\u2014but that the defendant is entitled to have the damages assessed by a jury on a proper trial and charge, and that there should be a new trial, unless both parties consent to the proposed reduction. I think the assent of the plaintiff alone not sufficient in a case like this, where there has been, in my opinion, a mistrial. STRONG, FOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The plaintiff's statement of claim charged four innuendoes as attributable to the article complained of. The learned Chief Justice who tried the case erred, I think, in holding that it was capable of having all of those innuendoes attributed to it. Some of them were of an aggravated character, involving the imputation of criminal offences of a very serious nature. The analysis made of the article by the learned Chief Justice, coupled with the opinion which he himself expressed of its character and of the meanings which were capable of being attributed to it, was calculated. I think, to draw the attention of the jury from their proper function on the trial and to convey to them the impression that all they had to do was to visit the offence of which the defendant, in his opinion, was clearly guilty with heavy damages, as had been done in the case of Bryce v. Ruston[9] which he stated to the jury to have been \u00a35,000. I do not by any means desire to be understood as entertaining an opinion that the article was not libellous ; on the contrary, I am clearly of opinion that it contained a very serious libel ; but to say thay the article was susceptible of all the innuendoes which were attributed to it by the plaintiff was, I think, an error. It was, however, susceptible of the first, but it is impossible to say what effect in increasing the amount of damages the ruling of the learned Chief Justice that it was susceptible of all the others, of a very aggravated nature, may have had upon the jury. What the learned Chief Justice should have done beside telling the jury what is the legal definition of a libel, I think, was to have told them that the article was susceptible of the meaning attributed. to it in the first innuendo, and that it was for them to say whether in point of fact that meaning was fairly attributed to it. If on such a charge they had rendered a verdict for the amount of damages which they have given, although that amount might seem to me to be excessive, I should have had great difficulty in interfering with it ; but as I think the case was submitted to the jury in a manner which may have misled them, and as it is impossible to say how much the opinion of the learned Chief Justice that the article was susceptible of all the meanings, of an aggravated nature attributed to it\u2014in which, I think, he erred\u2014may have influenced the jury in awarding the amount of damages given by their verdict, I think there should be a new trial, unless the plaintiff is willing to reduce his verdict to five hundred dollars and to alter the judgment which has been entered accordingly. This amount, together with the costs incurred, will amply satisfy the ends of justice. The only prejudice which I think the defendant can be said to have incurred by the manner in which the case was submitted to the jury was that thereby excessive damages may have been awarded against him by the jury, for there can be no doubt of the libellous character of the publication ; and as the appellant did not rest his appeal upon this ground, but insisted throughout that the publication was not actionable, I think that upon the plaintiff consenting to take the verdict and the judgment therein as suggested the appellant should pay the costs of the appeals. The appellant's contention throughout was, first, that the rule nisi for entering a non-suit should have been made absolute ; and if not secondly, that the verdict in favor of the plaintiff was not justified by the law and the evidence. In support of this contention he instituted two appeals when one only was necessary, one against the rule refusing leave to enter a non-suit and the other against the judgment entered upon the verdict. Under any circumstances the former appeal being utterly without foundation must have been dismissed with costs, and as upon the other appeal the appellant fails upon the grounds upon which he rested his appeal, and as there will be but one bill of costs as upon one appeal, there exists no reason for making any distinction between the two appeals in respect of costs. The ends of justice will, I think, be attained if, upon the plaintiff consenting to reduce his verdict to $500 and to alter the judgment already entered accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed with costs. In default of the plaintiff filing his consent to the above effect within two months, then the judgment of this court to be entered dismissing the appeal against the rule refusing leave to enter a non-suit with costs, and allowing the appeal against the judgment which has been entered, but without costs, and directing a rule to issue in the court below for a new trial without costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs on plaintiff filing consent to damages being reduced to $500.\nSolicitor for appellant : Theodore Davie.\nSolicitor for respondent : H.

[See now 52 V. c. 38 s. 3.]\nAppeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, upon a claim for expropriation under the Government Railway Act.\nThe appellant was the owner of two lots situate in the Parish of St. Joseph, Levis. On the 8th June, 1882, the Intercolonial Railway authorities expropriated two parcels of these lots for the construction of what is generally known under the name of the St. Charles Branch.\nThe appellant thereupon filed the following claim, which was contested by the crown and referred to the Exchequer Court, to wit:\nPlan Nos. 1 & 2\u20141st range.\nLand expropriated\n$ 200 00\nDamages\n1,200 00\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n$1,400 00 Plan No. 3\u20143rd Range.\nLand expropriated\n$120 00\nDamages\n380 00\n500 00\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n$1,900 00\nOn the 30th day of June, 1888, the court awarded the claimant the sum of $1,070 as follows, to wit:\nPlan Nos. 1 and 2\u20141st Range.\nLand expropriated\n$200 00\nDamages\n500 00\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n$ 700 00\nPlan No. 3\u20142nd Range.\nLand expropriated\n$120 00\nDamages\n250 00\n370 00\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n$1,70 00\nWith this award the claimant was dissatisfied and hence the present appeal.\nThe court below having awarded the claimant the full amount he demanded for lands expropriated, and there being no cross appeal, this part of the award was not attacked.\nThe only question, therefore, that arose on this appeal was in relation to the amount of damages awarded on each of appellant's properties for depreciation of value caused by the construction of the railway.\nBelleau for appellant contended that a subway which was constructed upon lot 1 on the side of a hill was impassable, and that having no crossing nor gate upon lot 2 appellant had not received full compensation for the future as well as for the past in consequence of the want of such a crossing.\nAngers Q.C. for respondent contended that the hill is not steeper on lot 1 than it was before and that in assessing the damages on lot 2 the learned judge had included the cost of the crossing.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by\nPATTERSON J.\u2014This appeal raises no question beyond the amount of damages for the depreciation of or inconvenience caused in respect of the claimant's land, by severance and by the effect of the railway upon the natural flow of water upon his land. The amount awarded for the land expropriated is not complained of.\nIt may be that we are as able to appreciate the evidence as was the learned judge in the court below, because the witnesses appear to have been examined before the registrar, but we are in no better position.\nI do not see any good reason to suppose that my estimate of the value of the opinions of the witnesses, if it differed from that formed by the learned judge, would be more likely to be right than his estimate; on the contrary I must regard the award as that of the tribunal primarily charged with the adjustment of compensation in these cases, and not to be disturbed unless a wrong principle appears to have been acted on, or unless some error as to facts or some oversight is apparent.\nThe learned judge appears to have had before his attention all the considerations affecting the injury, and the only point on which I should criticise his decision is upon the question of farm crossings, particularly with reference to the property in the third range. As to that property, the learned judge remarks that the claimant was entitled to a crossing, and I understand him to attribute the depreciation of that portion of the property chiefly to the want of a crossing and to take that into account in estimating the damages[1]. As explained in what I have said in V\u00e9zina's Case, I do not think the statutes give a right to a crossing over this railway apart from contract. If the right existed it would be enforceable notwithstanding the award in question, but when no right is given by statute or reserved by contract, full compensation, covering the future as well as the past, should be given.\nIt is not quite clear that the award is intended to give this full compensation, wherefore it will be proper for us to put it beyond question.\nWe therefore add one hundred dollars to the amount, which will still be less than the estimate of the witnesses for the claimant and not much above that of some of the witnesses for the crown.\nThe award is thus increased from $1,070 to $1,170 and the appeal is allowed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The only point in which any objection could, with propriety, as it appears to me, be made to the award of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court, is with respect to the sum of $250 allowed under the head of depreciation of the property in the 3rd range, if that sum was awarded upon the assumption that the owner was deprived of a right to cross the railway from one of the severed parts of his farm to the other. For the reasons given in Vezina v. The Queen[2], I am of opinion that a person whose property is severed by a railway into two or more parts, access between which across the railway is necessary to the full enjoyment of the severed parts, cannot against his will be deprived of his right to have such access by a suitable crossing under or over the railway and cannot be compelled to accept pecuniary recompense in lieu of such a crossing. The statute which authorizes the construction of a railway across a man's property is not, in my judgment, open to the imputation that it justifies any such autocratic interference with the property of a person across whose lands a railway is authorized to be constructed, whether it be constructed by a company or by the Government. Again, on the other hand, a land owner cannot in my judgment compel a railway to compensate him in money as in lieu of a crossing which can be supplied. In the present case the Government has not appealed or raised any objection to the amount awarded, but lest payment of this amount might hereafter present an obstacle to the owner of the land obtaining a suitable crossing which, it is apparent, can readily be given, and as an act has been passed during the present session of Parliament, which, I think, gives ample power to the Exchequer Court to make an order in the proceedings upon expropriation for the construction of a suitable crossing in cases like the present, I am of opinion that we should remit the case to the Exchequer Court to be dealt with under that act. As to the grounds of appeal taken by the appellant, I cannot see anything which would justify us as an appellate tribunal in pronouncing the judgment of the learned judge of the Court of Exchequer to be erroneous. I think that there should be no costs given on the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs\nSolicitors for appellant: Belleau, Stafford & Belleau.\nSolicitors for respondent: Casgrain, Angers & Hamel.\n[1] See p. 21 et seq.\n[2] 17 Can.

B. Ry. Co. had a siding for loading lumber delivered from a saw mill and piled upon a platform. The deceased was at the platform with a team for the purpose of taking away some lumber, when a train coming out of a cutting frightened the horses, which dragged the deceased to the main track where he was killed by the train.\nHeld that there was no duty upon the company to ring the bell or sound the whistle or to take special precautions in approaching or passing the siding.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] setting aside a non-suit granted at the trial and ordering a verdict to be entered for the plaintiff.\nThe action in this case was brought to recover damages from the defendant for the death of Joseph M. Vanwart, caused, as alleged by the plaintiff, by the negligence of the servants of the company.\nThe deceased was at a siding of the railway with a pair of spirited horses, his business there having no connection with the railway. While there he was told that a train was approaching, and he endeavored to unhitch the horses but before he could do so the train approached, the horses ran away and dragged deceased on the track and he was killed. No whistle was sounded or bell rung as the train approached the siding. The company was under no statutory obligation to give warning.\nThe defendants contended on the trial that there was no evidence of negligence to go to the jury, and if there was the plaintiff was guilty of such contributory negligence as to relieve the company.\nAt the trial the counsel agreed that a non-suit should be entered subject to the same being set aside by the court if it should be considered that there was evidence of negligence and not of contributory negligence, in which case a verdict might be entered for the plaintiff for the damages agreed upon or a new trial be granted, the court to draw inferences of fact. The court set aside the non-suit and ordered a verdict to be entered for the plaintiff. The company then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nWeldon, Q.C. for the appellants, cited Dublin, &c., Railway Company v. Slattery[2]; Wright v. The Boston & Maine Railroad[3]; Gaynor v. The Old Colony Railway Company[4]; Wakelin v. The London & South Western Railway Company[5]; Taylor on Private Corporations[6]; Skelton v. The London & North Western Railway Company[7]; Larmore v. The Crown Point Iron Co.[8].\nJ. A. Vanwart for the respondent\u2014The decision of the court below must be treated as the verdict of a jury, and will not be interfered with on questions of fact. (PATTERSON J., refers to the case of Young v. Moeller[9] as an authority, showing that where the court below has power to draw inferences from the evidence a court of appeal may also draw inferences.)\nThe learned counsel referred to the cases of Rosenberger v. The Grand Trunk Railway Company[10]; Davie v. The London & South Western Railway Co.[11];\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\u2014\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The plaintiff has judgment for $1,500 for herself, as widow of the deceased, and for $500 for his father. An objection was made to the father's right to recover damages for the death of his son, but the authorities are against the objection. He is properly held to have had reasonable expectations of future pecuniary benefit from the life of his son. I think all the English cases on the point, decided under Lord Campbell's Act, will be found collected in my judgment in Lett v. St. Lawrence and Ottawa Ry. Co.[12], and considered in chronological order. The cases of Franklin v. South Eastern Ry. Co.[13]; Dalton v. South Eastern Ry. Co.[14]; and Hetherington v. North Eastern Ry. Co.,[15], amongst others, will be found to be in point upon the present objection, if the defendants are held liable at all.\nUpon the main question of the defendants' liability we have the advantage of elaborate and able judgments delivered in the court below. The opinion of the majority of the court was in favor of the plaintiff's right to recover. The question was treated as one of some novelty, as well as of some difficulty. It is not a matter of surprise to find it regarded in different lights by the judges by whom it was discussed, but after the further discussion it has received in the argument before us, I cannot say that I have any doubt of the right of the defendants to our judgment in their favor.\nThe incidents connected with the unfortunate accident which occasioned the death of the intestate need not now be stated in detail. The essential facts on which the liability of the defendants must be tested are within a narrow compass.\nThe freight train was making its ordinary daily trip, in the ordinary manner, and at its regular time, when the horses of the deceased, which he had just brought to a place very near the track for the purpose of taking away a load of lumber, were frightened by the train, became unmanageable, and dragged him with or under the waggon on to the track, where he received fatal injuries from the train if he had not been already fatally injured by the horses and the waggon.\nThere was a cutting at a short distance each way from the place of the accident, and the approach of the train was not easily discovered until it was about to emerge from the cutting. The fright of the horses may have been in this case caused by the sudden appearance of the train, and reason is given for the belief that the accident might have been avoided if the deceased had had time, after he knew the train was coming, to turn the horses' heads towards it.\nNo whistle was sounded or bell rung to give notice of the approach of the train.\nThe place was not a highway crossing, and there was no statutory duty to whistle or to ring.\nUnder the facts so stated, if those were all the facts, there could be no suggestion of negligence on the part of the defendants:\nThe position would be that which recurs every hour in the day along all our railways.\nIt is precisely that of a farmer unloading his grain at a warehouse beside the railway, or a team standing at a flag station while an express train rushes past, or being driven along a highway that runs alongside of a railway as many highways do, or crosses the railway by a bridge or culvert where the statutory duty to whistle or to ring does not apply.\nIn cases like these the sight and noise of a train passing along the line may frighten horses unused to such objects. The business of the railway would be materially impeded if account had to be taken of every such possibility. The duty, if recognised, would, by an easy process of reasoning, be found to extend also to ordinary farm crossings. The danger to horses from the supposed cause may easily be exaggerated. It may be found, just as in the present instance, that while work with trains is plied all the year round in such situations, no trouble occurs in any but exceptional cases, where the horses may be excitable or the drivers imprudent.\nIt has long been the law with regard to nearly all our railways, under the provisions of our railway legislation, that notice of the approach of a train to a level crossing of a highway must be given by sounding the whistle or ringing the bell. We are told that that rule did not apply by statute to the defendant company until after the accident now in discussion. The existence of the legislative rule may, however, afford a criterion of what is reasonable, and as a warning not to impose on the company a burden more onerous than that indicated by the legislature as sufficient:\u2014\nIt would be extremely difficult, Lord Halsbury remarked in Wakelin's case[16], to lay down as a matter of law that precautions which the legislature has not enjoined should be observed by a railway company in the ordinary conduct of their traffic.\nNothing turns on the circumstance that the unfortunate man was dragged on to the track and mangled by the engine. The legal position would have been the same if his injuries had been sustained without that distressing incident. This was fully recognised in the court below.\nThere are, however, some other facts, and it is upon the effect attributed to them that I understand the judgment to have proceeded. I think the fallacy consists in regarding those other facts as essential facts.\nA Mr. Tapley had a sawmill at or near the spot in question. For the convenience of shipping his lumber by the railway he had made a road from the mill to the railway grounds, and the company had constructed a siding. There was a structure which is called a wharf, and was, if I correctly apprehend the evidence, some kind of platform on which boards could be piled and from which they could be conveniently loaded upon cars on the siding. The deceased had been sent by a customer of Tapley's for boards, and Tapley, not having what was wanted at the mill, directed the deceased to take them from the wharf. He had just driven his horses into position to begin loading from the wharf when the train appeared and the horses took fright.\nI am unable to see that the knowledge by the company of the existence and use of this wharf, or the consent and concurrence of the company in its erection and in the use of the siding for the purpose of the shipment of Tapley's lumber, and of bark or other produce brought there by others for shipment, alters the position in any respect material to the present inquiry. Setting aside the fact that the deceased was not using the structures for their intended purpose, or acting under any permission from the company, but regarding him in the same way as if he had brought lumber from the mill to pile it on the wharf for shipment, his position did not differ from that of a farmer delivering his grain at a warehouse beside the track, or a teamster waiting at a way station whose horses might be frightened by a passing train, without any breach of duty on the part of the company, and without any duty attaching to the company to give any kind of special notice that the train was approaching.\nSeveral cases have been relied on for the plaintiff either as showing that there may be circumstances in which special care is called for in operating the railway or that a liability may be incurred by neglecting to sound the whistle, and even by unnecessarily sounding it, and that the company may be liable even when the injury is sustained at a distance from the track. I do not propose to discuss those cases in detail. They will be found to be of two classes, viz.: cases where the railway crossed a highway, or where the complainant was injured while lawfully using or passing over the railway property. In Rosenberger v. The Grand Trunk Railway Company[17], which went as far as any case has gone, the railway crossed the highway, and the company neglected their statutory duty. The general remark of Spragge C. J., quoted by the learned Chief Justice in the court below, as to the duty of the company not being confined to that prescribed by the statute may perhaps be rather wide. It was merely obiter, because it was the neglect of a statutory duty that was there in question; but, at all events, it was made with reference to the crossing of a highway on the level, and cannot properly be taken to bear on a situation like that now under consideration.\nIn Sneesby vs. Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company[18] the negligence was in allowing some trucks to run down a siding over which the cattle were crossing on their way from the railway carriage in which they had been conveyed. The cattle were killed on another railway to which they had found their way, and which happened to belong to the same company. The ownership of that railway did not affect the liability of the defendant company, which would have been the same if the cattle had met their deaths by rushing in their fright over a precipice.\nTwo very recent cases may be usefully noted. One is The Victorian Railways Commissioners v. Coultas[19] decided by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council after the argument of the rule nisi in this case, where a person who was, by the negligence of the railway gatekeeper, allowed to drive across the track when a train was approaching, and who escaped actual impact but received a severe nervous shock from fright, was held not entitled to recover, the committee holding that the damages were too remote without deciding whether actual impact was necessary to the maintenance of the action. The other and later case, Simkin v. London and North-Western Railway Company[20] approaches more nearly to the present case in some of its facts than any other case which I have met with. The plaintiff's horse was frightened when leaving the station by an engine blowing off steam. The jury found that there was no negligence in the manner of the blowing off of the steam, but that the company ought to have erected a screen to shut out the view of the engines from the horses on the road. It was held that the evidence did not warrant the finding.\nI cite these because they are the latest cases on our subject, and not as necessarily bearing more directly than some others on the case in hand. It will be found, however, that the decisions proceed on the principles on which I have formed the opinions I have expressed, and that in Simkin's Case[21] the judgment delivered by Lopes C.J. follows to a great extent the same line of argument and illustration by which I have reached my conclusion.\nThe question of contributory negligence does not arise here as a separate question. The whole of the facts appear from the evidence adduced by the plaintiff, and the question is whether upon those facts the accident can properly be held to have been caused by the negligent conduct of the defendants in the running of the train.\nFor the reasons I have given, I am of opinion that that question must be answered in favor of the defendants.\nI have treated the case as if the company had been the only defendants. The engine-driver, who has been joined with them in the action, of course succeeds when the company succeeds. If the plaintiff had succeeded against the company the right of action asserted against the engine-driver might have required some consideration which is now unnecessary.\nI am of opinion that appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Weldon & McLean\nSolicitors for respondent: J.

C.\nWhere one member of a partnership borrows money upon his own credit by giving his own promissory note for the sum so borrowed, and he afterwards uses the proceeds of the note in the partnership business of his own free will without being under any obligation to, or contract with, the lender so to do, the partnership is not liable for said loan, under Art. 1867 C.C. Maguire v. Scott, 7 L. C. R. 451, distinguished.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side) ([1]), by which the judgment of the Superior Court, in review, which condemned the respondents to pay appellant $2,464422 with interest and costs was reversed and the \"judgment of the Superior Court which dismissed appellant's action was restored.\nThis was an action brought by the appellant to recover from the respondents, R. L. Cadwell and Henry J. Shaw, carrying on business in co-partnership under the name style and firm of \" The New York Piano Company,\" the amount of two promissory notes and interest accrued thereon one dated 20th September 1881 for $910.50 and the other dated 31st March 1883, for $1,100, and both signed by Henry J. Shaw alone to the order of the plaintiff; the plaintiff alleging in his declaration that these notes were so signed and given to him for money loaned by him to the firm '' The New York Piano Company,'' and of which the said firm had the benefit; to which the defendants pleaded that the said firm did not get or borrow any amount of money from the plaintiff, or ever had any business transaction with him but that the transaction was entirely between the plaintiff and his brother, Henry J. Shaw, personally, and not the firm.\nFrom the evidence which is reviewed at length in the judgment and in the report of the case in the court below ([2]), it appeared that although the money was used by the New York Piano Company, it was advanced to H. J. Shaw, personally, who was also a partner of the appellants' in the firm of Henry J. Shaw & Co., in the furniture business which firm became insolvent and made an assignment for the benefit of their creditors\nROBERTSON Q.C., and FALCONER for appellant.\nThe respondents would not be liable under the English law, but under article 1867, C.C., they are liable, for it is enough to show that the moneys were \u201capplied to the use of the partnership.\" Maguire v. Scott, ([3]) and Codifiers' Report on Partnership ([4]). The authorities relied on by respondents in the court below are not applicable as art. 1867 is not to be found in the French Code.\nGeoffrion Q.C., and Carter for respondents. Art. 1867 C C. must be read with art. 1855 C.C.\nThe case of Maguire v. Scott (2) referred to in the authorities under article 1867 is entirely different from the present one; in that case it was a purchase of goods by one partner in his own name, the seller being in ignorance of the partnership, but the goods went into the partnership business at once, and the court held the partnership liable.\nAt the time of the making of the notes the appellant was aware of the respondents' partnership; he did not give credit to the respondents, but to his brother, Henry J. Shaw, and in such a case the law is very clear. See Pothier (Ed. Paris, 1825), Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ([5]); Story on Partnership ([6]); Pont. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ([7]); Pardessus ([8]); Lindley on Partnership ([9]); Alauzet Soc. Civ. and Com. ([10]); Duranton ([11]); Duvergier ([12]).\nFournier and Taschereau JJ. were of Opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Cross in the Court of Queen's Bench ([13]).\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that the judgments of the Superior Court and of the Court of Queen's Bench at Montreal in appeal should be affirmed for the reasons given in the judgment of Mr. Justice Cross, and that this appeal should be dismissed \"with costs The case is purely one of fact and the sole question is: To whom and upon whose credit did the plaintiff lend the money for which the two promissory notes sued upon were made? And, in my opinion, the proper conclusion to draw from the evidence is that the loans were made to, and upon the credit of, Henry J. Shaw, the maker of the notes alone and not at all to or upon the credit of the New York Piano Company. The motive for the loan, I think, sufficiently appears upon the evidence of the plaintiff himself to have been an interest given to the plaintiff, by Henry J, Shaw, in the firm of Henry J. Shaw & Co. when the first note was given which interest was increased about the time that the second loan was made and the second note given. The money lent to Henry J. Shaw, or money to the same or nearly the same amount, was, no doubt, put by Henry J. Shaw into the business of the Piano Company, in which firm Henry J. Shaw was a partner but that was a matter wholly under the control of Henry J. Shaw, who might have done so, or have withheld from doing so, of his own free will and pleasure. The plaintiff's own conduct from the time of the making of the notes until sometime after the firm of Henry J. Shaw & Co. became insolvent plainly, I think shews that he never contemplated having any other security for the loans than Henry J. Shaw himself personally. The first note was made in September, 1881 payable in two months and the second in March. 1883, payable in 30 days. Yet the plaintiff, although, apparently, repeatedly making the most urgent demands upon Henry J. Shaw for payment of the money secured by the notes, as loans made to himself, does not appear to have ever made any demand upon the Piano Company, or in conversation even with any person to have alluded to them as his debtors until after the failure of the firm of Henry J. Shaw & Co., nor until after he had had presented to him a statement of his account as appearing in the books of that firm purporting to shew him to be largely indebted to Henry J. Shaw, after receiving credit in the books of that firm for the two promissory notes.\nThe fair inference further to be drawn from the evidence I think, is that it was subsequently to the receipt by the plaintiff of this statement of his account as appearing in the books of Henry J. Shaw & Co., that the plaintiff's son, who was employed then as cashier in the New York Piano Company, gave the plaintiff the information as to the entries in the books of that firm upon which alone this action is based. and that then for the first time the plaintiff conceived. the idea of making the Piano Company responsible upon Henry J. Shaw's notes so as aforesaid already credited to him in the books of Henry J Shaw & Co. in which firm the plaintiff was a partner. But the entries made in the books of the Piano Company, under the circumstances in which they were made as appearing in the evidence, some of them having been made by the plaintiff's son without any apparent authority and, as pointed out by Mr. Justice Cross, corrected by cross-entries made apparently as soon as the entries were perceived by Henry J. Shaw, cannot have the effect of displacing all the other evidence plainly pointing to the conclusion that, in point of fact, the loans when made by the plaintiff were made to, and, upon the credit of Henry J. Shaw alone personally, and were so regarded by the plaintiff, himself, for more than three years after the first note, and for nearly two years after the second, became due, and until (after having received, as aforementioned, the statement of his account as appearing in the books of Henry J. Shaw & Co., giving him credit for these notes,) he received from his son the information upon Which he rests this action. The fact that Henry J. Shaw put the amounts which he borrowed from the plaintiff. or similar amounts into the business, of the Piano Company, does not, in my opinion, bring this case within article 1867 C.C. and make the Piano Company liable to the plaintiff upon the notes as for loans made to that company. That article, in my opinion, applies only to goods which constitute stock-in-trade of the partnership in the usual course of business and dealing of the firm and, as in Maguire v. Scott ([14]), to the implements necessary for and used in the carrying on of the partnership business, but not to money which one member of a partnership borrows upon his own credit and which, having so borrowed, he afterwards uses in the partnership business of his own free will, without being under any obligation to, or contract with, the lender so to do. In the English copy of the Code the word used is \"objects\" which are in the usual course of dealing and business of the partnership. In the French copy the word used is choses, &c &c &c.; neither of these words seem to be appropriate to cover loans of money made to one partner on his own personal credit and which he may or may not at his pleasure use in whole, or in part, for the purposes of the partnership.\nSTRONG and Patterson JJ. dissented.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Robertson.

Both give the same cadastral number for the property, of which that expropriated is a portion, and the same numbers of the location plan. The only difference is that in the one description that contained in the notice, the adjoining properties are not mentioned, whereas they are in the description contained in the award. In mentioning the adjoining properties the deed says that the lot expropriated is bounded to the north-west in part by the River St. Charles at low tide. The word \" low \" is evidently a slip of the pen made by the notary who has written low instead of high, because no portion of the railway line on appellant's property touches low tide. A glance at the plan makes that perfectly clear.\nThe decision of this court in Beaudet v. North Shore Railway Co. ([2]) is in our favor on this branch of the case.\nAs to whether the appellant is entitled to damages for the obstruction to his rights of acc\u00e8s et sortie and whether he can claim damages by an action at common law I rely upon the decision of this court in Pion v. The North Shore Railway Co. ([3]).\nLacoste Q.C. for respondent:\nThere can be no doubt that the plaintiff was not and never had been the owner of the beach in front of his property. Art. 2213 C.C. Through a mistake on the part of the officers of the company he had been dealt with as such, and the expropriation notice served upon him included both the beach and his dry land. Availing himself of this mistake he proceeded with the arbitration provided by the statute to settle the indemnity to be awarded for both pieces of land and afterwards the company having been sued by the Harbor Commission for the value of the same beach lot and condemned to pay it to them saw the error and declined to make a second payment of the price to the plaintiff. If the award had discriminated between the two lots and had settled their value severally; if it had even fixed an amount for damages \u00bb sustained, the plaintiff would stand m a different position, but it is of a lump sum for the whole land and it is impossible to say how much of it represents the value of the beach lot and how much the plaintiff's property.\nNor did the plaintiff establish in evidence these different values and there is nothing in the record to show what the land taken from him was worth nor what damage he may have sustained.\nThe court was therefore bound to dismiss his claim first because he sought to recover what did not belong to him and in the next place because no one could tell the value of the land which belonged to him.\nThough the courts may have allowed owners of lands conterminous with a railway, to bring action directly for damages caused by the building of the railway along or near such lands, no such action lies to recover the value of any land actually taken.\nThe second reason for which the defendant demands that the award be declared void is because the arbitrators by their award declared that the company should open a passage through the embankment, on which its road is laid on the beach between high and low water to give the plaintiff free access to the river St. Charles; that this opening was to be made forthwith at any point to be fixed by the plaintiff, that in default of doing so, the company should pay the plaintiff a sum of $1,500.\nIn this the arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award is in so far void.\nTheir only charge was to fix the amount of indemnity the company had to pay, and they could not order it to perform any works. Langelier Q.C. in reply\u2014The $1500 were awarded to \u00a1appellant as damages for being deprived of free access to the river, and both under the Railway Act and under the common law the appellant is entitled to recover the amount claimed by his action.\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014Did the arbitrators include in the award damages for any land taken by the railway other than the land of the plaintiff ?\nIt is clear that the land valued was part of No. 2102 of the official cadastre for the parish of St. Sauveur of Quebec, and being the Nos. 9 and 11 upon the plan of the railway deposited according to law.\nIt is true the award says\nQue sous l'autorit\u00e9 de l'Acte 45 Vic. chap. XX, la dite Compagnie du chemin fer du Nord requiert pour la construction et le d\u00e9placement d'une partie de sa vole ferr\u00e9e, le terrain suivant, savoir:\nUn certain terrain situ\u00e9 en la paroisse de St. Sauveur de Qu\u00e9bec, contenant un arpent et une perche en superficie, borne an nord-ouest, par le dit Bigaouette et partie par la rivi\u00e8re St. Charles \u00e0 basse mar\u00e9e, au sud-est, au sud et sud-ouest par le dit Bigaouette.\nIt is true that this makes the boundary \"part by the river St Charles at low water \" which is evidently a mere mistake, for the award goes on to show unmistakeably the land for which damages were awarded, viz.:\nLequel terrain fait partie du c\u00f4t\u00e9 du mord, du lot No. (2102) deux mille cent deux du cadastre pour la dite paroisse de St. Sauveur do Quebec et portant les num\u00e9ros neuf et onze sur le plan du trac\u00e9 du chemin de fer tel que d\u00e9pos\u00e9 suivant la loi.\nThis tallies with the Railway Company's notice Which describes the land required\nUne portion de terre de un arpent et une perche en superficie, telle que maintenant jalonn\u00e9e et faisant partie du num\u00e9ro (2102) deux mille cent deux du cadastre officiel pour la paroisse de St. Sauveur de Qu\u00e9bec et portant les num\u00e9ros neuf et onze, sur le plan du trac\u00e9 du chemin de fer d\u00e9pos\u00e9 suivant la loi\nAnd this is the same as in the award and that this only was the land appraised, is very clear, I think, from the award itself for immediately following the specific description the award says that the arbitrators\nQu'apr\u00e8s avoir au pr\u00e9alable pr\u00eat\u00e9 le serment requis par la loi, ainsi qu'il appert par les certificats ci-annex\u00e9s, ils ont proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'examen du dit terrain et d\u00e9pendances et pris tous les renseignements n\u00e9cessaires.\nThis can have been no other than that portion of lot No. (2102) numbered 9 and 11 on the plan filed by the Railway Company. Notwithstanding the error in the description as stated in the award and in the quantity as stated in the notice and award there was an adequate and sufficient description with convenient certainty of the land intended to be valued and of the land actually valued and to which the maxim falsa demonstratio non nocet clearly applies.\nAs to the objection that the arbitrators order the Railway Co. to make the opening this is not so; if no opening was made they assessed the damages at $1,500 for excluding the plaintiff from access to the land, but give the Railway Co. the privilege of making an opening, so affording the plaintiff access, a provision entirely in the defendant's interest, and if they did not choose to avail themselves of this privilege they must pay the full amount awarded viz. $5200.\nSince the decision in the North Shore Railway Co and Pion ([4]) there can be no doubt the appellant is entitled to receive the damages awarded in this case.\nSTRONG J. concurred with FOUKNIER J.\nFOURNIER, J.\u2014Par son action l'appelant r\u00e9clamait la somme de $5200, valeur d'un certain terrain lui appartenant, dans la paroisse de St-Sauveur de Qu\u00e9bec, et au sujet duquel l'intim\u00e9e qui en avait besoin pour l'usage de son chemin de fer, avait adopt\u00e9 les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s ordinaires d'expropriation. Les arbitres qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9s pour en faire l'\u00e9valuation rendirent une sentence arbitrale en vertu de laquelle ils accord\u00e8rent \u00e0 l'appelant $3,700, \u00e0 condition que la compagnie lui ouvrit un passage de 20 pieds de largeur pour communiquer librement \u00e0 travers le chemin de fer entre son terrain et la rivi\u00e8re St-Charles. Ils accord\u00e8rent aussi $1,500, de plus dans le cas ou le passage ne serait pas imm\u00e9diatement ouvert.\nL'intim\u00e9e ayant refuse et n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de se conformer \u00e0 cette sentence, l'appelant par prot\u00eat notari\u00e9 du 28 ao\u00fbt 1883 la somma d'ex\u00e9cuter la d\u00e9cision des arbitres, et prit ensuite une action pour la somme totale de $5200.\nL'intim\u00e9e plaida que l'arbitrage avait eu lieu sur une petite partie du terrain situ\u00e9 au-dessus du chemin de fer et sur une autre plus grande situ\u00e9e au-dessous de la ligne de la haute mar\u00e9e qui n'appartenait pas \u00e0 l'appelant, et que la sentence n'avait pas fix\u00e9 la valeur de la partie appartenant \u00e0 l'appelant. Que la sentence \u00e9tait encore nulle parce que les arbitres n'avaient aucun pouvoir d'accorder \u00e0 l'appelant qui n'y avait aucun droit, un libre acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re, ni de lui accorder $1,500 pour la construction du passage accord\u00e9.\nL'appelant a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9claration que la juste valeur du dit terrain et des dommages caus\u00e9s au demandeur, (l'appelant) par les travaux d\u00e9 la d\u00e9fenderesse) (l'intim\u00e9e) est la somme de $5,200, qu'il r\u00e9clame.\nCette action contient deux obligations diff\u00e9rentes l'une bas\u00e9e sur la sentence arbitrale en vertu de la loi des chemins de fer et l'autre sur le droit commun.\nApr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate et audition de cette cause devant l'honorable juge Casault, l'action de l'appelant fut renvoy\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens. Ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la cour du Banc de la Reine.\nLe jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieuee pronon\u00e7ant la nullit\u00e9 de la sentence arbitrale sur le principe que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour laquelle les arbitres ont accord\u00e9 l'indemnit\u00e9 de $5,200 n'est pas la m\u00eame que celle d\u00e9crite dans l'avis d'expropriation, n'est fond\u00e9 que sur une erreur cl\u00e9ricale il est incorrect de dire que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite dans la sentence est beaucoup plus grande que celle d\u00e9crite dans l'avis, et qu'elle contient m\u00eame une partie de la gr\u00e8ve de la rivi\u00e8re St.-Charles qui n'appartient pas \u00e0 l'appelant. Il suffit de comparer les deux descriptions pour voir que cette allegation n'est pas fond\u00e9e. Dans les deux descriptions le m\u00eame num\u00e9ro cadastral est mentionn\u00e9 pour la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dont celle expropri\u00e9e fait partie, ainsi que les m\u00eames num\u00e9ros du plan de localisation.\nLa seule diff\u00e9rence est que dans la description donn\u00e9e dans l'avis, les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s voisines ne sont pas d\u00e9sign\u00e9es tandis qu'elles le sont dans la sentence. C'est dans cette derni\u00e8re description que le notaire a commis une erreur cl\u00e9ricale en disant que le lot expropri\u00e9 est borne au nord-ouest par la rivi\u00e8re St,-Charles \u00e0 mar\u00e9e basse. C'est \u00e0 mar\u00e9e haute qu'il aurait d\u00fb dire car aucune partie du chemin de fer ne se rend \u00e0 mar\u00e9e basse. C'est ce qui a fait dire que la sentence avait accord\u00e9 plus de terrain qu'il n'en \u00e9tait demand\u00e9. On ne peut adopter cette mani\u00e8re de voir qu'en se basant sur l'erreur de plume qui fait dire an notaire le contraire du contenu de ses deux documents car dans l'un et l'autre il mentionne la m\u00eame \u00e9tendue et les m\u00eames num\u00e9ros du plan de localisation. Il est \u00e9vident que les arbitres n'ont pas voulu comprendre la gr\u00e8ve dans les limites du terrain d\u00e9crit dans leur sentence, puisqu'ils n'ont assign\u00e9 \u00e0 ce terrain qu'une superficie de 101 perches tandis que la gr\u00e8ve \u00e0 elle seule en a 129.\nLa pr\u00e9tention que la sentence fait payer 21 perches de terrain de plus qu'il n'y en a n'est pas fond\u00e9e. Les arpenteurs Sewell et Lefrancois qui out mesur\u00e9 ce terrain en 1886 disent bien que l'intim\u00e9e n'occupe que 80 perches. Mais il ne s'agit pas ici de la quantit\u00e9 occup\u00e9e, si l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas pris tout son terrain, c'est sans doute qu'elle n'en avait pas besoin de plus, mais cela ne prouve nullement que c'est l'appelant qui en a la possession. Lorsque l'avis lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9, l'intim\u00e9e requ\u00e9rait cent une perches telles que jalonn\u00e9es sur le terrain. Cet avis b\u00e2 s\u00e9 sur le rapport de l'arpenteur Tourigny, qui avait visit\u00e9 et fait l'\u00e9valuation du terrain en question doit \u00eatre correct. C'est sur son rapport quo l'expropriation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en 1883, accordant la quantit\u00e9 demand\u00e9e.\nOn a aussi fait contre cette sentence l'objection que les arbitres ont outrepass\u00e9 leur juridiction en ordonnant \u00e0 la compagnie de construire un passage pour donner \u00e0 l'appelant l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re St.-Charles. La sentence ne contient pas r\u00e9ellement un ordre \u00e0 cet effet. C'est plut\u00f4t en substance une condamnation \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l'appelant la somme de $5,200, avec l'option de ne payer que $3,200, si on lui accorde le passage mentionn\u00e9; car dans ce cas il y aura \u00e0 faire d\u00e9duction de $1,500.\nC'est moins un ordre qu'une facult\u00e9 laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 la compagnie. Les t\u00e9moignages de 0-rondin et de Bell expliquent ce fait bien clairement. D'ailleurs en payant les $5,200, la compagnie peut se soustraire \u00e0 cette condition qu\u00ee se trouve plut\u00f4t en sa faveur.\nDans cette cause comme dans celle de Pion et al contre l'intim\u00e9e d\u00e9cid\u00e9e l'\u00e9t\u00e9 dernier au Conseil priv\u00e9 de Sa Majest\u00e9([5]),l'intim\u00e9e a ni\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant, propri\u00e9taire riverain de la rivi\u00e8re St-Charles le droit \u00e0 l'acc\u00e9s \u00e0 la dite rivi\u00e8re, et \u00e0 des dommages dans le cas o\u00f9 il en serait priv\u00e9 et lui a aussi ni\u00e9 le droit de r\u00e9clamer par action en vertu du droit commun la valeur du terrain que la compagnie avait prise pour son usage, pr\u00e9tendant qu'il ne pouvait agir contre elle pour en r\u00e9clamer la valeur, qu'en vertu de l'Acte des chemins de fer r\u00e9glant les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s d'expropriation pour l'utilit\u00e9 des chemins de fer.\nQuoique ces deux questions soient importantes, il serait tout-\u00e0-fait inutile de les discuter maintenant car elles out \u00e9t\u00e9, le ler ao\u00fbt 1889, toutes deux jug\u00e9es par le conseil priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Pion et at contre la dite intim\u00e9e, ([6]) et dans un sens favorable aux pr\u00e9tentions de l'appelant. Je me contente de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer au jugement ou ces deux questions sont longuement et savamment trait\u00e9es.\nPar tons ces motifs je suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre alloue, et les deux jugements de la cour du Banc de la Reine et de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, infirm\u00e9s \u2014et jugement rendu en faveur de l'appelant pour le montant de sa demande contre l'intim\u00e9e, avec d\u00e9pens dans toutes les cours.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion to dismiss this appeal. The plaintiff clearly claims from the company the payment of the value of the beach lying in front of his property. He admits it in his evidence. Now that beach does not belong to him but to the Crown and the Company has paid for it to the Crown or its trustees the Harbour Commissioners and the arbitrators had not the power in an arbitration between the plaintiff and the defendant to estimate the value of lands belonging to the Crown. They erroneously did do. and the fact that the company induced them into that error cannot validate the arbitration and this arbitration cannot stand\nThe Superior Court dismissed the action. The Court of Appeal unanimously confirmed that judgment. I do not see how any other judgment could have been given. Nor can I see what application to this case the case of Pion v.

J. Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nAssessments and taxes\u2014Lien\u2014Priority of mortgage made before statute\u2014Construction of act\u2014Healing clauses\u2014Effect and application of.\nThe Halifax City assessment Act, 1888, made the taxes assessed on real estate in said city a first lien thereon except as against the crown.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that such lien attached on a lot assessed under the act in preference to a mortgage made before the act was passed.\nThe act provided that in case of non-payment of taxes assessed upon any lands thereunder the City Collector should submit to the mayor a statement in duplicate of lands liable to be sold for such non-payment, to which statements the mayor should affix his signature and the seal of the corporation; one of such statements should then be filed with the city clerk and the other returned to tho collector with a warrant annexed thereto, and in any suit or other proceeding relating to the assessment on any real estate therein mentioned, any statements or lists so signed and sealed should be received as conclusive evidence of the legality of the assessment, &c. In a suit to foreclosure a mortgage on land which had been sold for taxes under this act the legality of the assessment and sale was attacked.\nHeld, per Strong, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ., that to make this provision operative to cure a defect in the assessment caused by failure to give a notice required by a previous section it was necessary for the defendants to show, affirmatively, that the statements had been signed and sealed in duplicate and filed as required by the act, and the production and proof of one of such statements was not sufficient.\nPer Ritchie C.J. and Patterson J., that it was sufficient to produce the statement returned to the collector signed and sealed as required, and with the necessary warrant annexed, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary it must be assumed that all the proceedings were regular and that the provisions of the statute requiring duplicate statements had been complied with.\nThe act also provided that the deed to a purchaser of lands sold for taxes should be conclusive evidence that all the provisions with reference to the sale had been complied with.\nHeld, per Strong, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ., that this provision could only operate to make the deed available to cure defects in the proceedings connected with the sale and would not cover the failure to give notice of assessment required before the taxes could be imposed.\nHeld, per Ritchie C.J. and Patterson J., that the deed could not be invoked in the present case to cure any defects in the proceedings' as it was not delivered to the purchaser until after the suit commenced; therefore a failure to give notice that the land was liable to be sold for taxes, which notice was required by the act, rendered the sale void.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming a judgment in favor of the plaintiff for a decree of foreclosure and an injunction restraining the defendants from interfering with the lands described in the mortgage foreclosed.\nThe facts of the case, which are more fully stated in the judgments hereinafter given, are as follows:\nThe action in this case was one for foreclosure of a mortgage made by the defendant John Holland to the plaintiff. After the mortgage was executed an act was passed by the legislature of Nova Scotia (46 Vic. ch. 28) relating to assessments on property in the City of Halifax where the land was situated. Section 13 of that act provided that \"the rates and taxes levied * * on real estate shall be a special lien on said real estate, having preference over any claim, lien, privileges or incumbrances of any party except the crown,\" etc.\nUnder this act the property described in the mortgage was sold for unpaid taxes, and one John Meagher became the purchaser at such sale. The defendants O'Brien and Brooks are the administrators for said Meagher, who died pending the action, and the defendant Theakston is the collector of rates and taxes for the City of Halifax.\nIn the foreclosure suit the plaintiff claimed that the sale for taxes only operated as a sale of the equity of redemption; that the act, having been passed after the mortgage was made, could not affect his rights; that if it could the act must be followed strictly, and there were irregularities in the assessment that made the sale void as against the mortgagees.\nOn the first trial of the cause judgment was given for the plaintiff, the trial judge holding that the lien created by the assessment act did not take precedence of the mortgage[2]. The full court, on appeal, held that it did, but on the ground that a regular assessment had not been proved, or any justification for the sale, a new trial was ordered. On the second trial, judgment was given for the plaintiff and affirmed by the full court, on the ground that the proceedings under the act were irregular and void.

RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I entirely agree with the judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Patterson in this case and think the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This action as originally framed was brought by the present respondent Charles Cogswell and Francis Duncan, trustees under the will of Isabella Cogswell, deceased, as mortgagees, against John Holland their mortgagor, John Meagher who assumed to be the purchaser of the mortgaged property at a sale for taxes claimed to be due to the City of Halifax, and William C. Hamilton the collector of the city who had made the sale; and it sought to have the plaintiffs declared entitled to priority over the city in respect of the lien for taxes, and over the purchaser at the tax sale, by reason of the prior date of the plaintiff's mortgage, and prayed for an injunction restraining the city from completing the sale, and for foreclosure. All the defendants, except Holland the mortgagor (who has taken no part in any of the proceedings), having filed statements of defence the action came on for trial befor Mr. Justice Weatherbee, without a jury, who gave judgment for the plaintiffs, holding that the mortgage had priority over the city's lien for taxes and that the plaintiffs were entitled to an injunction and to foreclosure as prayed. This judgment was, on appeal to the Supreme Court in banc, set aside and a new trial was ordered. Pending the proceedings, Francis Duncan, one of the plaintiffs, and the original defendants, John Meagher and William C. Hamilton, had all died. On the 19th October, 1888, the Chief Justice made an order in chambers permitting the surviving plaintiff Cogswell to amend the statement of claim, which he did by adding as defendants the appellants O'Brien and Brooks, the executors and devisees in trust of Meagher, as representing any interest which he might have acquired under the tax sale, also by substituting Theakston, who had succeeded Hamilton as city collector, as a defendant in his stead, and by making an entirely new case impeaching the validity of the assessment and the sale for taxes, and insisting upon the consequent nullity of the deed carrying out the sale which had been executed by the mayor and city collector on the 13th of October, 1888, before the leave to amend was given. To this amended statement of claim defences were put in by the new defendants, to which replies were filed, and the action was again tried before the Chief Justice, who found a verdict and entered judgment for the plaintiff upon the ground that the assessment of the tax and the sale were both void by reason of failure to comply with the requirements of the statutes governing those proceedings. From this judgment there was a second appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banc, and that court composed of five judges unanimously sustained the judgment pronounced at the trial. From this latter judgment the defendants the trustees of Meagher and the collector of the city, have now appealed to this court.\nThe general principles applicable to the construction of statutes imposing and regulating the enforcement of taxes for general and municipal purposes are well settled. Enactments of this class are to be construed strictly, and in all cases of ambiguity which may arise that construction is to be adopted which is most favorable to the subject. Further, all steps prescribed by the statute to be taken in the process either of imposing or levying the tax are to be considered essential and indispensable unless the statute expressly provides that their omission shall not be fatal to the legal validity of the proceedings; in other words, the pro\" visions requiring notices to be given and other formalities to be observed are to be construed as imperative, and not as merely directory, unless the contrary is explicitly declared.\nThe statute under which the city officers assumed to act in making the assessment and sale now called in question is the statute of Nova Scotia entitled \"The Halifax City Assessment Act of 1883\" as amended by an act passed in May, 1886.\nThis statute conforming to the scheme generally followed in legislation of this kind, provides for two distinct processes in the imposition and enforcement of the tax to be carried out by two distinct sets of officers\u2014the assessors and the collectors. Applying the principles already referred to it is plain that if any of the formalities or requirements prescribed by the act have been omitted by any of the officers in question the sale and the deed executed for the purpose of carrying it out are absolute nullities, unless it is indicated in the statute itself that the step which has been omitted is to be regarded as a non-essential proceeding, or unless the case comes within the terms of some provision enacted for the purpose of covering defects caused by failure to observe the procedure laid down by the statute.\nThe defects in the proceedings which are relied on as vitiating the sale are the omission by the assessor and Board of Assessors to give the notices required by sections 37 and 93 respectively, and the neglect of the collector to give the notice prescribed by section 57. It may at once be said that nothing is to be found in the statute which would warrant us in holding that the provisions requiring these three notices to be given are to be regarded as directory, or otherwise than as imperative. Failure to give any one of them must therefore be regarded as fatal to the sale, unless some healing clause can be pointed out sufficient to cover such an omission.\nSection 37 is as follows:\nAs soon as the whole amount of real and personal property, on which any person, company or corporation is to be assessed within any ward of the city, is determined, the chief assessor shall serve, or cause to be served, a notice of such valuation upon the person assessed, or his agent, or on the company or corporation, their officer, clerk or agent, by delivering the same personally, or by leaving it on the property so assessed, or by mailing the said notice through the post office duly registered. This notice shall be in the following form, in print, or ink, or both:\nWard No.\nName, No. and Description of Property.\nValue of Real Estate.\nValue of Personal Property.\nTotal Amount on which Assessm't is to be Levied.\nI hereby give you notice that the Board of City Assessors, to the best of their judgment, have made the above valuation of your real and personal estate within Ward No. \u2014, of the City of Halifax, on which assessment for the year 18\u2014 is to be levied. If you wish to object thereto you are hereby notified to furnish me at my office, in the City Court House, within fourteen days from this date, with a written statement, under oath, according to the form herewith served upon you.\nTo Mr. \u2014\u2014\n__________________\nChief Assessor.\nDated at Halifax, day of 188\nThese notices are to bear date on the days on which they are respectively served or mailed.\nThe material importance of the notice thus required is shown by the following section (38) which is in these words:\nAfter service of the notice, fourteen days shall be allowed to the parties, to be rated, or their agents, to furnish the Board of City Assessors with a written statement, under oath, of the real and personal estate in the following form:\nThe Chief Justice before whom the action was tried has found that the notice thus required by section 37 was not served, and the court in banc have concurred in that finding. That the attempt to prove the service of this notice by the witness Brown was, for the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice in his judgment, entirely abortive, is so clear that I consider it sufficient to refer to what he says (which I entirely adopt), without any further examination of the evidence.\nIt is said, however, that the omission to serve this notice is covered by the provisions of section 95 as amended. Sec. 94 and sec. 95 as amended are as follows:\n94. In case the taxes upon any of the lands mentioned in said list have not been paid to the City Collector, with interest from the time they were cue, before the 1st day of September following the delivery of said list by the Board of City Assessors to the City Collector of Rates and Taxes, the City Collector shall submit to the Mayor a statement in duplicate of all the lands liable, under the pro visions of this Act, to be sold for taxes, which shall contain a definite description of each lot, with the amount of arrears of taxes set opposite to the same, and the Mayor shall authenticate each of said statements by affixing thereunto the Seal of the Corporation and his signature, and one of said statements shall be deposited with the City Clerk, and the other shall be returned to the Collector, with a warrant thereto annexed under the hand of the Mayor and the seal of the City in the following form:\nSec. 95.\u2014Any statements or lists so signed by the Mayor and sealed with the Seal of the City, or a copy thereof, or of any portion thereof, certified under the hand of the City Clerk, shall in any suit or other proceeding relating to the assessment on the real estate therein mentioned, or at which it may be questioned, be received in any Court in this Province as conclusive evidence of the legality of the assessment, and that the same is due and unpaid, and that each lot of land in paid statement mentioned is legally liable for the amount of taxes set opposite the same, with interest and expenses, and that said amount forms a lien on said land.\nIt is obvious that it is a condition precedent to the applicability of this section 95 for the purpose of covering defects in the assessment proceedings, such as the want of the notice required by section 37, that the lists provided for by section 94 shall be in duplicate and authenticated by the mayor affixing to each of such duplicates his signature and the city seal. This was not found to have been done. The Chief Justice as to this finds that \"no evidence was adduced on the trial that any such statement was so authenticated in duplicate by the mayor, nor was there any evidence that a copy of the list or statement annexed to the warrant to the collector was ever filed in the office of the city clerk.\" This is an incontrovertible conclusion from the evidence\u2014and it thus appears that sec. 95 is wholly ineffectual for the purpose for which it was relied on by the defendants. It is said, however, that sec. 110 (as amended) covers the want of notice required by sec. 37. As this amended sec. 110, is also relied on as an answer to the objections raised for non-compliance with sec. 57 and 93, I defer the consideration of it until I have stated the secs. last mentioned.\nSec. 57 is in these words:\nAs soon as the assessment book shall be deposited with the Collector, he shall cause each person or company rated, or their agents, to be served with a notice in the following form, the said notice to be made out by the Board of City Assessors, as provided by the preceding section:\u2014\nAnd sec. 93 is as follows: \u2014\nIt shall be the duty of the City Board of Assessors carefully to examine said list and ascertain if the lands therein mentioned are properly described, and they shall notify the occupants of said lands, if any, and the owners thereof, if known, upon their respective assessment notice for the current year, that the land is liable to be sold for arrears of taxes, and said Board of Assessors shall, before the 31st day of May in each year, return said list, or a corrected copy thereof in case any error is discovered therein, to the City Collector, signed by the City Assessors, or any two of them, and said list shall be filed in the office of the City Collector for public use.\nThere is no proof whatever that either of the two notices required by these sections 57 and 93 was served.\nThe case is therefore narrowed down to the single question: Is the want of all these essential preliminaries covered by section 110 as amended? That amended section is to be read as follows:\u2014\nThe deed shall be under the seal of the city in the form or to the same effect as in schedule A to this Act, and shall particularly and fully describe the land conveyed. Said deed shall be conclusive evidence that all the provisions of this Act with reference to the sale of the land therein described have been fully complied with, and every act and thing necessary for the legal perfecting of such sale have been duly performed, and shall have the effect of vesting said land in the grantee or purchaser, his heirs or assigns, in fee simple, free and discharged from all incumbrances whatsoever, whether registered or not; except in the case of land in which the fee is in the city of Halifax, when the deed shall give the purchaser the same rights in respect of the land as the original lessee.\nAnd except as aforesaid, any deed in the form or to the same effect as in the said schedule, purporting to be executed under the Seal of the City of Halifax, by the Mayor and City Collector, shall vest in the grantee therein named, his heirs and assigns, a full, absolute and indefeasible estate in fee simple to the land therein described.\nI am of opinion that in order to give effect to this section 110 we must hold that the omission to give the notices required by sections 57 and 93 was covered by it upon the deed being executed. These notices are preliminaries required by the act with reference to the sale and have nothing to do with the imposition or assessment of the tax. They come, therefore, within the words of the 110th section which provide that \"the deed shall be conclusive evidence that all the provisions of the act with reference to the sale of the land have been complied with,\" and, in my judgment, cover the objections to the title which have been rested on the failure of the City Collector to comply with the requirements of section 57 and with the failure of the Board of Assessors to give the notice required by section 93, the notices mentioned in both these sections being provided for as preliminaries of the sale and not of the assessment. This, however, leaves the objection founded on section 37, which relates not to the sale but to the assessment and imposition of the tax, wholly untouched. I have already pointed out that there is no proof that this very important notice required by section 37 was given and that the Chief Justice expressly found that the attempt to prove it wholly failed. I have further shown that the objection founded on this omission was not covered by sections 94 and 95 inasmuch as the defendants had not shown that the conditions precedent required to make these sections operative had been complied with. The consequence must be that the court below were perfectly right in adjudicating as they did that the alleged assessment was a nullity, rendering all subsequent proceedings void unless this radical defect in the proceedings is covered by the 110th section. This is, indeed, the cardinal point in the case. Does then the 110th section cure defects and omissions in the assessments and make the deed a cover for all such, as well as for failures to comply with the provisions relating to the enforcement of the tax? First, it is to be observed that there is a very great difference between the relative importance of the two sets of objections\u2014those relating to the sale and those relating to the assessment. As regards the latter, the omission to give all notices such as that called for by section 37 renders all the proceedings ex parte and is equivalent to an omission to serve any process in the case of an ordinary action at law. The very first principles of justice such as that embodied in the maxim \"audi alteram partem\" require a most rigorous performance by the city officers of the duty to give this notice of section 37. The omission to observe the requirements as to preliminaries of sale either as to the notices or as to the advertisements does not go to the legality of the tax itself but merely relates to proceedings for its enforcement It is obvious that between these two objects there is a very wide difference. If the legislature has in unequivocal words said that a man's property may be sold for taxes and his title divested, although the tax for which it was sold was illegally imposed, and although the owner never had any notice of its imposition, the courts are bound to give effect to what the lawgiver has so enacted, and the gross hardship and flagrant injustice of such a law is no answer to an action invoking its judicial enforcement and application. These considerations do, however, constitute grounds for very carefully and strictly construing an enactment relied upon as warranting such a harsh and unreasonable conclusion and for so restricting its operation as to avoid injustice, if the language will possibly admit of such a construction.\nI am prepared to concede that the deed was properly in evidence and that the case must be dealt with entirely on the effect which we can attribute to it upon the facts in evidence according to the true construction of the terms of the 110th section. Then to come to the language of that section\u2014I am clear that the words \"said deed shall be conclusive evidence that all the particulars of the act with reference to the sale of the land therein described have been fully complied with and every act and thing necessary for the legal perfecting of such sale have been fully performed,\" are according to the prim\u00e2 facie meaning of the words themselves confined to proceedings preliminary to the sale not to proceedings relating to the assessment or levying of the tax, that is to proceedings which are to be taken after the roll goes into the hands of the executive officer, the collector, for the collection and enforcement of the tax\u2014and not to proceedings connected with the quasi adjudication which according to the machinery of the act is the result of the act of the assessors and the omission of the party rated to object to it. The words \"legally perfecting of the sale,\" obviously relate to proceedings after the sale and intervening between that act and the actual execution of the deed. The results so far indicated follow as the plain natural construction of the words used according to their primary meaning. The words immediately following \"shall have the effect of vesting said land in the grantee or purchaser his heirs or assigns in fee simple free and discharged from all encumbrances whatsoever\" are obviously added to indicate that the sale and conveyance shall pass not only the interest of the land owner whose property has been sold but (as is said in so many words) shall pass that interest and confer a title paramount to any incumbrances created by the landowner whether prior or subsequent to the imposition of the tax.\nThere remain however the concluding words of the section \"any deed in the form or to the same effect as in the said schedule purporting to be executed under the seal of the City of Halifax by the Mayor and City Collector shall vest in the grantee therein named his heirs and assigns, a full absolute and indefeasible estate, in fee simple to the land therein described.\"\nIn the first place it is to be remarked that we are bound, by well settled principles governing the construction of statutes already adverted to, to construe these words if possible in such a way as not to give them the violent and unjust operation contended for, according to which land which may have been illegally assessed for taxes might be sold and conveyed behind the back of the owner without the slightest notice having been given to him. If it is possible then to find any reasonable application of the language used which will avoid this the court is bound to adopt it, and it is also bound to be astute to find such an alternative construction and thus avoid doing a great wrong and violating the first principles of natural justice under a form of law. I am of opinion that keeping in mind these guiding principles it is not difficult to find an explanation of this clause which will avoid doing injustice to any one. Adverting to the context we find that the conclusive effect which the prior words, according to the exposition of them already given, were designed to give to the deed only applied to cure defects in the preliminaries of the sale; it is reasonable, therefore, that we should read these words \"full, absolute and indefeasible estate,\" as subservient to the preceding part of the section and not as intended to give any enlarged operation to the deed beyond that which the legislature manifestly intended to attribute to it when declaring and defining its \"conclusive effect;\" therefore we are to read this latter part of the section in connection with the preceding one, and thus to read the words \"all the provisions of the act with reference to the sale of land,\" as governing the whole section, in which way a reasonable interpretation of this last clause is reached, and one by which the great injustice of the violent construction contended for is avoided. Further, these words \"a full, absolute and indefeasible estate in fee simple,\" may well be construed as only intended to indicate the quantity of estate to be taken by the grantee in a tax deed, and as declaring that the land is from thenceforth irredeemable; and, therefore, to be only applicable to the case of a regular sale and a legal deed, and not as having any reference at all to the effect of a deed following a void sale made upon a void or irregular assessment. For such a purpose much stronger and more apposite and precise terms would have been indispensable.\nThe conclusion is, that the appeal fails and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia must be sustained as regards the question principally involved. I am of opinion, however, that the City Collector is not, on any recognized rule as to parties, a proper party defendant to the action, and as to him the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs in both courts; in other respects the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I agree with my brother Gwynne, and for the reasons by him given I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014On the 15th of August, 1882, one John Holland, being then seized in fee of a piece of land in the city of Halifax, in the Province of Nova Scotia, by an indenture of mortgage of that date conveyed to Charles Cogswell and Francis Duncan in fee simple, as trustees by way of security for payment of the sum of $3,000, the said piece of land by the following description:\u2014\nAll that certain piece or parcel of land, situate in the City of Halifax, being a certain proportion of property belonging to or known as Doctor Jennings' field, joining fields situate on the Studley or Cobourg Road and Oxford Street, being three lots numbered five, six and seven on a plan of said field, made on the 16th of June, 1870, and filed in the office of Registry of Deeds for the County of Halifax, which said lots are bounded, &c.\nThis indenture of mortgage was recorded in the office for the registry of deeds on the 26th day of September, 1882. The monies secured by this indenture of mortgage being unpaid, contrary to the terms and conditions of the said indenture, the mortgagees upon the 6th day of April, 1887, commenced an action in the Supreme Court for Nova Scotia against the mortgagor, John Holland, for foreclosure of the said indenture of mortgage. In this action one Alexander C. Hamilton, as collector of taxes for the City of Halifax, and one John Meagher, were made parties, defendants, upon the ground that the defendant Hamilton as such collector of taxes, claiming to have a lien on the said land for certain alleged arrears of taxes, had wrongfully, upon the 21st December, 1886, offered for sale, and assumed to sell to the defendant Meagher, the said land as for such arrears of taxes, but that no deed had as yet been executed; and the plaintiffs prayed, among other things, that it might be declared that the defendant Meagher had no right in or to the said mortgaged land and premises, or to any part thereof, in priority to the plaintiffs' claim for the principal and interest comprised in the said indenture of mortgage and secured thereby but that the rights of the said Meagher, if any he had, are subject to the rights of the plaintiffs. And they further prayed that the defendant Hamilton might be enjoined and restrained, as such collector of taxes, from signing, executing, or delivering to the said defendant Meagher or to any other person or persons any deed which should convey, or purport to convey, the said mortgaged lands and premises in priority to the said mortgage debt thereon, unless or until the said mortgage debt should have been first duly paid to the plaintiffs. And the plaintiffs charged and claimed that any right or interest which the said defendants, or either of them, have or hold in the said mortgaged lands and premises, if any such there be, are not prior to the said indenture of mortgage made to the said plaintiffs, and the registry thereof in the office for the registry of deeds in the County of Halifax. And the plaintiffs prayed for payment of their said mortgage debt or, in default, for foreclosure or sale of the said mortgaged lands and premises; and that the plaintiffs should have such other and further relief in the premises as to right and justice appertains. Now this action was simply an action for foreclosure of the mortgage and to which the defendants, Hamilton and Meagher, were made parties as being persons who claimed to have an interest or estate in the mortgaged lands and premises, which interest or estate if they, or either of them, had any, the plaintiffs did not admit, but insisted was an interest in the equity of redemption and that, therefore, they were necessary parties to the action for foreclosure of the mortgaged premises.\nTo this action, the defendant Holland offered no defence. The defendant Meagher filed a statement of defence, and therein insisted that the said mortgaged lands and premises, after the date of the said alleged mortgage, and while in the possession and occupation of the said John Holland, having been duly assessed and rated for taxes and rates due by law to the City of Halifax for the civic years 1883 and 1884, and for subsequent years, such rates and taxes remaining unpaid became a special lien and charge on said land under the Halifax City Assessment Act of 1883, and that proceedings were duly taken under the said act by the City of Halifax to enforce said lien, and that on the 21st day of December, 1886, the said land and premises were duly sold at public auction by the city collector under said act, and in compliance with the provisions of said act and amending acts, to satisfy said taxes so in arrear and interest, and expenses, and that the said defendant (Meagher) became the purchaser at the said sale for $290, and that the defendant thereupon paid said sum to the city collector and obtained a certificate of said sale from said collector under said act, by virtue of which the defendant claims to hold said land, and to receive the rents and profits free and clear from the plaintiffs alleged mortgage and all other incumbrances. And the defendant (Meagher) further claimed to have a title to the said land in priority to the plaintiffs' alleged mortgage under the provisions of the Halifax City Assessment Act of 1883, and as holder of a certificate from the city collector, made and given to the defendant on the 21st day of December, 1886, under the 101st section of said act. The defendant Hamilton also filed a statement of defence, in which he insisted that the sale of the said land to the defendant Meagher and the certificate thereof were good and valid under the Halifax City Assessment Acts of 1883 and 1886, but it is unnecessary to set out at large the matters pleaded by him, because all that is material to the case is comprised in the above extracts from the defence of the defendant Meagher. To the defence of the defendant Meagher the plaintiffs, besides joining issue with him upon the allegations in his defence contained, replied, among other thing's, that the said lands were not assessed to the said John Holland, and that none of the notices of assessment and liability for taxes in respect of said lands were served upon or given to the said John Holland, as by law required, and no notices of said assessment or liability for taxes in respect of said land were given to any one liable therefor, and the said rates and taxes did not become a special lien and a charge on said lands under the City of Halifax Assessment Act of 1883, as alleged, in preference and in priority to the previously vested rights therein of the plaintiffs, and by virtue of the mortgages thereon in the statement of claim mentioned, and further, that the said lands were not duly assessed and rated for taxes due by the said John Holland as alleged, and further, that the certificate of the city collector, under which the said defendant Meagher claims to hold the said lands free and clear from the plaintiffs' mortgage, is illegal and void; and further, that the City Assessment Act of 1883, and chapter 60 of the acts of 1886, in amendment thereof, are not retrospective so as to deprive the plaintiffs of their previously registered and vested rights in the said lands referred to in the plaintiffs' claim which the said John Meagher alleges that he purchased at said tax sale.\nThis special replication to the defence of the defendant Meagher does not appear to have been at all necessary, for the plaintiffs' joinder in issue to the defendant's statement of defence put in issue everything that was material, and cast upon Meagher the whole onus of proving everything necessary to his establishing the title pleaded by him and upon which he relied, and sufficiently raised all questions of law which might present themselves upon the facts which should be proved for the purpose of establishing the title which he had pleaded. The whole onus of proving such title rested upon him; the plaintiffs had nothing to do but produce and prove their mortgage.\nIssue having been in like manner joined upon the statement of defence of the defendant Hamilton, the case came down for trial in the month of December, 1887, before Mr. Justice Weatherbe, without a jury.\nThe learned judge was of opinion that the Halifax Assessment Act of 1883 did not operate against mortgagees out of possession at the date of the act and, moreover, that if it did still the defence authorising a sale of the lands in question had not been made out\u2014that no justification of the tax sale had been established, and that so the defendant Meagher had failed to establish the title he had pleaded; and he therefore gave judgment for the plaintiffs and pronounced a decree for foreclosure and sale, with a declaration that no lien exists upon the lands for taxes, and awarding an injunction to issue to restrain the defendants as prayed for in the plaintiffs' statement of claim. In the month of December, 1887, the defendant Hamilton died, and in the month of February, 1888, the defendant Meagher died. On the 31st day of March, 1888, Robert Theakston, the successor in office of the said Hamilton, as collector of the City of Halifax was, by an order of the Supreme Court, substituted and made a party defendant in the place of the said Hamilton deceased, and by an order of the court of the same date Michael O'Brien and James Brooks, as executors and devisees under the last will and testament of the said John Meagher, deceased, were substituted and made parties defendants in the place and stead of the said Meagher deceased.\nThereupon, the defendants upon the record so constituted appealed from the judgment and decree of Mr. Justice Weatherbe to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. That court differed from Mr. Justice Weatherbe as to the effect of the Halifax Assessment Act, holding that the liability for taxes upon real estate thereby created took precedence of mortgages although made before the passing of the act, but they agreed with Mr. Justice Weatherbe in the opinion that no proof had been given of any assessment upon the lands in mortgage, or of any justification of the sale to Meagher, as set up by him, and upon which the defendants O'Brien and Brooks, as representing him, relied; the court was, however, of opinion that the plaintiffs' replication, although putting in issue the matters alleged by Meagher in support of the title upon which he relied and upon which such title as set up by him was rested, amounted to a new case set up by the plaintiffs, which, in the opinion of the court, should have been pleaded in the statement of claim, and they held, therefore, that the matters which had been decided, invalidating the sale, were not properly in issue before the court, and they, therefore, in the month of July, 1888, gave judgment setting aside the judgment and decree pronounced by Mr. Justice Weatherbe and granted a rule for a new trial to enable the plaintiffs to set out in their statement of claim the matters stated in their replication by way of negation of the facts upon which the title as set up by Meagher rested.\nIn arriving at this conclusion the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in my opinion, wholly misconceived the nature of the case, and the matters put in issue upon the record. The action, as I have already pointed out, was simply one for the foreclosure of a mortgage to which certain persons were made defendants who claimed to have an interest in the mortgaged lands, which interest, if the said defendants had any, which the plaintiffs did not admit, the plaintiffs insisted was an interest only in the equity of redemption in the mortgaged premises, and that, therefore, these defendants were proper parties to be brought before the court in a foreclosure suit to enable them to assert whatever title, if any, they had.\nNow, the defendants so made parties having pleaded their title, and the facts upon which they relied as supporting it, and having insisted that it was a title superior to that of the plaintiffs, the latter, by joining issue upon the facts upon the existence of which the title, as so set up, rested, had, in a perfectly sufficient and in the customary mode of pleading, put in issue everything which was material to the final determination of the case, and cast upon the defendants the burthen of proving the existence of every single thing necessary to exist in order to support the title as set up by the defendants, and the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia having concurred with Mr. Justice Weatherbe that the defendants had failed to adduce the necessary proof, should have confirmed his judgment and decree. In pronouncing the judgment which they did the Supreme Court proceeded upon their view of the judgment in the case of Hall v. Eve[12], but that case, in reality, instead of supporting is adverse to the above conclusion as arrived at by the Supreme Court.\nThe plaintiff there claimed specific performance of an agreement for the sale of certain lands entered into between the defendants Eve and Whiffin, with one Lane who was also made a defendant, and who has assigned his interest in the land under the agreement and in the agreement to the plaintiff; the defendants Eve and Whiffin, in their statement of defence, alleged that before the transfer of the agreement to the plaintiff the defendant Lane had committed certain breaches of his contract, which gave the defendants Eve and Whiffin a right to put an end to the agreement which they had accordingly done.\nThe plaintiff in his reply admitted some of the paragraphs in the statement of defence and denied others. He, moreover, pleaded that if, which he did not admit but denied, there had been any breach of the agreement on the part of Lane the defendants Eve and Whiffin had waived it; and as to the provision which was alleged to have been broken by Lane, that the defendants Eve and Whiffin were not entitled by reason of such breach to determine the agreement for reasons which he stated. The defendants Eve and Whiffin moved before Y. C. Bacon that the reply of the plaintiffs might be set aside as irregular and erroneous in form and pleading. That learned judge was of opinion that the new matter set up in the reply should have appeared in the statement of claim, and he accordingly made an order setting aside the reply and giving leave to the plaintiff to amend his statement of claim.\nNow, first, it is to be observed that the reply contained new matter setting up a new case which the plaintiff relied upon as entitling him to the relief prayed, whereas in the present case the special matter replied was nothing but a negation of the existence of matters the onus of proving the existence of which already rested on the defendants by the joinder in issue\u2014thus disputing simply the validity of the title in Meagher which was pleaded by the defendants, and upon which they relied as defeating the plaintiffs' claim to the relief prayed by them, and\n2nd. That the question was raised upon a motion made by the defendants before trial to strike out the reply not upon the suggestion of a Court of Appeal after the issues raised by the pleadings had been fully entered upon and tried and judgment thereon pronounced and a decree made. However, upon appeal to the Court of Appeal the learned Vice Chancellor's order was set aside, and the pleading reinstated, Lord Justice James saying that he could see no limit as to what might be said in reply, except that it must not be scandalous or irrelevant, and that in the case before him the reply was the proper place to meet the defence set up by the defendants, and Lord Justice Bramwell said that, in his opinion, a plaintiff might traverse allegations made in a defence or confess and avoid them or both.\nIn accordance, however, with the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia the plaintiffs inserted in their statement of claim the matters which had been set out in their reply.\nIn the statement of claim as so altered the defendant Theakston, with very unnecessary prolixity, repeated the defence which had been pleaded by Hamilton deceased, and the defendants, O'Brien and Brooks, with like prolixity, repeated the defence which had been pleaded by Meagher deceased, with this addition that they set up a deed executed to them by the mayor for the time being of the City of Halifax, and the defendant Theakston, as collector, during the pendency of the suit, and after two courts had pronounced the sale, in pursuance of which the deed purports to have been executed, to have been illegal and void, their object being to setup a contention that, by reason of a clause in the statute, however illegal and void the sale may have been a deed so executed had the effect of making the void sale perfectly good and free from objection.\nIf the statute in question could have such an effect the court below were well justified in characterising such legislation as extraordinary in the extreme, and without parallel in any country in which legislation is conducted upon the principles of justice as understood in legislatures deriving their authority from the British Constitution, and it is not surprising that the court refused to receive in evidence a deed so executed pendente lite, and after the sale, the validity of which was the material question in issue, had been pronounced to be invalid.\nThe case accordingly was tried again upon precisely the same issues as had been tried before, and upon precisely the same evidence, from which latter circumstance it may justly be concluded that the defects in the sale which had been pointed out could not be removed, and judgment accordingly, as before, was rendered in favor of the plaintiffs, from which this appeal is taken.\nIn view of what appears to me to be the very extraordinary construction of two of the clauses of the statute insisted upon by the learned counsel for the defendants in his argument before us, I propose now to consider the act not in the light alone of the two clauses in question but, regarding the whole scope and object of the act in connection with such matters as appeared in evidence as well as those which did not so appear, endeavor to ascertain whether a construction cannot be put upon the two clauses particularly relied upon by the defendants which will be more in accordance with what is just and rational than that insisted upon; for if a statute is open to two constructions, one of which accords with common sense and justice and the other is an outrage upon both, the former must be accepted and the latter rejected.\nBy the 4th section of the statute under consideration it is enacted that\nAll property real and personal within the city of Halifax not expressly exempted by law shall be subject to taxation as hereinafter provided by this act.\nBy the 5th section that\nThe city of Halifax shall have a permanent Board of Assessors consisting of a chief assessor and two assistant assessors.\nBy the 8th section\nThe Board of Assessors shall as soon as possible make a complete register for each ward of all real estate within the city, giving a description of each property sufficient to designate it, and the street or locality in which it is situated and the number thereof if any, and the names of the owner or owners if the same can be ascertained, and the same can be filed as a permanent record in the office of the Board of City Assessors but the same shall be amended and corrected from time to time as occasion requires.\nThere was no evidence that any such register had been provided for the purposes of an assessment of the assessable property in the city for the year 1884.\nBy the 10th section it was enacted that\nThe Board of City Assessors, as hereinafter directed, shall proceed to make an assessment upon the respective wards of the city. By the 11th Section.\nThe assessment shall be rated on the owners of real property.\nAnd it was enacted by this section that mortgagees in possession should, for the purposes of the act, be deemed to be the owners of the lands mortgaged, but that when the mortgagee of real estate is not in possession the person entitled to the equity of redemption shall be deemed the owner.\nIt was enacted by the 12th section that\nAll real estate shall be assessed at its actual value at the time of the assessment, so far as the same can be ascertained.\nThe manner referred to in the 10th section in which the assessments authorized by the act should be effected is provided for in the sections numbering from 35 to 42 both inclusive.\nIt was by the 35th section enacted that\nThe Board of City Assessors, before proceeding to the assessment of the respective wards, shall be provided by the city with a sufficient number of blanks to form valuation books, ruled in four columns, headed as in the act is provided.\nBy the 36th section,\nThe Board of Assessors shall enter the name of each person to be assessed with a description of the property on the first or left hand column\u2014the value of real estate in the next column\u2014of the personal property in the third\u2014and the sum. total on which the assessment is to be levied in the last column opposite to each name.\nBy the 37th section.\nAs soon as the whole amount of real and personal property on which any person is to be assessed within any ward is determined, the chief assessor shall serve, or cause to be served, a notice of such valuation upon the person assessed, or his agent, by delivering the same personally, or by leaving it on the property so assessed, or by mailing the notice in the form prescribed in the act, through the post office, duly registered.\nThe prescribed notice contains a copy of the form filled in as prescribed in the 35th section with the following added: I hereby give you notice that the Board of City Assessors, to the best of their judgment, have made the above valuation of your real and personal estate within Ward No. \u2014\u2014\u2014, of the City of Halifax, on which assessment for the year 18\u2014, is to be levied. If you wish to object thereto, you are hereby notified to furnish me, at my office, in the City Court House, within fourteen days from this date, with a written statement, under oath, according to the form herewith served upon you.\nTo Mr. \u2014\u2014\u2014,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nChief Assessor.\nDated at Halifax, day of 188\nThe 38th section provided a form of a statement to be made under oath by any person served with one of the above notices objecting to the valuation made on him\nBy the 39th section it is enacted that\nThe Board of City Assessors shall complete the valuation annually within one hundred and twenty days from the date of commencement, and having duly delivered the notices of valuation above directed, and the 14 days allowed for the affidavits having expired, shall then proceed without delay to make up one general book of assessment for the city, in which there shall be distinctly shown the amount of the rate upon each individual, firm, estate, or company, and the assessment book being so made up and signed by the Board of City Assessors shall be handed to the City Collector of rates and taxes.\nBy the 40th section:\nThe members of the Board of City Assessors, or any two of them shall, after they have completed the assessment, each subscribe and take an oath.\nIn the form set out in the section verifying the list containing the assessment, and declaring that\nThe real and personal estate contained in said list and assessed upon each' individual in said list, is a full and accurate assessment upon all property of each individual liable to taxation, at its full and fair cash value, according to our best knowledge and belief.\nThen the 41st and 42nd sections provided a court of appeals, whose decisions should be final, authorized to\nHear all objections of ratepayers who shall have duly appealed, to the valuations, rates or assessments which have been made upon such ratepayers and their properties, and such court shall finally determine and decide the rates and assessments to be paid, by each person who appears before the court; and the decision of the court shall be final.\nProvision is also made in other sections, not necessary to be set forth, for enabling the court of appeals to correct errors, whether of omission or commission, or purely clerical errors, made by the board of City assessors in making up the assessment or valuation book.\nNow, from the above sections it is, I think, very apparent that the object of the legislature in enacting them was to prescribe the manner in which alone a legal assessment, binding upon the owners of real property, and upon such their property, should be made, and that the intention of the legislature was, that a legal assessment of real property could only be effected by assessing the owners of realty in respect of such realty owned by them, and that no person or his real property could be held to be assessed within the meaning of the act, or chargeable with any amount by way of tax or rate in any year unless the owner's name should be inserted in the assessment or valuation book made as prescribed by the act for that year, set opposite to the property in respect of which such owner is assessed, sufficiently described so as to designate it; nor unless notice of such assessment should be served upon the person so assessed in the manner prescribed in the act.\nBy the 64th section it is enacted that\nThe lien mentioned in this act on all real and personal property shall attach and operate on the same from the date of the oath subscribed on the completion of the assessment for the city as hereinbefore provided.\nThat is in the 40th section; the lien here referred to is that mentioned in the 13th section, which enacts that\nThe rates and taxes levied on said assessment on real estate shall be a special lien on said real estate, &c. Now the words, \"said assessment on real estate,\" in this section, can only refer to the only assessment which was authorized by the act, namely, the assessment rated on the owners of real estate as provided for in the 11th section. From these sections taken together it clearly, I think, appears that there is no lien created by the act upon any real estate not legally assessed as directed in the act, and entered in the assessment or valuation book, verified as required by the 40th section. There is no lien declared except upon real estate assessed to the owner thereof; there is no other assessment recognized by the act; so that in order to establish a lien upon any particular piece of land for a certain amount as for rates and taxes in a particular year, it is essentially necessary to prove that the land upon which it is sought to attach a lien for the amount was legally assessed as directed by the act.\nThen by the 28th section it was enacted that\nNo error, informality or irregularity, on the part of the City Council, the Board of City Assessors, or other civic officers, has affected, or shall affect, or prejudice the validity of any general assessment made, or hereafter to be made and levied in such city; and no individual rate or assessment has been, or shall be, prejudiced or affected by any error or irregularity which does not affect the amount of such rate. The invalidity, illegality or irregularity of any individual rate or assessment has not extended to and shall not extend or affect the general assessment, or any other individual rate or assessment.\nThe first part of this section seems to be for the purpose of providing (whether it was necessary or not we need not enquire,) that no error, informality or irregularity on the part of the City Council, as for example their neglecting to prepare and pass the estimates for the year by the 31st December in each year, as directed in the 9th section, or any mistake or informality in the valuation blanks directed to be furnished by the 33rd section; nor any error, informality or irregularity on the part of the Board of City Assessors, as for example, in relation to the register to be made by them as directed in the 8th section; or any error, informality or irregularity as to the times when, or the manner in which, the matters directed by 39th and 56th sections to be done should be done, or as to the time and manner of making; the assessments\u2014of giving the notices required, or the like, should have the effect of invalidating the general assessment in any year. Then the second part of this section seems to have been inserted with the object of providing against any individual assessed under the act being able to defeat the assessment made upon him and his property, by reason of any error or irregularity in such assessment, not affecting the amount of the rate assessed upon him; the 42nd section seems to be supplemental to this second part of the 28th section for it prescribes how and before what court, namely, the court of appeal on assessments, all objections of persons assessed to the amount of the rate assessed upon them respectively shall be made and finally disposed of. It is only in the court of appeal on assessments that an objection as to the amount assessed can be taken; and the only person who can take such objection is the person assessed; so that it seems clear that this second part of the 28th section refers to such an objection. The section clearly does not profess to say that an assessment can not be avoided as illegal and invalid for the last clause of the section provides, rather unnecessarily it would seem, that neither the illegality, invalidity or irregularity of an individual assessment (clearly implying that an individual assessment may be illegal and invalid apart from any objection as to irregularity) shall extend to or affect the general assessment or any other individual rate or assessment. The section does not affect to restrict the rights of property vested in any person not assessed at all or who has not been legally assessed.\nUpon the valuation book being completed and verified and handed to the city collector as provided in the 39th section, it is enacted by the 57th section that the collector, before any property assessed shall be liable to be sold for the purpose of realizing thereby any rates assessed thereon, shall cause each person rated to be served with a notice made out by the Board of Assessors as directed in the 56th section in the following form.\nYou are hereby notified that you are rated and assessed for the year 18\u2014 to pay the sum of \u2014\u2014\u2014 dollars and \u2014\u2014 cents for city, county school and poor rates. Unless the amount be paid within thirty days from the 1st day of May next, proceedings will be taken to enforce payment, together with all charges and costs of collection.\nTo \u2014\u2014\u2014 A \u2014\u2014\u2014 B \u2014\u2014\u2014\nChief Assessor.\nThen by the 65th it is enacted that\nAll rates and taxes shall become due the 31st day of May in each year. It shall be the duty of the City Collector immediately thereafter to take proceedings to recover the amounts due for city, county school rates and poll tax, and to enforce the payment thereof either by the issue of warrants of distress or by action at law, or both (the action to be in the name of the city as in case of debt), the City Collector's certificate in writing shall in all cases be presumptive evidence of the rate being due and unpaid, and shall be sufficient to entitle the city to a judgment without further proofs unless a good and just defence can be made thereto.\nFrom this section it would seem to have been the intention of the act that the action directed in this section to be brought against the person assessed should be brought and should fail to realize the amount of the rates assessed upon such person before ever the real estate assessed therefor should be liable to be sold. In the present case no such action could have been brought, but that was because there was no valid assessment\u2014no person assessed could have been sued; the particular lots in question, if ever entered upon the assessment or valuation book at all, not having been assessed to any person, but erroneously entered, by what description does not clearly appear but would seem to have been simply \"property situate on the Cobourg road,\" set opposite the words \"estate of William Holland,\" the said William Holland being dead. But it is apparent from this section that no such injustice was contemplated as that to an action brought under the section the defendant should not be permitted to show, either\n1. That the certificate of the city collector was untrue, for that the defendant had, in point of fact, paid to him the amount of rates sued for and held his receipt therefor; or,\n2. That the property assessed 1o the defendant belonged, not to the defendant but to another person not assessed for it; or,\n3. That the land assessed to the defendant was, in reality, land exempt from taxation. If a defendant sued in an action brought under the above section should obtain judgment therein for any of the above reasons, it surely could not be contended upon any principle of justice, and could not be held by any court that the land for which such defendant had been so assessed could become liable to be sold under the provisions of the statute, and could be legally sold for the same rates and taxes, so as to transfer the estate absotutely to a purchaser by the city collector, either intentionally or by mistake, signing under the 94th section, and procuring to be signed by the mayor of the city, with the city seal attached, statements in duplicate of lands which the city collector declared to be liable under the provisions of the act to be sold, which statements should contain therein the lands so assessed to the defendant. Yet the contention of the learned counsel for the defendants is, that a sale in such case and a deed executed in pursuance thereof would pass absolutely to the purchaser named in the deed the fee simple estate in such land.\nWe come, therefore, to the considerations of sections 92, 93, 94 and 95 of the act to which, in the interest of the defendants, a construction is pressed upon us which is utterly subversive of every principle of justice.\nThe 92nd section enacts that\nThe City Collector of Rates and taxes shall, on or before the 31st day of December, in each year, furnish to the City Board of Assessors a list and description, sufficient to identify the same, of all the lands in the City of Halifax in respect of which any taxes have been due and unpaid since the first day of June in the year preceding with the amount of taxes payable in respect of each, which list shall be headed \"List of lands in the City of Halifax liable to be sold for arrears of taxes for the year 188\u2014.\n93. It shall be the duty of the City Board of Assessors carefully to examine said list and ascertain if the lands therein mentioned are properly described, and they shall notify the occupants of said lands, if any, and the owners thereof, if known, upon their respective assessment notice for the current year, that the land is liable to be sold for arrears of taxes, and said Board of Assessors shall, before the 31st day of May, in each year, return said list, or a corrected copy thereof in case any error is discovered therein, to the City Collector, signed by the City Assessors or any two of them, and said list shall be filed in the office of the City Collector for public use.\nThe provisions of this section do not appear to have been complied with.\nJohn Holland, who, as owner of the equity of redemption in the lots 5, 6 and 7 in the registered plan of 1870, mentioned in the mortgage to the plaintiffs, was the person liable to be assessed, was not assessed therefor. In the spring of 1886 John Holland was confined as a patient in an insane asylum; his wife did not live upon the mortgaged premises, but a family named Murphy did. A witness named Laidlaw was called, who swore that in May, 1886, he served upon John Holland's wife, at her residence, which, as already said, was not on the premises in question, and while John Holland was so, as aforesaid, confined in the insane asylum, a notice of which he kept no copy or original, so that its precise contents could not be determined. This notice, he said, however, was to the effect that certain property mentioned therein was liable to be sold for the taxes of 1884. The land was not described in the notice otherwise than, as I understand his evidence, as \"property situate on the Cobourg road,\" and he would not undertake to say that it was not entered as belonging to \"the estate of William Holland.\" There was also property on Argyle street mentioned in the notice. This notice, whatever may have been its precise contents, so served on Mrs. Holland was the only attempt made, so far as appeared, to comply with the provisions of the 93rd section. Neither Murphy, who lived upon the premises, nor the plaintiffs, who, although not \"owners\" for the purposes of assessment, were the registered owners of the legal estate in fee subject to redemption and deeply interested in knowing whether the land was liable to be sold for taxes, had any notice whatever served on them. Whatever were the contents of the notice, there was no sufficient evidence that it related to the lots 5, 6 and 7, mortgaged to the plaintiffs. It is obvious, therefore, that there was no sufficient legal evidence of the provisions of this 93rd section having been complied with.\n94th section:\nIn case the taxes upon any of the lands mentioned in the said list have not been paid to the city collector with interest from the time they were due before the 1st day of September following the delivery of the said list by the board of City Assessors to the city collector of rates and taxes the city collector shall submit to the mayor a statement in duplicate of all the lands liable under the provisions of this act to be sold for taxes which shall contain a definite description of each lot with the amount of arrears of taxes set opposite the same, and the Mayor shall authenticate each of said statements by affixing thereunto the seal of the Corporation and his signature, and one of said statements shall be deposited with the City Clerk, and the other shall be returned to the collector with a warrant thereto annexed under the hand of the mayor and the seal of the city.\n95. Any statements or lists so signed by the mayor and signed with the seal of the city, or a copy thereof, or of any portion thereof, certified under the hand of the city clerk, shall in any suit or other proceeding relating to the assessment on the real estate therein mentioned, or at which it may be questioned, be received in any court in this Province as conclusive evidence of the legality of the assessment, and that the same is due and unpaid; and that each lot of land in said statement mentioned is legally liable for the amount of taxes set opposite the same, with interest and expenses, and that said amount forms a lien on said land.\nSections to which is attributed a construction so unjust and arbitrary as that insisted upon by the defendants, the effect of which is to work a forfeiture of the title of persons seized of real estate as for default in the payment of taxes which may never have been imposed at all according to the provisions of law in that behalf, or of the imposition of which, if attempted to be imposed, they may never have had any of the notices required by law to be given, should be criticised with the utmost possible acumen, so as to prevent such a construction being given to them, and to find a construction more conformable to justice. With this view it is important to state precisely what is the construction insisted upon by the defendants and its necessary effect, namely, that if the city collector, as directed in the 94th section, should prepare a statement in duplicate of lands as liable under the provisions of law to be sold for taxes, and in such statements or lists should, through ignorance, negligence, or the merest accident and mistake insert therein\u20141st a lot of land which by the 18th section of the act was exempt from taxation but was by error assessed to some person as owner who knowing that he did not own the land did not trouble himself to take any notice of the error, or 2nd a lot of land which, in truth, belonged to A., but was assessed to B. who took no notice of assessment papers served upon him, or, 3rd, a lot of land not on the assessment books at all as assessed to any one but which the city collector by mistake inserted in his statements instead of a lot which was assessed and was on the assessment book; and if the collector should submit these erroneous statements to the mayor and if he should affix his signature and the seal of the city thereto without taking any steps to satisfy himself, by reference to the assessment book as verified by the board of city assessors, or otherwise, of the correctness of the statements submitted to him by the collector, such erroneous statements when so signed and sealed with the city seal by the mayor must nevertheless, under the provisions of the 95th section, be received and taken as containing absolute verity and as conclusive evidence that all the lots of land mentioned therein have been duly assessed under the provisions of the law to the owners thereof, and are liable to be sold for taxes duly rated thereon, and that a sale of them by the city collector under a warrant signed by the mayor, and to which the seal of the city is affixed, will be a good and valid sale of the fee simple estate therein, although the owner of the piece of land so sold may never have been assessed therefor and may have been perfectly ignorant of the sale so purported to be effected of his land; in short, that such statements of the city collector, when so signed and sealed by the mayor, must be accepted as conclusive evidence of the truth of a lie.\nNow, what is to be taken as meant in the 94th section by the mayor authenticating the statements prepared by the city collector, reasonably, I think should be that he shall, by comparison of the lists submitted to him with the authentic list prepared by the board of city assessors, and mentioned in the 93rd section, and with the original assessment or valuation book for the year (the taxes of which are alleged to be in default) verified as is provided in the 40th section, satisfy himself that the lands mentioned in the lists submitted by the city collector were duly assessed according to the provisions of the law before he should set his name and the seal of the city to documents of such serious import as to be conclusive evidence that the lands therein mentioned were all duly assessed, and were liable to be sold for arrears of taxes, and that the owners were liable to be divested of their estates therein. The intention of the legislature could scarcely, I think, have been that the mayor should, in the formal manner prescribed, simply certify that the lists to which the mayor should set the seal of the city and his own signature were the same lists which the city collector had submitted to him; and which is substantially the utmost professed to be done in the present case although, in other respects, not done in accordance with the requirements of the 94th section, as the courts below upon both trials have expressly found; what the legislature intended was, as it appears to me, that the mayor should verify the statements submitted by the collector and authenticate them as true, a thing which has not been done or attempted to be done in the present case; moreover the intention of the legislature, I think, must have been that the statements required by the 94th section should be verified by the mayor before ever a warrant for sale of the lands mentioned therein should be executed, for the warrant, which in order to effect a sale of the lands therein mentioned he is required to execute under his hand and the seal of the city, contains an averment that by a rate of assessment made in conformity with law the lots of land and premises mentioned in the statement annexed to the warrant, which is one of the duplicate statements required by the 94th section to be made, have become liable to pay the several sums set opposite thereto, &c.\nBefore signing and executing under the seal of the city a warrant containing this averment it is but reasonable to infer that he should first have satisfied himself of its truth. Nothing of the kind appears to have been done in the present case; all that appears to have been done was, that a warrant for the sale of lands mentioned in a list annexed thereto was, upon the 9th day of November, 1886, presented to the mayor for his signature; the warrant with the list attached thereto contained about 120 pages; on the first page was the warrant; the list had a heading upon a page between the warrant and the first page of the list, all being got up in book shape as follows:\u2014\nList of lands in the City of Halifax liable to be sold for arrears of taxes for the year 1884, under provisions of the Halifax City Assessment Act, 1883.\nOn the last page of the book was written a certificate prepared for signature by the mayor, to the effect that\nThe foregoing statement of all the lands liable to be sold for taxes in respect of such lands for the year commencing on the first day of May, A.D. 1884, pursuant to the provisions of the Halifax Assessment Act of 1883, and the amendments thereto, was, on the ninth day of November, 1886, submitted to me by William C. Hamilton, City Collector of the City of Halifax, and I hereby, in pursuance of section 94 of said Act, authenticate the said statement and a duplicate thereof by affixing thereunto the seal of the City of Halifax and my signature, the day and year first aforesaid.\nThe warrant and the list with this form of certificate prepared for execution by the mayor were all presented to him together for his signature on the 9th day of November, 1886. Whether the seal of the city was attached to the warrant and certificate before they were presented to the mayor for his signature, or after they had been signed by him, did not appear, but the mayor did not appear to have had anything to do with the affixing of the seal, either to the warrant or the certificate on the list attached thereto, or even to have been present when it was so affixed.\nA clerk in the collector's office where the warrant and the list and certificate would seem to have been prepared says that he was present and saw the city clerk affix the city seal to both the warrant and the list attached thereto at the same time, and the mayor appears to have set his signature to both warrant and certificate without any verification of the correctness of the list. Although the certificate on the list attached to the warrant purports to represent that a duplicate of the list was, at the same time, and in the same manner, authenticated, the court upon both trials found that in point of fact no duplicate ever was authenticated, even in the manner that the list attached to the warrant purports to have been. However, I am of opinion that even if certificates had been signed in duplicate in the manner that the one attached to the warrant appears to have been, that would not have been the authentication contemplated by the legislature as competent to make the statements conclusive evidence of the liability of persons to be divested of their estates. The signing of his name by the mayor to the certificates in such a very perfunctory manner cannot, I think, have been what the legislature had in contemplation as the authentication of documents intended to have such an incontrovertible effect as purports to be given by the 95th section to the documents, which, as appears by the 94th section, the legislature had in view. However, the main point still remains, and, to my mind, it is conclusive against the 95th section having any application in the present case. The whole scope and object of the act is solely to make persons assessed under the provisions of the act, and the lands in respect of which they, as the owners thereof, are so assessed, liable for the amounts for which such persons should be respectively assessed on the valuation book in each year, and subject to the provisions of the act as to the realization of such amounts.\nThe act subjects the lands mentioned in such book, if they be the lands of the persons assessed therefor as owners and the lands be sufficiently designated in the book, to a lien, to operate from the date of the verification of the book as provided in the 40 th section, for the amount assessed upon such owners in respect of such lands, and makes such lands of persons so assessed liable to be sold to realize such amounts if the amounts should not be otherwise paid. It is only with such persons so assessed that the act professes to deal at all, It does not either in the 95th section nor in any other section profess to prejudice or affect any person not assessed under the provisions of the act, or to divest of their estates any such person. The provisions of the law as to the mode of assessing the persons to be charged, and as to the mode of fixing them with a liability to be divested of their estates for default in payment of the amounts assessed upon them, are so very precise that the legislature having made such careful provision that the persons assessed should have abundant notice of the assessment made upon them, no doubt thought that provision having been made that the persons assessed, in order to be assessed under the provisions of the law, should receive the notice provided in the 36th and 37th sections, and after the opportunity thus given of appealing to the court of appeal under the 42nd section, and provision having been made also for their receiving the notices mentioned in the 57th and 93rd sections, if the parties so assessed should still remain in default, it was not unreasonable to provide that statements such as are required to be prepared by the 94th section should be sufficient evidence of the legality of the assessment as against the assessed person in any suit relating to the assessment on his real estate, or at which such assessment should be questioned. The assessed person was the only person competent to call in question the assessment in any suit or other proceeding. By construing the 95th section (consistently with all the other clauses of the act) as having application only to persons assessed under the provisions of the act, and to the properties in respect of which they are so assessed, we can give a construction to the section consistent with the rest of the act, and more consonant with justice and common sense than the construction insisted upon by the defendants, which is to the effect that the 95th section makes the statements prepared by the city collector, when authenticated in the manner required by the 94th section, however erroneous they may in point of fact be, conclusive evidence of the liability of a person who is an utter stranger to the assessment to be divested of his estate at the caprice of the city collector and mayor, or through their carelessness or misconduct, by a sale by them as for arrears of taxes which never had been assessed on such person. Before, then, the 95th section can be appealed to in the case of assertion of title to land made by a person claiming under a sale by civic authorities as for arrears of taxes, if it can be at all appealed to in such a case, it must appear that the person whose lands are claimed to have been sold is not a stranger to the assessment for default in payment of which the lands were sold, but on the contrary is the person who was assessed for the taxes alleged to have been in arrear, and to realize which the sale took place, or a person claiming title under the person so assessed.\nIn the Caledonian Railway Co. v. North British Railway Co.[13], Lord Blackburn, as to the construction of statutes says:\nThe matter turns upon the construction of an Act of Parliament, which is an instrument in writing. I believe there is no dispute at all that in construing an instrument in writing we are to consider what the facts were in respect of which it was framed, and the object as appearing from the instrument, and taking all these together we are to see what is the intention appearing from the language when used with reference to such facts, and with such an object.\nApplying this test to the act under consideration it is impossible to hold that anything in the act authorizes or confirms the sale of the land of any person who had not been duly assessed under the provisions of the act in respect of such land. This is a point as to which evidence can never be excluded. In the present case the evidence of the defendants shows that the land in question never had been so assessed.\nBut further it is only\nIn a suit or other proceeding relating to the assessment on the real estate mentioned in the statements prepared by the city collector under the 94th section, or at which it may be questioned\nthat the collector's statements are rendered admissible as evidence. Now the word \"assessment\" as used in the 95th section plainly, as it appears to me, is used to represent the amount of taxes rated to the person assessed; the context seems to show this\u2014the section provides that the statements shall be received as conclusive evidence of the legality of the \"assessment\" and \"that the same is due and unpaid.\" Now the amount or rate charged to the person who is assessed is the only thing which can be said to be \"due and unpaid\" and this the section declares to be the same thing as the \"assessment\" as the latter word is used in the section. This word is used in a precisely similar sense in other sections of the act. Thus in the 36th section \"the sum total on which the assessment is to be levied\" shall be inserted in the last column of the valuation forms. In the 42nd section it is used as identical with the word \"rate\" where it is provided that the court of appeal shall hear all objections of ratepayers to the valuations, rates or assessments which have been made on such ratepayers; and shall have power to reduce or increase the valuations, and to alter the rates and assessments of any ratepayer\u2014and finally determine the rates and assessments to be paid by each person\u2014so, likewise, in the 59th section where it is provided that any such assessment or taxes may be recovered as a debt in an action at suit of the city\u2014so, likewise in the 68th section \"in case an individual from whom assessment or taxes are due to the city\" &c., and, again in the 69th section, \"the assessments annually levied thereon shall\"\u2014and again \"and taxes and assessment due on such estates, if not duly paid, may be sued for as a debt in the name of the city,\" &c.\nNow when a purchaser at a tax sale brings an action to recover possession of the lands purported to be sold to him against the person who is seized of an estate in fee simple in the land unless divested thereof by the tax sale, it is necessary for him to prove his title in order to succeed; the defendant in such an action has nothing to do but rest upon his title until it is displaced by legal evidence of the title asserted by the plaintiff\u2014the defendant simply rests upon his title and questions nothing. He simply leaves the plaintiff to proof of title in himself. Such an action cannot, I think, be said to be within the meaning of the 95th section one \"relating to the assessment on the real estate therein mentioned or at which it may be questioned.\" The 95th section, therefore, in my opinion, has no application to such an action. A plaintiff's failure to prove what he has undertaken to prove, and it is necessary for him to prove in order to establish his title, namely, a valid assessment made under the provisions of law, because of there never having been any such, is a very different thing from the questioning, within the meaning of the 95th section, the assessment which has been made \"in a suit, or other proceeding, relating to the assessment on the lands therein mentioned, or at which it may be questioned.\"\nSo, likewise, if a person seized in fee bring an action of trespass against a defendant for entering upon plaintiff's land and the defendant justifies as the real owner in fee of the land in question and, at the trial, proceeds to establish his defence under a sale made to him as for arrears of taxes assessed upon the plaintiff in respect of the land, the plaintiff has nothing to do\u2014nothing to prove\u2014nothing to question. He has simply to rest upon his title, which entitles him to judgment unless the defendant prove the title which he has undertaken to prove, which he can only do by showing that the plaintiff was assessed according to the provisions of the law for the year in respect of which the taxes for which the land was sold were claimed. Such an action cannot, in my opinion, be said to be one relating to the assessment on the real estate, for trespass on which the action is brought or at which it is questioned, and the 95th section, therefore, has no application to such an action; and so for the reasons already given, as well as for that relied upon in the courts below, namely, that the requirements of the 94th section as to authenticating the collector's statements were not complied with, I am of opinion that the defendants cannot appeal to the 95th section as removing the defects apparent in the title which they have pleaded and undertaken to prove. And as the defendants have not only failed to prove that John Holland, the plaintiff's mortgagor of the lands in question, who was the only person assessable under the provisions of the law in that behalf for the year 1884, was ever so assessed for that year, but on the contrary have proved, by the list annexed to the warrant to sell under which the defendants claim, that he was not, the sale under which Meagher, and the defendants O'Brien and Brooks as his devisees, claim was absolutely illegal, null, and void; the appeal must, therefore be dismissed and the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, made at the last trial, affirmed in every particular. As John Holland, the mortgagor, was not assessed in the year 1884, in respect of the lands, no sum of money as for rates of that year could be a lien upon his lands.\nAs to the 110th section I concur with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia that it only refers to acts done subsequently to the issuing of the warrants towards effecting the sale under it, and that it has not the extraordinary effect contended for by the defendants, namely, to make good a sale absolutely null and void by reason of the non-fulfilment of conditions precedent to the coming into existence of any right to issue a warrant to sell the particular lands in question. It is only to a deed executed in pursuance of a valid sale that the section can be regarded as referring.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014Cogswell, the plaintiff, who is respondent in this appeal, brings this action for the foreclosure of a mortgage made to him and another, on the 15th of August, 1882, by one John Holland, upon three building lots in the City of Halifax, numbered 5, 6 and 7, in a plan filed in the registry office for the city, to secure the sum of $3,600. The action was brought against John Holland the mortgagor, against John Meagher who had bought the lands at a sale for taxes in December, 1886, and against William C. Hamilton the collector of taxes for Halifax. Meagher died, and his executors, O'Brien and Brooks, were made defendants in his place. Hamilton also died, and Theakstone, his successor in the office of collector, was substituted on the record for him.\nThe plaintiff had judgment in the court below, and this appeal is by O'Brien and Brooks, and by Theakston.\nThe contest relates to the validity and the effect of the sale for taxes.\nThe Assessment Act under which the sale took place was passed by the legislature of Nova Scotia on the 19th of April, 1883. It is chapter 28 of the acts of that year. Some amendments to it, made by an act (ch. 60) passed on the 11th of May, 1886, will have to be noticed.\nThe action was commenced on the 6th of April, 1887.\nThe plaintiff contends that the tax sale is not operative by reason of failure to comply with certain requirements of the statute, and he takes the further ground that, inasmuch as his charge upon the land was created before the assessment, and in fact before the passing of the act, he has a title superior to that of the purchaser; in other words, that the equity of redemption only, and not the corpus of the land, passed by the sale.\nThose points, together with others, will be noticed as we proceed with an examination of the history of what was done in connection with some of the provisions of the statute. Section 4 contains the general provision that all property, real and personal, within the city of Halifax, not expressly exempted by law, shall be subject to taxation as provided by the act.\nBy section 11 the assessment shall be rated on the owners of real and personal property by an equal dollar rate upon the value; and amongst those to be deemed owners are persons entitled to the equity of redemption of mortgaged lands when the mortgagee is not in possession. If the mortgagee is in possession he is deemed to be the owner.\nThen section 13 makes the rates and taxes levied on an assessment of real estate a special lien on the real estate having preference over any claims, lien, privileges or incumbrances of any party except the crown.\nIt is apparent from these provisions that the land itself and not any particular estate or interest in it is what is taxed, and that the plaintiff must rely upon his objections to the proceedings under the statute and not upon the priority in date of his mortgage to the assessment, or even upon the fact that the mortgage was made before the assessment act was passed.\nThat was the view acted upon by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and although it is now formally questioned the objections urged against it are not supported by any arguments that require further discussion.\nThe taxes for which the land was sold amounted to no more than $22, and with interest and costs added the amount was still under $50.\nThe property is variously estimated by witnesses at values running from under $1,000 to upwards of $2,000.\nIt is plain that the purchase price of $290 was very much below the real value, though probably not more so than in numberless cases of sales in the United States and in Ontario under similar statutes. The disproportion so frequently, and perhaps as a rule, found between the value of land sold for taxes and the price brought at the sale is apt to shock one's sense of justice, yet I cannot say that in the present case I should pity the plaintiff on that score.\nHe knew all about the sale. He had a notice given warning purchasers that he objected, not to the right to sell for the taxes, but to the power under the statute to sell more than the equity of redemption. The act gave a year after the sale to redeem the land but the plaintiff began his action within four months, preferring to litigate the equity of redemption question, which was all he seems at that time to have thought of, to paying $50 or thereabouts for taxes and charges which, as he was then advised, the city was entitled to receive from some one.\nDuring the progress of the action the plaintiff obtained leave to attack the validity of the tax sale in addition to advancing his untenable claim to a superior title by virtue of his mortgage over the statutable lien given to the city for the taxes, and the question for determination is whether his attack, which has been upheld in the court below, ought to succeed.\nGreat reliance is placed by the defendants on sections 95 and 110 of the statute, which seem to be intended to make it difficult, if not impossible, to question sales for taxes on the ground of failure to follow the statutory directions concerning assessments, &c.\nThe sections preceding section 95 prescribe, amongst other things, what the officers who have to make the assessments and collect the taxes are to do. One duty of the collector is (by section 92) to furnish on or before the 31st December in each year, to the City Board of Assessors, a list of all lands in the city in respect of which taxes have been due and unpaid since the first of June in the preceding year, with certain particulars; then the board of assessors, after examining the list and giving certain notices, are (by section 93), on or before the 31st of May, to return the list or a corrected copy, signed by them, to the collector, and the list is to be filed in the collector's office for public use. If the taxes are not paid before the first of September the collector is (by section 94) to submit to the mayor a statement in duplicate of all the lands liable under the provisions of the act to be sold for taxes. The statement is to contain a definite description of each lot, with the amount of taxes set opposite the same, \"and the mayor shall authenticate each of said statements by affixing thereunto the seal of the corporation and his signature, and one of said statements shall be deposited with the city clerk, and the other shall be returned to the collector, with a warrant thereto annexed under the hand of the mayor and the seal of the city in following form:\"\nThen comes section 95, which reads thus:\n95.\u2014Any statements or lists so signed by the mayor and sealed with the seal of the city, or a copy thereof, or of any portion thereof, certified under the hand of the city clerk, shall in any suit or other proceeding relating to the assessment on the real estate therein mentioned, or at which it may be questioned, be received in any court in this Province as [conclusive] evidence of the legality of the assessment, and that the same is due and unpaid, and that each lot of land in said statement mentioned is legally liable for the amount of taxes set opposite the same, with interest and expenses, and that said amount forms a lien on said land.\nThe word \"conclusive\" was introduced as an amendment by the act of 1886.\nThis section makes something, whatever it is, conclusive evidence of certain things which are essential to the liability of the land to be sold for taxes, but something further remains to be done before the land can be sold. Those further proceedings, together with the mode of conducting the sale, the right to redeem within a year, and the giving of a deed of the land in case it is not redeemed, are the subjects of various sections on to section 109 and including or partly including section 93. Then section 110 provides as follows:\n110.\u2014The deed shall be under the seal of the city in the form or to the same effect as in schedule A to this act, and shall particularly and fully describe the land conveyed. Said deed shall be [conclusive] evidence that all the provisions of this act with reference to the sale of the land therein described have been fully complied with, and every act and thing necessary for the legal perfecting of such sale have been duly performed, and shall have the effect of vesting said land in the grantee or purchaser, his heirs or assigns, in fee simple, free and discharged from all incumbrances whatsoever, whether registered or not; except in the case of land in which the fee is in the city of Halifax, when the deed shall give the purchaser the same rights in respect of the land as the original lessee.\nThe word \"conclusive\" in this section, as in section 95, comes from the amending act of 1886. It takes the place of \"presumptive\" which was the original expression.\nThe legislation goes a long way, in cases that come within it, towards making tax sales in Halifax unimpeachable. I shall say nothing by way of criticism of the policy indicated, which may doubtless be supported as well as attacked by forcible arguments. But far as the legislation goes, it does not go so far as the defendants ask us to carry its effect. Section 110 is plainly the complement of section 95\u2014the one saying how the liability of the land to the lien for taxes may be proved, but stopping short of the sale itself; the other taking up the thread and assuming to provide a short and easy method of proving that the sale was properly conducted, or rather of dispensing with proof of the steps by which the sale was effected.\nThe language of the first half of the section makes this plain, and affords one clear ground of distinction between its provisions and those of the Encumbered Estates Act on which the case of Rooke v. Errington[14] was decided.\nThe second part of the section which declares the effect of the deed as a conveyance in fee is explanatory of the point, already touched upon, that the purchaser acquires the land itself and not any estate in it less than a fee simple, unless the land is the property of the city.\nThere are two particulars in which the defendants might hope to be aided by section 110 if that section could properly enter into the discussion. The plaintiff objects to the absence of a notice required to be given by section 93, informing the tax payer that his land is liable to be sold, and he also contends that more land was sold than was necessary for the payment of the taxes. These are two of the steps connected with the sale which are to be taken as conclusively proved by the deed, under section 110. The other objections are touched by section 95 and not by section 110.\nBut the deed was not in existence until a year and a half after this action was in progress. It was made on the 13th of October, 1888; the earliest date at which the purchaser could have demanded the deed, or the mayor and collector have made it, was the 21st of December, 1887, a year after the sale, and that was three weeks after the first trial of the action. Under these circumstances the decision of the court below that the deed was not properly receivable in this action as evidence against the plaintiff must be held to be correct, and the validity of the sale must be tested without respect to section 110.\nThe proof offered by the defendants under section 95 consisted of one of the statements submitted, in pursuance of section 94, by the city collector to the mayor. It was authenticated by the mayor by affixing thereunto the seal of the corporation and his signature, and had annexed to it a warrant as directed by section 94, being the warrant under which the land had been sold. The section requires that the statement shall be in duplicate; that the mayor shall authenticate each of the statements by annexing thereto the seal of the corporation and his signature; and that one of the statements shall be deposited with the city clerk, and the other returned to the collector with the warrant annexed. The latter, which was the one put in evidence, followed the directions of the section both in form and substance, but it was not proved that a duplicate had been deposited with the city clerk authenticated as required. I do not understand that the existence of a regular and sufficient duplicate was disproved, I understand merely that, as stated by the learned Chief Justice in his judgment after the trial, \"no evidence was adduced on the trial that any such statement was so authenticated in duplicate by the mayor, nor was there any evidence that a copy of the list or statement annexed to the warrant to the collector was ever filed in the office of the city clerk.\"\nI am of opinion that sufficient proof was given at the trial to give full operation to section 95. It is true that the language being put in the plural form\u2014\"any statements or lists so signed\"\u2014may suggest the idea that more than one statement or list is intended to be proved, and the expression \"so signed\" may easily be understood to mean signed in duplicate; but to hold that the production of one of the duplicates is insufficient without formal proof of the other, when nothing appears to create any doubt of the due making, authentication, and deposit in the city clerk's office of the other, is, in my judgment, to apply to this section a strict rule of interpretation that could not be applied to statutes in general without occasioning embarrassment. Nor do I perceive anything in the purpose of the enactment to require us so to construe it.\nThe statement submitted to the mayor by the city collector under section 94 is made in duplicate in order that one part may be deposited as a record, or to be accessible for reference, in the office of the city clerk, and that the other may go to the collector with the warrant to authorize the sale of such lands as have not the taxes ultimately paid. The statement is one statement though made in duplicate. If it should appear that no duplicate was deposited with the city clerk, or that the one deposited was not properly authenticated, the question whether the omission vitiated every sale made under the warrant, or whether the requirement was not directory only, might require careful consideration; but nothing appearing to suggest any such omission I do not see why the due performance of their duty by the officials concerned should not be presumed. Omnia presumuntur rite esse acta donec probetur in contrarium. The city clerk was a witness at the trial. He deposed to having attached the corporate seal to the statement produced and to the warrant annexed to it, by direction of the city collector.\nAnother witness was a clerk of the city collector who had been present when the seal was affixed to the warrant and the annexed list. If there were any doubt about the duplicate in the city clerk's office a word from one of these witnesses would have cleared it away. But nothing was asked either of them about it, and counsel for the defendants, when he objected to certain things in connection with the warrant and list, is not reported to have made any allusion to the absence of specific proof of the duplicate. We may safely assume that the solicitors for the parties informed themselves on the subject of all the formalities essential to the regular sale for taxes, and that the presumption of regularity with respect to the duplicate accorded with the knowledge of all parties concerned at the trial. It would, in my opinion, be proper to find as a fact, as well from the conduct of the trial as from the presumption of omnia rite esse acta, that the duplicate was duly made, authenticated and deposited in the office of the city clerk. At the same time I do not think it essential to the operation of section 95 to do more than prove one of the statements, or in place of it a copy of the statement or of a portion, (which must mean so much as relates to the particular land or tax in controversy), certified by the city clerk. The phrase with which the section commences: \"any statements or lists so signed,\" I take to be equivalent to \"any of the statements or lists so signed,\" or \"any one of the statements, &c.\"\nWith great respect, therefore, for the opinions of the learned Chief Justice of the court below, and of the judges who concurred with him, I am compelled to hold that by the effect of section 95 it is conclusively established that the taxes in question were a lien on the land.\nThe section thus construed is, no doubt, capable of leading to some startling results, and, in supposable cases, of working injustice. This has been forcibly pointed out by my brother Gwynne. I do not enter upon a discussion of these possibilities which may or may not have been foreseen when the clause was framed in the act of 1883, and when the policy was emphatically affirmed in 1886 by the amendment which introduced the word \"conclusive.\" I take the declaration that the statements shall be conclusive evidence of the four things: the legality of the assessment; that it is due and unpaid; that each lot of land mentioned is legally liable for the amount of taxes noted against it; and that the amount forms a lien on the land; to be too precise to leave room for qualification by reference to the possibly unexpected consequences which may seem calculated to produce hardship in certain situations.\nIt is objected that the city is not a party to the action. How does that circumstance concern the present defendants? If the sale is held to be valid, the action must be dismissed, and no question of parties can arise. If held to be invalid the plaintiff will succeed against the purchaser, though his judgment may not technically bind the city. If the city's lien has not lapsed by the three years' limitation under section 112, it may perhaps remain as a charge which has a statutory precedence over the plaintiff's mortgage, but we are not required to discuss these matters at the instance of the present defendants.\nTwo objections are urged against the validity of the sale, viz.: that a notice required by section 93 was not duly given, and that more land was sold than was necessary.\nSection 93 makes it the duty of the City Board of Assessors to notify the occupants, if any, of lands which the collector includes in his report of 31st December as lands in respect of which any taxes have been due and unpaid since the first of June in the year preceding, and the owners thereof, if known, upon their respective assessment notices for the current year, that the land is liable to be sold for arrears of taxes.\nJohn Holland, the mortgagor, is proved to have acquired the land by deed from the sheriff of Halifax, dated the 29th July, 1882, and he made the mortgage to the plaintiff on the 26th of September in the same year.\nHe lived on the land and had a tenant on part of it. Section 2 of the Assessment Act provided that the assessment shall be rated on the owners of real and personal property, and that when the mortgagee of real estate is not in possession the person entitled to the equity of redemption shall be deemed the owner of such land.\nThe taxes in question are those for 1884, and the notice under section 93 was therefore to be given with the assessment notice for 1886.\nAt that time John Holland was in a lunatic asylum, but his family were on the land. He was, for the purposes of the statute, both owner and occupant.\nThe land had belonged to William Holland a brother of John. William died in 1882, before the month of July. The assessors seem to have treated the land as belonging to William's estate, and it is alleged in the pleadings of the defendants, but is not proved, that John held as trustee for the estate of William.\nThe title shown by the evidence is the title in fee taken by John under the sheriff's deed of July, 1882.\nThe land was assessed in 1884, and at least one year after that, as owned by the estate of William Holland, and in the transactions of the city officials, including the list attached to the warrant for sale, the taxes are put down as due by the estate of William Holland. John's name does not appear.\nThe evidence on the subject of the notice under section 93 is that of James Laidlaw, which is thus noted:\nJames Laidlaw, sworn:\u2014I am one of the sub-collectors of the city in the office since 1883; in the spring of 1886 I served tax notices with notice of lien that the property charged would be sold for arrears of taxes. I know John Holland, of Halifax, a brother of William Holland, deceased. I had a notice for John Holland in the spring of 1886, which I served on his wife at his residence on Argyle Street. Served this 18th May, 1886. This is the book in which I made the memorandum of service. There was a notice for the amount of taxes for 1886, and also the notice of lien that the property was liable to be sold. There were two properties mentioned in the notice. This notice of sale was for the taxes for 1884.\nCross-examined\u2014I understood John Holland was confined in the insane asylum at this time as a patient. I have no copy of the notice which, I made at the time. The land was not described in the notice except where the property was situate. It stated that the property was situate at the Cobourg Road. Also the Argyle Street property. It also stated the property was liable to be sold for arrears. John Holland's name was on it. I would not undertake to say it was not Holland estate of William. My duty principally was to collect water rates. A family named Murphy was living on a part of the Holland property, Cobourg Road, 1886.\nI see no escape from the conclusion that the notice under section 93 is essential to the right and power to sell lands for taxes.\nThe warrant issues under section 94 only for the sale of the lands mentioned in the list returned by the assessors to the collector before the last day of May, on which the taxes remain unpaid on the 1st September. It will be remembered that the duty of the Board of Assessors, under section 93, after receiving from the collector on or before the 31st December a list and description of the lands in respect of which taxes are overdue since the 1st June in the preceding year, e.g., a list in December, 1885, of the unpaid taxes due at the first of June, 1884, is to ascertain if the lands are properly described on the list and to notify the occupants, if any, and the owners, if known, upon their respective assessment notices for the current year, that the land is liable to be sold for arrears of taxes, and then before the 31st of May to return the list to the collector. Thus in September, 1886, a warrant may issue to levy the taxes due on the 1st of June, 1884, after the Board of Assessors have, in May, 1886, served the notice under section 93. At least four months' time is given for the payment of the taxes after service of the notice and before the warrant can issue. The notice is clearly a condition precedent to the right to sell, and it is particularly important to hold to the statutory prescription respecting it in a case like that before us, where the person chiefly interested receives no direct notice of the assessment of the land or its liability to be sold, but is bound by notices given to and even by acts done or omitted by his mortgagor, if the mortgagor continues in possession of the land. We must be careful, also, when adjudicating upon the extent to which a mortgagee out of possession is affected by a notice said to have been given to his mortgagor, to see exactly what is proved to have been done, adding nothing by inferences that do not necessarily arise from the facts proved.\nThe facts, then, to be gathered from Mr. Laidlaw's evidence are that in May, 1886, when serving John Holland's notice of assessment for that year, he served with it, on John Holland's wife, a notice that some property at the Cobourg Road, assessed against the estate of William Holland, was liable to be sold for taxes. The notice did not describe the property as it was described in the list by the collector and the assessors, where there was a detailed description. I am not prepared to say that the full description from the list must of necessity be inserted in the notice. A shorter description would, in most cases, convey to the owner all the necessary information. We may surmise that the fact conveyed was that the same property mentioned in the new assessment notice for 1886 was liable to be sold for arrears; but we have no right to speculate about it. One would think it not improbable that with a little fuller investigation of the assessment rolls, or in some other way, more precise information could have been furnished, but taking the evidence as we find it it cannot be said that the learned Chief Justice at the trial, or the court in banc, ought to have found as a fact that a sufficient notice to satisfy section 93 had been given.\nThe onus of establishing a valid sale was clearly upon the defendants. There is no presumption in its favor.\nThe other objection to the sale, founded on the allegation that the officer did not obey section 98 by selling only so much of the land as would have been sufficient to pay the taxes with interest and expenses, raises a question of fact which has not been pronounced upon by the court below, and which I am not disposed to find in the plaintiff's favor. He attended at the sale, either in person or by his agent, and gave a formal notice which, if paid attention to, would have deterred purchasers from bidding, even for the whole property, any substantial sum, and he gave no warning that too much land was being offered for sale.\nHis action was originally only in assertion of the claim put forward by his notice, that his mortgage was a prior charge to the city's lien for taxes. It is only by crediting him with having had faith in that claim that his plunging into litigation in place of paying the small sum demanded for the taxes and expenses can be excused.\nOn the one ground of insufficient notice under section 93 I think the appeal should be dismissed, and I do not see sufficient reason to depart from the general rule to dismiss it with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant Theakston: James A.

It is also provided that when anything is required to be done at, on or before a meeting of council, and no other date is fixed therefor, the mayor may fix the date for doing the same in the City of St. John.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the provision requiring licenses to be taken into consideration not later than the first day of April is directory only, and licenses granted in St. John are not invalid by reason of the same being granted after that date.\nHeld, per Gwynne J., that this provision does not apply to the city of St. John.\nApplications for licenses under the act must be endorsed by the certificate of one-third of the rate-payers of the district for which the license is asked. No holder of a license can be a member of the municipal council, a justice of the peace, or a teacher in the public schools.\nHeld, that the legislature could properly impose these conditions to the obtaining of a license, and the provision is not ultra vires the local legislature as being a prohibitory measure by reason of the ratepayers being able to prevent any licenses being issued; nor is it a measure in restraint of trade by affixing a stigma to the business of selling liquor.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, refusing a writ of prohibition to restrain the defendants from enforcing a conviction for selling liquor without license, contrary to the provisions of the Liquor License Act, 1887[1].\nThis appeal raises only two questions which are dealt with in the following judgments of the Supreme Court. One question is as to the constitutionality of the act; the other as to the validity of licenses issued under it in the City of St. John.\nThe act provides that applications for licenses must be accompanied by a certificate of the applicant's fitness to hold a license, and that the premises for which it is asked are suitable, signed by at least one-third of the rate-payers for the polling sub-division established for the purposes of the last previous Dominion or Provincial Election for the district for which the license is asked. It was contended by the appellants that this provision enabled the ratepayers, by acting in concert, to prevent the granting of any licenses, and that it was, therefore, in effect a measure prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors, and ultra vires of the local legislature.\nAnother provision of the act was that no holder of a license should be qualified to sit on the commission of the peace, to be a member of a municipal council or a teacher in the public schools. The contention of the appellants under this provision was that it interfered with the public rights of persons engaged in the liquor business and, by affixing a stigma to that business, was calculated to prevent persons engaging in it, which made it a measure in restraint of trade and ultra vires of the local legislature.\nThe power to grant licenses under this act is vested in the municipal councils and, for the City of St. John, in the mayor, who has all the powers of a council. Applications for license in cities and incorporated towns are to be considered at a meeting of the council, (the expression council in relation to St. John meaning the mayor) to be held not later than the first day of April in each year. Anything required to be done at, or on or before, a meeting of council, when no other date is fixed therefor, shall be done in St. John on a day to be fixed by the mayor, of which he shall give notice by advertisement in a newspaper.\nThe mayor of St. John gave notice for, and received and considered applications for, license on the 26th day of April. The appellants, who were applicants for a retail and wholesale license respectively, appeared before him on that day and protested against any licenses being issued, and they afterwards sold liquor without license, and were convicted of an offence against the act for so doing by the respondent Peters, Police Magistrate for the city. They then applied for, and obtained, a rule nisi for a prohibition to prevent the said magistrate and the Chief of Police from enforcing the conviction. On the return of the rule nisi it was argued before the full court and discharged. This appeal was then brought to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe different sections of the act on which the decision of this court and that of the court below is founded are set out in the judgments of Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Milledge (Quigley with them) for the appellants. That the power to prohibit absolutely the sale of liquor in Canada is vested in the Dominion Parliament is settled by authority. Russell v. The Queen[2]; City of Fredericton v. The Queen[3].\nIt is not necessary that prohibition should appear as a feature apparent on the face of the act. If it can be utilized as a means for effecting prohibition it is beyond the legislative authority of the province.\nThen can licenses be granted in the City of St. John later than April 1st? By the act certain privileges are granted to a certain class of traders and the procedure provided must be strictly followed. That was not done in this case. The act negatively provides that applications for license must be considered on or before the first of April. See Becke v. Smith[4]; River Wear Commissioners v. Adamson[5]; Sussex Peerage Case[6]; Maxwell on Statutes[7]; Williams v. Swansea Canal Navigation Co.[8]; Howard v. Bodington[9].\nThere is no such thing in England as an unconstitutional act of Parliament. The English decisions on construction of statutes must be looked at in the light of our different position. White v. Tyndall[10]; Leader v. Duffey[11]; Caldwell v. McLaren[12], can only be upheld on a strict and literal construction of statutes.\nThe learned counsel referred also to Hodge v. The Queen[13], and the decision of the Privy Council in re Dominion Liquor License Act, 1883.\nJack, Recorder of the City of St. John for the respondents, cited the following cases and authorities: Sharp v. Dawes[14]; Pearse v. Morrice[15]; Le Feuvre v. Miller[16]; Siddell v. Vickers[17]; The People v. Allen[18]; Maxwell on Statutes[19]; Severn v. The Queen[20]; Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[21]; R.S.N.B.[22].\nSTRONG J.\u2014Was of opinion that the appeals should be dismissed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that these two appeals should be dismissed with costs for the reasons mentioned in the very elaborate notes of the judges of the court below.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that whether the Mayor could hold the meeting for the issue of licenses after the first of April or not is immaterial in this case (Danaher's). If he could do so, as he has done, the appellant stands without a license; if he could not do so the result is the same, the appellant is without a license and could not sell liquor without infringing the provisions of the Liquor License Act. As to the constitutionality of the act there can be no doubt. This is not a statute to prohibit, it is a statute to regulate, to permit under certain conditions. If these conditions are not fulfilled it may be that the consequences are that the sale of liquor is virtually prohibited, but that consequence cannot render the act unconstitutional.\nAs to O'Regan's case, he also sold liquor without a license. Whether he sold wholesale or retail is immaterial. It is not because he sold a large quantity that he can claim to have the action against him dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The first question which arises in these cases is as to the authority and jurisdiction of the mayor of the City of St. John, in the Province of New Brunswick, under the Provincial Statute 50 Vic. ch. 4, to issue the licenses issued by him on the 26th April, 1888. In the construction of this obscure act all that we are concerned with is as to its application to the City of St. John in relation to the issue of licenses to sell liquors therein. We are bound to find, if we can, an intelligible meaning for the seeming obscurity and this, I think, a careful study of the act will enable us to do, although not, perhaps, without some difficulty.\nSec. 2, sub sec. 4, enacts in substance in so far as the City of St. John is concerned, that by the word \"council\" where it occurs in the act standing thus alone, shall be understood, unless the context otherwise requires, \"the mayor of the city\" whom the act invests with all the powers and duties which in other municipalities are imposed upon the councils of the municipalities, and then sec. 8 enacts that:\nEvery application for a license to sell liquors (in the City of St. John) either by wholesale or retail shall be by petition of the applicant to the mayor of the city.\nSec. 9. Every petition for a license shall be filed with the chief inspector of the city on or before the first day of March in each year.\nSec. 13. The chief inspector shall cause to be posted up in his office the name of each applicant for license, the description of license applied for, and the place, described with sufficient certainty, where such applicant proposes to sell, at least fourteen days before the first day of April.\nSec. 15. It shall be the right and privilege of any person residing in the ward for which the license is required to file objections in writing to the granting of any license. The objections which may be taken to the granting of a license may be one or more of the following:\n1. That the applicant is of bad fame or character or of drunken habits, or has previously forfeited a license, or that the applicant has been convicted of selling liquor without license within the period of three years; or\n2. That the premises in question are out of repair, or have not the accommodation hereby required, or reasonable accommodations if the premises be not subject to the said regulations; or\n3. That the licensing thereof is not required in the neighborhood, or that the premises are in immediate vicinity of a place of public worship, hospital, or school, or that the quiet of the place in which such premises are situate will be disturbed if the license is granted.\nSec. 17. Any petition or memorial against the granting of a license shall be lodged with the chief inspector not less than four clear days before the day on which the application shall be considered.\nSec. 18. The chief inspector shall keep a list posted in his office for three days previous to such day of all certificates and petitions lodged with him as aforesaid, and every such petition or memorial shall be open for public inspection without fee.\nSec. 20. Every application for a license, and all objections to every such application shall be investigated by the chief inspector of the city;\n1. Every such investigation shall be open to the public.\n2. The chief inspector may, at his discretion, adjourn such investigation from time to time.\nSec. 21. On every application for a license, the chief inspector shall report in writing to the mayor of the city, and such report shall contain, &c.\nSec. 22. The inspector shall with his report return to the mayor of the said city the evidence taken by him at any investigation, and such report and evidence shall be for the information of the mayor of the city who shall nevertheless exercise his own discretion in each application.\nThen sec. 23 enacts that\u2014\nWhenever by this act anything is required to be done at a meeting, or on or before a meeting of council, and no other day is fixed therefor in this act, such act or thing may be done in the City of St. John on or before a date to be named and fixed by the mayor of the said city, of which date he shall give seven days previous public notice by advertisement in one or more of the daily newspapers published in the city.\nThis section read in connection with sec. 17 shows that the day upon which the applications for licenses in the City of St. John are to be considered must be a day to be appointed and fixed by the mayor, of which seven days notice by advertisement in one or more of the daily newspapers published in the city must be given, and, therefore, that such day may be, and indeed, generally, perhaps, would be a day subsequent to the first of April in each year.\nI have stated above what appears to me to be the correct reading of sections 17 and 18 in relation to the issuing of licenses in the City of St. John, and that this is the correct reading will, I think, appear by applying to their construction this 23rd section.\nSec. 17 literally reads as follows:\nAny petition or memorial against the granting of a license shall be lodged with the Chief Inspector not less than four clear days before the day of the meeting of the Council at which the application shall be considered.\nNow, this expression\u2014\nNot less than four clear days before the meeting of Council at which the application shall be considered\u2014\nsupplies the very condition precedent required by sec. 23 to determine its application to sec. 17.\nThe lodging a petition or memorial against the granting of a license which has been applied for, is a thing required by the act to be done\u2014\nBefore a meeting of Council, and no other day is fixed therefor in the act.\nIt must, therefore, in the City of St. John, be done by force of sec. 23 not less than four clear days before a day to be named and fixed by the mayor of the city for taking applications for licenses into his consideration, of which day seven days previous public notice by advertisement in one or more of the public newspapers published in the city must be given. In so far, therefore, as the City of St. John is concerned a day to be fixed by the mayor, of which seven days public notice, as aforesaid, is given, is the day upon which applications for licenses in the City of St. John are to be considered, and such day may be subsequent to the first of April in each year, notwithstanding the ingenious arguments of the learned counsel for the appellants founded upon the words\u2014\nNot later than the first day of April in each and every year,\nin the 27th section, the sentence in which these words occur, properly understood, having no application whatever to the City of St. John.\nThat section enacts that\nAll applications for license other than in cities and incorporated towns shall be presented at the annual meeting of the council of the municipality, and shall then be taken into consideration, and in cities and incorporated towns at a meeting to be held not later than the first day of April in each and every year.\nAs to the first branch of the sentence it is expressly limited to municipalities other than cities and incorporated towns. The word \"council\" as it is used in that sentence cannot be construed as coming within the 4th sub-section of section 2 of the act; the context requires that it should not be so construed; what the sentence relates to is an annual meeting of a council of a municipality other than a city or an incorporated town. So likewise, as it is the manifest design of the act to make special provision for the City of St. John different from the provision made for all other cities and for all incorporated towns, the City of St. John cannot be comprehended under the words in the latter clause of the sentence \"and in cities and incorporated towns, &c.\" The cities and incorporated towns there referred to are these at the meeting of whose municipal councils the applications are to be presented; the word \"meeting\" as here used would be manifestly insensible as applied to the mayor of the city to whom, by sections 8 and 21 read in the light of section 2, sub-section 4, applications for licenses in the city of St. John are to be presented. Moreover, the expression \"council\" is not used in the latter branch of the sentence at all, so that for these reasons it is apparent that the sentence has no application to the City of St. John as to which special provision is made quite different from that made for all other cities and for all incorporated towns. The same observation applies to the 1st sub-section of sec. 27. The word \"council\" as there used in connection with the words \"at such meeting\" refers to the municipal council of a municipality other than a city or incorporated town and to the municipal council of cities and incorporated towns in the previous sentence referred to, that is to say to cities whose councils receive and take into their consideration applications for licenses at a meeting of council held not later than the first of April in each year\u2014in other words all cities except the City of St. John; the context requires that the word \"council\" in this sub-section is not to be read as meaning the mayor of the said City of St. John.\nThe word \"council\" in the 2nd sub-section and wherever it occurs in the other sub-sections can be applied in relation to the City of St. John to the mayor of the said city. Thus sub-section 3:\nThe mayor of the City of St. John shall hear and determine all applications, &c.\nSub-sec. 5. No objection from an inspector shall be entertained unless the nature of the objection shall be stated in his report furnished to the mayor of the city.\nSub -sec. 6. Notwithstanding anything in this act contained, the mayor of the said city may of his own motion, &c., &c.\nThus reading the 27th section all argument based on the words in it \"at a meeting to be held not later than the first day of April in each and every year\" is removed, and these words have no application as regards the issuing of licenses in the City of St. John. Whether, therefore, the language of the section is imperative or directory is unimportant in the present case.\nIt was contended that in effect the act operates as a total prohibition of the sale of liquor in the City of St. John and that it was therefore ultra vires and void. The argument in support of this contention was rested upon sections 27 and 10. In so far as section 27 is concerned I have already, I think, shewn that it has no application to the issuing of licenses in the City of St. John, and it is with this point alone that we are concerned.\nSec. 10 enacts that\u2014\nIn case of an application for a license, the petition must be accompanied by a certificate signed by one-third of the rate-payers in the polling sub-division in which the premises sought to be licensed are situate, which polling sub-division shall be that established by law for the purposes of an election for the House of Commons, or if none such be established then the polling sub-division used for the last election.\nThe argument based upon this section was that it shewed clearly the intention of the legislation to be that any number of rate-payers in a polling subdivision exceeding two-thirds should have the power of totally prohibiting the sale of liquor by refusing to sign the certificates for applicants for licenses. Then it was contended that section 31 authorises the majority of the rate-payers in a city or incorporated town to prohibit the sale of liquor by petitioning against the granting of licenses, and for those reasons it was contended that the act was, in effect, an act for the total prohibition of the sale of liquor in the City of St. John, and therefore ultra vires and void; but there is nothing in the language of the act which would justify us in pronouncing the intention of the Legislature to have been to enact a prohibition of the sale of liquors in a municipality or in any part thereof under colour of passing an act upon the subject of municipal regulations relating to the sale of liquors, which is a subject clearly within the jurisdiction of the local legislatures.\nThe objections which alone the act authorises to be urged by petition against the granting of a license to a particular person or for a particular house, enumerated in section 15, seem to be very reasonable grounds of objection as affecting the person and place sought to be licensed as regards the retail trade in liquors, and although these objections may seem to be unreasonable if applied to a person or shop for which a license to sell liquors by wholesale is sought to be obtained, we cannot for that reason hold the object of the legislature to have been to effect prohibition of the trade of dealing in the sale of liquors under colour of an act establishing municipal regulations affecting that trade. So neither can we hold that the certificate of approval of the fitness of the applicant to obtain a license, or of the place in which he proposes to carry on the trade required by the act, however stringent the provision upon that subject is, has been enacted for the purpose of effecting a prohibition of the sale of liquors in any part of a municipality. The act may be defective, also, in some particulars, as in the absence of a provision (which was much relied upon) for supplying throughout the year the places of licensed persons dying, or being deprived of their licenses. So, likewise, it may to some seem to be reasonable, to others it may seem to be unreasonable, that a licensed tavern keeper should not be eligible to serve as a trustee of schools or hold a place in the commission of the peace, or to be a member of a municipal council, &c., but defects or imperfections in the act or provisions therein which may be, or may appear to some to be, unreasonable will not justify us in pronouncing the true object of the act to have been prohibition, total or partial, of the trade of dealing in the sale of liquors, under pretence of establishing municipal regulations upon that subject.\nAs to sec. 73, and the argument founded thereon as affecting brewers and distillers, we have no concern in my opinion in the present case with any consideration of that section or its effect upon brewers and distillers. The appeals must in both cases be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I agree that these appeals must be dismissed, and I do not propose to discuss at much length the questions that have been debated before us.\nThe power of the local legislatures to provide for the issuing of licenses for the sale of spirituous liquors, either in large or small quantities, to limit the number of licenses, and to prohibit, under penalties, the sale of such liquors without license, cannot now be treated as an open question.\nThe contention for the present appellants is that the New Brunswick Liquor License Act, 1887, while professing merely to deal with the subject of licenses, contains provisions which, either from their inherent tendency or from the way in which they may be acted on, give the measure the effect of a prohibitory law, either as to the whole province and for all time, or as to particular localities and particular calendar years.\nThe larger question of the power of the province to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors within its own borders is not presented for discussion, and we have to deal only with questions which concede that total prohibition can be decreed only by the Dominion Parliament.\nThree points have been made before us, but two of them may be dismissed with a few observations. They were, if I am not mistaken, raised for the first time in this court.\nOne relates to the requirement of a certificate signed by one-third of the rate-payers of the locality as a qualification for obtaining a license, and the other to the disqualification, under sec. 76, of licensed persons for holding commissions of the peace or municipal offices. These provisions, it is urged, interfere with the freedom of individuals in the matter of engaging in the liquor trade by making their right to a license depend on the action of their neighbors, and by attaching a stigma to the business. The stigma may or may not be implied. There may be other motives for desiring that under a system of popular government the liquor seller shall control public affairs to as small an extent as possible, without any more imputation against him or his calling than is implied by the exclusion of judges from the electoral franchise.\nBut the objections are too fanciful and far-fetched to be seriously discussed without denying to the local legislature the right to prescribe the conditions on which licenses can be obtained. They assume a right in every man to demand a license, ignoring the right of the legislature to limit the number.\nThe main point, and that with which the judgments delivered in the court below are almost altogether occupied, is the effect of section 27, which declares that\u2014\nAll applications for license other than in cities and incorporated towns shall be presented at the annual meeting of the council of the municipality and shall then be taken into consideration, and in cities and incorporated towns at a meeting to be held not later than the first day of April in each and every year.\nWith this section are to be read section 2, sub-section 4, where it is enacted that in the City of St. John the expression \"Council\" shall mean the mayor of the city who shall have and exercise all the powers and duties imposed by the act upon the council, and also section 23 which declares that\u2014\nWhenever by this act anything is required to be done at a meeting, or on or before a meeting of Council, and no other day is fixed therefor in this act, such act or thing may be done in the City of Saint John on or before a date to be named and fixed by the mayor of the said city, of which date he shall give seven days previous public notice by advertisement in one or more of the daily newspapers published in the said city.\nThe mayor of St. John sat for the purpose of receiving and disposing of applications for licenses on the 26th of April, 1888, and not on the first day of that month. He had given seven days previous public notice of his intention to attend on the 26th by advertisement in a daily newspaper published in the city, and applicants for licenses, the appellants being among them, also attended. Licenses were granted to others, but not to the appellants who protested against the right of the mayor to act in the matter after the first of April.\nThe appellants afterwards sold spirituous liquors without license in violation of the 71st section of the act, and were fined therefor by the respondent Peters.\nThe point made is that there was no power to issue licenses except at a meeting held not later than the first of April; that therefore no licenses for St. John could be legally issued for the year that began on the first of May, 1888; and therefore it was lawful to sell without license, or rather that the act which prohibited selling without license during a period when under the terms of the act no valid license could be obtained, or which left it open to an officer, by neglecting to do an act at the proper time, to suspend for a year the power of vendors of liquors to obtain a license, was a prohibitory act, and therefore beyond the legislative jurisdiction of the province.\nOn the other side it is denied that the conclusion follows from the premises, and the premises are also disputed.\nThe judgments delivered in the court below deal chiefly with the question of the validity of what was done by the mayor, notwithstanding that it was done later than the first of April; and the court held, with one dissentient opinion, that the licenses were valid which were issued on the 26th. If that decision is correct it will not be necessary now, as it was not found necessary in the court below, to consider whether or not the conclusion against the statute would follow from the different premises on which the appellant bases his syllogism.\nI agree with the views expressed by the majority of the court. The judgments of the learned Chief Justice and of Justices King, Wetmore and Fraser deal with the matter so fully, and to my mind so satisfactorily, both on reason and on the authorities, that to attempt to discuss the matter would be but to repeat what they have said.\nI am satisfied that the reference to the time in section 27 cannot be properly treated as otherwise than directory, so that even if the provisions of that section apply to the mayor of St. John in the same way as to a municipal council the adjudication on the applications for license on the 26th of April was good and valid.\nI am a good deal struck by the view, to which I understand Mr. Justice Wetmore to have been inclined, that there was no irregularity, but that the proceeding on the 26th was within the letter of the statute. It may be suggested that as the existing licenses expired on the 30th of April an earlier day than the 26th ought to have been adopted. That is a speculation on which I cannot enter.\nThe mayor of St. John may be credited with knowing better than I can be expected to know what the general convenience required. The question is: What does the statute say?\nIt says that licenses shall be issued by municipal councils or city or town councils, except in St. John where the mayor is to do what the council does elsewhere. Section 27 is framed with special reference to meetings of council. The phraseology of the section does not enable us to read the word \"mayor\" in place of the word \"council\" as directed by section two, because the word \"council\" does not happen to be expressed along with the word \"meeting\" in relation to cities and towns. The meeting means, of course, a meeting of council, but the absence of the word renders gratuitous some ingenious discussion which we heard concerning the practicability of the mayor holding a meeting by himself.\nThe draftsman of the statute very likely supposed that he had named the first of April as the latest day for the mayor as well as for meetings of city and town councils to deal with applications for licenses. Section 13, which directs the posting up of notices with the names of applicants fourteen days before the meeting of council and, in the City of St. John, fourteen days before the first of April, shows that that date was thought of in connection with the functions that were to be discharged by the mayor, but it was evidently thought of as the earliest day on which he was to act.\nIt may be that section 23, which Mr. Justice Wetmore refers to as possibly leaving the time for the mayor's action very much to his own discretion, is not precise enough to be relied on for that purpose, but that reading of it would scarcely be a strained one.\nThe fact is that these several sections will not bear the close scrutiny which the appellants ask us to apply to them; and the close and critical reading which they urge would not lead to the conclusion on which they insist. The matter is not of much consequence, and is noticeable chiefly as a feather in the directory scale as against the application of section 27 according to its literal interpretation.\nIn my opinion we should dismiss the appeals with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: R.

J. Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nRailway Company\u2014Expropriation of land,\u2014Description in map or plan filed\u201442 Vic. ch. 9.\nA company built its line to the termini mentioned in the charter and then wished to extend it less than a mile in the same direction. The time limited for the completion of the road had not expired but the company had terminated the representation on the board of directors which, by statute, was to continue during construction and had claimed and obtained from the City of K. exemption from taxation on the ground of completion of the road. To effect the desired extension it was sought to expropriate lands which were not marked or referred to on the map or plan filed under the statute.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the statutory provisions that land required for a railway shall be indicated on a map or plan filed in the Department of Railways before it can be expropriated applies as well to a deviation from the original line as to the line itself, and the company, having failed to show any statutory authority therefor, could not take the said land against the owner's consent.\nHeld, also, that the proposed extension was not a deviation within the meaning of the statute 42 Vic. ch. 9 sec. 8, sub-sec. 11 (D).\nPer Ritchie C.J., Strong, Fournier and Taschereau JJ., that the road authorized was completed as shown by the acts of the company, and upon such completion the compulsory power to expropriate ceased.\nPer Gwynne J., that the time limited by the charter for the completion of the road not having expired the company could still file a map or plan showing the lands in question, and acquire the land under sec. 7, sub-sec. 19, of the act 42 Vic. ch. 9. Appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming a judgment in the Chancery Division for the plaintiffs[1] by which the defendant company were restrained from expropriating plaintiffs' land.\nThere were two actions in in this case which were tried and argued together in the court below and in this court. In the one action it was alleged that the defendants were taking proceedings before a County Court Judge to be put in possession of plaintiffs' land; in the other, that the defendants had been making application to different judges in Toronto for the same purpose.\nThe defendants had completed and were running their road when they obtained additional powers from Parliament as to the land they could hold in Kingston; they then obtained a lease of Government land from the Province of Ontario and wishing to build a new station and freight house proceeded to expropriate plaintiffs' land adjoining the land so leased. Plaintiffs' land was not in the maps and plans filed in the Railway Department under the Consolidated Railway Act.\nThe plaintiffs claim that under these circumstances the defendants could not expropriate such land without their consent. The Court of Appeal upheld this contention, affirming the Chancellor's judgment to that effect and maintaining the injunction to restrain the defendants from proceeding with the expropriation. From the decision of the Court of Appeal the defendants have appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nRobinson Q.C. and Cattanach for the appellants.\nS. H. Blake Q.C. and Britton Q.C. for the respondents.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014It appears very clear that the road was constructed and completed before the company sought to expropriate the land in question. This having been established by two courts, and such a conclusion justified by the evidence, this court ought not to disturb the finding. Indeed it is hard to conceive how the company, having claimed and obtained from the City of Kingston a certain stipulated exemption from taxation from the 1st of January, 1885, on the ground of the completion of the road, and having in consequence terminated the representation on the board of directors which, by 34 Vic. ch. 49, was to continue during the construction of the road, can now with a view to the expropriation in this case set up its non-completion. The company's map or plan shows the terminus of the property in Kingston and the evidence shows that the road was constructed from that terminus and operated for several years, but the plan did not show the land now sought to be expropriated, and the company have failed to show any statutory authority for taking land not shown on the map or plan.\nI am also of opinion that having completed the road as authorized by the charter the ordinary compulsory powers of the company ceased, and their remedy, if any, must be left to the special powers to be exercised under the sanction of the Minister of Public Works on a proper case being made out.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014For a statement of the facts which have given rise to the action now under appeal I refer to the reports of this and another case relating to the same question and between the same parties to be found in the 11th volume of the Ontario Reports[2].\nThe present appeal appears to me to be quite unfounded and at the conclusion of the argument I had formed the opinion that it ought to be dismissed; a careful examination of the pleadings and evidence, the several judgments pronounced in the courts below and the well considered arguments of counsel on the hearing of the appeal in this court, have tended rather to confirm than to shake this original opinion.\nI so fully adopt the reasons given by the learned judges in the Court of Appeal that to state at length the considerations which have led me to the conclusions I have arrived at would only be to reiterate what has already been well said in judgments in which I entirely agree. It is, therefore, sufficient to say that for the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario and Mr. Justice Osier I am of opinion that the power to expropriate lands as here claimed only existed during the construction and ceased upon the completion of the railway, and that the fact of the completion is conclusively shown by the appellants' own acts in claiming the payment of money granted to them by way of bonus and which was only payable upon the completion of the undertaking.\nI also agree that this proposed extension of the railway was not a deviation at all, or at least not such a deviation as was contemplated by the statute.\nAnd further, that the statutory preliminaries which authorized lands to be taken on a deviation to be shown on the plan had not been complied with.\nLastly, in addition to the foregoing reasons, which are all set forth in the judgments in the court below, I would add that it appears to me that however convenient and advantageous to the railway company the acquisition of this land of the respondent might be, it is not \"necessary\" in the sense in which land required for a work like this must under the provisions of the Railway Act be requisite before a railway company is empowered to exercise the right of expropriation as regards it.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J. concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. The company's road was completed before they attempted to expropriate the plaintiff's land, and what they propose is not a deviation within the meaning of the statute. It is conceded that the plaintiff's land is not laid out, marked out, or referred to in the plan and books of reference filed by the company in conformity with the requirements of the statute.\nThe appellants contend that even if the respondents were entitled to an injunction in this case the order goes too far in restraining them from taking any steps or doing anything for the purpose of expropriating said land\u2014notwithstanding that the appellants can expropriate the land by proceeding under sections 10 to 14, 42 Vic. ch. 9, and the judgment and order appealed from should be amended accordingly to permit such steps being taken.\nIf necessary this amendment may be ordered. The respondents, however, do not contend that the order goes further than to stop proceedings under secs. 8\u20139, 42 Vic. ch. 9.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I concur in the view which was pressed upon us by the learned counsel for the respondents\u2014that the 11th sub-section of section 8 of the Railway Act, 42 Vic. ch. 9, is not an enabling clause, but is a clause enacted for the purpose of imposing restrictions upon the powers of the railway company to make a deviation from the line of railway as originally shown on the map or plan of survey required to be made and deposited in the office of the clerk of the peace of the several counties through which the railway is to pass, and that, therefore, authority to make any deviation from such line must be sought for in some other section of the act; and this authority is found under the head of \"powers\" in section 7, sub-sections 5 and 19, the former of which enacts that, \"the company\" (authorised by the special act to construct the railway)\nshall have power and authority to make the railway across or upon the lands of any corporation or person on the line of the railway, or within the distance from such line stated in the special act, although, through error or other cause, the name of such party has not been entered in the book of reference hereinafter mentioned, or although some other party has been erroneously mentioned as the owner of or entitled to convey or is interested in such lands.\nAnd sub-section 19 enacts that\nany railway company desiring at any time to change the location of its line of railway in any particular part, for the purpose of lessening a curve, reducing a gradient, or otherwise benefiting such line of railway, or for any other purpose of public advantage, may make such change: and all and every the clauses of this act shall refer as fully to the part of such line of railway so at any time changed or proposed to be changed as to the original line; but no railway company shall have any right to extend its line of railway beyond the termini mentioned in the special act.\nNow this latter subsection in express terms prescribes that a railway company in making a deviation from the original location of its line under this section must not only do so within the termini mentioned in the special act, but that all the clauses in 42 Vic. ch. 9 as to plans and surveys prescribed in relation to the original line must be complied with in relation to any such deviation. Now for the purpose of determining the precise location of the railway and works by the special act, section 5, sub-section 16, authorised to be constructed, provision is made, under the head \"Plans and Surveys,\" by section 8, which enacts as follows:\u2014 Subsec. 1. Surveys and levels shall be taken and made of the lands through which the railway is to pass, together with a map or plan thereof and of its course and direction and of the lands intended to be passed over and taken therefor, so far as then ascertained, and also a book of reference for the railway in which shall be set forth:\n(a) A general description of such lands;\nthat is of the lands intended to be passed over and taken;\n(b) The names of the owners and occupiers thereof\nthat is of the lands intended to be taken\nso far as they\nthat is such owners and occupiers\ncan be ascertained;\n(c) Everything necessary for the right understanding of such map or plan.\nSub-section 2. The map or plan and book of reference shall be examined and certified by the Minister of Public Works or his Deputy, and a duplicate thereof so examined and certified shall be deposited in the office of the Department of Public Works, and the company shall be bound to furnish copies of such map or plan and book of reference or of such parts thereof as relate to each district or county through which the railway is to pass, to be deposited in the offices of the Clerks of the Peace for such districts or counties respectively.\nSub-section 3. Any person may resort to such copies and make extracts therefrom or copies thereof, as occasion requires, paying to the Clerks of the Peace at the rate of ten cents for every hundred words.\nSub-section 4. Such map or plan and book of reference so certified or a true copy thereof certified by the Minister of Public Works or by the Clerks of the Peace, shall be good evidence in any court of law and elsewhere.\nSub-section 5. Any omission, mis-statement or erroneous description of such lands or of the owners or occupiers thereof in any map or plan or book of reference may, after giving ten days notice to the owners of such lands, be corrected by two justices on application made to them for that purpose, and if it appears to them that such omission, mis-statement or erroneous description arose from mistake the justices shall certify the same accordingly.\nSub-section 6. The certificate shall state the particulars of any such omission and the manner thereof, and shall be deposited with the clerks of the peace of the districts or counties respectively in which such lands are situate, and be kept by them along with the other documents to which they relate; and thereupon such map or plan or book of reference shall be deemed to be corrected according to such certificate, and the company may make the railway according to the certificate.\nNow from these provisions it appears to me to be very obvious that the line of the railway which is authorised by the special act to be constructed must be correctly shown on such map or plan, and that no lands can be taken for the railway unless they are shown as intended to be taken upon the map or plan as originally registered or as corrected under the provisions contained in the above sub-sections 5 and 6 or upon a map or plan prepared and registered under sub-section 19, and the company are, by the sub-section 6, only authorised to make the railway in accordance with the original or corrected map or plan and book of reference; and as no map or plan can be registered until the location of the line as shown thereon has been adopted, it is also obvious that any deviation from the line which may be authorised by the special act, equally as one made under sub-section 19, can only be made after the original map or plan showing the line of railway at the place where the deviation is intended to take place is registered; and such deviation must be by way of substitution for some part of the line as originally located and not by way of addition to such line, although such proposed addition should be within the extreme points designated as the termini of the railway as authorized by the special act.\nThe policy of the act is that all lands intended to be taken shall be shown on a map or plan made and registered as required by the statute, and this policy is as applicable to the case of lands proposed to be taken by way of deviation from the line as originally located as to lands proposed to have been taken for the original line itself; accordingly, and, as it appears to me, for the express purpose of providing for the case of a deviation, if authorised by the special act, being proposed to be substituted for any part of the line as originally located and shown upon a registered plan, the 7th sub-section of section 8 was enacted, which provides that:\u2014\nIf any alterations from the original plan or survey are intended to be made in the line or course of the railway, a plan and section of such alterations as have been approved of by Parliament, on the same scale and containing the same particulars as the original plan and survey, shall be deposited in the same manner as the original plan, and copies of or extracts from such plan or section so far as they relate to the several districts or counties in or through which such alterations have been authorised to be made, shall be deposited with the Clerks of the Peace of such districts or counties.\nAnd sub-section 8 provides that:\nUntil such original map or plan and book of reference or the plans and sections of the alterations have been so deposited, the execution of the railway, or of the part thereof affected by the alterations as the case may be, shall not be proceeded with.\nThe provision in this sub-section that a plan or section of such alterations as have been approved by Parliament shall be deposited with the Clerk of the Peace of the several counties through which such alterations have been authorised to be made can, in my judgment, have reference only to the provision in section 7, sub-section 5, empowering the company to make their railway across or upon the lands of any person on the line of railway or within the distance from such line stated in the special act and, therefore, relate to such deviations, if any, which may have been authorised by the special act, while sub-section 19 makes like provision as to plans and surveys for any deviation from the original line by that sub-section authorised; thus establishing beyond all doubt, as it appears to me, that no land can be taken for a line of railway as originally located, or for any deviation therefrom at any point therein, until the provisions as to plans and surveys prescribed as to the original line are complied with as to every such deviation.\nNow, deviations being authorised only under these sub-sections of section 7 in which are comprised the \"powers\" of the company by the special act authorised to construct the railway, sub-sections 11 and. 12 of section 8 are introduced by way of restriction and qualification of the powers of deviation so as aforesaid conferred; they are as follows:\u2014\nSub-section 11. No deviation of more than one mile from the line of the railway or from the places assigned thereto in the said map or plan and book of reference or plans and sections shall be made into, through, across, under or over any part of the lands not shown in such map or plan and book of reference or plans, or within one mile of the said line and place, save in such instances as are provided for in the special act.\nSub-section 12. The railway may be carried across or upon the lands of any person on the line or within the distance from such line as aforesaid, although the name of such person has not been entered in the book of reference through error or any other cause, or though some other person is erroneously mentioned as the owner of, or entitled to convey, or is interested in such lands.\nThe provisions of the above sub-sections are taken from the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, 22 Vic. ch. 66, section 10, sub-sections 11 and 12 which omitted from the 11th sub-section the word \"nor\" as it appeared in the original statute, 14-15 Vic. ch. 51, section 10, sub-section 7, which ran thus: \u2014\nNo deviation of more than one mile from the line of the railway or from the places assigned thereto in the said map or plan and book of reference of plans and sections shall be made \"nor\" into, through, &c.\nmaking a contrast between the lands outside of, and those inside of, one mile from the line of railway as originally located, namely, that no deviation should be made outside of a mile from the line of railway as originally located, (although authorised by the special act) and that within a mile they should only be made as authorised by the special act\u2014as for example, if by the special act they should only be authorised to be made within a quarter of a mile from the line as originally located or, in one place within a quarter of a mile and, at another or other places, at different distances within the one mile, then they should be made only within\" the respective distances, at such points, prescribed by the special act. The consolidators of the Statutes of Canada carelessly and unintentionally, as I have no doubt, omitted the word \"nor\" from the consolidated statute, 22 Vic. ch. 66, section 10, sub-section 11, from which sub-section 11, of section 8, of 42 Vic. ch. 9, as well as the corresponding section of the Railway Act of 1868, have been taken. If the whole of the two sub-sections after the words \"shall be made\" had been omitted it would have been much better, for then the redundancy, tautology, and confusion which the residue creates would have been avoided. The 12th sub-section is but an unnecessary repetition of the provision contained in section subsection 5, and the insertion of the words\ninto, through, across, under or over any part of the lands not shown on such map or plan and book of reference, or plans or sections,\nwhether with or without the word \"nor\" prefixed, is equally redundant and unnecessary, for, as already shown, no line, whether original or by way of deviation from (or alteration of) a line as originally located, can be made across any lands not shown on a map or plan and book of reference, registered as required by the act; and the last words of sub-section 11\nor within a mile of such line or place save in such instances as provided for in the special act\nif construed literally are calculated to create a doubt whether they might not have the effect of neutralising sub-section 19 of section 7.\nThe only intelligent construction, as it appears to me, which can be put upon these sub-sections, 11 and 12, of section 8, is obtained by reading them in immediate connection with the provision as to deviation contained in section 7, sub-section 5, omitting what is redundant and unnecessarily repeated, thus: \u2014\nThe company shall have power and authority to make carry or place the railway across or upon the lands of any corporation on the line of the railway or within the distance from such line stated in the special act although, through error or other cause, the name of such party has not been entered in the book of reference hereinafter mentioned as the owner, or entitled to convey or as interested in such lands, provided that no deviation of more than one mile from the line of railway or from the places assigned thereto on the map or plan and books of reference by this act required to be registered shall be made; or within one mile of the said line save as provided for in the special act? when deviation is provided for in such act,\nleaving sub-section 19 to have the operation which, as it appears to me, it was originally designed to have, namely, to make provision for deviation in cases where none should be provided for in the special act, qualified only by the restriction that no deviation could be made under sub-section 19 outside of one mile from the line of railway as originally located; and for extension of the line as originally located provided that such extension be made within the termini mentioned in the special act. Sub-section 12 of section 9, which prescribes a form of notice to be served upon an owner when his land is required to be taken for the railway, also supports the view already expressed as being established by the other sections already alluded to, namely, that no land can be taken from any person by process of expropriation unless it be shown as intended to be taken on a map or plan and book of reference registered under the act. Section 9, sub-section 11, provides, first that the deposit of a map or plan and book of reference as required by the act and a notice of such deposit published in the manner directed by sub-section 10 shall be deemed a general notice to all parties of the lands which will be required for the railway and works; then by sub-section 12 it is provided that a notice shall be served upon the party whose land is proposed to be taken which shall contain: (a) A description of the lands to be taken; (b) a declaration of readiness to pay a certain sum as compensation for such lands; (c) the name of a person to be appointed as arbitrator of the company if their offer should not be accepted; and such notice shall be accompanied by the certificate of a sworn disinterested provincial surveyor that the land shown on the said map or plan (that is the map or plan deposited as requried by the statute and referred to in sub-section 11) is required for the railway or is within the limits of deviation hereby allowed.\nThese latter words \"or is within &c.,\" appear to be quite redundant for no lands, whether lands upon which the line has been originally located, or lands intended to be substituted for any part of such line within the limits of deviation allowed by the act, can be taken unless required for the railway, which word \"Railway\" as is declared by the interpretation clause, section 5, sub-section 16:\n\"Shall mean the railway and works by the special act authorised to be constructed.\nAll, therefore, that is or can be substantially necessary to be established in any case to entitle the company to acquire land sought to be expropriated, whether such lands be lands shown as intended to be taken on the map or plan registered of the line as originally located or land shown on a map or plan registered for the purpose of designating a deviation from such line, and the lands intended to be taken for such deviation, is that the land of the person for the time being dealt with, and on whom notice is served, is shown on a registered map or plan under which the company are proceeding to construct the railway, and that the lands shown on such registered map or plan are required for the railway and works which the company are authorised to construct. I am of opinion, therefore, that in the absence of such a map or plan registered and showing the lands sought to be expropriated in the present case it was not competent for the company to acquire the land by process of expropriation by arbitration; but I am also of opinion that inasmuch as the time given by their act for completion of their railway had not and has not yet expired it was competent for them, upon registering a map or plan under the act, to have expropriated the land under the 19th sub-section of section 7, the proposed extension (which the contemplated alteration is, and not a deviation) being within the termini mentioned in the special act; and that what has taken place in relation to the acquiring lands for station grounds at Barracks street, or the fact that the road had been some years in operation from that station, offers no impediment to the company acquiring better and more convenient and suitable station grounds which, in fact, they have acquired between Brock and Clarence streets in the city of Kingston, or to their acquiring the piece of land sought to be acquired by expropriation process under sub-section 19 of section 7 if the piece of land be necessary for, or be conducive to, the more beneficial and perfect enjoyment of such their new station, and as the decree as framed perpetually restrains the company from taking possession of the land in question\nand from taking any steps and from doing anything whatsoever for the purpose of expropriating the said lands, or any part thereof,\nand so in effect restrains them from acting under the above sub-section 19, this appeal should be dismissed but the decree should be varied so as to declare simply that under the circumstances appearing, namely, that the company have never registered, as required by the act, a map or plan showing their intention to construct any part of their railway across the land in question, they are not entitled to proceed to acquire the same by process of expropriation by arbitration and restraining them merely from taking any further proceeding under the notice already served.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Kirkpatrick & Rogers.\nSolicitors for respondents: Britton & Whiting.\n[1] 11 O.

Mead (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1889: April 8, 9; 1889: December 14.\nPresent: Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nPartnership\u2014Terms of\u2014Breach of conditions\u2014Expulsion of one partner\u2014Notice\u2014Waiver\u2014Goodwill.\nPartnership articles for a firm of three persons provided that if any partner should violate certain conditions of the terms of partnership the others could compel him to retire by giving three months\u2019 notice of their intention so to do, and a partner so retiring should forfeit his claim to a share of the goodwill of the business. One of the partners having broken such conditions of partnership the others verbally notified him that he must leave the firm and to avoid publicity he consented to an immediate dissolution which was advertised as \u201ca dissolution by mutual consent.\u201d After the dissolution the retiring partner made an assignment of his goodwill and interest in the business and the assignee brought an action against the remaining partners for the value of the same.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, Fournier J. dissenting, that the action of the defendants in advertising that the dissolution was \u201cby mutual consent\u201d did not preclude them from showing that it took place in consequence of the misconduct of the retiring partner; that the forfeiture of the goodwill was caused by the improper conduct which led to the expulsion of the partner in fault and not by the mode in which such expulsion was effected; and, therefore, the want of notice required by the articles of intention to expel could not he relied on as taking the retirement out of that provision of the articles by which the goodwill was forfeited.\nHeld also, that if it was a dissolution by one partner voluntarily retiring no claim could be made by the retiring partner in respect to goodwill, as the account to be taken under the partnership articles in such cases does not provide therefor. Semble, that the goodwill consisted wholly of the trade name of the firm.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] in favor of the plaintiffs.\nThe facts are stated quite fully in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne as well as in the reports of the Ontario Courts. They may be briefly summed up as follows:\nThe defendant and the plaintiff Mead were partners in the brewing business, and among the articles of partnership were the following:\n\u201cThird\u2014That if any of the said partners shall be guilty of any breach or non-observance of any of the stipulations contained in the fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth articles hereinafter mentioned, the other or others of the said partners shall be at liberty, if he or they shall think fit, within three calendar months after the same shall have become known to him or them, to dissolve the said partnership by giving to the partner who shall so offend, or leaving in the counting house of the place where the business shall then be carried on, notice in writing declaring the said partnership to be dissolved and determined; and the said partnership shall from the time of giving or leaving such notice, or from any other time to be therein appointed for the purpose, absolutely cease and determine accordingly, without prejudice nevertheless to the remedies of the respective partners for the breach or non\u2011observance of all or any of the covenants or agreements contained in these presents at any time or times before the determination of the said partnership. And the partner to whom the said notice shall be given shall be considered as quitting the business for the benefit of the other partners who shall give the said notice.\u201d\n\u201cTwenty-nine.\u2014In the event of either of them, the said Widmer Hawke or Joseph Hooper Mead, retiring from the said firm hereby formed under article number two, or being compelled to leave the same firm under article number three, the partner so retiring or being compelled to leave the said firm shall not be entitled to receive, and shall not receive from the other of them, or from any new firm which may be formed to carry on the said business, any sum of money whatever for or in respect of his goodwill in the said business.\u201d\nThe plaintiff, Mead, having violated articles 14 and 17, was verbally notified by his partners that he must quit the firm, and to avoid publicity he consented to an immediate dissolution. Notice was given by advertisement that the firm was dissolved by mutual consent and the business was afterwards carried on by the defendants. At the same time Mead assigned to his mother all his right and title in the real and personal estate, stock-in-trade, plant, rights and credits of the firm, and the assignee brought an action against the defendants in which she claimed, among other things, Mead\u2019s share of the goodwill. This claim was dismissed at the hearing before the Chancellor, after which Mead executed another instrument in favor of his mother confirming the previous assignment and expressly conveying all his right and title to the goodwill and interest in the business, and another action was instituted against the defendants in which was claimed an account to be taken of Mead\u2019s shark in the goodwill and payment of the same to the plaintiff.\nThe action was tried before Cameron C.J., who held that Mead was expelled from the firm under article 3, and he dismissed the action with costs. The Division- al Court reversed this judgment and ordered judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for the value of the goodwill and costs. On appeal to the Court of Appeal the judges of that court were equally divided and the judgment for the plaintiff was affirmed. The defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nPending the present action the original plaintiff died and the action was revived in the name of the plaintiff Curran, devisee of her estate.\nChristopher Robinson Q.C. and Moss Q.C. for the appellants. The partnership was in a position to be dissolved by the misconduct of Mead, and the three month\u2019s notice was only a mode of effecting the dissolution and could be waived. Hall v. Hall[3].\nThe partnership agreement amounts to a renunciation of the right to the goodwill in the events which actually happened. Pearson v. Pearson[4]. And see Lindley on Partnership[5]; Tudor\u2019s Leading Cases on Mercantile Law[6].\nMead was expelled under article three of the partnership agreement, and thereby forfeited his claim to goodwill. See Atwood v. Maude[7]; Mellerish v. Keen[8].\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Morrell for the respondents.

Garfit[18]; Mason v. Andes Insurance Co.[19]\nSTRONG J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would allow this appeal and dismiss the action for the reasons given by Cameron C.J. at the trial and in the Divisional Court.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014That the plaintiff Mead was guilty of such breach of certain of the stipulations of the partnership articles that his co-partners, the defendants, were justified in determining the partnership under the provisions of the 3rd article cannot, in my opinion, admit of a doubt. His overdrawing the partnership account at the bank for the purpose of applying the monies so drawn to his own use was, in my opinion, a borrowing or taking of money from the bank, not on account of the partnership but for his own unauthorized use within the meaning of the article, and so a clear violation of it. So in like manner the constant cheques from time to time drawn by him on the partnership account at the bank, whether such account was overdrawn or not, and his applying the proceeds partly to his own use, partly to the use of his brother, partly to the use of Gillespie, Mead & Co., in which firm his brother was a partner, was also, in my opinion, a taking up of money from the bank as on account of the partnership, without the consent of his co-partners, within the meaning of that article. Then, again, his fraudulent conduct in respect of the $900, drawn by him from the bank, which was the immediate cause of his expulsion, and his not having made or caused to be made any entry in the books of the partnership in relation to such sum by which his dealings therewith could be traced was, in my opinion, a clear breach of the 14th and 17th articles of the partnership articles.\nI am of opinion, further, that it was clearly established by the evidence that, in point of fact, Mead was removed from the partnership and that it was dissolved and determined solely because of Mead\u2019s misconduct and, as Mead well knew, in virtue of the authority deemed to be vested in his co-partners by the third article of the partnership articles, although the form pointed out in that article of giving to Mead notice in writing was not pursued. He was informed verbally, though not in writing, that the partnership was dissolved and determined for such his misconduct.\nThe substance of the article was complied with to which Mead, after vainly endeavoring to persuade his co-partners to alter their determination submitted; the form only of giving notice in writing to Mead was omitted. There can, I think, be no doubt that the form of the notice of dissolution, which was signed by all the parties for publication, was adopted for the purpose of sparing the feelings of Mead and his relatives. That notice cannot estop the defendants from proving that Mead\u2019s misconduct was the sole cause of the dissolution, nor can Mead or his assignees, in my opinion, be heard to invoke that notice in support of their claim to have an account taken in the present action of the value of the interest which he once had in the good will of the business, of which interest he was, by the express terms of the partnership, declared to be divested in the event of his voluntarily retiring from the partnership, or of its being dissolved by his co-partners, under the third article, for his misconduct; nor in whatever light the circumstances attending the dissolution may be viewed, is there, in my opinion, anything in the terms of the notice of dissolution which, in view of all the actual circumstances of the case, can be construed as giving to Mead any right to have any allowance made to him as for the value of the interest which he had under the articles of partnership in the good will of the business.\nThe circumstances of the case are as follows: The defendant O\u2019Keefe had for many years carried on the business of brewer and maltster in the City of Toronto, for some time alone and afterwards in partnership with, and upon premises belonging to, the father of the defendant Hawke, under the name, style and firm of \u201cO\u2019Keefe & Co.,\u201d in which name the business had acquired a considerable reputation. In 1881 the defendant Hawke\u2019s father, on retiring from the business, was desirous that his son, the defendant Hawke, then a young man who knew nothing of the business, should be taken into the business by O\u2019Keefe. The plaintiff Mead and his friends were at the same time very desirous that the plaintiff Mead, who was also a young man wholly ignorant of the business, should also be taken by O\u2019Keefe into the business. The interest of O\u2019Keefe in his partnership with the defendant Hawke\u2019s father had been, in round numbers, $53,397.00 and that of the defendant Hawke\u2019s father $14,071.00; an agreement was thereupon come to between O\u2019Keefe, the defendant Hawke\u2019s father, the defendant Hawke and the plaintiff Mead respectively, that the defendant Hawke should acquire the share his father had held to the amount of $14,071.00, and that Mead should bring a like sum into the business; and inasmuch as the defendant Hawke and the plaintiff Mead knew nothing of the business, and would require three years to acquire a thorough knowledge of it, it was agreed that they should form a partnership for three years, and that the defendant Hawke\u2019s father should execute a lease to the new firm of the premises wherein the business of \u201cO\u2019Keefe & Co.\u201d had been carried on for such period of three years, and that the defendant Hawke and the plaintiff Mead, in addition to the sums of $14,071.00 brought by them respectively into the business, should each pay to O\u2019Keefe the sum of $12,500.00 in consideration of which payment O\u2019Keefe agreed with each of them respectively to teach them the business during the said period of three years, and to sell and transfer absolutely to them jointly the whole interest in the good-will of the business as then already acquired, or as should thereafter be acquired, and to conduct the business as general manager during the three years partnership for the sum of $2,000.00 per annum over and above his share in the net profits of the business, which was agreed to be one half of the whole and that of the defendant Hawke and the plaintiff Mead one-fourth each. Accordingly a partnership was entered into between O\u2019Keefe, the defendant Hawke and Mead, for the term of three years from the 1st September, 1881, and the partnership articles were executed in the month of April following whereby, among other things, after reciting the payment of the sum of $25,000.00 in equal shares by the defendant Hawke and the plaintiff Mead to O\u2019Keefe, and his agreement to fully initiate and instruct them in the business of brewing, the said O\u2019Keefe for himself, his heirs, executors and administrators, did grant, trans- fer and deliver to the said Hawke and Mead and the survivor of them, all the interest of him, the said O\u2019Keefe, in the good-will of the business and partnership theretofore existing between him and the defendant Hawke\u2019s father, and also of the business to be carried on under the partnership then formed between O\u2019Keefe, Hawke & Mead, and for the consideration aforesaid, that is in consideration of the payment of the said sum of $25,000.00, the said O\u2019Keefe did thereby covenant with the said Hawke and Mead and the survivor of them at the expiration of the new partnership to be formed, if formed as thereinafter mentioned, to execute to the said Hawke and Mead, or to the survivor of them, a good and sufficient deed assigning and transferring to them all his right, title and interest in the said goodwill as aforesaid but that:\nIn the event of the said Widmer Hawke and the said Joseph Hooper Mead, or in the event of either of them, desiring it he, the said Eugene O\u2019Keefe, will, if living at the expiration of the partnership hereby formed, enter into a fresh partnership with the said Hawke and Mead, if they both desire it, or in the event of only one of them desiring it, or being then alive, with the one so desiring, or with the survivor for the term of three years after the expiration of the partnership hereby formed, on the terms and conditions that the capital brought into such new partnership and business shall be not less than $75,000 if the three partners be then alive and desirous to continue in business together or not less than $50,000 if two only are alive and desirous to continue in business together, and shall be contributed by the partners therein in equal shares; and he, the said Eugene O\u2019Keefe, shall only be entitled to receive out of the profits of the said co\u2011partnership during the said further period of three years, an equal share with each of the other partners, instead of the one-half share to be received by him during the aforesaid first period of three years; and the salary, as chief brewer, agreed to be paid to the said Eugene O\u2019Keefe during the said first period of three years shall cease and determine at the expiration of the said first period, and shall not be payable to him during the said second period of three years if the said partnership extend so long; and he will accept one-half share in such net profits, if either of the said Hawke or Mead be then dead or unwilling to continue said partnership. In the event of no such new partnership being formed, or at the expiration of such new partnership if the same shall be formed, he, the said Eugene O\u2019Keefe, will retire from the present partnership, or such future partnership, as the case may be, and shall only call for and be entitled to receive whatever his share in the capital stock of the said firm may then be, and his share of the net profits up to the time of his retiring from the said firm, but shall receive nothing for the good will of the business at that date, and whether he, the said Eugene O\u2019Keefe, shall retire from the partnership hereby formed at the expiration of the same, or shall enter upon such new partnership as hereby agreed, and shall retire therefrom at the expiration thereof as hereinbefore mentioned, he doth hereby for himself, his heirs, executors and administrators, covenant, promise and agree with the said Hawke and Mead and the survivor of them, that he, the said Eugene O\u2019Keefe, shall not, nor will at any time or times, during the period of twenty-five years from and after the time he shall have retired from the partnership hereby formed, or such new partnership as the case may be, either on his own account, or for or on account of any other person or persons whomsoever, corporation or corporations, either directly or indirectly, engage in or carry on within the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba and the North-west Territories, or any province or provinces which hereafter may be formed out of any part thereof, the business of maltster or brewer of ale, porter or lager beer, and shall not nor will directly or indirectly, on his own account or on account of his wife for the time being, or on account of one or more or any of his children, invest any money in any such malting or brewing business within the limits above prescribed, nor shall either directly or indirectly participate in the earnings of any such malting or brewing business within the limits above described; or manufacture within any part of the United States of America malt, ale, beer, porter, or lager beer, to be sold afterwards within the limits above prescribed, unless duly authorized in writing so to do by the said Hawke and Mead, or the survivor of them. And the said O\u2019Keefe, for himself, his executors and administrators, doth hereby promise and agree with the said Hawke and Mead and the survivor of them, that he, the said O\u2019Keefe, shall and will, during the partnership hereby formed, and also during such new partnership if the same shall be formed, to the best of his knowledge and ability, teach and instruct the said Hawke and Mead and the survivor of them, the business of malting and brewing ale, beer, porter and lager beer, and shall and will to the best of his knowledge and ability, fully, particularly, and without reserve, initiate and instruct the said Hawke and Mead and the survivor of them in such malting and brewing business, imparting to them and the survivor of them, and instructing them in all the trade secrets in connection with the said malting or brewing business, with which the said O\u2019Keefe may now or hereafter be acquainted.\nNow this right to the use of the trade name of \u201cO\u2019Keefe & Co.,\u201d which is a right more in the nature of a trade mark than a \u201cgoodwill\u201d is the only thing which came under the name of \u201cgoodwill\u201d of the business thus transferred by O\u2019Keefe to Hawke and Mead. It is apparent also from the above article extracted from the partnership articles, and also from the 23rd, that from the moment the articles of partnership were signed O\u2019Keefe retained no right, title, interest or benefit whatever in the \u201cgoodwill\u201d so transferred, other than such benefit as he might incidentally derive during the continuance of his partnership with Hawke and Mead or with one of them under the provisions of the articles in that behalf. He had nothing in the nature of \u201cgoodwill\u201d to transfer to any one. The right and title to, and interest in, the use of the name of \u201cO\u2019Keefe & Co.\u201d as maltsters and brewers belonged under the articles wholly to Hawke and Mead as joint owners with benefit of survivorship.\nIn case after the expiration of the first partnership term of three years either Hawke or Mead should die the \u201cgoodwill\u201d would be vested in the survivor, and in case they should both be living but one of them should be unwilling to continue carrying on the business and that the other should be willing, no provision being made in the articles for compensation to the one unwilling to continue the business, the one continuing the business, in the absence of a special provision to be made between him and the one ceasing to carry on the business, would retain the right to the use of the trade name, and nothing could be recovered from him by the other party in such a case. In effect the right to the use of the trade name of \u201cO\u2019Keefe & Co.\u201d belonged to Hawke and Mead so long as they should jointly carry on the business, and upon either of them ceasing to carry on the business for any cause would belong to the other continuing to carry on the business without any compensation unless such was provided in the above articles of partnership or should be provided in an agreement to be entered into between them either on dissolution of the partnership or otherwise. Now by the partnership articles it is agreed that neither O\u2019Keefe, Hawke or Mead should either by himself or with any other person or persons whomsoever, either directly or indirectly, engage in the business of brewers or maltsters, or in any business except the business of the said partnership and upon account thereof; provision is also made enabling either of the partners Hawke or Mead to retire from the business before the expiration of the partnership term formed by the articles without the consent of his partners by giving to them three months\u2019 notice in writing of his intent; and also for the removal from the partnership of such one of them as should be guilty of a breach or non-observance of certain specified articles by giving to or leaving for the one guilty of such breach or non-observance a notice dissolving the partnership for such cause. Then provision is made between the defendant Hawke and the plaintiff Mead as the sole owners of the \u201cgoodwill\u201d for three events and only for three events, namely:\u2014\n1.The event of one or other of them voluntarily retiring from the business before the expiration of the three years for which the partnership was formed; 2, the event of one or other of them being compelled to leave the firm because of his being guilty of any breach or non\u2011observance of any of the stipulations contained in the specified articles; and 3, the event of one or either of them dying before the expiration of the said partnership term of three years; and it was specially agreed that in the event of either the defend- ant Hawke or the plaintiff Mead retiring from the said firm, or being compelled to leave the said firm for a breach or non-observance of any of the stipulations of the specified articles, the one so retiring or being compelled to leave the said firm shall not be entitled to receive, and shall not receive from the other of them, or from any new firm which may be formed to carry on the business, any sum of money whatsoever for, or in respect of, his \u201cgoodwill\u201d in the business; but that in the event of the death of one of them before the expiration of the partnership formed by the articles the survivor should and would pay to the personal representatives of the deceased one the sum of $12,500, which should, among other things, be taken to be payment in full of the \u201cgoodwill\u201d of the business which the partner so dying had bought from the said Eugene O\u2019Keefe, and the same should therefore be considered to have been transferred to, and to have become the property of, the party making such payment.\nThen the 18th article made provision for an account being taken every year of all the assets of the firm to participate in which the three partners were interested. It is obvious that the \u201cgoodwill\u201d which belonged to Hawke and Mead jointly, and in which O\u2019Keefe had no interest, formed no part of the account by this article prescribed to be taken.\nThen the 19th article made provision for the account to be taken after the expiration of the partnership, or in the event of its sooner determination for any cause other than death, for the 21st article made provision for the case of death. That the \u201cgoodwill\u201d formed no part of the account by the 19th article prescribed to be taken is apparent from this, that after the payment of all the debts of the partnership the balance arising from every particular in respect of which the account is directed to be taken is made divisible between the three partners in the following proportions, namely, one-half share to O\u2019Keefe and one-quarter share to Hawke and Mead respectively. Then the 21st article makes provision for the case of death, namely, that an account shall be taken of the stock in trade, monies, credits and things belonging to the said partnership as provided in the 18th article hereinbefore contained, so that the interest of such deceased partner in the capital stock in trade, monies, credits and things, and the net profits of the said firm up to the time of the decease of such deceased partner, may be ascertained, for payment of which by the surviving partners provision is made. Then inasmuch as this account had nothing to do with the \u201cgoodwill\u201d of the business provision is made for it in the 26th article, namely, that:\nin the event of either the said Hawke or Mead departing this life before the expiration of the partnership hereby formed, in addition to the amount which the executors or administrators of the partner so dying would be entitled to receive, under article 21 hereinbefore contained, they shall be entitled to receive from the survivor of such of the two last mentioned partners, and such survivor hereby agrees to pay to the executors or administrators of the partner so dying, the sum of $12,500 as aforesaid.\nThe articles, therefore, seem to provide for every possible contingency affecting the \u201cgoodwill.\u201d If Hawke or Mead voluntarily retires from the firm, or is compelled to leave for breach or non-observance of the specified articles, he is not to receive anything for interest in the \u201cgoodwill;\u201d if either of them should die before the expiration of the term of the partnership the personal representative of the one so dying is to receive from the survivor a specified sum in full satisfaction of all interest of the deceased one in the goodwill; if both should live until the expiration of the partnership formed by the articles they are left to deal with the good will as they should think fit. The non-compliance by Hawke or Mead with the form pointed out in the 2nd article to enable a partner voluntarily to retire from the firm against the will of his co-partners would not, in my opinion, if his co-partners should waive compliance with the form, remove the case of the one retiring from the operation of the clause depriving him of his interest in the goodwill in the event of his retiring from the firm before the expiration of the partnership formed by the articles; nor would the expulsion of either the one or the other for breach or non-observance of the stipulations of the specified articles, to which expulsion the party guilty of such breach has submitted although he has not been served with a notice in writing terminating the partnership for such cause, remove the case from the operation of the clause divesting the expelled party of all his interest in the goodwill; it is to the substance of the acts that the forfeiture of interest in the goodwill is annexed, namely, in the one case to the fact of retirement and in the other to the fact of the expulsion for breach of the specified articles, and not to the form pursued for effecting such retirement or expulsion.\nBut we have in the notice of dissolution which was signed by Mead the terms of the dissolution, namely,\nThe partnership is dissolved by mutual consent, and that Messrs. O\u2019Keefe and Hawke will continue the business, and are authorized to collect all debts due to the firm, and meet all the engagements thereof.\nThis agreement, as I have already said, does not, in my opinion, operate as having any effect to prevent the defendants showing the true state of the case to be that in point of fact Mead was expelled from the firm for breach of the specified articles, and that this form of notice was adopted to spare the feelings of Mead and his friends: but, however this may be, it is plain that under such terms of dissolution as above specified, Hawke must be entitled to continue using the trade name of \u201cO\u2019Keefe & Co.,\u201d in which alone the \u201cgood will\u201d consists. Of this right Hawke cannot be deprived, nor can he be compelled to pay anything to Mead for the enjoyment of such right in the absence of a special contract to that effect. As already shown, the only account which is provided by the articles of partnership to be taken in the events which have happened is that prescribed by the 19th article, which excludes any estimate of any interest of Mead in the \u201cgood will.\u201d The appeal must, therefore, in my opinion, be allowed with costs, and the action in the court below dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs and action dismissed.\nSolicitors for appellants: Gordon & Sampson.\nSolicitors for respondents: Crombie, Morrell & Gwynne.\n[1] 15 Ont.

S. C. c. 54 s. 57 at the instance of a relator claiming part of said lands to set aside said letters patent as issued in error or improvidence.\nHeld, 1. That a judgment avoiding letters patent upon such an information could only be justified and supported upon the same grounds being established in evidence as would be necessary if the proceedings were by scire facias.\n2. The term \u201cimprovidence,\u201d as distinguished from error, applies to\ncases-where the grant has been to the prejudice of the commonwealth or the general injury of the public, or where the rights of any individual in the thing granted are injuriously affected by the letters patent; and F.\u2019s title having been recognized by the government as good and valid under the Manitoba Act, and the lands granted to him in recognition of that right, the letters patent could not be set aside as having been issued improvidently except upon the ground that some other person had a superior title also valid under the act.\n3. Letters patent cannot be judicially pronounced to have been issued in error or improvidently when lands have been granted upon which a trespasser, having no color of right in law, has entered and was in possession without the knowledge of the government officials upon whom rests the duty of executing and issuing the letters patent, and of investigating and passing judgment upon the claims therefor; or when such trespasser, or any person claiming under him, has not made any application for letters patent; or when such an application has been made and refused without any express determination of the officials refusing the application, or any record having been made of the application having been made and rejected.\n4. Per Patterson J.\u2014That in the construction of the statute effect must be given to the term improvidence as meaning something distinct from fraud or error; letters patent may, therefore, be held to have been issued improvidently if issued in ignorance of a substantial claim by persons other than the patentee to the land which, if it had been known, would have been investigated and passed upon before the patent issued; and it is not the duty of the court to form a definite opinion as to the relative strength of opposing claims.\n5. Semble per Gwynne J.\u2014There is no sound reason why the Government of the Dominion should not be bound by the judgment of a court of justice in a suit to which the Attorney-General, as representing the Government, was a party defendant, equally as any individual would be, if the relief prayed by the information is sought in the same interest and upon the same grounds as were adjudicated upon by the judgment in the former suit.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Manitoba ([1]), reversing the judgment at the hearing by which the information was dismissed.\nThe facts of this case may be found in the report of the decision of the court below and in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne herein.\nJ. S. Tupper and Glass for the appellants. The evidence shows that the facts were misrepresented to the Attorney-General when he granted his fiat for the information in this case.\nFonseca acted in entire good faith, and his patent will not be set aside except on the clearest evidence. Attorney General v. McNulty ([2]); Attorney-General v. Garbutt ([3]); Martyn v. Kennedy ([4]).\nThe learned counsel also referre to Lake v. Bailey ([5]); Farmer v. Livingston ([6]); Barnes v. Boomer ([7]). Ewart Q.C. for the respondent.\nSTRONG J. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am in favor of allowing this appeal for the reasons stated by the late Chief Justice Wallbridge and also for reasons given by Mr. Justice Gwynne in his judgment.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I concur with my brother Gwynne and for the reasons by him given I think this appeal should be allowed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In 1861 the defendant Fonseca settled in Rupert\u2019s Land, upon part of a piece of land known as lot No 244 of the Hudson Bay Company\u2019s survey, now known as lot No. 35, in the parish of St. John, in the city of Winnipeg. From the time of his entry he occupied about three or four acres as a homestead, and in 1862 erected a dwelling house in which he thenceforth lived. The piece so occupied by him extended the distance of ten chains, measured in a direction from north to south, or nearly the fourth part of the width of the lot 244, its length being in the direction from east to west. The piece so enclosed and occupied as his homestead was of a triangular shape, the eastern extremity of which was a line ten chains in length from north to south, and which separated the piece occupied by Fonseca from a lot owned and occupied by one Neil McDonald, which was one of a number of lots laid out on a bend of the Red River and known as the Point Douglas lots. In 1864 Fonseca purchased from Neil McDonald a triangular piece of about two acres of this point, immediately adjoining Fonseca\u2019s homestead enclosure which, added to the piece, made his homestead a rectangular piece of land of about 5 or 6 acres. He also purchased three of those Point Douglas or river lots, comprising among them from 50 to 55 acres. In 1869 Fonseca took possession also of two other small pieces of said lot 244 on the west side of a road or highway crossing said lot about 300 yards to, the west of his homestead, on which he also erected\u2019 buildings, consisting of stores and dwelling houses; the pieces so taken possession of are now known as two town lots on the west side of Main street, in the City of Winnipeg. In or about the month of November, 1870, one Sinclair, a surveyor, laid out a portion of the said lot No. 244 into town lots upon the employment of Fonseca and of certain others of the holders of Point Douglas lots. The piece so surveyed comprehends what are now known as lots C, D, E and F, on block 14, according to the official plan of the City of Winnipeg. The owners of these Point lots appear to have claimed to have had some interest in the lot No. 244 as a common prior to the surrender of Rupert\u2019s Land to the crown, but under what title such claim was asserted does not clearly appear. After the surrender of Rupert\u2019s land to the crown one William Logan, who is a brother-in-law of the defendant Fonseca, and who was not an owner of any of the Point Douglas or river lots, without any claim of title entered upon a part of the said lot 244, apparently just before the above mentioned survey made by Sinclair; and as it is in virtue of this his entry that the present information is filed upon the relation of, and in the interest of, Eliza Mercer, and in the interest also of one T. Gray, who severally claim only by title derived from Logan, it will be convenient to state from the information the grounds upon which the relief asked by the information is based. The information, commencing at its 14th Paragraph, alleges that: In or about the year of our Lord, 1870, (in paragraph 21 it is stated to have been after the 15th July of that year), one William Logan, who was one of the said Point Douglas holders, in respect of his ownership of the lot of land on the river known as the Hup\u00e9 lot, and afterwards as lot No. 24 of the Dominion Government Survey of the Parish of St. Johns, as one of the persons interested in the Point Douglas Common, took possession of said southerly ten chains of said lot thirty-five which portion may be more familiarly known and described as follows, that is to say: Lots C, D, E and F in block number fourteen according to the official plan of the City of Winnipeg made by George McPhillips, D.L.S., and filed in the Registry Office in and for the County of Selkirk.\nAfterwards the said Logan conveyed to various persons various portions of the said lots C, D, E and F, and some of those persons conveyed to others, and there are now various persons in possession of the said lots claiming to be entitled thereto, and to receive patents therefor by virtue of long possession and improvements placed upon the property. Among such persons the relator claims to be entitled to:\nFirst.\u2014A portion of said lot D having a frontage of about ninety-two feet on Main street and running back along Fonseca street, with a uniform width of ninety-two feet to a depth of one hundred and sixty-five feet.\nSecond.\u2014A portion of said lot E having a frontage of ninety-two feet on Austin street and running back along Fonseca street the same width to a depth of one hundred and thirty feet more or less. And the said Thomas Simon Gray claims to be entitled to parts of the lots C and F in the plan hereinafter mentioned, and more particularly described as follows:\nHere follows a description which it is not necessary to set out at large. Then the information proceeds:\u2014\nThe relator and the said Thomas Simon Gray each claim title to their respective portions of the said lands through the said William Logan and they and those through whom they claim were for many years prior to the issue of the said patent, (that is a patent granting the land to Fonseca previously mentioned in the information), continuously in possession of the said portions of the said lands, claiming to be entitled thereto by reason of such possession and in the absence of title in any person or persons other than the crown.\nThe information then prays that the letters patent to Fonseca for the lands in question may be declared to have issued, in respect of these lands, improvidently and through error and in ignorance of the rights of the several persons aforesaid, and that the said letters patent may be set aside as far as they affect the said lands, and be declared absolutely null and void and of no effect so far as regards these lands. That an agreement of the 12th November, 1879, mentioned in the information, made between the defendants Fonseca and Schultz for the sale and conveyance by the former to the latter of one undivided half share in the lands on the said common for which Fonseca should obtain letters patent from the Government, be declared null and void as to the lands in question, and\nthat all the conveyances of the said lands and premises through which the said relator claims title to the said lands and premises may be confirmed.\nThe object of this latter clause is not very apparent. It could scarcely have been supposed that the court could rectify any defect there might be in the relator\u2019s title. It was inserted, perhaps, with the view of obtaining the judgment of the court to the effect that her claim and title to have the land she claims granted to her is preferable to any claim that Fonseca had, so as to justify the court in acceding to the prayer of the information by granting a decree avoiding the letters patent issued in favor of Fonseca. This appears to me to be the only purpose contemplated by the insertion of this clause in the prayer; but whatever may have been the object of its insertion, it plainly appears by the information that it was filed, and thereby the present suit was instituted, in assertion of a claim and right in the relator, Eliza Mercer and in Thomas Simon Gray severally to certain parts of the land in question, to have such parts granted to them respectively preferably to the claim of Fonseca in right of which the lands were granted to him; and it is for this reason only that a decree is asked that the letters patent granting the lands to him may be declared to be null and void as issued improvidently, in error and in ignorance of the rights of the several parties aforesaid; and the present Deputy Minister of the Interior, upon whose suggestion alone the information appears to have been authorized to be filed by the Attorney-General, says in his evidence that in point of fact the suit is prosecuted for the benefit of Eliza Mercer who is the sole relator, making no mention of Thomas Simon Gray. Gray\u2019s claim is mentioned in the information, but the evidence of the Deputy Minister is as above\u2014that the suit is prosecuted for the benefit of Eliza Mercer\u2014and she is the person at whose sole expense the suit has been instituted. There can, therefore, be no doubt that the suit is founded upon a claim of right in the relator Eliza Mercer and Thomas Simon Gray respectively, which is asserted to be preferable to any right or claim Fonseca had, to obtain a grant of the lands in question, and not upon any suggestion or complaint made by the Attorney-General that the letters patent granting the lands to Fonseca were issued either improvidently or in error, otherwise than in so far as they may have been, if they were, issued in ignorance of some superior right which the relator and Gray respectively had, or have, if any such they have, in the pieces claimed by them respectively, through Logan, to obtain a decree annulling the letters patent to Fonseca, in order that letters patent may be issued to them respectively in recognition of such their claims as preferable to any Fonseca had.\nNow, the allegation in the information as to the right in virtue of which Logan is said to have entered upon the lands in question, upon which right alone is now rested the preferable claim asserted on behalf of the relator and Gray, as claiming through Logan, to have the letters patent issued to Fonseca annulled as to the lands in question, and those lands granted to them respectively, is not supported by the evidence. On the contrary, it is shown by the evidence to be an allegation not founded on facts, and this is the second time in which this allegation has been made in a legal proceeding, for a bill was filed by the relator Eliza Mercer against the present defendants and the Attorney-General of the Dominion, which prayed for the same relief as that which is prayed for in this information founded upon the same allegation coupled with another, namely, that Logan\u2019s possession of the lands in question had commenced prior to the 15th July, 1870, and that bill was dismissed upon the ground that the allegations upon which the then plaintiff\u2014the present relator\u2014based her claim to the relief prayed for were disproved. It is now claimed upon behalf of the relator that the Attorney-General, as representing the Government of the Dominion, although a defendant in the former suit, as representing the Government, cannot in the present suit be affected by the judgment in the former. I can see no sound reason why the Government of the Dominion should not be bound by the judgment of a court of justice in a suit to which the Attorney-General as representing the Government was a party defendant equally as any individual defendant would be, if the relief prayed by the information is sought in the same interest and upon the same grounds as were adjudicated upon by the judgment in the former suit; and I am not prepared to admit the proposition that, in such case, the Government would not be affected by the judgment in the former suit to be well founded in law. It is not, however, I think, necessary to decide the point in the present suit. The question now is not so much whether the Government as represented by the Attorney-General is or is not estopped by the judgment in the former suit, as whether a court of justice should, in the interest of the relator, in whose interest and in assertion of whose title the present suit has been instituted, entertain as sufficient ground upon which to grant the relief prayed, namely, to avoid letters patent, a claim of the relator\u2019s, which in the former suit, (in which the same relief was prayed for and could have been granted if a right thereto had been established, as is prayed for and could be granted in the present suit), was adjudged to have been not only not proved, but to have been disproved.\nGray, however, in whose interest also, as well as in the interest of the relator, the information shows the present suit to have been instituted, was not a party to the former suit. I propose, therefore, to deal with the case upon the evidence taken in the case as we have it before us. In some respects it is not perhaps quite as full as was the evidence in the former case, but the conclusion which should be arrived at seems to me to be the same.\nLogan, in his evidence in the present case, although he said on his examination-in-chief that he put up a log building on the land in question in the spring of 1870, and another in the fall of that year, was obliged to admit, upon his cross-examination, that the first log building he ever put upon any part of the land was in the month of September, 1870.\nThe log building he then put up was of the dimensions of 14 x 16 feet. He brought it from some other place; it did not take quite a week to put it up. In 1871 he put an addition to it and built a small stable. Whether he went to reside upon the lot prior to 1872 is not perhaps quite clear; but this is immaterial. Then, as to the right in virtue of which he says he entered upon the land. He took possession, he says, in right of his being the owner of a Point Douglas river lot, then known as the Hup\u00e9 lot, now lot 24. He took possession without the authority of or consultation with any one. His right so to take possession he explains in this manner: He bought, he says, the Hup\u00e9 lot, and having bought it that, he says, gave him a right to the common, that is, to some part, of it, and to the particular part in question, \u201c simply because he located it,\u201d that is to say entered upon it and took possession of it, his right to do so being, as he says, solely in virtue of his having been the owner of the Hup\u00e9 river lot at Point Douglas. Now, in point of fact, it appears by the evidence which was given of certain deeds upon registry in the registry office at Winnipeg that Logan did not own the Hup\u00e9 lot until the month of October, 1872. Hup\u00e9 by a deed upon the 17th October, 1872, conveyed the lot to Logan by the description following, that is to say: as situate at Point Douglas, in the county of Selkirk, measuring four and one-half chains in width by all the depth between the Red River by which it is bounded in front and the road leading from the Point Douglas ferry, which road forms the rear boundary. The lot belonging to John Sutherland bounds the said land on one side, and E. L. Barber\u2019s lot bounds it on the other. The whole of this lot Logan, upon the 26th June, 1873, by deed of that date, sold and conveyed to one David H. Thomas. It is obvious, therefore, that the possession taken of the lands in question, as part of the common, by Logan, in September, 1870, was not in virtue of his having been the owner of the Hup\u00e9 river lot; indeed he admits that he did not at the time claim possession in virtue of title as owner of any river lot; this is an idea which he must have first entertained at some subsequent period, but when does not appear. Now, it is in evidence that Fonseca always entertained the idea of acquiring title, if and when he could, for a strip of this lot 244, ten chains in width\u2014that is, running north and south, by the length of the lot measured from the eastern extremity where his house was built to the western extremity. It would seem also that there were other persons who had like possession of other parts, subject always to the common rights claimed by the owners of the Point lots. Dr. Schultz in his evidence says that at the time of the transfer of Rupert\u2019s Land to the crown, on the 15th July, 1870, the persons having actual possession of parts of lot 244 were himself, John McTavish, Eli Barber, the defendant Fonseca, and the Hon. John Sutherland; and he says that for seven or eight y ears prior to 1870 Fonseca\u2019s possession of this southern ten chains of the lot measured as aforesaid was so far recognized by the persons claiming common rights in virtue of their being owners of Point lots that these common rights were exercised over the portion of the said southern ten chains in width by the length of the lot from east to west lying outside of Fonseca\u2019s homestead enclosure with the consent of Fonseca. In 1870 the owners of the Point lots had a survey made of a small portion of the lot 244 adjoining a road then called the Highway, now Main street, in the City of Winnipeg, into town lots, with the view of selling the lots for the benefit of the owners of the Point lots. The piece so surveyed comprised within it a portion of the southern ten chains of the lot adjoining Fonseca\u2019s homestead enclosure, and the erections he had made in 1869, about 300 yards west thereof, including the lots now known as lots 0, D, E, and F, on the Government survey made some years subsequent. A meeting of the owners of the Point Douglas river lots was held on the 24th July, 1872, at which an agreement was come to as to the action of the claimants to common rights in the lot 244. This agreement was reduced into the shape of a deed executed by the several owners, seventeen in number, of whom the defendant Fonseca was one, and the defendant Schultz another, and bearing date the 15th October, 1872, by which five of their number, of whom Fonseca was one, became trustees under and for the purposes of the deed. The deed purported to convey to the trustees the lot No. 244 known as the reserve in common belonging to the owners, occupiers and possessors of Point Douglas, and the trust purpose was declared to be to sell the town lots laid out on the survey made by the owners of Point lots in 1870, for the benefit of the several parties interested in proportion to their interests. The trustees made sales of some of the town lots to certain persons who purchased from them, and to enable them to make good those sales, and to obtain title to the whole lot in order that it might be sub-divided by them in accordance with their knowledge of the proportions to be allotted to each person entitled, they applied to the Government for letters patent granting the lot to them. The grounds upon which they based their application will sufficiently appear when we come to see the action taken by Government thereon in 1877, after several years taken for the consideration of the claim. Now, upon the 12th May, 1870, the act 35 Vic. ch. 3, to establish and provide for the government of Manitoba, was parsed. That act was passed4n anticipation of the transfer of Rupert\u2019s land from the Hudson Bay Company to the crown being shortly thereafter perfected, and it enacted, among other things, as follows:\u2014\nSec. 32. For the quieting of titles and assuring to the settlers in the Province the peaceable possession of the lands now held by them, it is enacted as follows:\u2014\n1. All grants of land in freehold made by the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company up to the 8th day of March, 1869, shall, if required by the owner, be confirmed by grant from the Crown.\n2. All grants of estates less than freehold in land made by the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company up to the 8th day of March aforesaid shall, if required by the owner, be converted into an estate in freehold by grant from the Crown.\n3. All titles by occupancy with the sanction and under the license and authority of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company up to the 8th day of March aforesaid, of land in that part of the Province in which the Indian title has been extinguished shall, if required by the owner, be converted into an estate in freehold by giant from the Crown.\n4. All persons in peaceable possession of tracts of land at the time of the transfer to Canada in those parts of the Province in which the Indian title has lot been extinguished shall have the right of pre-emption of the same on such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Governor in Council.\n5. The Lieutenant Governor is hereby authorised under regulations to be made from time to time by the Governor in Council, to make all such provisions for ascertaining and adjusting on fair and equitable terms the rights of common and the rights of cutting hay held and enjoyed by the settlers in the Province, and for the commutation of the same by grants of land from the Crown.\nThe transfer of Rupert\u2019s Land to the crown became perfected on the 15th July, 1870. It is now obvious that Logan never acquired any right or claim whatever to have had any part of the land now in question granted to him under the provisions of the above act. Evidence was given at the trial that a notice which was issued from the office of the Surveyor General of the Dominion, then kept in Winnipeg, and signed by the Surveyor General, and bearing date the 21st March, 1873, was at that time very extensively circulated in Winnipeg and throughout the Province, in the terms following:\u2014\nNotice is hereby given that claims, by squatting on, or otherwise, to any Government lands within the settlements of the Red River and the Assiniboine River without the authority of this Department previously obtained will not be recognised by the Government. Persons are hereby required to govern themselves accordingly.\n(Signed)\nJ. S. DENNIS,\nSurveyor General\nIt appeared in evidence by abstracts of, and extracts from, deeds on registry in the registry office at Winnipeg (for this is the only way, as far as I can see upon the appeal case laid before us, the deeds upon which the relator and Gray rest their respective claims were proved), that on the 26th June, 1873, after the publication and circulation of the notice of the 21st March, 1873, Logan executed a deed purporting to convey to ( one David H. Thomas a piece of land in the City of Winnipeg, described as being:\nOne chain frontage on Main street, Winnipeg, by which it is bounded on one side, i.e., the west side running eastward four chains, and bounded by the common or reserve on Point Douglas, on which said lot of land is situate, and on the north by an adjoining lot and property of said William Logan, where he resides, and on the south by the property of E. L. Barber, on which his store or place of business is.\nThis deed is relied upon as the foundation of Gray\u2019s claim. At the time of its execution Thomas must be taken to have been aware of the notice of the 21st March previous, and to have been aware that the deed would pass nothing more than Logan\u2019s possession, which was that of a squatter only. In like manner, it appears that upon the 13th October, 1874, Thomas executed a deed of that date by which he purported to convey to one John Freeman a part of the piece conveyed by Logan to Thomas by the following description:\nCommencing at the north-west point of letter B in the survey of said Point Douglas Common made by Douglas Sinclair, Esquire, Provincial Land Surveyor, on the east side of Main street in said city, which said survey, by a plan or map thereof, has been duly registered, thence northerly forty feet, thence in a line parallel with the boundary line of said lot B and lot letter C\u2014in the same survey in an easterly direction to Austin street, thence southerly along the front of lot letter F, where the same fronts on Austin street forty feet, thence along the southern boundary line of lots letters C and F in said survey to the place of beginning.\nThen, upon the 7th December, 1875, Logan executed a deed of that date by which he purported to convey to the said David EL Thomas the whole of lots D and E, extending from Main street along Fonseca street to Austin street.\nThen, upon the 22nd March, 1876, the said David Thomas executed a deed of that date, by which he purported to re-convey to the said Logan a portion of the said lots D and E by the following description:\nCommencing at the north-west angle of lot D, fronting on Main street and Fonseca street, thence in an easterly direction along Fonseca street four chains, thence in a southerly direction at right angles 92 feet, thence in a westerly direction parallel with Fonseca street to Main street, thence along Main street 92 feet to the place of beginning.\nThen on the 20th June, 1870, Logan executed a deed of that date, by which he purported to convey the same piece, by the same description, to one Frederick C. Mercer. Upon the 19th June, 1876, David Thomas executed a deed of that date by which he purported to convey to the said Frederick C. Mercer a portion of the said lot E in block 14, by the following description.\nCommencing at a point on the south side of Fonseca street, distant four chains in a course S. 50\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201d from the intersection of the south side of Fonseca street with the east side of Main street; thence southerly at right angles to Fonseca street 92 feet; thence easterly parallel to Fonseca street one chain more or less to the west side of Austin street, thence northerly along the west side of Austin Street 92 feet to the south side of Fonseca street thence N. 50\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201d W. along the south side of Fonseca street one chain, more or less, to the place of beginning.\nOn the 28th March, 1876, by a deed of that date, the said David Thomas purported to convey to the said Logan that portion of lots F and E in block 14, described as follows,\nCommencing at a point on the west side of Austin street forty-one feet northerly from the line between lots F and G, thence in a westerly direction parallel to the line between lots F and G, 90 feet, thence at right angles northerly 30 feet, thence easterly parallel to the said line between lots F and G to the line defining the westerly side of Austin street, thence southerly along the said westerly side of Austin street 30 feet, more or less, to the place of beginning. Then, on 31st March, 1876, by deed of that date Logan purported to convey this lastly described piece of land to two persons of the name of McLean and McDonald. And, on the 20th September, 1876, the said David Thomas executed a deed of that date, by, which he purported to convey to one Thomas Manley a piece of land which, by the abstract, appears to be a small piece of lot E, which lay between the south-easterly angle of that lot on Austin street and the boundary of the piece described in the deed from Thomas to Mercer, dated the 19th June, 1876. Then by deed, dated the 19th December, 1876, executed by the said David Thomas, he purported to convey to the defendant Schultz a portion of the said lots C, D, E and F. by the following description,\nCommencing at a point forty feet in a northerly direction along Main street from the line dividing lots B and C, thence in an easterly direction 260 feet, more or less, running along the line and property of one John Freeman, thence at right angles in a northerly direction one hundred and thirty-five feet., more or less, running along the lines and property of one Thomas Manley, tradesman, and Messrs. McLean and McDonald to the line and property of Frederick Mercer, thence in a westerly direction 300 feet, more or less, running along the line and property of the said Frederick C. Mercer to Main street, thence in a southerly direction 42 feet, more or less, along Main street to the place of beginning.\nThe piece here described covered all the remaining portions of the lots C, D, E and F. not covered by the descriptions in the deeds to Freeman, Mercer, Manley, McLean and McDonald and from this time forth Logan had no possession, so far as appears, of any part of these lots C, D, E, or F.\nNow, upon the 8th of April, 1875, the act 38 Vic. ch. 52 was passed in which it was enacted as follows:\nWhereas it is expedient to afford facilities to parties claiming land under the third and fourth sub-sections of the thirty-second section of the Act thirty-third Victoria chapter three, to obtain letters patent for the same: Be it enacted that persons satisfactorily establishing undisturbed occupancy of any lands within the Province prior to, and being by themselves or their servants, tenants or agents or those through whom they claim in actual peaceable possession thereof on the fifteenth day of July 1870 shall be entitled to receive letters patent therefor granting the same absolutely to them respectively in t fee simple.\nUpon the passing of this act the trustees of the Point Douglas Common seem to have appealed to it in support of their application to the Government for letters patent granting the lot No. 244 to them. Upon the 10th May, 1877, an Order in Council was passed adopting a report of the Minister of the Interior upon the application of the trustees. In that report the Minister submitted for the approval of His Excellency in Council:\u2014\nThe land claimed consists of lot No. 35 Dominion Land Surveys, or No. 244 according to the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company\u2019s Survey and Registry Book situate formerly in the parish of St. John now included within the limits of the city of Winnipeg and contains 667 2\/10 acres. Its precise boundaries are indicated on the diagram A herewith which also shows its position in relation to the small holdings embracing the frontage on the Red River at Point Douglas owned severally by the applicants by virtue of which ownership they claim the lands in question as tenants in common.\nThe claimants apply for a patent for this land and support their application by certain allegations as follows:\u2014\n1. That the late Lord Selkirk at or about the time he founded the Red River settlement laid out on the river lots on Point Douglas and gave the same to certain of his servants or retainers marking off the large tract in rear to be held as a common by and for the benefit of the Point owners. Two of the claimants have stated their belief that Lord Selkirk actually conveyed this land to the settlers at the same time that he granted them the small lots.\n2. That they have always asserted their claim thereto, and have with slight interruption enjoyed the continuous and exclusive right of way and common over the same, and that the latter right has always been recognized in the surrounding community.\n3. That the right so claimed and enjoyed by them is superior in all respects to that conceded by the law of the Assiniboia council to the owners of the river lots, between the two mile and the four mile lines.\n5. They further claim a patent for the land under the provisions of the act 38 Vic, ch. 52. The report then states, among other things, as follows:\u2014\nOn an attentive perusal of all the evidence adduced and the voluminous papers in the case, it appears to the undersigned;\n1. It may be conceded that the claimants had, for many years previous to the transfer, enjoyed a right of common and of cutting hay over the land, but the enjoyment of such right can only be regarded as having been exclusive in the same light as the hay and common right in the outer two miles enjoyed by settlers on farm lots in the old parishes was exclusive.\n2. As regards the right of the claimants to a patent under the act 38 Vic. ch. 52, it is clear to the undersigned that the \u201c undisturbed occupancy \u201d and \u201c actual peaceable possession \u201d of the common either at the time of, or previous to, the transfer by the Point holders, was not of a character contemplated by the statute and, therefore, not such as would entitle the claimants to a grant of the land. The undersigned is of opinion that the claimants were at the time of, and previous to, the transfer in the enjoyment of a right of common and of cutting hay over the land in question, and generally in the Province, the ascertaining and adjusting which is provided for in the act 33 Vic. ch. 3, and that the same should be commuted by a grant of land from the crown. He is of opinion, however, that the applicants are unreasonable in their demands.\nUpon a full and earnest consideration of all the circumstances, the undersigned is of opinion that the applicants would be fairly, indeed liberally, dealt with, were they to receive in commutation of their rights a giant of acre for acre out of that part of the common next toward the river which is the most valuable part of the property.\nThe total acreage of the small holdings embracing the Point is 226 07 acres.\nThe undersigned recommends that a patent for an equal quantity issue to such persons as may be indicated with that view by the claimants, in trust for the benefit of the several owners of the Point lots. The land so patented should be bounded next to the river by the rear of the lots as originally laid out (the lot owned by the family of the late Neil McDonald to be considered as one of such lots), but not to be held to include any land for which a right to a patent may be established under the Manitoba act or the act 38 Vic. ch. 52, on the said property.\nIt should be understood, further, that the Government is to be entirely relieved from any trouble or responsibility connected with the division of the grant among the claimants, and finally the patent not to issue to the trustees until the written consent to such step shall have been filed in the Dominion Lands office of the several parties to whom the Point holders or any of them may have sold lots on the common.\nThis latter clause was inserted, as it would seem, for the protection of the parties to whom the trustees of the Point holders may have sold lots under the trust deed of the 15th October, 1872. Upon the adoption of that report by His Excellency in Council, the order in council passed for that purpose had plainly the effect, as it appears to me, of setting apart, for the benefit solely of the owners of Point lots, that part of lot 244, now lot 35, next adjoining the Point Douglas lots (including the lots now in question), to which no right to a patent could be established under the Manitoba act, or 38 Vic. ch. 52, to the extent of 226 acres. If a right to a patent could be established either under the Manitoba act or 38 Vic. ch. 52, to any part of lot 35 next adjoining the Point lots, such part was excluded from the computation of the 226 acres reserved for the benefit of the owners of Point lots; but if no such right could be established then the 226 acres next adjoining the Point lots were reserved for the benefit of the owners of such lots.\nUpon this report and order in council becoming known, Fonseca, apparently regarding himself as one of the persons therein alluded to as having a claim under the Manitoba act, as amended by 38 Vic. ch. 52, in the month of July, 1877, presented a petition addressed to the Minister of the Interior for a grant of the southern part of lot 244, now 35, measured from the eastern extremity of the common where his homestead enclosure was to the western extremity, and ten chains in width. The petition is as follows:\u2014\nThe petition of the undersigned respectfully sheweth that prior to and on the 15th day of July, 1870, he was by himself and through his servants, tenants and agents in actual peaceable possession of a portion of lot No. 35, in the parish of St. John, according to the Dominion survey of river lots to wit: the southern ten chains of said lot, commencing in the rear of the land or lot owned by the late Neil McDonald, and thence running back the usual distance to the two mile limit, and therefore prays that letters patent therefor may issue to him for the same.\nThis petition was accompanied with Fonseca\u2019s declaration, as follows:\u2014\nI, William Gomez Fonseca, of the City of Winnipeg, in the county of Selkirk, gentleman, do solemnly declare:\n1. That in the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one I, with the permission of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, through the late Governor McTavish, located and settled on part of now lot number thirty-five, according to the Dominion survey of river lots, immediately in rear of that portion of land then occupied by the late Neil McDonald, having a width of ten chains, and bounded on the southerly side by the land of Alexander Logan, Esquire; and, within a few years thereafter, not exceeding four, I fenced in a portion of said lot on the east side of the highway, and built thereon a dwelling-house, which I have ever since lived in, and occupied and cultivated, and I also, in the year 1869, built a store and outhouses on a portion of said lot, within the range of ten chains, aforesaid, extending back from the river on the west side of the highway, which I used for a store until about four years ago, and the same has since been occupied and is now occupied by my tenants.\nThat my occupancy of said ten chains has been peaceable and without interruption, and that, to the best of my knowledge and belief my claim to the crown patent for that portion of said lot thirty-five, in the rear of the late Neil McDonald\u2019s holding, having a width of ten chains and extending back to the two mile limit, is just and well founded.\nThat in the year 1867 I employed Herbert L. Sabine, an authorized surveyor under the Assiniboian Government, to survey for myself and others the whole of the lot 35, aforesaid, and I assisted in such survey, and planted the pickets, and we surveyed to the whole extent of the outer two mile limit, and I paid him therefor my proportion, equal to the ten chains in width aforesaid; and I make this solemn declaration, believing it to be true, and by virtue of the act passed in the 37th year of Her Majesty\u2019s reign, for the suppression of voluntary and extrajudicial oaths.\nHerbert L. Sabine, the surveyor therein referred to, also made a like declaration, affirming in every particular the statements in Fonseca\u2019s declaration; and one Alexander Dub\u00e9 also made a similar declaration, affirming Fonseca\u2019s declaration in every particular, save only that in relation to the survey of the lot in 1867, as to which Dub\u00e9 said nothing. With these declarations accompanying the petition, it was presented to the Government.\nAt this time the Government was recognizing the right of persons settled on land in Rupert\u2019s Land, prior to the 15th of July, 1870, to letters patent granting to them the land extending back from their actual location to the extent of what was called the two mile limit; and upon the strength of this action of the Government Fonseca and others similarly situated with him upon this lot 244, now 35, made application for letters patent to be granted to them respectively.\nWe now see that when Fonseca\u2019s petition was presented asking for letters patent to be issued granting to him the southerly ten chains of lot 244, which included the whole of the lots now in question, Logan was not in apparent or actual possession of any part of the lots now in question. He himself admits that he knew of Fonseca\u2019s application, and that it covered lots C, D, E and F, and that he never did make any application himself until the month of May, 1882, more than three years after the letters patent to Fonseca had been issued; and in that application he based his claim under the Manitoba act, as amended by 38 Vic. ch. 52, upon the allegation that he was in actual peaceable possession prior to and upon the 15th July, 1870, and that he had been in possession of a part as far back as 1863. We have already seen that there was no foundation whatever for such an allegation, and that its falsity has been established in part from his own lips, and by other means. All claim in him based upon any such foundation has been disproved, not only by the evidence given in the present case, but by that given in the case instituted by the present relator against the present defendants and the Attorney General, in which judgment has been rendered against the relator; but whether Logan had or had not any pretence of claim, he never made any claim to the Government or took any steps whatever to interfere with Fonseca\u2019s application for letters patent granting to him land including, as Logan knew, these very lots 0, D, E and F, while that application was before the Government, a period of about 18 months; neither did any person assert any claim to the land now claimed by the relator, either in virtue of a transfer derived from Logan of any claim or possession which Logan had or was supposed to have, or otherwise. The present relator only acquired the interest under which she claims in 1882, long after the letters patent to Fonseca were issued; but her husband, Frederick O. Mercer, in and from the month of June, 1876, until the month of November, 1880, as to part, and until the month of October, 1882, as to other part, was possessed of whatever claim or possession or right of possession Logan ever had in those parts of lots D and E, which are now claimed by the relator. Her claim rests upon three deeds, the first of which is dated the 8th November, 1880, executed by the relator\u2019s husband, whereby he purported to convey to one Charles H. Pattison parts of lots D and E in block 14, described as follows:\u2014\nFirst, commencing at the north-west corner of lot D, at the intersection of Main and Fonseca streets, thence easterly along the northern boundary of said lot D 132 feet, thence southerly and at right angles to the northerly boundary of said lot D 92 feet, thence westerly and parrallel with the northerly boundary of said lot D 132 feet, more or less, to Main street; thence along the westerly boundary of said lot D 92 feet to the place of beginning; and,\nSecondly, commencing at a point on the southern boundary of Fonseca street at the distance of 198 feet easterly from the north-west corner of lot D, thence easterly and along the northerly boundary of lot E 132 feet, more or less, to Austin street; thence southerly along the easterly boundary of said lot E 92 feet, thence westerly and parallel with the northerly boundary of lot E 132 feet; thence northerly 92 feet to the place of beginning.\nThis description left on lots D and E still unaffected by this deed 35 feet on lot D, measured on Fonseca street, at the eastern extremity of lot D, by 92 feet back at right angles with Fonseca street, and 35 feet on lot E, measured on Fonseca street, at the western extremity of that lot by 92 feet back. The second deed is dated the 31st January, 1882, whereby Pattison purported to convey to the relator the pieces of land above described in the deed of the 8th November, 1880, and the third is dated the 9th of October, 1882, whereby Frederick O. Mercer purported to convey to his wife, the relator in the present proceeding, that portion of lot D having a frontage on Fonseca street of 35 feet by 92 feet back at right angles with Fonseca street, not included in the deed of the 8th November, 1880, leaving thus 35 feet on Fonseca street by 92 feet back at the western extremity of lot E still unaffected. Now, Frederick C. Mercer, who was the only person who had any claim as derived from Logan in the land now claimed by his wife, the relator in the present case, never made any claim for letters patent to be granted to him, nor has any reason been given or suggested why he did not if he supposed that he had any. For all that appears, he may have known that Logan\u2019s possession consisted merely in his having squatted, as it is called, without any authority or color of right, and subsequently to the 15th July, 1870. He may, for all that appears, have had knowledge of the publication of the notice of the 21st March, 1873, and have thereby or otherwise known that he could not substantiate any right to have letters patent issued to him in virtue of any possession derived from Logan; but, however this may be, the fact remains that he never made any claim or application for letters patent to be granted to him. If he had any claim he had it from the moment of his getting his deeds in June, 1876. Yet he never asserted it, and he does not appear to have been prevented from doing so by Fonseca, who, so far as appears, may have been utterly ignorant of his having obtained any interest derived from Logan, and in point of fact it is now clear beyond question that he never had any claim, the recognition of which is sanctioned and directed by the Manitoba act, 33 Vic. ch. 3, as amended by 38 Vic. ch. 62, to be recognized. Nor does the evidence afford any reason for concluding that he ever believed or supposed that he had any such or any claim to have letters patent issued granting the land in question to him.\nNow as to Fonseca\u2019s application, that it was made in assertion of the existence of a right under the Manitoba act as amended there can be no doubt, neither do I think there can be any doubt that it was entertained as such, or that the letters patent issued to Fonseca were issued in recognition of such right, although not to the actual extent which, in the case of country lots away from towns, was then the practice. At this time the Government was in the habit, in recognition of claims under the act, of making grants to persons who, prior to the 15th July, 1870, were in peaceable possession of lands in country places which constituted parts of lots ns subsequently surveyed by the Government, back to the extent of what was called the two mile limit, and Fonseca and others similarly situated with him upon the lot 244 made their applications founded upon a knowledge of this practice. Now that Fonseca\u2019s claim was recognized by the Minister of Justice (whose office it appears to have been to pronounce first upon the validity of the claim) as being valid under the act, appears from a reference to the opinion of the Deputy Minister of Justice upon that point in a memorandum signed by the then Surveyor General, in February, 1879. The Department of Justice, and not that of the Surveyor General, or any other department, would seem to be the department to pronounce upon the validity of the claim, and this is what the Department of Justice appears to have done in the case of Fonseca, submitting to the Department of the Interior a question as to the quantum of the demand. The memorandum of the Surveyor General contains what appear to be some strange mistakes as to some matters of fact, and some opinions upon questions of law seemingly at variance with the view taken by the Department of Justice, and the expression of which opinions cannot, I think, be appealed to or adopted to the prejudice of the defendants. In that memorandum he says:\u2014\nIn the matter of the claim preferred by Mr. W. G. Fonseca for a grant to him under the Manitoba act of a certain portion of Point Douglas common, the undersigned has the honor to report that the Deputy Minister of Justice has, on the evidence submitted to him, approved the recognition of the claim, but gives the opinion that the extent of land to be granted is a matter for the decision of the Right Honourable the Minister of this department.\nIn common with others making similar claims, Mr. Fonseca applies for the full depth of the \u201cinner two mile\u201d belt remaining in rear of the Neil McDonald property, and a width throughout often chains from the outline of the river lot next adjoining to the westward.\nIt is to be observed that the Point Douglas common lot was not surveyed either by the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, or subsequently by the Dominion Lands.\nUnder these circumstances the possession of Mr. Fonseca under the Manitoba Act could not be affirmed to include any greater extent than his own actual enclosures, and did not therefore carry with it the occupation of any definite one of a system of lots.\nIf, therefore, anything beyond the ground actually enclosed by him be granted to Mr. Fonseca, such concession will be purely an act of grace on the part of the Minister; and in view of the relatively great value of the land in question, the undersigned is of the opinion that Mr. Fonseca would be most liberally treated were he given such an additional area to that actually occupied as would make the whole 25 acres. As it will be advisable in public interest to recognise the private surveys which have been registered in the registry office at Winnipeg, subdividing certain portions of the common into building lots and laying out streets thereon; and furthermore, that already action has been taken upon them by the department in giving patents to individuals who bought building lots from the trustees for the Point holders; therefore, it would be well that the grant to Mr. Fonseca should be described to conform to the outline of certain streets to include certain blocks so laid out, and in doing this it may be necessary to depart slightly in defect or in excess from the area of 25 acres above specified.\nIt should be borne in mind in estimating the consideration that Mr. Fonseca would so receive, that it is but comparatively lately that he has preferred a claim on the present basis; that he had with others, for a long time, advanced an antagonistic claim to this same piece of ground as one of the original Point holders, and therefore necessarily has himself to a certain extent weakened the force of the claim for consideration which he now advances. The information in this office is not yet sufficiently detailed and complete to enable the undersigned to know what parts of the common covered by this claim have already been disposed of to other parties, either by Fonseca acting for himself alone and receiving the equivalent therefor or by the trustees for the Point holders. In the latter case a proportionate additional extent in the rear would require to be added to make up for any such land sold for which Fonseca received no equivalent.\nThe allegation that the Point Douglas common had not been surveyed either by the Hudson Bay Company or the Dominion Government appears to be quite erroneous, as appears by the report of the Minister of the Interior, adopted in Council in May, 1877, where the common is referred to as being called lot 244 in the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company\u2019s survey and registry book, and the Dominion survey is referred to in the letters patent to Fonseca as of record in that branch of the Department of the Interior, known as the Dominion Lands Office, where the lot is designated as No. 35 on a plan signed by John Stoughten Dennis, Surveyor General of Dominion Lands, and dated 1st January, 1875. The allegation upon which the Surveyor General rested his opinion that Fonseca had no claim under the Manitoba act for any more than his actual homestead enclosure, and that if anything beyond that should be given to him, it should be a mere act of grace on the part of the Minister, being erroneous, the opinion based upon such material cannot be entitled to much consideration, and the opinion of the Minister of Justice may, I think, be allowed to prevail, namely, that Fonseca\u2019s claim was valid and should be recognized, but that it was for the Minister of the Interior to determine the quantity of land to be granted in recognition of it. So, likewise, not much weight can be attached to the opinion that the claim by Fonseca and co-trustees reported on by a former Minister of the Interior, in May, 1877, was so antagonistic to Fonseca\u2019s claim for a grant to himself under the Manitoba act that his claim under the act was weakened thereby. Weakened it might be, without being reduced to the condition of a mere petition for the exercise of the grace and favor of the Minister. However, the Surveyor General does not appear to me to have appreciated accurately the object of the parties to the trust deed. Their intention was to sell the town lots as surveyed by the trustees in 1870; and as to the residue their object, as testified by Dr. Schultz, was to obtain a grant, in order that the parties interested might be in a position to apportion the land among themselves in an equitable manner, according to their knowledge of the proportion that should be allotted to each. When the Government refused to recognize the application of the trustees, as they did by the order in council of May, 1877, by which, at the same time, they reserved the rights of all persons having exclusive claims under the Manitoba act, it was natural that Fonseca and such others as were similarly situated should have made the applications they did; and their having made the former application cannot in fairness be said to prejudice their rights under the act. The Surveyor General, however, appears to have touched the material point when he suggested that to recognize the practice as to what was called \u201cthe inner two mile\u201d belt as applicable to a case affecting property in the town of Winnipeg, where it was very valuable, would be unreasonable, and it may be admitted that the 25 acres as suggested by him as sufficient would be to the full as liberal as, if not more so than, a grant in a country lot up to the two mile belt would be. The quantity suggested may have been very liberal but it was no less a grant in recognition of Fonseca\u2019s claim under the act; and so, indeed, it is in most express terms shown to be in the letters patent, where the Government speaks as of record in well considered language. That Fonseca\u2019s grant, then, was in recognition of a claim valid under the act cannot, in my opinion, admit now of question.\nThe Surveyor General\u2019s memorandum, however, shows that when he was not expressing a legal opinion he knew thoroughly what he was about, and what his suggestion was as to the position of the land to make up the 25 acres he has not left in obscurity. The land to be granted was plainly to be adjoining to the homestead enclosure\u2014it was to cover all the land now in question. It was to comprehend all the land surveyed into town lots by the trustees, except such as they had sold, or any, if any there was, that Fonseca had himself sold on his own account and received the benefit, which, it may be observed, he could only have done as a person in actual possession under circumstances recognized by the act, and it may be further observed that no trespasser could substantiate a claim against a claim valid under the act. He had before him the plan as registered by the trustees as well as the plan of the Government official survey of the town lots, He had also the abstracts of all deeds on the registry including those under which the relator\u2019s husband had, whatever title he ever had; with these documents his department, under his supervision, if not he himself personally, inserts in Fonseca\u2019s grant these four lots C, D, E and F.\nAfter the letters patent issued it appeared, however, that some few of the lots sold by the trustees were, by mistake, included in the grant. This mistake Fonseca immediately pointed out, and had rectified, he confirming the purchasers\u2019 titles and receiving other lots from the Government. It was contended that Fonseca in a letter addressed by him in October, 1878, to Mr. Dennis, the then Surveyor General, had admitted Logan\u2019s claim to lots 0, D and E. The force of the argument founded on this letter I have not been able to see. It would seem to have been urged in the nature of an estoppel against his now denying it, but there is no question here of estoppel, and notwithstanding anything in that letter it appears conclusively, by abundant evidence, that in point of fact Logan had not the title which Fonseca in that letter attributed to him, nor any title. There appears to be no doubt that Fonseca was trying to serve Logan, who was his brother-in-law. If the Government, upon the strength of Fonseca\u2019s letter, had withheld the lots C, D and E from Fonseca\u2019s grant he could not have complained, although, perhaps, others who had an interest in the common could; but the Government having included these lots in his patent, and Logan not having had any title to the lots, as now appears beyond all question, I do not see how Fonseca, having said in that letter that Logan had a title to those lots, when in truth he had not, and Fonseca was mistaken upon that point, can affect the letters patent with the infirmity of having been granted in error or improvidently and in ignorance of a right which did not exist. In so far, then, as this letter is concerned, it seems to me, instead of being prejudicial to Fonseca in the present case, to remove all possibility of any deceit or concealment of facts to the prejudice either of the public or of any individual, or malpractice of any kind being imputed to him.\nNow, as to Gray\u2019s case: he claims under a deed executed by a Mr. Belch, dated the 2nd August, 1881, or a year and seven months after the letters patent to Fonseca were issued. At the time of Gray\u2019s purchase there were no improvements on the piece in question. Belch, with full knowledge of the imperfection of his claim, refused to give anything but a quit claim deed, and Gray, with like knowledge it may be presumed, was content with such a deed. When Gray proceeded to make improvements on the lot he was expressly forbidden to do so by Fonseca, claiming under his letters patent, so that whatever improvements Gray made he made them at his own peril with full notice of Fonseca\u2019s title. This Mr. Belch, from whom Gray purchased, obtained a deed from one Freeman, under whom he claimed, upon the 13th of August, 1877. Freeman had never made any claim for letters patent to be issued granting the land to him, and for all that appears he may have well known that he had no claim whatever for such grant. Mr. Belch, however, at the time of his purchase and for some time previously, but for how long does not appear, was a clerk in that branch of the Department of the Interior known as the Dominion Lands Office, at Winnipeg. He, at least, must be held to have had full knowledge that no clerk in the Lands\u2019 Office could be permitted to traffic in doubtful land claims, squatters\u2019 claims, &c. He must be charged with knowledge of the circulation of notices, such as that of the 21st March, 1873. He must have known that squatters\u2019 claims upon the land in question would not be recognized by the departments having charge of the duty of issuing letters patent therefor, and that, in fact, none but claims under the Manitoba act could be entertained. He never made application for letters patent until the month of July, 1879, and when he did he based his claim on the Manitoba act, well knowing, doubtless, that this was the only way by which he could get it to be recognized. He succeeded in procuring Fonseca to support his application. Fonseca could not truly say and, in point of fact, did not say in his declaration, that Logan, from whom Belch traced the origin of his title, had been in occupation on the 15th July, 1870, but, willing to assist Belch, he did say that he was in occupation in 1870, and he added that he knew of no claim adverse except one of his own, as to which he said:\u2014\nWhich I release and forego as to the said portions of lots.\nFonseca\u2019s declaration, in fact, upon its face, would convey to the experienced mind that Logan\u2019s possession had not existed on the 15th July, for if he had been then in possession his claim would have been valid under the act, and Fonseca would have had no claim to release and forego; this could not well have escaped the notice of the Government officials having to deal with the application, who appeared to be the Minister of Justice, the Surveyor General and the Minister of the Interior, and that it did not escape them may fairly be concluded, I think, from a letter produced from the Surveyor General\u2019s Department in July, 1881, to Mr. Belch\u2019s solicitors, when his application was then renewed under circumstances which shall shortly appear. In that letter Mr. Belch\u2019s solicitors are informed that the Surveyor General regrets:\u2014\nThat looking through the evidences they fail to establish any title, under the Manitoba act, on the part of Mr. Belch\u2019s assignors. And after pointing out the defect in Fonseca\u2019s declaration the letter concludes:\u2014\nUnder the circumstances that the evidences filed, where they are to the point, are informal and that, when they are in proper form, they are either not to the point, or clash with each other\u2014I could not, consistently with my duty, report the case to the Minister as one in fit shape for decision as to the right of the claimants. 1\nThe defect alluded to has never since been and never could be removed, for it related to the want of proof that Logan had possession on the 15th July, 1870, so as to establish a claim under the Manitoba act, which in a passage in the letter is referred to \u201c as the all important point.\u201d\nNow, I do not think it can be doubted that the Surveyor-General had come to the same conclusion in 1879, when the selection of the lots for Fonseca\u2019s patent was proceeding in his department, under his supervision. And here it may be observed that the Surveyor General, to whom chiefly any mistake or improvidence in the matter, if there has been any, is imputed, and who could have testified clearly upon this point, and who could also, perhaps, if pressed, have said that he never could have sanctioned or recognized a traffic in land claims of this nature by a clerk in his department, was not called; so that in fact, as to this point, we are asked on behalf of the Government to render a solemn judgment declaring these letters patent to have been issued in error and improvidently, not upon the production of the best evidence to establish the charge of error and improvidence, namely, that of the officer of the land department upon whom devolved the duty of selecting the lots to be mentioned in the letters patent but we are asked, in the absence of his evidence, to impute to the officer and his department the error and improvidence necessary to be established by the informant (upon whom the whole burthen of proving the error and improvidence rests) in order to justify our judgment.\nIn the case of Mercer against these defendants and the Attorney-General Mr. Dennis, who had been Surveyor General part of the time that Fonseca\u2019s application was before the Government, was examined as a witness, and he being dead his evidence then given was read in the present case, and is before us. As to it I may say that it is clear to my mind it must be read as having relation to the claim then made before the court, namely, that Logan had a claim which was valid under the Manitoba act, as a person who had been in actual possession peaceably on the 15th July, 1870 as to which Mr. Dennis repeatedly says that if such a claim had been presented, and was true, then the letters patent to Fonseca were issued in error. The mass of his evidence has little bearing in the present case, but in the view which I take there is a portion of it which has a very important bearing. He says that it was the duty of a Mr. Lang (then an officer of the department), in connection with the Surveyor General, to classify and to look into all claims; that when he (Col. Dennis) was Deputy Minister he would not go into details himself, that they would be entered into by Lang and the Surveyor General; that Lang was sent up to Manitoba to investigate all claims, and that he thought that after his return he (Lang) at Mr. Dennis\u2019s instance, made out a list of the lots that should go to Fonseca, Sutherland, Schultz, and so on, parties whose rights were to be commuted. Again, that Mr. Lang was the person with whom he had most intercourse; that his (Lang\u2019s) duty was to ascertain what lots the Government were in a position to grant. In that case Lang\u2019s evidence also was taken, but this is not brought before us except in so far as some questions were put to Mr. Dennis on cross-examination in relation to it. For example, this passage occurs: The examining counsel says:\u2014\nI am reading now from Mr. Lang\u2019s examination:\u2014\nFonseca never asked me to select any particular lots. Col. Dennis gave me instructions as to selecting.\nThen he goes on to say:\nWas Col. Dennis personally acquainted with the holdings on the Point Douglas common? Yes; Col. Dennis told me he was. I think I got instructions to draw the references for patents from Col. Dennis. I had no written instructions. I was also directed to select an area of land as near to the land actually in occupation of Fonseca as possible, not including any land sold by Fonseca or the Point Douglas trustees to make up the quantity to be granted to Fonseca.\nThis portion of Lang\u2019s examination haying been read to Col. Dennis, and he having been asked if what Lang had there stated was correct, replied in effect it was\u2014his exact answer was, \u201c precisely so.\u201d Then he says that both he and Mr. Lash, who was then Deputy Minister of Justice, spent until two or three o\u2019clock in the morning for weeks together, weighing and considering all the different claims, and that before letters patent issued the Department of Justice had to approve the fiat. Col. Dennis does not appear to have been asked any questions about Belch\u2019s claim; in his examination the whole inquiry was as to Logan\u2019s claim, which was alleged to be prior to the 15th July, 1870, but which in that case was disproved. Now, there is a point to which I desire to draw particular notice in this connection, and it is one which I can only conceive to have arisen by reason of the relator having had, as I think she must have had, the control of the conduct of the case upon behalf of the informant. It is this; this Mr. Lang, who appears to have had such important duties to discharge, and to have known so much in relation to the lands in question and to the including them in Fonseca\u2019s patent, appears to have been examined in the former case of Mercer against these defendants and the Attorney General, and to have been able to give very important evidence in the matters now under discussion, and judging from the above extract from his examination read to Col. Dennis seems to have given very important evidence. He seems to have been in a most favorable position to supply evidence as to points in relation to which the present Deputy Minister of the Interior says he cannot find what he calls \u201c a record \u201d in the department. Notice of intention to read Lang\u2019s evidence as well as Col. Dennis\u2019s (Lang having since his former examination left the country as is believed), was served on the defendants, yet Lang\u2019s evidence has not been read by or on behalf of the Attorney General, although from a report made by him upon Logan\u2019s claim, when made in 1882, and which does appear to be in possession of the department if it cannot be said to be \u201con record,\u201d the following extract is supplied:\u2014\nMemo.\u2014Re claim of Wm. Logan to part of lot 35, St. John.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,\nOTTAWA, 13th September, 1883.\nThe laud referred to herein was patented to W. G. Fonseca as part of his claim under the Manitoba Act on the 3rd December, 1879. It was known in the department at the time that there were others who had squatted upon the land patented to Fonseca, but Fonseca\u2019s claim was considered to be the one which should prevail over all the others.\n(Signed,) R. LANG.\nThere is just one other point which I cannot refrain from referring to. The Deputy Minister of the Interior has said in his evidence that by a record in his department it appears that Belch\u2019s application was received in the Department of the Interior on the 30th July, 1879, and that on the 13th August, 1879, it was transmitted to the Inspector of Surveys at Winnipeg, to be dealt with in the usual course which was to make a report upon the claim, and he said that it was not received back until the 18th June, 1881. No evidence of any kind was offered as to what was done with the papers at Winnipeg, or how they come to have been put away where they were said to have been found. If Mr. Belch was, in August, 1879, still in the Winnipeg Lands Office he could probably have thrown some light upon the subject. Neither was any evidence given as to who found them, or how them came to be found. The only information on the subject is contained in a telegram received in Ottawa the 13th June, 1881, from Winnipeg, from a Mr. E. M. Wood, who was not called as a witness to give any information upon the subject. The telegram is addressed to Lindsay Russell (who was Surveyor General), and is as follows:\u2014\nRe Belch.\u2014Point Douglas common papers found accidentally here in Land Office today. Will forward.\nE. M. WOOD.\nNow Mr. Lang, to whom, as would seem from Col. Dennis\u2019 evidence, the papers were most probably given to report upon in pursuance of the duty imposed on him, if he had been consulted upon the point could probably have given a satisfactory explanation. So, no doubt, could Mr. Lindsay Russell, for from a letter addressed to him, dated the 19th July, 1881, as well as from the letter addressed from his department to Mr. Belch\u2019s solicitors shortly previously, I think it very probable that in addition to explaining that he had in 1879 found that the claim could not be entertained he could have added a most excellent reason why the papers should have been relegated to, and suffered to remain in, the pigeon-holes of the department at Winnipeg, where they are said but not proved to have been found accidently, namely, that the public interests forbid the possibility of the department recognising the improper traffic by a clerk in the department in land speculations of the character of the one under consideration. The following is the material part of Mr. Belch\u2019s letter of the 19th July, 1881, and this was before he executed the deed of quit claim in favor of Gray:\nDOMINION LANDS,\nBIRTLE, MAN., July 19th, 1881.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014On my return from Winnipeg in February last I wrote you a note in which, I think, I stated I had reached that point on my return to resume my official work at Birtle, not having, however, succeeded in the business object of my visit to Winnipeg, which was principally to dispose of certain property on Point Douglas common I purchased from one John Freeman.\nAfter the transaction was closed I discovered the chain of title was imperfect, having no responsible beginning, William Logan and wife having conveyed without first obtaining title from the crown. I then made application by myself and wife to the department for these lots, together with another property on McWilliam street where my family reside. This application was made by Messrs. Aikins & Monkman, barristers, on 23rd July, 1879, and by them forwarded to Ottawa. \u201e The papers were duly received at the H. O. and returned to the office in Winnipeg, in order that they might be dealt with in the ordinary way.\nMr. Whitcher acknowledged the receipt of them. In the letter register it is noted that the papers were handed to Mr. Lang, but such is not the fact, as they were found accidentally on the 11th ultimo, stored in an out of-the-way place in the vault upstairs in the Winnipeg office. In consequence of the state of things I have described, is it unreasonable for me to ask the department to interfere to make my title marketable ? What is required is a quit claim deed from Fonseca and one from Schultz. * * * *\nIn the meantime I have sold the Point Douglas property for a little over $3,000.00 and make title clear. Will the Department help me to do so?\n(Signed) A. J. BELCH.\nUpon this letter it is to be observed that Gray\u2019s claim is, in fact, made on behalf of Belch, and in order to try and get his title made good which was known to the department not only to be defective in respect of its origin derived from Logan, but as an improper traffic by a clerk of the department in squatters\u2019 titles It appears, moreover, that there is a record in this department that Mr. Lang was instructed to investigate this claim. Mr. Belch, for a very insufficient reason, asserts this record to be false. It certainly is a very unfortunate state of things if the records of the department are not only imperfect in not being preserved so as to be produced when required to show that the officials of a time past were not guilty of error and improvidence in the discharge of their duties, but also that those which are preserved cannot be relied upon as correct.\nThese imputations only serve to show the greater importance of Mr. Lang\u2019s evidence being produced by the informant, upon whom the whole burthen rests in this case. It is not improbable that he may have made a verbal report in this case, as he appears by Col. Dennis\u2019 evidence to have done in other cases; or that he relegated the papers, not, perhaps, without Belch\u2019s knowledge, to the place where they are suggested to have been accidentally found because it was clear that the claim could not be entertained. If Lang had, as it now appears he had, these papers to report on, and if he had investigated it as directed (and that he did not do so cannot be assumed), then it is clear that Lang, whose duty it was, in conjunction with the Surveyor General, to select the lots to be inserted in Fonseca\u2019s patent, had the fullest information on the subject, and cannot be assumed to have been guilty of error or improvidence in inserting in it the land now claimed on behalf of Belch through the intervention of Gray.\nNow, I think it is free from doubt that a judgment avoiding letters patent upon an information of this nature can only be justified and supported upon the same grounds being established in evidence as would be necessary to be established if the proceeding were by scire facias, namely, either 1st, for the misrecitals in the letters patent ([8]), or 2, for false suggestions or misinformation by which the Queen has been deceived (1); or\n3. Where there has been granted more than lawfully might be ([9]); or\n4. When the grant may be to the prejudice of the commonwealth, or to the general injury of the public ([10]); or\n5. Where the same thing has been granted to others. All of these grounds are comprehended under the terms fraud, error and improvidence. In the present case there is no suggestion of fraud; as to error, there is none in point of law suggested.\nWhat is the distinction between \u201c error \u201d and \u201c improvidence \u201d it is difficult to say with preciseness. That these letters patent were granted in error and improvidently, and in ignorance of the right of others, is what the information alleges as the grounds upon which the letters patent are sought to be avoided by a judicial decision. If the letters patent were granted \u201cimprovidently\u201d they may, in a certain sense, be said to have been granted \u201cin error,\u201d but not in the same sense as where the same thing has been granted to other persons, or where more has been granted than lawfully might be. The term \u201c improvidence,\u201d in so far as it is distinguishable from \u201cerror,\u201d as applied to letters patent which are sought to be avoided and set aside as issued \u201cimprovidently,\u201d seems to me to apply to cases coming within the 4th of the above grounds in the enumeration of the grounds of objection open in a proceeding by scire facias by the crown to revoke letters patent, namely, where the grant has been made to the prejudice of the commonwealth or to the general injury of the public, with this superaded\u2014or of any individual having any rights in the thing granted which are injuriously affected by the letters patent. It is difficult to define affirmatively all the acts or defaults that will constitute \u201cimprovidence\u201d in the issuing of letters patent granting land so as to justify the avoidance of the letters patent. It is easier to say what will not, and even to attempt to do that, so as to include all cases, would be difficult. It is sufficient for us to consider only the acts and defaults which are suggested by the information as existing in the present case; and first, I think we must regard Fonseca\u2019s right to the lands granted as having been recognized by the Government as good and valid under the Manitoba act, and that the lands granted to him were so granted in recognition of that right; and this being so, I think it follows as a proper, if not a necessary, conclusion that those letters patent cannot be assailed by the Government that issued them in recognition of such a valid and statutory right as having been issued in error or improvidently as to any of the land thereby granted, except upon the ground that some other person had a better title\u2014that is to say, one which was also valid under the act, and superior to that of the patentee. It is upon this ground alone, as it appears to me, that adjudication in support of the prayer of the information would be justifiable.\nSecondly,\u2014When lands have been granted upon which an intruder and trespasser having no color of right in law has entered and was in possession, of whose possession the Government officials, upon whom rests the duty of executing and issuing letters patent and of investigating, and passing their judgment upon, the claims therefor, were ignorant, or when such intruder and trespasser has not, nor has any person as claiming under him, made application for letters patent to be issued granting any part of the land to him or her; or, when the possession of the intruder and trespasser, or some person under him or her, was known to such officials, and the intruder and trespasser, or some person claiming under him or her has made application for a grant of some part of the land upon which the trespasser had so intruded and entered, and not withstanding letters patent have been issued granting the land so applied for to another, without any express determination of the officials refusing the application of the intruder and trespasser, or of the person claiming under him or her, or without any record having been made of the application having been made and rejected; the letters patent which have been issued granting the land to another cannot, at the instance of the Government, be judicially pronounced to have been issued in error or improvidently in any of the above instances, or because the officials did not make an express decision refusing the application of the trespasser or of the person claiming under him. For the determination of the present case it is sufficient, in my opinion, to say that the burden of proving by clear testimony, of an unquestionable character, that the letters, patent, as regards the lots in question, were granted in error and improvidently rested wholly upon the Attorney General, and that for the reasons already herein-above indicated such evidence has not been given.\nFrom the evidence which has been given sufficient, I think, appears to show that Lang\u2019s evidence, which, although taken in the case of Mercer, the present relator, against these defendants, was suppressed in the present case, and the evidence of the Surveyor General and of the material upon which the Department of Justice proceeded when the Minister signed the fiat for the letters, patent to issue, were most material, and should have been produced and given if the prayer of the information could have been thereby supported, before a court of justice would be justified in adjudicating that letters patent, in which is recorded the declaration that the claim of the patentee, to the lands granted under the Manitoba act had been duly investigated, and that he had been found entitled thereto, were issued in error and improvidently. Such a declaration manifested by matter of record cannot be so easily avoided. It is impossible that the letters patent in the present case should be adjudged to be avoided as issued in error and improvidently upon the suggestion, eight or ten years afterwards, that in one of the departments of the Government whose duty it was to take part in investigating and determining upon the validity of the claim of the patentee to the lands granted, and of issuing letters patent to him if his claim should be recognised as valid, there is said to be no \u201crecord\u201d showing that the officials, upon whose authority the letters patent were issued, had given due consideration to all the matters which should have been considered by them. The charge of error and improvidence must be proved, and clearly proved, by positive affirmative evidence; notwithstanding the statement that the records of the Department of the Interior are defective, inasmuch as they do not show what was done in respect of Logan\u2019s, possession, or of that of those claiming under him, sufficient does, I think, appear to show that the officials who authorised the issue of the letters patent to Fonseca had knowledge of the character of Logan\u2019s possession and of that of those claiming under him, and that it was only that of squatters, without any legal right\u2014and that they had knowledge also of the fact that neither Logan nor any person claiming under him had made any application for letters patent in assertion of such possession, and that the letters patent to Fonseca were authorized to be issued for the lands therein intentionally and deliberately, and with the intent of treating such possession as not having attached to it any right whatever to recognition, or entitling Logan or any person claiming under him to be maintained in such possession. There is, therefore, enough to show that the letters patent were not issued in error or improvidently.\nIn so far as the claim of Gray is concerned, representing as he does simply that of Belch, it would be a public scandal if these letters patent should be avoided in the interest and for the benefit of a clerk in the Lands Department who had speculated in squatters\u2019 claims. As to Mrs. Mercer, the Government has it in its power to indemnify her equally as it would have had to indemnify Fonseca if the letters patent to him had been avoided in the interest and for the benefit of Mrs. Mercer.\nFor the reasons given I think the appeal must be allowed with costs, and the information be dismissed in the court below with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I am not disposed to quarrel with the conclusion arrived at by the other members of the court, though I cannot take credit for having assisted in reaching it.\nThe reasoning of the present learned Chief Justice of Manitoba on which the judgment proceeded seems to me to be correct, and the judgment of the late Chief Justice to be influenced by what I think a somewhat erroneous reading of the clause E.S.C. ch. 54 sec. 57, which reading appears to overlook the word \u201c improvidence \u201d and to give it no effect in the operation of the clause. Instruments may, under that clause, be adjudged void if issued through fraud, error, or improvidence. Fraud needs no definition. Error exists when something not intended is done, as if a patent were issued for Blackacre when Whiteacre was meant to be granted, or where, as in Stevens v. Cook ([11]), land to which one person is entitled is by inadvertence granted to another. It would be only consonant with sound principles of construction to understand \u201c improvidence \u201d to denote something which is not necessarily covered by the terms fraud or error, as if a patent is ordered to be issued without facts being present to the minds of those w ho deal with the matter which, if known and considered, might have affected the decision to advise the making of the grant. This is the force given to the term by Esten V.C. and Spragge V.-C. in the cases cited to us of Attorney General v. McNulty ([12]) and Attorney-General v. Contois ([13]).\nThe assertion here is that conflicting claims existed and were traceable by documents in the department, but that they were not considered or adjudicated upon.\nIn ordinary affairs it may be, and is, often proper to treat one as knowing what he has the means of knowing or what he is proved to have once known. But that is not a rule of universal application. In the well known case of Raphael v. The Bank of England ([14]) the bank was held to have taken a bill without notice of the invalidity of the title of a previous holder, notwithstanding that a formal notice of the facts invalidating the title had been given to the bank a year before. I do not understand the question before us to be a question of title. The grant might, even if the present patent were avoided, be again made to Fonseca, but whether made to him or to any one claiming under Logan or Belch, it would still be made by the grace of the crown and not necessarily as a recognition of any legal title. The determination is for the department and is not appealable to this court. On the question of improvidence, considered apart from fraud and error, it is not our duty, as I apprehend, to form a definite opinion as to the relative strength of opposing claims.\nIn this case I entertain no doubt of the admissibility of the evidence of Col. Dennis given in the action of Mercer v. Fonseca, and the conclusion to be drawn from his evidence and that of Mr. Burgess seems plainly to be that the parts of lots C, D, E, and F now in question would not have been included in the patent to Fonseca without further inquiry, and possibly would not have been granted to him if the conflicting claims had been present for consideration.\nFor these general reasons I should have been inclined to hold that the patent was issued by improvidence as far as those lands are concerned, and should, to that extent, be declared void.\nMy opinion would, of course, have assumed that there were really conflicting claims for consideration, and claims which, whether sustainable or not, were advanced in good faith and were not entirely frivolous.\nIt is not quite clear that the claims in respect of which the Attorney-General has allowed this information to be filed in his name are of that character, or, if they were, that they can properly be said to have been overlooked; and under the circumstances I do not apprehend that the decision now arrived at involves, in strictness, a construction of the statute different from that given to the cognate statute in the Upper Canada cases which have been cited.\nI do not say that the opinions expressed in those cases will not bear reconsideration. The true, effect of the statute may be found to be a question open for discussion in some case where the facts are more distinct.\nWith this explanation of my views I do not dissent from the judgment of the court allowing the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: McDonald, Tupper & Phippin\nSolicitors for respondent: Patterson & Baker.\n[1] 5 Man.

The active partner had authority, by power of attorney, to sign his partners\u2019 names to all deeds and conveyances necessary for carrying, on the business but had no express authority to endorse cheques.\nHeld, that having authority to effect the loan and receive the amount in cash he could endorse his partners\u2019 names on the cheque, and the drawee had a right to assume that he did it for partnership purposes and were justified in paying it on such endorsement.\nHeld also, that if the payment by the drawees was not warranted the drawers having, for two years after, received monthly statements of their account with the drawees, and given receipts acknowledging the correctness of the same, they must be held to have acquiesced in the payment.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Manitoba, affirming the judgment at the trial for the defendant. The action was to recover from the defendants the amount of an unpaid balance of plaintiffs\u2019 deposit in the bank. The issue tried was whether or not a cheque for the amount of such balance had been properly paid by the bank.\nThe cheque was drawn by the plaintiffs in 1882, under the following circumstances: Three persons named Ross, Kennedy and McMillan, were engaged in the business of buying and selling lands on speculation in Manitoba. Ross was the active man in the business, and he held a power of attorney from the others authorizing him to sign their names to all deeds and conveyances necessary for carrying on the business. In the course of one transaction Ross acquired certain mortgages on land which he had sold and needing money he assigned these mortgages to the plaintiffs, signing the necessary transfers for his associates under the power of attorney. The amount of the loan was paid to Ross by the plaintiffs\u2019 cheque drawn payable to the order of Ross, Kennedy and McMillan, and Ross endorsed this cheque in his own name and in the names of his associates as their attorney and received the money from the defendants\u2019 bank. This cheque represented the balance claimed in the action.\nThe plaintiffs brought an action against Ross, Kennedy and McMillan on the covenants in the mortgages assigned to them as security for the loan, and this action was successfully defended by McMillan on the ground that Ross had no authority to execute the assignment for him, the power of attorney not covering the case of borrowing money. The present action was then brought against the bank and the defendants succeeded in the court below on the ground that McMillan was shown to have got the benefit of the money and the cheque was, therefore, properly paid. The plaintiffs appealed. Ewart Q.C. for the appellants. If Ross, Kennedy and McMillan were partners the partnership was of a special nature and not governed by general partnership rules. The acts of Ross, therefore, would not bind the other partners. Morrison v. Earls ([1]); Walker on Banking ([2]); Saderquist v. Ontario Bank ([3]).\nLand partners have no power to borrow on behalf of the firm. Dickinson v. Valpy ([4]); Ricketts v. Bennett ([5]); Barmester v Norris ([6]).\nThe endorsement of all the payees was necessary to justify the bank in paying the cheque. See Carrick v. Vickery ([7]); Innes v. Stephenson ([8]); Stone v. Marsh ([9]).\nChristopher Robinson Q.C. for the respondents referred to Brandon v. Scott ([10]); Charles v. Blackwell ([11]); Smith v. Johnson ([12]).\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that the cheque in this case was properly paid by the bank.\nThe payment was a good payment inasmuch as the cheque was properly endorsed by Ross in the name of McMillan. There was, undoubtedly, a partnership for the purpose of land speculations between Ross, Kennedy and McMillan; the land mortgaged to the appellants was part of the stock-in trade of that partnership. When a partnership is entered into for the purpose of buying and selling lands it is well established that, in equity, the lands acquired for the purpose of being so dealt with are, by the doctrine of conversion, considered as personalty (13), just as much personalty as goods forming the stock-in- trade of a mercantile partnership are, and being so can, in equity, be dealt with by one partner just as freely as one partner in a commercial partnership can deal with goods forming the stock of the firm for partnership purposes. Then Ross could assign, and did assign, a good equitable title to the mortgages transferred to the plaintiffs, irrespective of the power of attorney altogether, and he had a perfect right to do so, and a right to receive payment in cash and apply the cash to the purposes of the partnership business or liabilities. It is true he could only confer an equitable title (irrespective of the power of attorney) but aside altogether from the power of attorney he could confer an equitable title which a court of equity would compel the other partners to clothe with the legal estate.\nThen, having a right to receive cash, and having taken instead a cheque payable to the partners, he had a perfect right to use his partners\u2019 names in endorsing that cheque, and the bank having a right to assume he did it for partnership purposes was justified in paying the cheque on that endorsement.\nWe all agree in this last ground, and Mr. Justice Patterson will state the reasons for it more fully in a written judgment which I have read and in which I concur.\nThis is a question with which the appellants have really nothing to do. They gave a cheque on their bankers, and this cheque the bank accepted, and there ended all right to dispute the payment so far as the appellants are concerned. So soon as the bank engaged to pay the cheque their contract with the appellants as depositors was performed, and a new contract with the persons entitled to receive payment, and with which the appellants had nothing to do, sprung into existence. If this latter contract has not been properly performed by the bank, in consequence of payment to a person not entitled to receive it, the proper person to sue for such breach of contract is McMillan, the person said to be prejudiced by payment to Ross.\nLastly, at all events the appellants must be held to be estopped by their acquiescence in the bank account as entered in their pass-book, and by their monthly receipts. The position of the bank has been changed since the payment. Assuming it to have been a bad payment, of which the appellants could have taken advantage if they had complained promptly, yet they are now too late to do so after Ross, from whom the bank might have reclaimed the funds, has become insolvent.\nFor these reasons the appeal must, in my opinion be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am also of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. That the only person who could maintain an action is McMillan seems to me perfectly plain. Certainly the mortgage company could have no action on the facts of the case as presented to us.\nI concur also in the opinion expressed as to Laches. The company received monthly statements from the bank after payment of this cheque and gave receipts acknowledging their correctness. They cannot recede from that now when Ross is insolvent and the position of the bank is changed.\nI agree with the remarks of my brother Patterson as to the authority of Ross to indorse the cheque.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Mr. McMillan admits in his evidence that the whole management of the speculation in which he and Ross and W. N. Kennedy were jointly interested was confided to Ross, who had authority to sell the lands which were the subject of the speculation in such parcels and upon such terms as he should think fit, and that the whole financial administration of the speculation was confided to him. As part of the financial administration confided to him he had to make arrangements to meet from $75,000 to $80,000 balance of purchase money of the lands placed in his hands for sale. The better to enable him to dispose of the property a power of attorney was executed by McMillan to him whereby he was authorised, as McMillan\u2019s attorney and in his name, to grant, sell, convey, transfer and mortgage all and singular (the lands jointly purchased) and for this purpose to sign, seal, execute and deliver the necessary deeds, papers, writings and conveyances, either in parcels or in block, and upon such terms and conditions as to the said Ross might seem meet, and, for that purpose, McMillan gave and granted to him full and absolute power and authority to do, perform and execute all and every such acts, deeds, matters and things as might be requisite and necessary, or expedient to be done in and about the premises as he, the said McMillan, if personally present and acting in the premises, could do. If, in order to execute these powers effectually, it should be necessary to effect a loan upon the security of a mortgage of any part of the joint estate it was competent for Ross to execute such mortgage in the name of McMillan, and of the necessity for effecting the loan and executing the mortgage Ross was made by McMillan sole judge. So, likewise, Ross had power to sign in McMillan\u2019s name, and for McMillan, all necessary receipts for the money and, in fact, to do in McMillan\u2019s name and for McMillan, every act, matter, and thing necessary for the completion of the loan transaction. There can, I think, be no doubt that he had power to effect the loan which he did effect with the plaintiffs upon the assignment to them of the mortgage which had been executed to the three, Ross, McMillan and W. N. Kennedy, by a purchaser of a portion of the joint estate to secure the purchase money, and also to receive the money advanced by the plaintiffs upon such security, and as necessary to the completion of that transaction to endorse in McMillan\u2019s name the cheque given by the plaintiffs as the mode adopted by them of advancing the money lent upon the security of the mortgage assigned to them by way of mortgage. McMillan, indeed, admits that if the money was applied by Ross for the purpose of the joint speculation he has nothing to complain of, and that it was so applied Ross swears and both courts below have found, as matter of fact, it was. But whether it was, or not, is no concern of the present plaintiffs or defendants. In order, however, to so apply it it was necessary that Ross should receive it and the only question, here is whether in order to receive it he had authority to endorse the cheque made in favor of himself, W. N. Kennedy and McMillan in McMillan\u2019s name, and I am of opinion, for the above reasons, that he had, and that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I am satisfied, notwithstanding the learned and able argument of Mr. E wart for the plaintiffs, that we ought not to disturb the judgment appealed from.\nThe matter seems to me very simple. McMillan, Kennedy and Ross engaged in joint speculations in the purchase and sale of lands, the entire financial management being left with Ross, as McMillan very clearly explains in his evidence. They were co-partners to all intents and purposes, Ross being the managing partner. The position is exactly described in the passage in Lindley on partnership to which we were referred ([13]);\nIf persons who are not partners agree to share the profit and loss or the profits of one particular transation or adventure, they become partners as to that transaction or adventure, but not as to anything else. In all such cases as these, the rights and liabilities of the partners are governed by the same principles as those which apply to ordinary partnerships; but such rights and liabilities are necessarily less extensive than those of persons who have entered into less limited contracts. The extent to which persons can be considered as partners depends entirely on the agreement into which they have entered and upon their conduct.\nMcMillan gave Ross a power of attorney to grant, sell, convey transfer and mortgage all his lands, tenements, right, title and estate, in and to certain specified lots of land, with certain general powers, but it is a mistake to say, as the plaintiffs do in their factum, that Ross\u2019s authority was limited by the terms of that instrument. He required, no doubt, to resort to it for authority to execute deeds in the name of McMillan, just as in ordinary partnership, but the power to buy and manage lands for the three partners, and to do all things incident to the prosecution of the joint enterprise, did not depend on the power of attorney. Debts were incurred by the partners and Ross was depended upon to find money to pay them. He may have received from sales of lands much more than enough for the purpose, and may have been blamable, as between himself and his partners, for raising money in any other way. That was, however, a matter between him and his partners. The present dispute arises from his having borrowed money from the plaintiffs\u2019 company by pledging certain mortgages which he had taken for the purchase money of lands sold to one J. H. Kennedy\u2014not the partner who is called Col. Kennedy. His legal power to assign these mortgages is questioned. I am not disposed to regard the objection as serious, but I think it is outside of the matter with which we are concerned. The plaintiffs, in fact, got the mortgages and gave their cheque on the defendants for the amount of the loan. They might as well have paid the cash and no question of the right of Ross to receive it could have been seriously raised. It is laid down in Story on Agency ([14]), that an authority to sell lands for cash includes the authority to receive the purchase money. In section 59 the author says:\u2014\nUpon the same ground an agent who is employed to procure a note or bill to be discounted may, unless expressly restricted, endorse it in the name of his employee, and bind him by the endorsement, for he may well be deemed as incidentally clothed with this authority as a means of effectuating the discount.\nNothing so serious as binding one\u2019s principal by the contract of endorsement is involved in what Ross did when he endorsed the\u2019 cheque for McMillan for the purpose merely of negotiating it. The distinction between endorsing for one purpose and the other is explained in Denton v. Peters (2) and other cases.\nIn Grant on Banking (3) there is this exposition of the rule:\nAn agent, though unauthorized to draw or endorse cheques in the name of his principal, can, nevertheless, bind his principal by doing so, provided the drawing and indorsing of cheques is incidental to the business he is deputed to transact, and provided the party dealing with him has no notice of want of authority.\nAmong the cases cited for this proposition is Edmunds v. Bushell (4) the head note of which reads as follows:\nA employed B to manage his business and to carry it on in the name of B & Co. The drawing and accepting of bills of exchange was incidental to the carrying on of such a business, but it was stipulated between them that B should not draw or accept bills. B having accepted a bill in the name of B & Co., Held, that A was liable on the bill in the hands of an endorsee who took it without any knowledge of A and B or the business.\nWe may also note the rule as expressed in Chalmers on Bills ([15]), that\nan authority to sign bills on behalf of another may be either express (verbal or written) or implied from circumstances.\nHaving here the character of the business in which Ross, McMillan and Kennedy were engaged as explained by McMillan; the unlimited power confided to Ross to manage it for the joint adventures; the uncontrolled discretion committed to him, which McMillan clearly informs us of; the fact that what Ross was doing was raising money on assets of the concern by pledging them to the lenders; and the fact that the cheque was merely an order to the bank to pay what the plaintiffs might themselves have paid in cash; having regard also to the express power to \u201c mortgage,\u201d which, though we do not require to pronounce upon its effect as bearing on the title to the securities acquired by the plaintiffs, yet implies authority to pledge assets of McMillan in security for debts, a general authority not in terms restricted to securing unpaid purchase money, but as wide as the discretion reposed in Ross for the conduct of the adventure; I do not see any reason to hesitate in holding that he could properly endorse the cheque, as he did, in the name of McMillan, for the purpose of procuring the cash upon it, and that the payment of it was a good discharge to the defendants as against the plaintiffs.\nUpon this ground I am of opinion that the appellants must fail in their appeal, and I do not enter upon the other matters discussed before us. I do not examine, as the appellants invite us to do, the details bearing on the question of what Ross did with the money. It would require a very clear demonstration of the incorrectness of the conclusion of the court below upon that question of fact to warrant us in disturbing it, and I form no opinion respecting it.\nNor do I discuss other questions which have been debated. One of them is whether, assuming that the endorsement was invalid and that Ross mis-applied the money, any action at law would lie against the defendants after they had paid the money to two of the three persons jointly entitled to it, and, in case an action would lie, it would not be at the suit of McMillan only, and not of the plaintiffs. Another question is the effect of the acquiesence of the plaintiffs by the confirmation of the statements of account rendered them from time to time by the defendants.\nBut while I do not discuss these questions I agree with the opinions expressed upon them by my brothers Strong and Taschereau.\nI am of opinion that we should dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for Appellants: Richards, Brophy & Brad Shaw.\nSolicitors for respondents: Perdue & Robinson\n[1] 5 O.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nMarine insurance\u2014Total loss\u2014Evidence\u2014Right to recover for partial loss.\nA vessel insured for a voyage from Newfoundland to Cape Breton went ashore on October 30th at a place where there were no habitations, and the master had to travel several miles to communicate with the owners. On Nov. 2nd a tug came to the place where the vessel was, the master of which, after examining the situation, refused to try and get her off the rocks. On Nov. 16th one of the owners and the captain went to the vessel and caused a survey to be had and the following day the vessel was sold for a small amount, the purchaser eventually stripping her and taking out the sails and rigging. No notice of abandonment was given to the underwriters and the owners brought an action on the policy claiming a total loss. The only evidence of loss given at the trial was that of the captain who related what the tug had done and swore that, in his opinion, the vessel was too high on the rocks to be got off. The jury found, in answer to questions submitted, that the vessel was a total wreck in the position she was in and that a notice of abandonment would not have benefitted the underwriters. On appeal from a judgment refusing to set aside a verdict for the plaintiff and order a nonsuit or new trial.\nHeld, per Ritchie C. J. and Strong J., that there was evidence to justify the trial judge in leaving to the jury the question whether or not the vessel was a total loss, and the finding of the jury that she was a total loss, being one which reasonable men might have arrived at it should not be disturbed.\nPer Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ., that the vessel having been stranded only, and there being no satisfactory proof that she could not have been rescued and repaired, the owners could not claim a total loss. Held, Gwynne J. dissenting, that there being evidence of some loss under the policy, and the owner being entitled, in his action for a total loss, to recover damages for a partial loss, a non-suit could not be entered, but there should be a new trial unless the parties agreed on a reference to ascertain the amount of such damages.\nPer Gwynne J.\u2014That the plaintiff could not recover damages for a partial loss of which he offered no evidence at the trial but rested his claim wholly upon a total loss.\nHeld, per Strong J.\u2014An appeal court exercises different functions in dealing with a case tried by a judge without a jury from those exercised in jury cases. In the former case, the court has the same jurisdiction over the facts as the trial judge, and can deal with them as it chooses. In the latter, the court cannot be substituted for the jury to whom the parties have agreed to assign the facts for decision.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick refusing to set aside a verdict for the plaintiff and order a non-suit or new trial.\nThe facts of the case are fully set out hereafter in the judgment of Mr. Justice Strong.\nC. A. Palmer for the appellants.\nBarker Q.C. for the respondents.\nIn June, 1890, the court proceeded to deliver judgment but no decision was pronounced as Mr. Justice Patterson wished to satisfy himself that the plaintiff could recover for a partial loss under the pleadings and the case stood over until October.\n(June 12th, 1890.)\nSir W. J. Ritchie C.J.\u2014Two questions were discussed in this case. First, was there evidence of a total loss? Secondly, as to the preliminary proofs?\nI think there was evidence to justify the learned judge in leaving the question to the jury whether the vessel was an actual total loss or not in these words:\nWas this vessel when she was thrown upon the beach as described in the evidence, in your opinion, a complete wreck, that is, had she ceased to be a ship for any useful purpose or not?\nIn answer to this question the jury stated: We find that the vessel was a total loss from the position in which we consider she was in.\nI read these words to mean that the vessel was a complete wreck\u2014 a total loss\u2014as she lay upon the shore, and therefore, no notice of abandonment was, in my opinion, necessary. The evidence of the captain fully justifies this conclusion[1].\nIt is clear from this evidence that if the tug could have taken her off she would have done so, and, therefore, I think the jury were quite justified in finding that in the position she then was she was a total loss.\nThis finding of the jury shows that the ship, in the position in which she was, was physically irreparable and, therefore, she was an actual loss to the owner. In this case the jury must be taken to have found that there was no chance of the recovery of the vessel; that there was a total loss of the subject matter insured; that the vessel had become a wreck, and from the position she was in she was a mere congeries of planks, and, in the language of the Court of Exchequer in Roux v Salvador[2].\nShe was placed by reason of the perils of the seas, against which the underwriter insured the vessel, in such a position that it was wholly out of the power of the insured or of the underwriter to procure its arrival, and he is bound by the letter of his contract to pay the sum insured.\nThis case is cited in Cossman v. West[3].\nThere having been sufficient evidence to justify the learned judge in so leaving that question to the jury I think their verdict should not be disturbed, more especially as the loss appears to have been, unquestionably, a bon\u00e2 fide loss. I am, therefore, less disposed to interfere with this finding.\nAs to the preliminary proof, the learned Chief Justice in the court below says: The defendants could not possibly be prejudiced by the variance between the preliminary proof of interest and the proof on the trial,\nand I should be very sorry to defeat a just and honest claim by an objection so purely technical, and which in no way whatever touches the merits of the case. I think the appeal should be dismissed.\n(Nov. 10th 1890.)\nWhen the matter was formerly before the court my brother Strong was of my opinion that the appeal should be dismissed, but my brother Gwynne thought that a non-suit should be entered, and it has now become necessary to determine what form our judgment should take. I think a non-suit would be against the law laid down in New Brunswick decisions. I have looked into this point, and find that the courts of New Brunswick, on several occasions, have determined that where an action was brought for a constructive total loss, which has not been established for want of notice of abandonment, that it is not proper to non-suit, but that there should be a verdict at all events for nominal damages, or, as it was determined in one case, that there should be a new trial or a verdict for nominal damages.\nIn Millidge v. Stymest[4], the plaintiff claimed for a constructive total loss but the evidence showed a partial loss only the vessel having been repaired, but no evidence having been given of the cost of the repairs the plaintiff was non-suited. It was distinctly held that the non-suit was wrong, and that plaintiff was entitled to nominal damages at all events. So in the case of Wood v Stymest[5], the plaintiff sought to recover for a total loss without giving notice of abandonment, which the court thought necessary; no evidence of damages on a partial loss was given, and it was very obvious could not be given as it would go against the party seeking to recover for a total loss. On motion to enter a non-suit the court refused to make the rule absolute, but ordered a new trial unless the plaintiff should consent to have the damages reduced to one shilling, or unless both parties should agree to refer the estimate of liability on a partial loss to some competent person for adjudication. The case before us is in precisely the same condition.\nI therefore think that in this case there should be a new trial ordered unless the parties agree to refer the matter to a competent accountant to take evidence of the amount of damages as on a partial loss, and then a verdict should be entered for that amount.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This was an action on a policy of insurance, dated 2nd November, 1883, and underwritten by the appellants, effected sometime previously to the date in the name of the respondent for the sum of $600 on the schooner \"Betsey\" lost or not lost at and on a voyage from St. John's, Newfoundland, to coal ports in Cape Breton and return. The vessel was valued on the policy at $4,000. The policy contained a clause in these words, \"and in case of loss such loss to be paid within thirty days after proof of loss and proof of interest in said schooner,\" and also a clause \"that no partial loss or particular average should be paid unless amounting to 5 per cent.\"\nThe vessel sailed from St. John's on the 27th October, 1883, and went ashore on Wing and Point Beach inside of Gruion Island, about five miles from Gabarus, Cape Breton, on the morning of the 30th October. The crew having got ashore the captain went in search of a settlement, the spot at which the vessel was beached being on a wild shore with no houses nearer than Gabarus. The captain not being able to find houses or settlement had to return to the vessel, but found her pounding so badly that he could not get aboard and had to remain in the woods all night.\nThe next morning, the 31st, a man came down to them from a place called Firchete and told the crew where they were, and this man guided the master to Gabarus from whence, finding no telegraph there, he went on to Louisbourg, twenty miles further, and from thence telegraphed the owners, Messrs. S. March & Sons of St. John's, Newfoundland, informing them of the loss and received an answer telling him that the vessel was only half insured and directing him to use his best endeavors to get her off, and referring him to Messrs. Archibald & Co. of Sydney, Cape Breton, for assistance. Thereupon the master telegraphed Messrs. Archibald & Co. who the next day sent their tug \"The Merrimac\" to the wreck. The master also returned there. The master of the tug having arrived at the wreck and examined the situation of the vessel declined to attempt to pull her off, considering it useless to do so as from her position he considered that the tug could not have hauled her off. Nickerson the master of the schooner in his evidence gives the following account of what occurred on this occasion and of the situation of the vessel. He says:\u2014\nThe tug came around and would not take hold of the schooner. The captain of the tug said he could do nothing to the vessel as she was too high up. She was at that time so high up that at high water it would only come half way up half her length. It was Archibald's tug \"Merrimac,\" a large tug. Don't know her tonnage or power. Refused to take hold.\nThen in answer to the question:\nFrom nautical knowledge and experience could the tug in your opinion have pulled the vessel off? Answer\u2014I don't think she could. She was too far up, was not water enough to float her. The ground she was on was no objection to pulling her off, but she was too high and dry. Went to Sydney and telegraphed the owners that the tug could not get the vessel off and that they had better come on themselves. No more correspondence until Levi March came on himself. The very last time I saw her was last fall (September) I saw her ribs sticking up out of the sand. The last time before that about a fortnight after I went to Sydney, say about middle of November, 1883, she was pretty well used up then by pounding on the shoals. Her keel was twisted badly; her treenails were sticking out of her; the oakum sticking out of her seams and a hole was through her bottom; her rudder traces were broken and the wheel was broken.* * * No chance of getting the vessel off. Heavy waves, barren country, no roads, swamps, etc. No heavy woods within 15 or 20 miles, the vessel never was off the beach.\nThen in cross examination the witness says:\nIf on the 1st or 2nd November I had had ways etc., she could not have been launched. The time of year and weather could not be depended upon. I took the carpenter down I think to try and launch the vessel. The tug did not take hold of her. If there was any chance of getting the vessel off, the tug could have taken hold of her. * * * *\nQuestion.\u2014How much more in your opinion were the hull and materials of the schooner \"Betsey\" worth on the 2nd of November than they were at the time of sale?\nAnswer.\u2014I don't consider she was worth a great deal to any one after she struck.* * * The only effort I made to get the vessel off was having tug come round.* * When I left hull in tug boat she was pretty badly strained.\nThe master returned to Sydney taking with him the crew with the exception of the mate whom he left in charge of the vessel.\nAbout a fortnight after this Mr. Levi March came over from Newfoundland and he, together with Nickerson, Mr. Ross, who described himself as Surveyor for Lloyd's agent, and Gordon the master of the tug \"Merrimac,\" went to Gabarus and from thence to the wreck which was found to have suffered much additional damage since the captain had been last there. Nickerson in his deposition says that at this time the vessel was in the state detailed by him in the extract before given from the evidence. A survey was then held by Mr. Ross and Gordon the captain of the tug who made the following report:\u2014\nWe the undersigned Alexander C. Ross, of North Sydney C.B. agent and Surveyor Lloyd's agent at North Sydney aforesaid, and James W. Gordon, master of the steam tug \"Merrimac,\" having been called upon by George Nickerson, master of the schooner \"Betsey\" 79 tons register of St. John's Newfoundland, to hold a survey upon the said vessel do hereby certify that on the day of the date hereof we proceeded together to the said vessel and after careful examination and survey report as follows:\u2014We found the said vessel up on Wing and Point Beach inside of Guion Island near Gabarus, Cape Breton, but within reach of the sea at high water, and considering the dangerous and exposed condition of the said vessel on a barren coast several miles from any habitation, the lateness of the season, and the impracticability of procuring the necessary material and assistance for launching and floating the said vessel, we therefore condemn the said vessel and order her to be sold as she lies for the benefit of all whom it may concern.\nGiven under our hand at North Sydney, Cape Breton, this 2nd day of November 1883.\n(Signed). ALEX. C. ROSS,\nSurveyor for Lloyd's agent.\nJ. W. GORDON, Master Steamer\n\"Merrimac,\"\nThe date of this document is clearly erroneous; instead of the 2nd of November, the date should have been the 14th or 15th of that month.\nThis document was proved by Nickerson on his examination and its admissibility in evidence does not appear to have been objected to, either then or subsequently when it was read at the trial.\nUpon this the vessel was sold at auction on the 17th November, at Gabarus, for the sum of $400, the net proceeds of sale, after deduction of expenses, being $376, as appears from the account sales put in as an exhibit, and this amount being further diminished by the deduction of $150, the amount of the Messrs. March expenditure for the survey, protest, tug service and telegrams, left $226 to be distributed between the two sets of underwriters and the owners as self-assurers for the amount not covered by the policies, the proportion attributable to the appellants being some $33.90.\nThe purchaser did not attempt to get the vessel off, but stripped her, taking out rigging and sails, and in this condition left her on the beach, where Nickerson says he saw her remains in September, 1884, when \"her ribs were sticking out of the sand.\"\nMr. Justice Fraser, who tried the case, refused to grant a motion for a non-suit but reserved leave to move in term, holding that there was evidence of an actual total loss and that the proofs of loss and interest furnished to the appellants were sufficient, and he left the case to the jury who, upon the question of actual loss, found for the respondent for $625.53, and in answer to a question put by the learned judge the jury said:\nWe find the vessel was a total loss from the position in which we considered she was in.\nThe declaration, as amended under an order of a judge in chambers, averred interest in the owners S. March & Sons, a firm composed of Nathaniel March, Stephen R. March, and Levi March, as broker for whom the policy sued on had been effected by the plaintiff, and the interest so alleged was proved at the trial. It was, however, objected that the proofs of loss furnished to the defendants preliminary to the action, and as required by the policy, did not show the interest as thus alleged and proved.\nA motion to enter a non-suit or for a new trial having subsequently been made in term a rule nisi was granted which was, after argument, discharged, Mr. Justice King and Mr. Justice Tuck being dissentients from the judgment of the court, and from that decision the present appeal has been brought.\nThe only substantial questions which we are called upon to decide in order to determine this appeal are whether there was evidence to leave to the jury of an actual, as distinguished from a constructive, total loss; and if so, whether the verdict ought to be set aside as being against the weight of evidence. No notice of abandonment was given and, therefore, the respondent is entirely precluded from recovering as for a constructive total loss.\nA majority of the learned judges in the court below were of opinion that there was evidence proper for the consideration of the jury, and that Mr. Justice Fraser was right in leaving the question of an actual total loss to them. The learned Chief Justice, however, thought that although there was some evidence fit for the consideration of the jury yet it was weak and hardly satisfactory; but Mr. Justice Wetmore and Mr. Justice Fraser considered it amply sufficient to warrant the verdict.\nIt is a fact not without legitimate influence in the case, and therefore one not to be disregarded, that the claim in the present case is beyond all doubt or question a perfectly honest and legitimate one. The vessel was valued in the policy at $4000, and besides the $600 covered by the policy sued upon in the present action there was no insurance on the interest of Messrs. S. March & Sons except a policy for \u00a3275 ($1100) underwritten by private insurers in Newfoundland.\nThe case must depend then altogether on the evidence of Nickerson, the captain of the schooner. This witness was unfortunately not examined before the court and jury, but his deposition taken by consent before an examiner was read at the trial.\nCases of high and unimpeachable authority have established that to constitute a total loss in the case of a ship the subject of insurance must be either such an entire wreck as to be reduced, as it is said, to a mere \"congeries of planks,\" or if it still subsists in specie it must, as a result of perils insured against, be placed in such a situation that it is totally out of the power of the owner or the underwriter at any labor, and by means of any expenditure, to get it afloat and cause it to be repaired and used again as a ship. The latter branch of the foregoing proposition is deducible from the following cases, viz. Cambridge v. Anderlon[6]; Roux v. Salvador[7]; Rankin v. Potter[8]; Barker v. Janson[9] and Cossman v West[10]. In Roux v. Salvadore (2) Lord Abinger says:\u2014\nIf in the progress of the voyage the thing insured becomes totally destroyed or annihilated, or if it be placed by the perils insured against in such a position that it is totally out of the power of the assured or the underwriter to procure its arrival, the latter is bound by the very terms of his contract to pay the whole sum assured.\nAnd in Rankin v. Potter (3) Mr. Justice Blackburn in advising the house says:\u2014\nThe decision of the Exchequer Chamber in Roux v. Salvador (2) was, as far as I can learn, received with general approbation. There was, however, one exception; Lord Campbell never could be brought to think it right. In the case of Fleming v. Smith[11], the counsel for the appellants, the Attorney General Jarvis and Sir F. Thesiger, argued, as I think logically from the decision in Roux v. Salvador (2), that notice of abandonment could not be in any case required except where there was something which could be done by the underwriters in consequence, and then the failure to give notice of abandonment might be material as determining the election which the assured had, whether to treat the loss as total or not. This, as I have already stated, is what I consider to be the law.\nIn the same case of Rankin v. Potter (3), the rule thus propounded by Mr. Justice Blackburn was accepted as a correct statement of the law and, so far as it was applicable to the circumstances of that case, acted upon by the House of Lords. In the case of Anchor Marine Insurance Company v. Keith[12], this court recognised and acted upon this view of the law and, adhering to what I said in the last named case, I am of opinion that it must now be considered a governing principle of the law of marine insurance and that the case of Knight v. Faith[13], Lord Campbell's opinion in Fleming v. Smith[14], and the case of Kaltenbach v. Mackenzie[15] (unless, indeed, the latter case is to be distinguished upon its particular facts) are so inconsistent with the case of Rankin v. Potter[16] as to be of no authority.\nThat this rule is well founded appears very plain when we consider the object and purpose for which notice of abandonment is required as a preliminary condition to the right to claim for a constructive total loss. The reason for requiring such notice is not, as explained by the authorities already quoted, that the underwriters may thereby be subrogated to the rights of the assured in so much of the subject as still remains in specie; the law alone, without any notice, effects such a subrogation upon payment of the loss.\nThe notice is required in order that the underwriters may have an option of doing that which the assured by the act of abandonment has announced his intention not to do, viz., an opportunity of reclaiming and rescuing the insured property and (in the case of a ship) repairing it, and reinstating it in its original condition. Then it is manifest that if such restoration is a physical impossibility the reason for requiring notice is inapplicable, and the assured who fails to give it does not, in legal contemplation, by his omission, cause prejudice to the underwriters.\nThe cardinal point for determination in the present case is therefore this: Was there any evidence which the judge could properly have submitted to the jury to show that the schooner could not, by means of the tug, or by the use of other appliances within reach, have been got off the shore on which she had been beached? It is important to emphasize that the question we have to consider, in so much of the appeal as relates to entering a nonsuit, is not whether the proposition of fact just stated is established to our own satisfaction, but solely whether there was evidence of it proper for the consideration of the jury.\nAnd as regards that part of the rule which asks for a new trial on the weight of evidence it is to be remarked that although issues of facts are now in some jurisdictions tried by a judge without a jury yet the functions of a court in banc, or an appellate court, in reviewing the findings in such cases on a motion for a new trial or on appeal, differ widely from those which are properly exercised in the case of a trial by jury. In the case of Jones v. Hough[17], Lord Bramwell said:\u2014\nA great difference exists between a finding by a judge and a finding by the jury. Where the jury find the facts the court cannot be substituted for them because the parties have agreed that the facts shall be decided by a jury; but where the judge finds the facts there the court of appeal has the same jurisdiction that he has, and can find the facts whichever way they like.\nIt being the province of the court to determine if there is any evidence proper for submission to the jury, then if it is determined that there is such evidence a verdict based upon it is not, according to a late decision of the House of Lords, to be disturbed unless the court should think it such that reasonable men could not have found as the jury did. In the case referred to, Metropolitan Railway Company v. Wright[18], Lord Halsbury said:\nIf reasonable men might find (not \"ought to,\" as was said in Solomon v. Bitton),[19] the verdict which has been found, I think no court has jurisdiction to disturb a decision of fact which the law has confided to jurors, not to judges.\nThis decision of the House of Lords, though of so recent a date as 1886, has been so frequently referred to as to have become very familiar to the profession, so much so that it may seem superfluous to quote it. It appears to me, however, that in the present day, when courts and judges have so frequently to deal with facts in cases in which juries are dispensed with, that this important distinction between the widely different functions of the court in such cases, and in those in which upon a motion for a new trial its duty is limited to reviewing the verdict which the jury may have found in the exercise of its exclusive jurisdiction of finding the facts, and to annulling it if it should appear not to be such as reasonable men could, on the evidence, have found, cannot be too much dwelt upon. In the present case it may well be that if we had on this appeal to decide the question of fact we might find the evidence not satisfactory to show that it was impossible to have got the vessel off on the 2nd of November when the tug went to the scene of the wreck, but we have not here to pronounce upon any question of fact except so far as we are called upon to say: 1st. If there was any evidence of the loss of the schooner in the sense before mentioned, which the judge could submit to the jury; and 2nd. If there was, whether on that evidence reasonable men might find as the jury actually did find. Whatever opinion I might have come to if I had had to deal with the evidence absolutely as a judge of fact, I am of opinion that upon these two questions, which alone are properly before us, the conclusion of the court below was in all respects correct.\nUpon the question of non-suit I think it clear that there are to be found in the evidence of Nickerson, the master, facts stated which were properly left to the jury. We have the fact sworn to that the captain of the tug, after having been brought at considerable expense to the spot where the vessel lay, and having every inducement, so far as self-interest was concerned, to endeavor to get her off, considered it so hopeless as not to be worth while making the attempt; and that in the judgment of the witness himself, who, as a nautical expert, gives his opinion that the vessel could not have been pulled off, this conclusion of the master of the tug was entirely correct. Then there is in addition the report of the surveyors, which appears to have been before the jury having been admitted in evidence without objection so far as appears from the record before us. Further, there is the evidence of Nickerson to show that except the tug other means and appliances for the rescue of the vessel were not within reach. On the whole, it seems impossible to say that these were not proper matters for the consideration of the jury, and that in the face of such evidence the judge would have been justified in granting the motion for a non-suit.\nThen, as regards the alternative of the rule asking for a new trial, that, in my opinion, was also properly refused. It was, no doubt, open to remark that the captain of the tug was neither called nor his absence accounted for, but any presumption resulting from this is not, in my opinion, sufficient to neutralize the evidence of the facts stated by the master, and to warrant us in saying that in finding as they did the jury did not act as reasonable men. Upon this head it is also to be remembered that in the present case the value of the vessel was not covered by the insurance, and that the master, who seems to have been zealous for the interests of his owners, and to have done his best to protect them, knew this to be the fact. I am of opinion, therefore, that the verdict could not properly have been set aside as being against the weight of evidence.\nHad I thought, however, that there was no evidence of actual loss proper for the consideration of the jury I should have considered a new trial and not a nonsuit to have been the proper disposition of the case. It is quite clear that though the declaration goes for a total loss yet upon such pleading a partial loss may be recovered for. Then there was, beyond all doubt or question, evidence of some loss from perils covered by the policy having been sustained by the assured, and although the exact amount of it had not been ascertained yet it seems to me it would have been reasonable to have permitted a new trial in order to ascertain the amount, unless the defendants had, to save expense, submitted to some less costly and more simple mode of arriving at the amount as by a reference to an officer of the court or other referee. It would have seemed to me a harsh decision to have precluded the assured from recovering any indemnity whatever in respect of the policy sued on, as must be the effect of a judgment entered upon this action for the defendants.\nThere was ample evidence of proofs of loss and of the interest of the assured having been forwarded to the appellants before action brought. The fact of loss was shown by the protest. As regards the interest no technical proof of that was required and the account furnished by the assured to the appellants, of the expenses incurred in which (as is pointed out by Mr. Justice King) the underwriters were charged as debtors to \"S. March & Sons,\" would at once have been an intimation to any reasonable man that the latter firm claimed as owners, and that the insurance had been effected for their benefit.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The only question left for our determination is as to the necessity of the notice of abandonment. I am of opinion, for the reasons given by Tuck and King JJ. in the court below, that such notice was necessary, and that none having been given in this case the appeal should, on this ground, be allowed.\nI cannot see in the evidence that this ship was an actual total loss. As Arnould on Insurance[20] puts it:\nAn absolute total loss takes place when the subject insured wholly perishes, or there is a privation of it and its recovery is hopeless. A constructive total loss takes place when the subject insured is not wholly destroyed but its destruction is highly probable, or the privation of it, although not quite irretrievable, is such that its recovery is either exceedingly doubtful or too expensive to be worth the attempt.\nAnd to quote Tuck J. in the court below:\nAn absolute total loss entitles the assured to claim from the underwriter the whole amount of his subscription. A constructive total loss entitles him to make such claim, on condition of giving notice of the abandonment of all right and title to any part of the property that may still exist or may be recovered.\nIt is the duty of the assured if he means to abandon, in cases where abandonment is necessary, to give notice to the underwriters of his intention within a reasonable time after he gets intelligence of the loss.\nIf the first information is not sufficient to enable the owner to tell whether he ought to abandon or not, he may wait a reasonable time for further information as to the extent of the damage. He cannot wait an undue length of time to see which will be the more profitable for him to abandon or to claim for a partial loss. If the assured makes little or no effort to recover the property whilst it exists in specie, but lies by for weeks with knowledge of the disaster, and gives no notice of abandonment, he cannot recover for an actual total loss. The rule is that where there is anything to abandon, it must be abandoned; in case of an actual total loss, where nothing is left to abandon, there need be no abandonment, but when there is a constructive total loss it is necessary.\nIn Kaltenbach v. Mackenzie[21], Lord Justice Brett states the law thus:\nIf he (the assured) hears that the ship is stranded and her back is broken, although she retains her character as a ship, if he gets the information upon which any reasonable man must conclude that there is very imminent danger of her being lost, the moment he gets that information he must immediately give notice of abandonment.\nIf the information that he first receives is not sufficient to enable him to say whether there is immediate danger, then he has reasonable time to acquire full information as to the state and nature of the damage done to the ship. I also refer to Hilliard on Marine Insurance[22], Marshall[23] and 2 Phillips[24],\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Upon the 30th October, 1883, the insured vessel named the \"Betsey\" was cast ashore on the coast of Cape Breton, about twenty miles from the town of Louisburg, and on the 1st November her captain telegraphed from Louisburg to the owners at St. John's, Newfoundland, as follows:\u2014\nLouisburg, 1st November, 1883.\nS. March & Sons.\u2014\"Betsey\" stranded Tuesday's gale, twenty miles west of Louisburg\u2014wild shore\u2014any insurance? Telegraph instructions immediately.\nGeorge Nickerson.\nUpon the same day March & Sons telegraphed to Nickerson in reply:\n\"Betsey\" not half insured\u2014use all possible means to get her off, and dock her if necessary. Have telegraphed Archibald, our agents, North Sydney to assist you. Consult them by wire. Employ tugs if necessary.\nUpon the same day March & Sons telegraphed to Archibald as follows:\u2014\nSchooner \"Betsey\" ashore near Louisburg. Have telegraphed Captain Nickerson to wire you for advice and assistance. Vessel not half covered. Serious loss if abandoned. Make best possible arrangements. Keep us posted. Has \"Mayflower\" sailed?\nNickerson also telegraphed to Archibald as he was directed in the telegram he had received from March & Sons. Archibald sent a tug down to the vessel upon the 2nd or 3rd November. The tug did not take hold of her or make any effort to take her off the shore where she was. Nickerson said that the captain of the tug had told him why nothing was done by him to take the vessel off; this evidence was objected to, and as it was inadmissible as evidence it is unnecessary to repeat what Nickerson said that the captain of the tug said to him. Nickerson himself, however, said that he thought the vessel was too far up ashore to have been hauled down; that the ground where she was offered no impediment to pulling her off, but that he thought she was too high and dry. On the same day that the tug came down to the vessel she returned to North Sidney with captain Nickerson and all his crew except the mate of the \"Betsey\" who was left in charge of her. Nickerson said that immediately after his arrival at Sydney he telegraphed again to March & Sons, the owners of the \"Betsey,\" that the tug could not get the vessel off and that they had better come down themselves.\nWhether Archibald, the agent of March & Sons, who had been directed by the telegram of the 1st November to keep March & Sons posted in the matter, sent any communication to them by telegram or letter did not appear; however, from Nickerson's telegram from Sydney to March & Sons on the 3rd or 4th November they must, I think, be held to have had sufficient reliable information to make reasonable men conclude that the vessel was then in imminent danger of becoming lost. That she then existed in specie as a ship there can be no doubt, however perilous may have been the position in which she was. Then, therefore, was the time when, upon the authority of Kaltenbach v. McKenzie[25], it became imperative upon the owners, if ever they should claim as for a total loss, to have given immediate notice of abandonment to the underwriters. There is no suggestion that the vessel was in such a position and condition that she must have absolutely perished and disappeared before notice could be given to the underwriters, if that would have been a sufficient excuse for not having given notice of abandonment. From the information which the owners then had they had no right to keep secret in their own minds what they intended to do, namely, whether they would treat the loss as total, in which case notice of abandonment was necessary, or wait to see whether a change of circumstances might not make it more to their advantage to treat the loss as partial, thus keeping the underwriters in ignorance of the state of things and depriving them of the opportunity of doing what they might think best to be done in their interest, while the vessel was all the time left exposed to the violence of winds and waves and to increased damages and greater probability of eventual total loss. From the 3rd to the 18th November the vessel was left exposed to the violence of the winds and waves without any effort whatever being made to get her off. During this time she suffered additional damage. On the 18th, one of the owners went down to where she was and got the captain of the tug, who had gone down to her on the 2nd or 3rd of November and done nothing, and another man, to make a survey of the vessel as she then lay, and upon their report, which is not produced, sold the vessel. Nickerson says that between the time that he had left her on the 2nd or 3rd of November and his coming back with Mr. March, the owner, who went down to her on the 18th November she had sustained additional damage\u2014that he could see that she had strained and had some water in her\u2014that he did not know whose idea it was bringing Mr. Ross and the master of the tug from Sydney to hold survey\u2014that Mr. March got them to hold survey, and that the vessel was sold the same day or the next day after the survey. He said:\u2014\nThe men that held the survey, I suppose, went about to sell the vessel and she was sold the same day or next after survey.\nThe language of the Lords Justices in Kaltenbach v. McKenzie[26] is, to my mind, conclusive in the present case. Lord Justice Brett[27] says, speaking of the assured owner of a ship:\u2014\nIf he hears that the ship is stranded, and her back is broken, although she retains her character as a ship, if he gets information upon which any reasonable man must conclude that there is very imminent danger of her being lost, the moment he gets that information he must immediately give notice of abandonment. The law that has been laid down is that immediately the assured has reliable information of such damages to the subject matter of insurance as that there is imminent danger of its becoming a total loss, then he must at once, unless there is some reason to the contrary, give notice of abandonment.\nAnd again[28], he says:\u2014\nI am not prepared to say that if it could be shown that the subject matter of insurance, at the time when the assured has information upon which otherwise he would be bound to act, is in such a condition that it would absolutely perish and disappear before notice could be received or any answer returned, that that might not excuse the assured from giving notice of abandonment, but I am prepared to say that nothing short of that would excuse him; and although I do not say that what I have stated would excuse him, I am not prepared to say it would not; that is the limit to which, I think, the doctrine could be carried, and it seems to me that to go further than that would let in the danger to provide against which the doctrine of notice of abandonment was introduced into the contract and made a part of the contract.\nLord Justice Cotton[29] says: The object of notice, which is entirely different from abandonment, is, that he (the assured) may tell the underwriters at once what he has done, and not keep it secret in his mind to see if there will be a change of circumstances. There is another reason: the thing in various ways may be profitably dealt with; therefore the second reason for requiring notice of abandonment to be given to the underwriters is that they may do, if they think fit, what in their opinion is best and make the most they can out of that which is abandoned to them as the consequence of the election which the assured has come to. How then can the plaintiff say that it was not necessary in the present case to give notice of abandonment?\nAnd referring to Rankin v. Potter[30], he says:\nIt was suggested that it followed from Rankin v. Potter (1) that if the notice of abandonment was of no use to the underwriters the assured was excused from giving it, but in my opinion nothing that was said by the learned lord who moved the judgment of the House of Lords, or by any of the judges, supports that contention.\nAnd again:\nThere is nothing in the observations of Blackburn J. which can possibly be construed to mean, that where the assured has in his possession the thing insured at the time when he received notice of the facts, he then is excused from giving notice of abandonment to the underwriters. On principle, ought we to carry what was laid down in Rankin v. Potter (1), further than that case has carried it? In my opinion, no. All the grounds upon which the rule requiring notice of abandonment to be given is based apply equally in this case, even although the jury might find that in the ultimate result notice of abandonment would have produced no good result to the underwriters. The object is, as I have pointed out before, to communicate to the underwriters that decision at which the assured has arrived at the earliest possible moment, so as to render it impossible for him having formed that decision to retract it, and in order that he must not be allowed to run the chance of events, and to abstain from giving notice and afterwards excuse himself by saying; \"if I had given notice the underwriters would have got no benefit from it,\" and from the other ground on which notice is required it equally follows that it must not be left to the jury to say whether or no notice would be useful.\nThen Lord Justice Thesiger, after quoting largely from the judgments of the learned law lords in Rankin v. Potter[31], and referring to the opinion of Blackburn J. in that case given to the House of Lords, says[32]:\nIn the first place it is to be observed that the opinion of Blackburn J. delivered to the House of Lords is not a binding authority upon us, and although the opinion is very valuable for the purpose of guiding us, we have to look at the opinions of the lords and not the opinion of the judges given to the lords; but, at the same time, I think I may also say that when the whole opinion of Blackburn J. is looked at it does not justify the contention on behalf of the plaintiff, and without taking up time by reading passages from that opinion I would say that it goes no further than the opinions of the lords themselves, that where at the time that the assured receives notice of the loss, and has to exercise his election to abandon, there is no part of the subject matter of the insurance to abandon, and therefore no possibility of advantage to the underwriters if they did receive the notice, in that case the assured may be discharged from the onus which otherwise would be upon him of giving a notice of abandonment.\nNow how can it be held that the judgment in that case is not conclusive upon the present? Here, upon 3rd or 4th November, at latest, the owners of the insured vessel had reliable information that she lay ashore where she had stranded, in imminent peril of becoming a total loss, which made it their imperative duty then to elect whether they would treat the vessel as a total loss, or should regard their loss as partial only. In the former case it was absolutely necessary for them to give notice of abandonment to the underwriters in order to enable them to recover as for a total loss. The vessel was, beyond all question, then in existence as a vessel, and capable of being abandoned to the underwriters as the subject insured by them, and Kaltenbach v. MacKenzie[33] is a conclusive authority, therefore, that in the absence of notice of abandonment the assured cannot recover as for a total loss.\nIn my opinion the conduct of the assured in doing nothing whatever with the vessel for the purpose of extricating her after receiving Nickerson's telegram of the 3rd November, and in suffering her to be exposed to further damage from the violence of the winds and waves without giving notice of abandonment to the underwriters, affords abundant evidence that they did elect to regard their loss as partial, and to run all risks themselves of extricating the vessel; the conduct of the owners is not, I think, otherwise susceptible of a reasonable construction.\nIt has been contended that this case comes within the principle of the Anchor Marine Insurance Company v. Keith[34], which proceeded upon the opinion expressed by Willes J. in Barker v. Janson[35]. namely, that\nwhen a ship is so injured that it cannot sail without repairs, and cannot be taken to a port at which the necessary repairs can be executed, there is an actual total loss, for that has ceased to be a ship which never can be used for the purposes of a ship.\nIn that case it was held that a valid sale for the benefit of all concerned might be made, and no notice of abandonment would be necessary. The principle involved in such a case is, that as there was \u00e4 physical impossibility under the circumstances that the vessel ever could be used again as a ship she had ceased to be a ship, and could not be transferred to the underwriters as the thing which was the subject of insurance by them. It is unnecessary to inquire whether a ship stranded, but not otherwise damaged, and which retains her character of a ship in specie and is capable of being abandoned to the underwriters as the very thing insured by them, presents a case at all analogous to the case suggested by Willes J. in Barker v. Janson (2), which was the very case of The Anchor Marine Insurance Company v. Keith (1), for there was in the present case no evidence whatever that there was any physical impossibility in the insured vessel being put to sea again. It was suggested that from the fact of the tug having gone down on the 2nd or 3rd November, and nothing having been done, it might be inferred that it was physically impossible that anything could be done\u2014but from such a premise no such inference could be drawn. It might be that the tug had not the necessary appliances, or that the expense of getting the vessel down to sea again was thought to be greater than she was worth, or that the tug master could give no rational account of his inaction and, therefore, was not called by the plaintiff. But, in truth, the case of the plaintiff was not one to be established by any such inferences as were suggested. He had undertaken to excuse his not giving a notice of abandonment to the underwriters upon the ground that it was physically impossible to get the vessel down to sea again. If that could afford an excuse, while the thing insured remained in existence in specie the fact had to be proved by the assured by clear and conclusive testimony, and in point of fact none such was, in my opinion, offered. The plaintiff should, therefore, have been non-suited.\nFinally, it has been suggested that as there was undoubtedly a partial loss the plaintiff could not be nonsuited. This suggestion has proceeded from one of the learned judges in the court below, not from the plaintiff either in the court below or here, and it appears that at the trial the plaintiff, repudiating all idea of claiming as for a partial loss, abstained from offering any evidence in support of such a claim, and insisted wholly upon an actual total loss which he failed to prove. The appeal, therefore, in my opinion, should be allowed with costs, and judgment of non-suit be ordered to be entered in the court below.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I have had an opportunity of reading the opinion prepared by my brother Gwynne, and agreeing as I do with the views he has expressed I shall not repeat what he has said.\nThe result of that opinion is to overrule the judgment pronounced by a majority of three against two in the court below, but when I read the opinions of the learned judges who formed the majority I cannot avoid the impression that if the second discussion, which is one advantage of an appeal, had taken place in the court below there would have been at least a majority of that court in favor of a judgment of nonsuit.\nThe learned Chief Justice formed his opinion with hesitation, being pressed by the slight evidence of inability to get the vessel off the rocks, there being really no evidence of any attempt to do so and no evidence of the reason why the tug did not make the attempt, and Mr. Justice Wetmore seems to have been influenced by what I conceive to be a misapprehension of remarks of my brother Strong in Providence Washington Insurance Company v. Corbett[36]. He applies to this case, in which the vessel when surveyed and sold was in far worse condition than when the tug was there, the rule stated and illustrated in Corbett's case that the right to abandon the vessel must, under English law, be tested by the condition of the vessel at the time of action brought. But the discussion in Corbett's case was on a very different matter. It related to the case of notice of abandonment being given under circumstances that justified it\u2014as e. g. when the vessel had been captured by an enemy's cruiser but afterwards came back to the possession of the assured, as in the event of a rescue by an English frigate\u2014and the point discussed was whether under such circumstances the notice of abandonment could be insisted on. Nothing was said in that case at all inconsistent with the doctrines quoted by my brother Gwynne from the observations of the lords justices in Kaltenback v. Mackenzie[37] as to the necessity for prompt notice of abandonment.\nI agree that the plaintiff ought to have been nonsuited and that the appeal should therefore be allowed.\n(Nov. 10th, 1890.)\nOur judgment in this case upon the merits when the court formerly proceeded to deliver judgment was to enter a nonsuit, taking the view of two judges of the court below, but it was suggested in this court that a new trial would be more proper under the circumstances. I was not prepared at the time to pronounce an opinion upon that, as I wished to be quite satisfied that upon the pleadings it was competent for the plaintiff to recover for the partial loss. I am now satisfied that he has a right to do so. It was competent after evidence of partial loss, which I think there is in this case, for the plaintiff to recover for a partial loss on his claim on the record for a total loss. I therefore agree that our judgment should be for a new trial instead of entering judgment of nonsuit. I do not think it should affect the question of costs of the appeal as the judgment of the majority of the court is against the decision appealed from. If a new trial is had it should be on terms of paying the costs of the former trial.\nAppeal allowed and case remitted to court below to make rule absolute for new trial on payment of costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: C.

Held, further, that the water of a stream, &c., may be unoccupied under the ordinance even though there may be a riparian proprietor upon a part of it.\nHeld, also, Ritchie C.J. and Strong J. dissenting, that the provisions of s. 45 are merely directory but if imperative a grantee of water under the ordinance who has used the water granted to him for several years would not be required, in an action for damages caused by interference with such user, to prove that he gave the notice required by that section as it would be presumed that the same were given before recording the grant.\nHeld, per Ritchie C.J. and Strong J., that the water records in evidence were imperfect and the grant to plaintiff was not proved thereby, and having failed to prove authority from the magistrate to divert the water his riparian rights either at common law or under the ordinance were not established and the action failed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia reversing the judgment for defendants at the trial.\nThe facts of the case are fully set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nS. H. Blake Q.C. and Bodwell for the appellants.\nChristopher Robinson Q.C. for the respondents.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I do not think the plaintiff has shown that he has any riparian rights, either at common law or under any ordinance or statute of British Columbia, in the waters he now claims the right to diver ; he has no title to any of the lands over or through which the water in question flows and, therefore, could have no common law right ; nor, indeed, does he claim that he has, but rests his right to divert and use the waters in question by virtue of the authority acquired under certain sections of the ordinance for regulating the acquisition of lands in British Columbia, No. 27, passed 11th April, 1865.\nThe sections are as follows :\u2014\nWATER.\n44. Every person lawfully occupying and bon\u1ead fide cultivating lands, may divert any unoccupied water from the natural channel of any stream, lake, or river adjacent to or passing through such land, for agricultural and other purposes, upon obtaining the written authority of the Stipendiary Magistrate of the district for the purpose, and recording the same with him, after due notice, as hereinafter mentioned, specifying the name of the applicant, the quantity sought to be diverted, the place of diversion, the object thereof, and all such other particulars as such Magistrate may require.\n45. Previous to such authority being given the applicant shall post up in a conspicuous place on each person's land through which it is proposed that the water should pass, and on the District Court House, notices in writing, stating his intention to enter such land, and through and over the same to take and carry such water, specifying all particulars relating thereto, including direction, quantity, purpose and term.\n46. Priority of right to any such water privilege, in case of dispute, shall depend on priority of record.\n47. The right of entry on and through the lands of others for carrying water for any lawful purpose, upon, over, or under the said land, may be claimed and taken by any person lawfully occupying and bon\u1ead fide cultivating as aforesaid, and (previous to entry) upon paying or securing payment of compensation as aforesaid, for the waste or damage so occasioned to the person whose land may be wasted or damaged by such entry or carrying of water.\n48. In case of dispute, such compensation or any other question connected with such water privilege, entry, or carrying may be ascertained by the Stipendiary Magistrate of the district in a summary manner, at the option of either of the commanding parties, either with or without a jury of five men, to be summoned as in ordinary cases.\n49. It shall be lawful for such magistrate, by an order under his hand directed to the Sheriff or Deputy Sheriff, to summon a jury for such purpose, and in the event of non-attendance of any persons so summoned, he shall have power to impose a fine not exceeding five pounds.\n50. Water privileges for mining or other purposes, not otherwise lawfully appropriated, may be claimed, and the said water may be taken upon, under, and over any land so pre-empted or purchased as aforesaid, by obtaining a grant or license from the Stipendiary Magistrate of the District, and previous to taking the same, paying reasonable compensation for waste or damage to the person whose land may be wasted or damaged by such water privilege or carriage of water.\nNo evidence has been furnished of any written authority by the stipendiary magistrate of the district for diverting the water in question, nor any records of the same ; the only evidence we have, taken from the so-called water records, is as follows :\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE.\nWATER RECORDS.\n(Vide certified copies of originals filed.)\nNo . 22.\nJOHN MARTLEY.\nOct. 3rd, 1866.\u2014The right to the water of the creek crossed by the trail running from the 29-Mile House, Pavilion Mountain, to Captain Martley's house at the Grange Pavilion Creek.\nA.

C. of L. & W., Lillooet District.\nThere does not appear to have been any such due notice given as the ordinance requires before obtaining the written authority of the magistrate and recording the same, specifying the name of the applicant, the quantity of water sought to be diverted, the place of diversion, the object thereof, and all such other particulars as such magistrate may require. Now it is clear, by section 44, that it is only after due notice as hereinbefore mentioned, specifying the above, that the authority can be obtained and recorded, nor is there a particle of evidence to show that, under section 45, previous to such authority being given the applicant posted up., &c., the notice provided. No permission, that I can discover, is furnished by these records which, if records they are, are vague, insensible and amount simply to nothing. The granting permission, if it had been granted by the stipendiary magistrate, is a quasi judicial act. Not only must the sanction be obtained but the applicant cannot, under the terms of the ordinance, avail himself of any permission granted until recorded.\nWith reference to the jurisdiction of persons exercising judicial, or quasi judicial, functions it must be as was said in The Mayor of London v. Cox[1] by Willes J. :\u2014\nWilles J.\u2014The conclusion that the Court is inferior has a double application, first, to the construction of the plea in this case, because \" the rule for jurisdiction is that nothing shall be intended to be out of the jurisdiction of an inferior Court but that which specially appears to be so ; and, on the contrary, nothing shall be intended to be within the jurisdiction of an inferior Court but that which is so expressly alleged ;\"\nP. 262. Another distinction is, that whereas the judgment of a Superior Court unreversed is conclusive as to all relevant matters thereby decided, the judgment of an Inferior Court, involving a question of jurisdiction, is not final. If the decision be for the defendant there is nothing to estop the plaintiff from suing over again in a Superior Court, and insisting that the decision below had turned, or might have turned, upon jurisdiction. If the decision were in favour of the plaintiff it is still not conclusive, because \" the rule that in Inferior Courts and proceedings by magistrates the maxin omnia proesumuntur rite esse acta does not apply to give jurisdiction, never has been questioned ;\" Per Holroyd J., Rex v. All Saints-Southampton[2] ;The Queen v. Bolton[3]; Chew v. Holroyd[4], per Parke, B.\nIn the absence, then, of evidence of any compliance, in any particular, with the express provisions gf the ordinance, how can it be said that these indefinite and really meaningless, so-called, water records confer on any person any rights whatever in any waters of which they are not proprietors, or give a right of entry on or through the land of others for carrying the water upon, over or under such lands ? The owners of the land through which the water flows are entitled to the common law riparian rights in such waters, which includes the right of using the water for irrigating purposes, unless deprived of them by virtue of some statutory enactment interfering therewith, and subject always to the provision or reservation in said grant with reference to taking or occupying the water privileges in these words :\nProvided nevertheless that it shall be lawful for any person duly authorized in that behalf by us, our heirs, and successors to take and occupy such water privileges, and to have and enjoy such rights of carrying water over, through or under any parts of the hereditaments hereby granted as may be reasonably required for mining purposes in the vicinity of the said hereditaments, paying therefor a reasonable compensation to the aforesaid John Martley, his heirs or assigns.\nThe defendant having pleaded that the written authority of the stipendiary magistrate of the district was never obtained, and certainly the so-called water records do not, in the most remote degree, establish that it was, I am clearly of opinion that t\u00e8e plaintiff acquired no rights under the statute to the waters as claimed by him.\nIt is unnecessary to discuss the question as to the meaning and application of the term \" adjacent \" in the ordinance.\nIt is clear that Clark, as the Chief Justice says, was riparian proprietor at the commencement of this action, in the possession of rights entirely irrespective of Martley, or his agreement, or of the award ; and as respects Martley it is equally clear that Carson violently repudiated the award, etc., when, as the learned Chief Justice says, \" he wholly cut off Martley's supply.\" The evidence as to the agreement itself is set out by the Chief Justice in his judgment.\nI cannot say that the damages awarded on the counter-claim are unreasonable or based on any wrong principle. I therefore think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned Chief Justice restored.\nOn the second argument I understood Mr. Blake to assent to a reduction of the damages, but I do not remember to what amount.\nSTRONG J. was also of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Robert Carson and Joseph Eholt, not having any joint interest in the subject of litigation in this cause, united as plaintiffs in bringing an action against the defendants Martley and Clark for an alleged obstruction by them of a certain right to the flow of water to the properties of the respective plaintiffs, situate on Pavilion Mountain in the province of British Columbia, which right the plaintiffs respectively and independently each of the other claim to have by virtue of the statute law of the province. The defendants sever in their defence and each claims the existence of the right to the flow of water as claimed by the respective plaintiffs and pleads a counter claim for damages alleged to have been sustained by each severally by reason of an alleged illegal obstruction and abstraction by the plaintiffs of certain water, the uninterrupted flow of which to and through the properties of the respective defendants is claimed by each of them severally. The learned Chief Justice, before whom the action was tried without a jury, pronounced a judgment or decree in the cause, whereby it was ordered that judgment should be entered for the defendants with costs, and that judgment should be entered for the defendant Clark on his counter-claim for $500 with costs, and for the defendant Martley on his counter-claim for $200 and costs, and that the said Martley should allow to the plaintiff Carson \" out of any moneys payable to him under the judgment the sum of $100 paid as part consideration of the above agreement of the day of , 1868,\" (no agreement being mentioned in the judgment or decree). And by the said judgment or decree it was declared that the defendants are entitled to the free and uninterrupted enjoyment of the flow of the waters of Pavilion Creek in their accustomed bed in the same manner as they respectively enjoyed the same before the plaintiffs or either of them interfered with such enjoyment, and that the defendant Clark is likewise entitled to the free and uninterrupted enjoyment of the flow of the waters of Milk Ranch Creek in the same manner as he enjoyed the same before the use and enjoyment thereof by the defendant John Martley ; and it was thereby further ordered that a perpetual injunction be awarded to restrain the plaintiffs and each of them, their and each of their servants, agents or workmen, from interrupting or interfering with the flow of the waters of the said creeks or streams, or either of them, or from permitting the same to continue unrestored, and from permitting to continue on their or either of their lands any ditches, drains, or works whereby the same is or may be wholly or partially diverted or interfered with in such manner as in any wise to infringe on the rights of the defendants or either of them. This judgment is founded upon the opinion which the learned Chief Justice entertained that the land ordinance of British Columbia upon which the plaintiff rested their claim was one the benefit of which was conferred only upon riparian proprietors, and that as neither of the plaintiffs was a riparian proprietor neither of them could acquire any title to a supply of water to his property under and in virtue of the ordinance ; and further, as to the claim of Carson, that assuming the ordinance to be applicable to the case of any one but a riparian proprietor the title under which Carson claimed was for other reasons utterly defective and null and void. From this judgment the plaintiffs appealed to the full court of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and thereby prayed that the above judgment should be reversed or discharged, and that instead thereof judgment should be entered for the plaintiffs, or that a new trial should be granted. After argument of the said appeal it was ordered and adjudged by the judgment or decree of the court bearing date the twentieth day of August, 1885, that\u2014\n1. So much of the judgment of the Chief Justice as gives judgment for the defendants against the plaintiff Carson be reversed, and that in lieu thereof the plaintiff Carson do recover from the defendants jointly and severally the sum of eighteen hundred dollars together with the costs of suit, except in so far as such costs are attributable to the counter-claim of the defendants.\n2. That the defendants do recover against the plaintiff Eholt so much of their costs of action as were occasioned by reason of the said Eholt being a party plaintiff in the said action.\n3. That so much of said judgment as decreed to the defendant Martley, on his counter-claim, damages to the amount of two hundred dollars less one hundred dollars paid on agreement be reversed, and in lieu thereof that the defendant Martley do recover against the plaintiffs Carson and Eholt the sum of one dollar nominal damages together with his costs of his counter-claim against both plaintiffs.\n4. That so much of the said judgment as awards to the defendant Clark on his counter-claim, damages to the amount of five hundred dollars against the plaintiffs Carson and Eholt be reversed and in lieu thereof that the defendant Clark do recover against the plaintiffs Carson and Eholt the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars together with his costs of his counter-claim.\n5. That the defendants do recover against the plaintiff Eholt their cost of the appeal and also against the plaintiff Carson so much of their costs of the appeal as are attributable to the counter-claims of the said Martley and Clark ; and\n6. That the plaintiff Carson do recover against the defendants the costs of his appeal except in so far as they are attributable to the counter-claims of the said defendants.\nFrom this judgment the defendants have severally appealed to this court.\nBefore referring to the pleadings in the action and the matters put in issue thereby and the evidence as given in respect thereof it will be convenient, and indeed necessary, in my opinion, to a proper understanding of the rights and interests of the respective parties, to draw attention first to the condition of things in relation to the properties affected in chronological order, and to refer to several statutes of the province, in order to throw some light upon the matters in contestation on points in which the evidence, as appearing on the appeal case laid before us, seems to me to be defective in view of the magnitude of the damage alleged to have been sustained by each party and the great importance of the matters in litigation, not only as affecting the rights and interests of the respective parties to the present suit but the validity of the titles of all persons similarly situated claiming title under what are called in British Columbia \" Water Records \" or water rights granted or supposed to have been granted to them under the statute law of the province. To the plaintiff Carson an adverse decision upon the ground of defect in his title arising either from the non-applicability of the statute under which he claims to the circumstances of his case, or from the manner in which the powers conferred by the statute have been administered by the local authorities intrusted with its administration, would seem to be little short of ruinous, as rendering utterly value-less the land upon which he has settled upon the faith, as it would seem, that the statute as it has been hitherto understood and administered in the province was effectual to secure to him the benefit of the flow of water which he claims to have been granted to him, and to obtain which as absolutely necessary to the beneficial enjoyment of his land he has, as he testifies upon oath, expended upwards of $ 1,500.\nOn the 2nd of August, 1858, the Imperial statute 21 & 22 Vic. ch. 99 constituting the province of British Columbia was passed and proclamation thereof was made in the province upon the 19th November, 1858.\nBy a statute or ordinance duly passed under the provisions and authority of the above act upon the 31st of August, 1859, called the Gold Fields Act of 1859, provision was made for the regulation of gold mining in the province, and among other things for supplying watercourses for the use of persons engaged in mining to enable them beneficially to carry on their work. By this ordinance it was enacted that all persons to whom a certificate called a free miner's certificate should be given by an officer styled a Gold Commissioner should during the continuance of the certificate have the right to enter without let or hindrance upon any of the waste Crown lands not, for the time being, occupied by any other person and to mine on the land so entered upon. At this time all the land in British Columbia belonged to the Crown and gold mining was the staple industry of the province to the free and beneficial cultivation of which all other rights of property, none of which at that early stage of the existence of the province had passed out of the Crown, should be subservient. By the ordinance the Governor of the province was also authorized to grant leases of any portion of the waste lands of the Crown for mining purp\u00efses, for such term of years and upon such conditions as to rent and the mode of working, and as to any water privilege connected therewith, as the Governor should deem expedient ; and it was further enacted by the ordinance, among other things, that it should be lawful for the Governor from time to time to make rules and regulations, having the force of laws, concerning all matters relating to claims, and ditch and water privileges and leases of |he auriferous lands in the colony ; and it was further thereby enacted that all disputes relating to any ditch or water privilege, or to any contract or labour to be done in respect of a ditch or water privilege, mine or claim should be investigated by the Gold Commissioner having jurisdiction in the neighbourhood who alone without a jury should be sole judge of law and fact, subject to appeal in certain cases. Under the provisions of this act the Governor of the province did upon the 7th of April, 1859, publish certain rules and regulations whereby among other things it was provided that any person desiring any exclusive ditch or water privilege should make application to the Gold Commissioner having jurisdiction for the place where the same should be situate, stating for the guidance of the Commissioner in estimating the character of the application the name of the applicant, the proposed ditch head and the quantity of water, the proposed locality of distribution, and if such water should be for sale the price at which it was proposed to sell the same, the general nature of the work to be done and the time within which such work should be completed, and that the Gold Commissioner should enter a note of all such matters as of record so that rent should be paid for such water privilege as provided in the regulations ; that every owner of a ditch or water privilege should be bound to take all reasonable means for utilizing water granted to and taken by him and that in the case of wilful waste the Gold Commissioner, if the offence should be persisted in, might declare all rights to the water to be forfeited ; that the owner of any ditch or water privilege should be bound to supply all applicants being free miners in a fair proportion, and should not demand from one person more than from another except when the difficulty of supply is enhanced ; that no person not being a free miner should be entitled to be supplied with water at all ; and that any person desiring to carry water through or ov?r any land already occupied by any other person might be enabled to do so in proper cases with the sanction of the Gold Commissioner. By certain other rules and regulations published by the Governor, under the provision of the said Gold Fields Act of 1859, upon the 29th day of September, 1862, it was among other things provided that owners for the time being, not being the Government, of any ditch or water privilege should construct and secure the same in a proper and sufficient manner and maintain the same in good repair to the satisfaction of the Gold Commissioner ; and by a statute or ordinance of the province duly passed, under the provisions and authority of the Imperial statute, upon the 25th day of March, 1863, it was among other things enacted that where application is intended to be made for the exclusive grant of any surplus water to be taken from any creek or other locality every such applicant, in addition to all existing requirements, should affix a written notice of all the particulars of his application upon some conspicuous part of the premises to be affected by the proposed grant for not less than five days before recording the same, and that every exclu- sive grant of a ditch or water privilege in occupied or unoccupied creeks should be subject to the rights of such registered free miners as should then be working or should thereafter work in the locality from which it is proposed to take such water.\nFrom the above provisions as extracted from the Gold Fields Act and the rules and regulations made under the authority thereof, it would seem to have been contemplated that the government of the colony should or might have, or that it in fact had, ditches or watercourses dug and constructed either by the government itself wholly through Crown lands, or dug and constructed by miners under the authority and provisions of the Gold Fields Act, and which by reason of abandonment of their gold claims by the original constructors had come into the possession of the Crown for the purposes of the act. Such ditches or watercourses may, I apprehend, have been made directly by the Government Commissioner of Lands and Works independently of the Gold Commissioner, or they may have been made under contracts entered into by the Gold Commissioner under authority from the government, but however made, being constructed for the purpose of enabling free miners to acquire the use of the water running therein for mining purposes they would, so long as the Gold Fields Act should remain in force, be subject to the right of all free miners to acquire grants or leases from the Gold Commissioner under the Gold Fields Act of portions of the water running in such ditches for mining purposes notwithstanding that a portion of the land through which any such ditch or watercourse should be in part constructed should subsequently be granted to a purchaser or settler.\nNow it appears that some years prior to the month of February, 1864, but when in particular or by whom does not appear, there had been constructed wholly through the lands of the Crown across some miles of table land, situate at a high level on a certain mountain known as Pavilion Mountain, such a ditch or watercourse from a point in the bank of a certain stream called Pavilion Creek, which flowing from the east to the west descended from the mountain through a deep precipitous gorge therein into a lake below, and from thence flowed westerly through a valley at the foot of the mountain for some distance, until it fell into the Fraser River to the west of the mountain. The reasonable presumption in the absence of any evidence to the contrary appears to me to be that this ditch or watercourse had been constructed by the Provincial Government or by authority of the Gold Commissioner under the authority of the Gold Fields Act, and that it was constructed for the benefit of all free miners mining west of the Pavilion Mountain who had a right to receive grants of the use of the water running therein under the provisions of the act, and that it was dedicated to their use subject to the provisions of the act as to the Gold Commissioner granting or leasing the use of the water therein.\nIt is said that prior to the month of February, 1864, certain miners who had had the use of the water running in this ditch or watercourse for mining purposes under the act upon claims on the west end of the Pavilion Mountain had ceased to work their claims ; but all the lands of the Crown being open to free miners, any such miners might at some future time acquire a claim which for the due working thereof might require the use of the waters in the ditch. Certain miners abandoning their claims did not divest the Gold Commissioner of the right to let claims in the same locality to other miners, or deprive free miners of their right to mine in that locality ; and as such miners might require the use of the waters in this ditch as necessary for mining purposes, the watercourse itself must needs, as it appears to me, have nevertheless continued to remain under the jurisdiction of the Gold Commissioner, and dedicated to the purposes of the Gold Fields Act. In this condition of things and while the ditch remained open and water flowing in it, although it may not then have been in actual use by any free miner in the working of any claim, the Crown by letters patent bearing date 11th February, 1864, under the seal of the province, granted to the defendant Martley in fee a portion of the table land on the Pavilion Mountain by the following description :\nAll that tract or parcel of unsurveyed land in British Columbia consisting of fourteen hundred and forty statute acres of land, be the same more or less, with the appurtenances situate at or near the southeast extremity of the able land known as Pavilion Mountain and immediately above the homestead occupied by the said John Martley in the valley ; and bounded approximately as follows : On the north by the open range of Pavilion Mountain, the base of which is precipitous and well defined ; on the south by the crest of Pavilion Mountain overhanging the valley, or for greater accuracy an imaginary line between two stakes placed east and west along this southern boundary, on the east by the main creek which, coming through a deep gorge in the mountain, runs through the valley into the Fraser River, on the west by a lesser creek which, running from the mountain, falls close by the house of the aforesaid John Martley, in the said valley.\nNow, from the above description and the map laid before us it appears that although the eastern boundary of the piece granted is stated to be a creek descending from the mountain that creek where it forms a boundary of the piece granted is described as descending through a deep gorge in the mountain into the valley below, so that from this, as well as from other matters appearing in the case, it seems clear that the grantee of that piece of land never could within the bounds of the piece granted draw off any of the waters of the creek on to the piece granted for irrigation or other purposes. In order to draw water from the creek on to the above piece granted to Martley it would be necessary to take the water from a point high up in the creek a long distance above the nearest boundary of the land granted to Martley where the waters of the creek pass through the lands of the Crown. And for this reason it was that the ditch head of the ditch or watercourse before spoken of as having been constructed wholly through the lands of the Crown on the table land of the Pavilion Mountain was placed at a point in the above creek distant from about one mile and a quarter higher up the stream than the above piece granted to Martley, from whence it follows that Martley in virtue or by force of the letters patent granting to him the above piece of land acquired no right at common law or otherwise in the water running from time to time through the artificial watercourse, so as aforesaid constructed prior to his grant, and that he took the piece granted subject at least to a right subsisting in the Crown to maintain that ditch or watercourse for the public purposes for which it was constructed. In this position matters continued until the following year, 1865 ; for the fact that Martley on the 1st December, 1863, before he had acquired title to the land, mortgaged it to certain persons, who upon default being made in the payment by Martley of a sum of money thereby secured on or before the 1st day of June, 1864, were empowered by a clause in the mortgage to sell the land freed and discharged of all claim of Martley, is immaterial to the consideration of the points in discussion. It may be here observed that the piece of land spoken of in the above letters patent as the \" homestead occupied by the said John Martley in the valley\" consisted of four pre-emption claims of 160 acres each, which had been pre-empted by Martley in his own name and in that of his wife and of a son and of a daughter in 1861, the whole together forming a tract of 640 acres extending in length along the stream flowing through the valley and in depth about a quarter of a mile from the stream to the crest of the table land on the mountain overhanging the valley.\nOn the 11th day of April, 1865, there was passed a statute called the \" Land Ordinance of 1865,\" certain clauses of which headed \" Water \" are important and which as interpreted by the 3rd section of another statute or ordinance passed the 31st day of March, 1866, read as follows :\nWATER.\n44. Every person lawfully occupying and \u201c bon\u1ead fide\u201d cultivating lands may divert any unoccupied water from the natural channel of any stream, lake or river adjacent to, or passing through such land, for agricultural purposes upon obtaining the written authority of the Stipendiary Magistrate of any District, acting as Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works, for the purpose and recording the same with him after due notice as hereinafter mentioned specifying the name of the applicant, the quantity sought to be diverted, the place of diversion, the object thereof, and all such other particulars as such magistrate may require.\n45. Previous to such authority being given the applicant shall put up in a conspicuous place on each person's land through which it is proposed that the water should pass and on the District Court-house notices in writing stating his intention to enter such land and through and over the same to take and carry such water, specifying all particulars relating thereto, including direction, quantity, purpose and term.\n46. Priority of right to any such water privilege, in case of dispute shall depend on priority of records.\n47. The right of entry on and through the lands of others for carrying water for any lawful purpose upon, over or under the said land, may be claimed and taken by any person lawfully occupying and bon\u1ead fide cultivating as aforesaid and, (previous to entry) upon paying or securing payment of compensation as aforesaid for the waste or damage so occasioned to the person whose land may be wasted or damaged by such entry or carrying of water. 48. In case of dispute such compensation or any other question connected with such water privilege, entry or carrying, may be ascertained by the Stipendiary Magistrate of the District, acting as Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works, in a summary manner at the option of either of the contending parties either with or without a jury of five men to be summoned as in ordinary cases.\n50. Water privileges for mining or other purposes not otherwise lawfully appropriated may be claimed, and the said water may be taken upon, under or over any land so (as in the act) pre-empted or purchased as aforesaid by obtaining a grant or license from the Stipendiary Magistrate of the District, acting as Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works, and previous to taking the same paying reasonable compensation for waste or damage to the person whose land may be wasted or damaged by such water privilege or carriage of water.\nThe first question which arises upon this statute is : Are riparian proprietors the only persons who come within the operation of the benefits conferred by the above clauses of the act, and can they only draw off water from the streams, &c., upon which they are such riparian proprietors, or does the statute apply for the benefit of all persons requiring the use of water for agricultural or other purposes, whether they be riparian proprietors or not ? And, in my opinion, the answer must be that the act is not limited to riparian proprietors but applies equally to persons who are not such proprietors, and that a contrary construction would make the statute quite useless. Instead of contemplating an addition to the common law right of riparian proprietors to the natural flow of the waters in a stream flowing through their properties, the design of the statute was to make provision for enabling all persons requiring the use of water for agricultural or other purposes to obtain it from all neighbouring streams or lakes from which it could advantageously be brought, thus qualifying the common law right of riparian proprietors by substituting therefor those statutory rights which the conformation of the country made absolutely necessary to the bene- ficial use of by far the greater portion of the whole province consisting, as it does, chiefly of mountain ranges and elevated table lands on the mountain slopes through or near which mountain streams flow rapidly down steep descents through precipitous gorges into valleys which are in many places narrow, and where only riparian proprietors could avail themselves of any benefit from their common law right to the natural flow of running water. The provisions made by the statute do no prejudice to the riparian proprietors who can avail themselves equally with all other persons of the benefits of the act, priority of a grant, recorded under the act, of water not otherwise occupied or appropriated alone giving precedence to any one. For my part I can entertain no doubt as to the language of the act. It does not say that any riparian proprietor on any stream, &c., may draw off from the same stream as it flows through the land of some other person, the waters on any part of the waters of the stream and convey them through a ditch or channel constructed on the lands of one or more riparian proprietors to his own land for his own use ; but it plainly says that every person lawfully occupying and bon\u00e2 fide cultivating lands may divert the water of any stream, lake, or river adjacent to, or passing through, such land upon obtaining the written authority of the Stipendiary Magistrate of the District acting as Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works so to do. Then by another section it is plain the lands of more persons than one may intervene between the stream, lake or river from which the water is taken and the lands to which it is conveyed ; then another section enacts that the right of entry upon and through the lands of others for carrying water for any lawful purpose upon, over or under the said land may be claimed and taken by any person lawfully occupying and bon\u00e2 fide cultivating as aforesaid upon payment of compensation for any damage done to the person whose land is entered upon for such carriage of water.\nThen another section provides in general terms that water privileges may be claimed for mining and other purposes, an expression large enough to include all lawful purposes, and that the said water may be taken upon, under or over any land pre-empted or purchased under the act by obtaining a grant or license from the Stipendiary Magistrate of the District acting as Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works\u2014and previous to taking the same paying reasonable compensation to the person whose land may be damaged thereby.\nThere may be some difficulty at first sight in construing the act by reason of an apparent repetition of powers which upon a careful consideration appear to me not to be repetitions. That, however, the act is not confined in its application to riparian proprietors there can, I think, be no doubt.\nIn construing the act we must attribute a distinct purpose to the several sections of the act above referred to. The true construction of the act appears to me to be, that by the 44th section leave to divert any unoccupied water may be obtained upon the written authority of the Stipendiary Magistrate acting in the capacity of Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works. In that case the magistrate as such Assistant Commissioner is directed to see that before he gives the leave the provisions of the 45th section have been complied with ; but these provisions are merely directory, for in a province only opened to settlement in 1859 the lands to be affected in the greater number of cases would be the lands of the Crown under the control of the Assistant Commissioner himself of Lands and Works in the district, so that in those cases there would be no person to whom the notice referred to could be given. Then by the 47th section the privilege may be claimed, that is to say as I read the act, before the Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works who must determine whether, and to what extent, the water sought to be diverted is unoccupied, and what would be a reasonable quantity to allow to the applicant for the purpose for which the water is required by him, but the questions of compensation and as to the course the channel for conducting the water shall take through the lands in which it has to be dug, &c., &c., may be left by the Assistant Commissioner to be agreed upon by the parties concerned either of whom, if they fail to agree, may by the 48th section require the Assistant Commissioner himself to determine the questions either with or without a jury, and lastly, by the 50th section, provision is made that water privileges for mining or other purposes may be obtained by a grant or license made by the Stipendiary Magistrate, acting as Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works, a higher species of right than the \" leave \" in the 44th section. In that case it appears to be left to the discretion of the magistrate acting as aforesaid to determine the propriety of making the grant in each case, but the making it is of no avail to the party obtaining it until he shall have made reasonable compensation for the waste or damage to the person or persons whose lands may be wasted or damaged by such water privilege ; and the propriety of making such grant cannot be questioned after it is made, nor is there any reason why it should be as it cannot be acted upon on the lands of any person which may be affected by it until the parties whose lands may be damaged thereby are compensated. In case the parties should fail to agree as to the compensation, I apprehend that the decision of the Assistant Commissioner could be invoked in this case under the 48th section equally as in the case mentioned in the 47th section. The object of the statute, as it appears to me, plainly was to provide means by which, in a country of such peculiar conformation as British Columbia, water required for the beneficial use of land or for any other lawful purpose, including mining might, be obtained with the greatest facility and in the most speedy and summary mode possible, and that no common law grant of the easement is at all necessary. That the statute should be construed as an encroachment upon that venerable embodiment of all wisdom, the common law, is really no hardship but quite the reverse in a country of such modern origin and of such peculiar conformation as British Columbia. The legislature of that country are the best judges of what is most suitable to the condition of the country, and they have, in my opinion, in clear language enough expressed their intention to be as above stated, and that authority to determine in what manner the waters in all the streams, lakes and rivers in this mountainous country shall be distributed among all persons requiring the use of such water, whether for mining or any other lawful purpose, is confided to the discretion of the Stipendiary Magistrate of the district in which such water is, acting in his capacity of Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works which, as well as Stipendiary Magistrate he is.\nNo one has any right to complain of its provisions ; it does no prejudice to any one, for all Crown grants in the colony have been and are made subject to it.\nIt would be useless to expect that the table lands upon the mountain ranges stretching throughout the colony should ever attract settlers upon them, or that the staple wealth of the colony could ever be worked beneficially, if riparian proprietors of land should be permitted to set up the common law of England against the advancement of the material interests of the colony. To my mind the act is infinitely more suited to the condition of the colony and better calculated to promote the interests of all persons becoming settlers in it than the common law of England, however admirable it be, and however entitled to the designation of \" perfection of wisdom,\" when applied to the condition of a country like England.\nTo carry out the provisions of the act a book appears to have been opened in each district of the colony in which the custom was to enter all grants of water privileges made under the act as a record of the transaction. This book in which the grants are entered under the heading \" Water Records \" is preserved as a public record of such grants in the office of the Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works in the district in which the water privilege granted is situate. The defendant Martley availed himself of the act by having recorded in the book opened for the purpose in the district in which the streams under consideration in the present case are situate, grants of water privileges made to him for the benefit of his aforementioned location in the Pavilion Creek Valley called the Grange, as follows :\nWATER RECORDS.\nNo. 22.\nOctr. 3rd, 1866.\nJohn Martley.\nThe right to the water of the creek crossed by the trail from the 29-mile house Pavilion Mountain to Captain Martley's house at the Grange Pavilion Creek.\nA. C. ELLIOTT.\nNo. 28.\nJanuary 4th, 1867.\u2014The right to the water of a creek running from Pavilion Mountain into Pavilion Creek Valley, and running close to Captain Martley's house.\nPer A. C. ELLIOTT.\nT. H. SHERWOOD. The first of the above entries relates to a creek now called Gillen's Creek which flows down from a part of the table land north of Martley's location in the valley into and through a portion of the location lying west of his house on the Grange farm until it reaches Pavilion Creek, and the other of the above entries relates to a creek now called Milk Ranch Creek, which also flows down from another part of the table land north of the Martley location, but at some distance east of Gillen's Creek, and flowing through a portion of the Martley location east of the house thereon also falls into Pavilion Creek. This Milk Ranch Creek is supplied at a point above the table land overhanging the easterly section of the Martley location in the valley with the waters of another creek descending from the mountain and called now \" Island Creek.\"\nOn the 20th January, 1868, the plaintiff Carson acquired, by right of pre-emption under the provisions of the above mentioned Land Ordinance of 1865, 160 acres of land called a ranch situate upon a part of the table land of Pavilion Mountain which overhangs the Martley Valley location ; the southerly limit of Carson's ranch constitutes part of the northerly limit of the westerly portion of the Martley location, so that Carson's land or ranch although on a much higher elevation abuts upon the Martley location in the valley, and by reason of its elevation, although it is separated from Pavilion Creek by but a short space across the Martley Valley location which is there narrow, can have no benefit from any water in the Pavilion Creek, nor as it appears from any creek in the neighbourhood, to supply his farm otherwise than by obtaining water to be drawn from the Pavilion Creek at a point high up and at the distance of some miles easterly of his land where the Pavilion Creek descends from the mountain, and before it enters the gorge by which through precipitous banks it descends into the valley. The most suitable if not the only point in the Pavilion Creek from which water could be drawn to Carson's land appears to be that where the ditch head of the ditch or watercourse hereinbefore mentioned to have been constructed through the lands of the Crown for mining purposes was situate, and as this ditch or watercourse was still open and passed a short distance to the north of Carson's ranch it presented a favourable channel, if not the only one, by which Carson could procure a supply of water which was absolutely necessary for the beneficial enjoyment of his land.\nThe same person who by the Land Ordinance of 1865 was authorized to make grants of and to distribute unoccupied water flowing in all streams, lakes and rivers for agricultural purposes was, as already shown, the person who was also by that act authorized to grant and distribute unoccupied water for mining or any other lawful purpose, namely, the Stipendiary Magistrate in the district in which the water sought to be diverted was situate, acting in his capacity of Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works.\nHe was the person who alone was competent to determine whether water required for agricultural purposes or any lawful purpose other than mining, could be spared as unoccupied and should be granted from the waters supplied by the Pavilion Creek to the ditch or watercourse so as aforesaid originally constructed for mining purposes. That was a question with which none but persons engaged or authorized and intending to be engaged in carrying on mining operations had any concern and the Stipendiary Magistrate acting in his capacity of Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works had, as it appears to me, the fullest authority in the exercise of his sole discretion to determine it. Accordingly Carson made application to Mr. Sanders, who as Stipendiary Magistrate, acting as Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works, had in January, 1868, recorded his pre-emption grant of his land, for a grant of 200 inches of water to be conveyed to his farm though this ditch which in his application he appears to have described as\u2014\nA ditch on Pavilion Mountain coming from a large creek on a mountain to about opposite 26-mile post, said water ditch for farming purposes on my ranch. I wish to record 200 inches of water.\nThis from the entry made in the record book of grants of water privileges would seem to have been the form of Carson's application. Upon this application Mr. Sanders, as and being then the Stipendiary Magistrate acting as Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works in the district, entered in the water record book a record of a grant to Carson of 200 inches of water, describing the ditch through which the water is to be conveyed in the above terms as seemingly extracted from Carson's application, and then signed the record thereunder with his own name as stipendiary magistrate ; the mining ditch already referred to corresponded with the description of the ditch mentioned in Carson's application through which he desired to get the water required ; there was no other ditch of any description then in the neighbourhood, and there never has been entertained any doubt that the said mining ditch was, and alone could be, the ditch referred to in the application of Carson, and in the record of the grant, which latter as certified by a certified copy from the government record in the custody of and under the hand of the Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works is as follows, under the heading \" Water Records \" :\u2014 1868, May 16\u2014No. 43.\nRobert Carson, Pavilion Mountain, 200 inches to ditch on Pavilion Mountain coming from a large creek on a mountain to about opposite the 26-mile post. Said water ditch for farming purposes on my ranch. I wish to record 200 inches of water.\nAt the foot of the above record of grant the magistrate signed his name.\nE. H. SANDERS S.M.\nThese letters S. M. meaning stipendiary magistrate.\nNow, although the form adopted for recording these water grants might certainly have been more perfect than that which by the record book appears to have been originally made use of we cannot, for imperfections in form, pronounce the record to be void. In a new colony having a very sparse population, and whose officials have had little experience, imperfections of this nature which time and experience remove are very common and should be regarded leniently, and we must be careful not to frustrate manifest intention by too acute verbal criticism. There can be no doubt that the entries made in this book were intended to serve as a record, and the only record, of grants of water intended to have been made by the officer having sole authority under the statute to make them. With respect to this record of Carson's grant, which is more perfect than some others (notably those of the defendant Martley himself in which no quantity is mentioned), if instead of inserting at the foot of the grant of Carson's application in the first person, as made by him, the magistrate had used the third person so as to adapt the phraseology which was suitable in an application to the purpose for which the magistrate was using it, namely, insertion in the record of the grant made by him to Carson, the record would not have been open to the criticism to which it has been subjected ; thus\u2014\" said water ditch for farming purposes on his ranch,\" \" he wishes to record 200 inches of water.\" With a refinement of criticism more specious than sound it has been contended, however, that the record of this water grant (although entered in the book kept for the special purpose of recording water grants, and although by its heading it appears to have been intended to be the record of a grant of 200 inches of water on Pavilion Mountain to Robert Carson, and although it is signed by the stipendiary magistrate, the only officer competent and authorized by the statute to make the grant), is utterly null and void and is in fact an application merely for a water grant by the stipendiary magistrate himself.\nNow the ditch or watercourse through which the water was to be conveyed to Carson's farm, as already pointed out, was constructed by or for the government wholly through lands of the Crown and was under the administration and control of the Gold Commissioners prior to the passing of the above Land Ordinance of 1865, and then by section 50 of that act came under the administration and control of the Stipendiary Magistrate of the district acting in his capacity of Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works. The defendant Martley had not in virtue of his letters patent of February, 1864, any interest whatever in the waters entering and running in the ditch, nor any right in law to the use of, or to obstruct the free and uninterrupted flow of, the water in this artificial watercourse which was by statutory authority under the sole control and administration of the Stipendiary Magistrate of the district acting in his capacity of Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works. He had no claim or right to compensation for the ditch which had been constructed before he obtained the grant specified in his letters patent. There was no intention to grant to Carson any right to enter upon Martley's or any other person's land for the purpose of making any new chan- nel by which the water should be conveyed to Carson's farm. There seems therefore to have been no necessity or occasion that Martley or any other person should have had given to them the notice mentioned in the 45th section of the act. But however this may be, and assuming Martley to have been entitled to some compensation by reason of the land granted to him having been, if it was, exposed to damage by reason of dirt taken out of the ditch in the course of any cleaning of it which may have been necessary being thrown upon it, which seems to me to be the utmost he could claim, still the grant to Carson was perfectly good, if not under all at least under some or one of the three sections 44, 47 or 50 of the act ; and, moreover, for reasons appearing further on, it is not open to either of the defendants to make any objection to it in the present action.\nCarson appears to have proceeded under his grant to perform some work in the ditch so as aforesaid already in existence, whether of the nature of taking dirt out of it and cleaning it, or of laying a flume in it to measure his 200 inches of water at the ditch head or what else does not appear. The greater part of his work would necessarily be in that part of the ditch which passed through lands still belonging to the Crown. When, however, he came to that part of the ditch which was within the bounds of the lands granted to Martley by the letters patent of February 21, 1864, Martley made some objection, the nature of which or the reasons upon which it was founded do not appear. The defendant Martley says that he brought an action of trespass against Carson before Mr. Sanders (who as stipendiary magistrate aforesaid had given to Carson the grant which is as above stated recorded in the record book) and that Mr. Sanders gave judgment in his (Martley's) favour, and suggested an arrangement which as he says did take place. This statement cannot be accepted as evidence in the sense in which Mr. Martley plainly intends it to be understood, namely, that Carson's title to the use of the water in the ditch consists solely in a verbal arrangement with him, Martley, as the recognized and only person who was competent to give to Carson a grant of such use as of an easement in and upon his, Martley's, land, and that such right not having been granted by a deed executed by Martley it is void. That an arrangement was made between Martley and Carson there can be no doubt, and that it consisted in Carson paying $100 to Martley and in agreeing that Martley might take 50 inches of water out of the flume Carson was making and laying in the ditch, and that in pursuance of such agreement Martley put into Carson's flume a box to take such 50 inches of water may be admitted, but this admission is susceptible of a very different construction from that part of the transaction as represented by Martley. In 1868 the only character in which Mr. Sanders could have taken cognisance of any complaint made by Martley against Carson was either as a judge of the County Court under the County Court Ordinance of 1867, or as Stipendiary Magistrate acting as Commissioner of Lands and Works under the Land Ordinance of 1865, section 48. Now if Martley's complaint was the subject of county court action, and if, as Martley says, Mr. Sanders gave judgment in his favour, the subject matter of such action as well as the judgment therein could only be proved under the provisions of section 111 of the Imperial statute 9 & 10 Vic. ch. 95, which is incorporated into and made part of the County Court Ordinance of 1867, namely, by copies of the proceedings of the court certified under the seal of the court, and signed and certified by the clerk of the court. In the ab- sence of such evidence it is impossible to assume that Martley's complaint took the form of an action in the county court. Indeed there is the strongest possible presumption, as it appears to me, not only that it did not assume the form of an action in the county court, but that it was a complaint made under the 47th section of the Land Ordinance of 1865.\nThere is no evidence of the committal by Carson of any act over which the county court could have assumed cognizance. That whatever Carson did was in assertion of a right claimed by him under the water grant in his favour recorded by the Stipendiary Magistrate acting as Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works, and that such act was done in the ditch or watercourse so as aforesaid constructed, there is not raised any doubt. That this ditch was by the Land Ordinance of 1865 under the control and administration of the Stipendiary Magistrate of the district acting as Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works there can, I think, be no doubt ; that it was in the assertion of his right to make the grant to Carson under the Land Ordinance that Sanders acted when he made and recorded the grant to Carson there can be no doubt. The assertion by Carson of his right and title under the water grant to the enjoyment of the easement he was claiming in the ditch or watercourse, and Martley's assertion on the contrary of sole title in himself to grant the easement as being one to be enjoyed on land of which he claimed to be seized in fee, if such a claim had been asserted by him, must of necessity have raised a question of title to the land in which Carson was asserting his claim to an easement under his water grant so as to have excluded the jurisdiction of the County Court, if Martley had asserted in the County Court a right to interfere with Carson's proceedings upon such ground ; whereas Martley may have deemed himself to be, whether in point of law he was or not under the circumstances is immaterial, entitled to compensation under the Land Ordinance Act before Carson should interfere with that portion of the ditch which passed through the land granted to Martley by the description contained in his letters patent of February, 1864 ; and in truth and in fact he would, I apprehend, have been entitled to compensation if, as possibly may have been the case, any dirt which in cleaning the ditch it may have been necessary to remove had been, or had to be, thrown upon Martley's land. That would have been a matter over which Mr. Sanders as the Stipendiary Magistrate who had made the water grant to Carson had undoubted jurisdiction, and he might have suggested to the parties that they had better come to an agreement as to compensation. What may have been actually passing in his mind it is difficult after the lapse of twenty years now to determine. The fact that the arrangement which was made was verbal was quite consistent with its having been made under the 48th section of the Land Ordinance of 1865, whereas it is quite inconsistent with its having been intended to be, as is now contended, an imperfect grant of an easement over Martley's land made by him to Carson. There is, therefore, in my opinion, the very strongest possible presumption that the arrangement was, and was intended to be, an arrangement under the 48th section of the Land Ordinance. There can be no doubt that the intention of the parties was that the arrangement should be an honest, perfect and effectual one for both parties to it. At the time of its having been entered into Carson had his water grant recorded entitling him to 200 inches of water to be taken from the Pavilion Creek by a flume to be laid by Carson in the ditch so constructed as aforesaid. If the lands through which the ditch was constructed were all of them still Crown lands there was no person to be compensated under the statute before the grant should be acted upon and the water taken. If, however, there was any person whose lands through which the water should be so conducted to Carson's farm would be wasted or damaged thereby Carson's grant although made to him would, by a provision in the statute, be of no avail to him as to such lands until he should make an arrangement with such person as to compensation. Carson was claiming the benefit of his grant and was proceeding to avail himself of it, under the impression no doubt that as the ditch was constructed in manner aforesaid, and as he had a grant under the statute and recorded by the Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works, the officer of the government having control of all public lands and works and the making of water grants under the statute, there was no person to be compensated for his laying his flume in the ditch and doing any necessary repairs in it to enable him to do so. Martley, however, (whether or not under an erroneous impression as to his rights, does not now matter) objected to Carson's interfering in any manner with that part of the ditch where it lay through his land, and Carson (whether under any obligation or not so to do) agreed to pay Martley and did in fact pay him $100 and agreed also to let him have fifty inches of water from his, Carson's, flume and thereupon proceeded under his water grant to do all work necessary to the laying of his flume from the ditch head at the Pavilion Creek to his farm at a cost of $1,500, as he says, and suffered and permitted Martley to put a box into his flume to take the 50 inches of water at a place where the ditch and flume therein crossed the Island Creek. Now as this arrangement could only be good and effectual by regarding it as one made under the Land Ordinance by way of compensation to Martley thereunder it must be so regarded ; and Carson's grant of the 200 inches of water made to him by the Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works became thereby absolutely indefeasible as against Martley and all persons claiming under him the land granted by the letters patent of February, 1864, who cannot now be permitted to call in question Carson's right to the benefit of the water grant made to him under the statute for any real or supposed defect either in form or substance. Martley having, under the arrangement made by him with Carson, put a box into Carson's flume so as to draw off his 50 inches of water differences arose in 1870 between them as to the use made by each of the water during 1869, which was a dry season ; each party seemingly complaining of the other having done damage by a use of the water contrary to the arrangement. Now these differences had plainly no relation whatever to any question as to the terms upon which Carson should acquire, or had acquired, a grant of any easement from Martley. Neither Carson nor Martley can be assumed to have contemplated submitting any such question to arbitration, nor in point of fact was any such arbitrated upon ; but differences as to any damage which either may have sustained, or may have supposed that he had sustained, in the dry season of 1869 by a greater use of the water than was in accordance with the arrangement, treating it as one made under the Land Ordinance as above suggested, and for the purpose of regulating in future the use of the water under the arrangement so as to prevent the recurrence of such differences, were matters which well and reasonably might have been submitted by both parties to arbitration and by a parol submission ; and this is what, judging from the award, appears to have been done. The award was produced in evidence at the trial but is not in the appeal case as an exhibit ; it is however quoted in full in the judgment of the full court on the appeal to it from the judgment of the learned Chief Justice who tried the case. It is as follows and is dated the 2nd June, 1870 :\nWe have been appointed arbitrators in a cause between Captain Martley and Robert Carson respecting the right to water in a certain ditch passing through Captain Martley's farm on Pavilion Mountain and damages that either may have sustained by the loss of water for irrigation in the year 1869. We find that neithe? is entitled to damages. That while Captain Martley has a sufficient supply of water in the two creeks passing into his farm he shall not be entitled to any water from Carson's ditch, but in case of scarcity Captain Martley shall be entitled to half the water in Carson's ditch, the half not to exceed in any case fifty inches and he will be entitled to get this for use on his farm round his house, and to take it out of the ditch where it joins the Island Creek. Captain Martley may use these fifty inches on Pavilion Mountain if he chooses.\nSigned,\nGEORGE A. KELLEY.\nJOSEPH L. SMITH.\nJ. S. SWART.\nIn the above award it is to be observed that the ditch is called Carson's ditch, and what the award recognizes Martley to be entitled to is 50 inches of water from Carson's ditch (not that Carson is entitled to any water from a ditch of Martley). Indeed it appears that from the time of the water grant to Carson the ditch through which the water was conveyed to his farm became known, not only popularly throughout the country, as Carson's ditch, but that it was also recognized as such by the Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Works in other grants of water made and recorded by him. In the water record book a grant is recorded on the 16th May, 1870, as having been made in favour of one William Sampson of a right to 200 inches of water from a large creek supplying Carson's ditch.\nUpon the 10th of August, 1870, two months after the above award was made, the mortgagees in the herein- before mentioned mortgage executed by Martley sold and conveyed the land therein comprised, under the power of sale therein contained, to one Beaven in fee, and upon the 27th of the same month of August Martley, by a deed of grant and confirmation reciting that sale, granted, confirmed and assured the land to Beaven in fee by the description contained in the letters patent to Martley of 7th February, 1864.\nNow, bearing in mind the facts that the ditch head of this ditch (now called Carson's ditch) was situate on the lands of the Crown about one mile or one mile and a quarter above the land granted to Martley, and that the ditch was dug for that distance from its ditch head before it entered that part of the Crown lands which, subsequently to the construction of the ditch, was granted to Martley ; and that Martley had never acquired any water grant whatever under the Land Ordinance, it follows, in my opinion, that he never had at any time a legal right to draw water from that ditch on to his land ; but however this may be, if he ever had any such right in virtue of his letters patent such right absolutely ceased and determined, if not on the 10th August, 1870, at least upon the execution by him of the deed of the 27th August, 1870, to Beaven ; so that after that date he could have had no claim whatever or pretense of claim to draw off water from the Carson ditch where it crossed Island Creek or any other point unless under Carson's recorded water grant, and the agreement for compensation made with Carson and the award. He did, however, draw off his 50 inches of water out of the Carson ditch at the place specified in the award, namely, where it crossed Island Creek, continuously until 1878, when, as he says himself, he told Carson that he would be content with 30 inches, and that Carson accordingly put in a 30-inch box through which Martley received water until the diffi culty arose which was the cause of this action having been commenced on the 7th July, 1884. We have thus arrived at the conclusion, which I confess appears to me to be incontrovertible, that as during all this period from the 27th August, 1870, to the occurrence of the difficulty which was the cause of the commencement of this action on the 7th July, 1884, a period of fourteen years, Martley had no legal right whatever entitling him to draw water from the Carson ditch unless in virtue of Carson's water grant and his agreement with Martley for compensation and the award, it must be presumed that the water was taken under this the only title which Martley had and could assert, and that in this action he must be concluded from disputing a title the benefit of which he has so long enjoyed. It seems, therefore, to me to be clear that as against him, and Clark also as claiming under him the land granted by the letters patent of February, 1864, Carson's right to draw his 200 inches of water from Pavilion Creek under his grant is indisputable, and any interference by Martley or Clark with such right constitutes an actionable wrong to Carson entitling him to recover satisfaction for such damage as he may have sustained which is reasonably attributable to such interference.\nNow as to the defendant Clark he obtained no title to any land until the 9th July, 1875, when he had recorded a pre-emption title to 320 acres of land on the Pavilion Mountain, bounded on the north-west by Sampson's farm and on the south-east by Beaven's land ; this latter land is that conveyed to Beaven by Martley. This land so pre-empted by Clark is, equally as is Carson's, situate on the table land north of Martley's location in the valley, but through it flows Milk Ranch Creek, which upon Clark's farm is joined by Island Creek and flows down the crest of the mountain across Martley's grange from and to the east of his house into Pavilion Creek. Through the westerly part of Clark\u2019s pre-emption land there flows another small stream into Gillen's Creek where it flows through Martley's location in the valley. Clark would seem to have found these streams so flowing through his land to be insufficient for his farming purposes, in consequence probably of Martley having claimed to have acquired by his hereinbefore mentioned water records of 3rd October, 1866, and the 4th January, 1867, a right to have the uninterrupted flow of all the water in these streams down from the mountain into and upon the location in the valley, a claim which I presume was founded upon the last sentence in the 48th section of the Land Ordinance of 1875, which is a repetition of the last sentence of the 30th section of the Land Ordinance of 1870, which seems to enact that no person shall have exclusive right to the waters of a natural stream, even though running through his land, unless under a water grant recorded under the act. Clark therefore applied under this Land Ordinance of 1875 for a grant of water from Pavilion Creek which is recorded on December 14, 1876, as granted to him in these words :\u2014\nT. C. Clark, Pavilion, 200 inches of water from Pavilion Creek 20 yards below Carson's ditch for irrigating purposes on Clark's ranch, Pavilion Mountain.\nThis grant, it will be observed, as did that to Sampson in 1870, mentions Carson's ditch as one recognized, by the authorities alone having authority to make water grants, as belonging to Carson, and this in so very marked manner as to make the reference to the Carson ditch form such an essential part of the grant to Clark by defining the precise point from which he is permitted to take the water granted to him as to seem to attach to his grant a necessary obligation upon him to recognize the Carson grant as one with which he cannot interfere, for he is permitted only to take the water at a point \" 20 yards below Carson's ditch.\" Under this water grant Clark made a ditch from the Pavilion Creek placing his ditch head as directed in his grant at a point 20 yards below the ditch head of Carson's ditch. The ditch so constructed by Clark is a little to the south of and nearly parallel for some distance with Carson's ditch ; it runs first through the lands of the Crown, then through Beaven's land formerly belonging to Martley, and then takes a southerly course and crosses Island Creek some distance south of the point where Carson's ditch crosses that creek, then it crosses Milk Ranch Creek in Clark's pre-emption lot through which it passes and discharges its waste water into the small stream which falls into Gillen's Creek, and so through Martley's location in the valley into Pavilion Creek. Through this ditch Clark from the time of its construction has conveyed, and at the time of the commencement of this action did convey, and still conveys the waters which he takes from Pavilion Creek to his said pre-emption lot, as the only course by which water can be conveyed from Pavilion Creek to his said lot. Now it is obvious that Clark can claim a right to water running in this ditch only in virtue of the same title as that under which Carson claims, namely, a grant under the Land Ordinance, and it appears to me the reference to \" Carson's Ditch \" in the record of Clark's water grant so imports into this latter a recognition of Carson's grant as to conclude Clark from disputing its validity, even if it was open to impeachment for any cause, which for the reasons already given in discussing Martley's case I think it is not. If, however, either Carson or Clark should wilfully waste any of the water acquired under the grant to either the case is brought within the 55th section of the Land Ordinance of 1875, which enacts that : Any owner of any ditch or water privilege who shall wilfully waste any quantity of water heretofore or hereafter acquired by record or otherwise by diverting any more of it from its natural course, through any ditch or otherwise, than the quantity actually required by him for irrigation or any other purpose, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars for each such offence to be recovered before a justice of the peace, stipendiary magistrate, or commissioner in a summary manner, and in default of payment by distress, or by imprisonment for any period not exceeding six months.\nNow upon the 7th July, 1884, this action was commenced and the pleader in the statement of claim filed on behalf of Carson (I omit all reference to Eholt for the present) asserts title under his water grant of the 16th May, 1868. He inaccurately avers that in 1867 Carson made the ditch which, as already stated, was some years previously constructed by, or by authority of, the government for mining purposes ; he then sets out the award made in 1870 in the arbitration between Carson and Martley, and avers that Martley never had obtained any water grant recorded in his favour entitling him to take water from Pavilion Creek and insists that by reason of his not having done so he could acquire no interest under the award. This contention was presumably based upon the construction put by the pleader upon the 30th section of the Land Ordinance of 1870, which became law upon the 1st of June, 1870, the day before the making of the award, and which is repeated in the 48th section of the Land Ordinance of 1875 and is still in force, to the effect apparently that no person can have exclusive right to the waters, even of a natural stream running by or through his land, except under a water grant recorded under the act. The statement then avers the cause of action as follows :\u2014\nIn and during the month of June, 1884, and thenceforth until the commencement of this suit the defendant, John Martley, by his agents, servants or workmen, and the defendant Clark obstructed the said ditch of the plaintiff and diverted large quantities of the water thereof away from the said land of the plaintiff by placing a box in the bed of the said ditch about three-quarters of a mile up the said ditch, and by there making and maintaining a cutting in the said ditch and drawing off large quantities of the water thereof through the said cutting back into Pavilion Creek, and the defendants by force and violence prevented the plaintiffs from repairing such ditch ; that the defendants thereby diminished the quantity of water which flowed down the said ditch and deprived the plaintiffs of the flow of water therein to which they were entitled as aforesaid.\nThe plaintiffs claimed $8,000 and an injunction and such further and other relief as the nature of the case might require. The defendant Martley in his defence and counter-claim denied that Carson had ever in point of fact obtained any right to 200 inches of water from Pavilion Creek, or that the waters of that creek were at any time unoccupied. He denied that Carson ever got the written authority of the Stipendiary Magistrate of the district to divert any of the water of the said creek, and that Carson did post or give notices to the effect mentioned in the 45th section of the Land Ordinance of 1865.\nUnder this averment is sought to be raised the contention that a right, if any could be obtained by Carson, to the use upon his farm of any water from Pavilion Creek could only be obtained under the 44th section of the Land Ordinance of 1865, and that it is necessary for a person claiming such a right to be prepared during all time with evidence of the fact that the notices mentioned in the 45th section were given before the leave to take the water was given by the Assistant Commissioner ; but for the reasons already given the 45th section is merely directory ; and moreover it is not, in my opinion, necessary for Carson to rest upon the 44th section to maintain his water grant recorded as it has been ; but assuming him to be obliged to rest on the 44th section alone it is, in my judgment, impossible that it could be expected, or that it could have been intended by the statute, that a person who had obtained from the duly authorized ministerial officer of the government named in the statute permission to take to his farm a supply of water from a stream should during all time and after enjoying the benefit of such permission, it may be for 15 years as here, be required to prove that such notices were given before he could succeed in an action then brought for an interruption and encroachment upon his right. The case has been compared to that of a person justifying or claiming under a judgment of a court of interior jurisdiction, in which case it has been held to be necessary upon all such occasions for such person to plead and prove all matters necessary to show his case to have come within the jurisdiction of the inferior court upon whose judgment he relies. That was an old rule of pleading merely which owed its existence to another rule adopted by the superior courts to govern their own procedure, namely, that they would not take judicial notice of the jurisdiction of inferior courts, and that therefore, if a judgment of such a tribunal was relied upon, it was necessary for the party relying on it to plead and prove that the case came within the jurisdiction of the inferior tribunal. But between such a case and the present there is no analogy. Here no claim is made under the judgment of a court of inferior jurisdiction or anything analogous thereto. The present is the case of a grant made by the ministerial officer of the government authorized by statute to make the grant, which grant when made and recorded cannot be questioned upon an allegation that notices which he was directed to see had been given before he should make and record the grant had not been given. To such a case the old rule of pleading mentioned has no application. Martley then avers that the waters of the Pavilion Creek naturally flow through his land ; he avers that in the month of August, 1884, he duly obtained the right to divert and use 200 inches of water of the said creek ; he says that Carson and he verbally agreed in the year 1868, that in consideration of Carson paying him one hundred dollars he, Carson, should have the right to use that part of the ditch running through his, Martley's, land subject to Martley's right to use the first fifty inches of water running through it to be taken for use whenever he, Martley, required it, and that it was in consequence of a breach of this agreement by Carson that the arbitration mentioned in the statement of claim was had ; he avers that at the time of filing his statement by way of defence he has been in undisputed possession of so much of the waters of Pavilion Creek as is necessary for farming purposes and the use of the said ditch for over twenty years then last past ; he denies that he ever acted in concert with the defendant Clark as in the statement of claim is alleged, and he avers that in so far as he is concerned the alleged trespasses and grievances in the statement of claim mentioned consisted in the exercise by him of his right to the said water and to the use of the ditch, placing a box therein to take 50 inches of water therefrom and taking it for use upon his farm and not otherwise; and he denies that he directly or indirectly prevented the repairing of the ditch, and he denies the use of force and violence, and he denies that either of the plaintiffs has been deprived by him of any water to which he is entitled or that either of them has sustained any damage ; and he makes a counter-claim for damages alleged to have been sustained under the averments following : He says that he is possessed of a farm known as the Grange, and that in the months of June, July and August in the year 1884 the plaintiffs wrongfully di- verted and deprived him of the use of the said water whereby his crops became poor ; that the plaintiffs broke the box through which he, Martley, took the water, and that he incurred a great expense in endeavouring to prevent the plaintiff's abstracting the water. It is to be observed as to this defence and counter-claim :\n1st. Upon the averment that at the time of the water grant the waters of Pavilion Creek from which the water was granted to him were not unoccupied has been founded the argument that the Land Ordinance as regards water grants was not intended to apply to any one but a riparian proprietor, an argument which, upon reflection, appears to be suicidal. The contention is that as by the common law of England every riparian proprietor is entitled to the flow of the waters of every stream running along or through his property in its natural course without interruption, therefore the waters of no stream upon any part of which there is a riparian proprietor can be said to be unoccupied. If this be so then as a matter of course when there are two or more riparian proprietors upon any stream, as according to the argument none of the waters of that stream can be said to be unoccupied, no riparian proprietor can claim to have or can have any exclusive use of any part of the waters of that stream taken from it in the lands of another riparian proprietor granted to him under the Land Ordinance, any more than a stranger not a riparian proprietor could ; for by the Land Ordinance it is only unoccupied water which can be granted under its provisions to any one ; and so the Land Ordinance, so far as water grants are concerned, becomes nugatory and inoperative.\nThe term \" unoccupied,\" in my judgment, on the contrary plainly means what the terms \" unrecorded and unappropriated \" mean in the Land Ordinances of 1870 and 1875, and the term \" unoccupied water \" in the Gold Fields Act, and so read the Land Ordinance becomes, what it was intended to be, sensible and operative.\n2ndly. It is not true that the Pavilion Creek naturally flows through or along the land of the defendant Martley at any place which is material to the consideration of the points in difference in this action, although it is true that the creek runs along, and is the southern boundary of his pre-emption location in the valley at the foot of the mountain called the Grange Farm ; but this is wholly immaterial to the present case, for none of the waters so flowing in the creek have been interfered with, nor does Martley complain that it has been, nor does he pretend that he could make use of the water in the creek, as it flows through the valley, for irrigation upon his Grange Farm, or that he has been prevented from so doing by any act of Carson's ; all that he claims is a right to draw off water from the ditch called Carson's ditch by a box therein to his Grange Farm in the valley, and the obstruction complained of by him is the alleged removal by Carson of a box in his ditch which Martley had at the place where it was directed by the award to be kept, namely, where Carson's ditch crosses the Island Creek.\n3rdly. As to the allegation that in the month of August, 1884, Martley obtained a right to divert and use 200 inches of the water of the said creek to be recorded as granted to him. This allegation, although it is quite immaterial and irrelevant in the present case, because the right, if acquired, was acquired subsequently to the commencement of this suit, was not proved in the sense of showing that any right was acquired under the grant, or if acquired had been inter- fered with. This grant, although recorded, does not indicate any point in the Pavilion Creek from which the water is authorized to be drawn, and having been made under the provisions of the Land Ordinance of 1875 was of no avail to the grantee until he should construct a ditch for conveying the water to the place authorized by the grant, and it is not alleged or pretended that any such ditch was ever constructed or that Carson interfered with any right acquired under the grant.\n4thly. As to the setting upan undisputed possession of so much of the water of Pavilion Creek as is necessary for farming purposes, and the use of the ditch (the Carson ditch) for upwards of twenty years next before the defence pleaded, it is utterly inconceivable how this allegation, which is so singularly rash and recklessly inaccurate, should have been pleaded and relied upon, or that being so relied upon it should have escaped notice in the court below and at the trial.\nAs already shown Martley had never, prior to August, 1884, recorded any grant authorizing him to divert any water from Pavilion Creek by the Carson ditch or otherwise, and since the 27th August, 1870, at any rate, he had no pretense of claim to the waters of the creek in its natural flow along the boundary of the land granted by the letters patent of February, 1864, through which the ditch passed ; nor had he any right to divert any of the waters of the creek through the Carson ditch or otherwise, or to have or take any water running through that ditch otherwise than in virtue of Carson's water grant, the agreement with him and the award ; and as to that agreement, as also already shown, it had no rationally conceivable raison d'\u00eatre whatever, unless it was by way of compensation to Martley (whether entitled to it or not) to terminate all possible right of objection upon his part to Carson availing himself of his water grant through the ditch in question, and to render it perfect and indefeasible as against Martley and all persons claiming or to claim under him the land granted by the letters patent of February, 1864 ; and his counter-claim is only for damage alleged to have been done to the Grange Farm in the valley by reason of the want of water which could be conveyed to it from Carson's ditch only through the box which Martley was permitted to have there and, ever since the 27th August, 1870, had there by no title whatever that can be shown or suggested unless under Carson's water grant, the agreement with him and the award ; which title after having enjoyed the benefit of it for fifteen years Martley has now by this defence and counter-claim utterly repudiated.\nClark in his defence and counter-claim, while he admits the water grant made to him which was recorded in his favour on the 14th December, 1876, and his construction thereunder of the ditch in the plaintiffs' statement of claim in that behalf mentioned, pleads by way of counter-claim that the estate which Martley acquired by the letters patent of February, 1864, and which was vested in Beaven as hereinbefore stated, is now held by Clark under an agreement with Beaven ; this agreement appears in evidence to have been entered into on the 8th January, 1883, whereby Beaven agreed upon payment of a sum of money therein mentioned by three annual instalments on the 1st days of December, 1883-4-5, to sell the said land to Clark. He then avers that at the times thereinafter mentioned he was and still is entitled to the flow of Pavilion Creek for nearly one mile and one-half along the eastern boundary of the said land, and that the plaintiff Carson in and during the month of June, 1884, and thenceforth until the commencement of this action obstructed Pavilion Creek and diverted large quantities of the waters thereof away from the said land by placing and keeping earth and stone in the bed of the said stream, and by placing a box as in plaintiffs' statement of claim is alleged (that is to say, as there alleged, \" in the ditch of the plaintiff Robert Carson a measuring box capable of carrying 200 inches of water,\") and there making and maintaining a cutting in the bank of the said stream, and taking the waters of the stream through the box and carrying the same through the ditch leading therefrom to Carson's land ; and he further avers that Carson thereby diminished the quantity, and at times completely arrested the waters which flowed down the stream and deprived him, Clark, of the flow of water to which he was entitled as aforesaid ; and he avers that the plaintiff Carson has continued such obstruction as aforesaid up to the present time, and he prays a declaration of the court to be made in this cause that he is entitled to the flow of t\u00e8e waters of the said stream, and that the plaintiff Carson may be restrained by injunction from in any manner obstructing or diverting the water of the said stream and from in any manner interfering with his, Clark's, said rights.\nThe obstruction above complained of, it will be observed, is in that portion of the creek which is situate in the Crown lands about a mile (as appears by the evidence) above the land granted to Martley by the letters patent of February, 1864, and it consisted in making a dam of some kind in the stream to divert water into Carson's ditch for the purpose of enabling him to take his 200 inches of water granted to him. The 55th section of the Land Ordinance of 1875, under which alone Clark by his water grant of December 14, 1876, obtained any right affecting the waters of the stream, provided abundant means to enable him to divert the waters of the stream from the place without any interference with the means necessary to be employed by Carson to enable him to enjoy the benefit of the water granted to him, namely, by constructing a dam or breakwater below Carson's ditch to retain the waters crossing Carson's dam, which it is quite possible may for a short time in a dry season necessarily keep back all the water flowing down the stream until sufficient is obtained to supply his 200 inches. This 55th section of the Land Ordinance of 1875 provides that\u2014\nNo owner of any first record to any ditch or water right shall have any right to interfere with or prevent the construction of any dams, breakwaters, or other improvements made or hereafter to be made for the purpose of saving or economising the water of any creek, lake or water-course of any kind, provided that the construction or use of such dam or breakwater does not nor will divert such water from its proper channel at the point or place where such owner takes the water used by him into his ditch or channel. Provided also that the construction and use of such dam or breakwater shall not injure the source from which such water is taken or the property of any person by backing water, flooding or otherwise ; provided also that all disputes arising upon any matter or thing in this clause contained shall be decided in a summary manner before any justices of the peace, stipendiary magistrate or commissioner who shall have free power to make such decision as shall seem to him just and equitable.\nBy this statute ample means are provided to enable Clark to enjoy the full benefit of all the water of the river he was entitled to divert and the most speedy and effectual redress for any infringement of such, his rights. But what Clark asserts is, and this is his sole contention, that he is entitled to the natural flow of all the water in Pavilion Creek in virtue of his agreement of January, 1883, made with Beaven for the purchase of the land granted to Martley by the letters patent of 4th February, 1864, and that Carson had no right whatever to any of the waters of the stream to be taken through his ditch as claimed by him, and that under the above assertion of title what he seeks to obtain plainly appears to be, not that the waters of the Pavilion Creek may be suffered to flow in their natural course down the steep mountain gorge by which it descends along the land which Clark has agreed to purchase from Beaven into the valley at the foot of the mountain where the stream flows along Martley's pre-emption called the Grange farm, but to prevent Carson from taking his 200 inches of water or any water through his ditch head situate 20 yards higher up the creek than that of Clark, in order that Clark may obtain and through his ditch take the whole of the waters of the creek to his pre-emption land, and may be able to discharge as much as he pleases, or as may be agreed upon between him and Martley, down Milk Ranch Creek into the Grange Farm. Clark's defence and counter-claim, however, establish that Clark's complaint against Carson is not of any waste by him of the waters of the creek in excess of what he is entitled to, (in which case the 55th section of the act of 1875 would afford a most complete, prompt and effectual remedy), but an absolute denial that Carson has any right to divert any water by his ditch, and that all that is complained of by Clark is Carson's taking through his ditch head in the manner stated in his statement of claim the 200 inches claimed by him under his water grant, and that this diversion of the waters of Pavilion Creek by Carson is what has caused to Clark the damage of which he complains ; so that if Carson's right to draw 200 inches of water from the creek under his water grant be established the establishment of such right, while entitling Carson to recover for any damage which may have been sustained by him by reason of Clark's interference with such right, also displaces wholly Clark's counter-claim which rests solely upon the success of his contention that Carson is not entitled to divert any of the waters of the creek and that he, Clark, is entitled to the whole of the water flowing in it ; and thus all necessity will be removed of endeavouring to ascertain from the evidence, which I confess seems, to my mind, very imperfect and confused, where or how precisely it is contended that the damage of which Clark complains could have been and was occasioned.\nWe find then the position of the parties as contended by the defendants to be this, that while Clark has two streams flowing through his pre-emption land and a water grant under the Land Ordinance of 1875 authorizing him to take and by which he takes 200 inches of water from the Pavilion Creek to the same land, and while Martley has the same two streams and another flowing down from the mountain to his Grange Farm besides the Pavilion Creek which flows along the whole length of that pre-emption location, and the plaintiff Carson has no means of irrigating his location unless by water taken under his water grant from Pavilion Creek at the point where his ditch head is 20 yards above the head of Clark's ditch, he, Carson, is not to be permitted to take any of such water, but that all the waters of the Pavilion Creek are to be applied to the exclusive use of Martley and Clark, upon the principle, no doubt, that to him alone who hath shall be given, and this is contended to be the true intent and meaning of the land ordinances of British Columbia passed by the legislature by way of invitation and inducement to persons to come into the province and settle upon the said table lands in the mountains who, without water provided by statute for irrigation purposes, have no possible means of procuring water for such purpose, and upon this construction of the said acts or ordinances a decree has been made adjudging the defendants to be entitled to the natural flow of the waters of Pavilion Creek as claimed by them and restraining the plaintiff Carson by perpetual injunction from interrupting or interfering with the flow of the waters of the said stream, and from permitting the same to continue unrestored and from permitting to continue on his land any ditch, dyke or watercourse whereby the waters of the stream may be wholly or partially diverted or interfered with so as to infringe upon the said rights of the defendants ; and that he should also pay the defendant Martley $200 as herein aforesaid and the defendant Clark $500.\nThis judgment and decree cannot for the reasons already given be, in my opinion, sustained. On the contrary I am of opinion that the plaintiff Carson is clearly entitled to recover in this action, and that every principle of law and equity requires that judgment should be rendered in his favour for such damage as he may have sustained which can be reasonably attributed to any acts or act of the defendants or of either of them.\nThe sole question which now remains is to determine the amount of such damage. Now as to Clark his conduct has been, in my opinion, most wanton, vexatious and selfish. So far as I can collect from the evidence as appearing on the appeal case it appears that early in May, 1884, Carson proceeded to clean the ditch of which he had been in possession for fifteen years, claiming under his water grant of May 1868 ; about the 7th of that month he had completed such work as may have been necessary to enable him to draw off water from Pavilion Creek to his farm through his ditch under his grant; at first the water ran freely ; in a day and a half it stopped ; upon the 9th he went up to his ditch head and found it obstructed, and the water in the creek flowing down to Clark's ditch head ; he removed the obstruction and let the water again into his ditch ; again the obstruction was repeated, and again he repaired it ; afterwards he found a box let into his ditch by which all water coming into the ditch was let back again into the creek, thus again supplying Clark's ditch ; subsequently he found another box put into his ditch at a point further from the ditch head by which the water was taken direct into Clark's ditch ; these boxes Carson removed, but all his efforts to obtain water were fruitless for his ditch was again opened by Clark in different places so that the water was taken into Clark's ditch ; at last as a final effort Carson put a new flume into his ditch head on the 12th June, 1884 ; upon this occasion Martley and Clark went up to the ditch head where Carson was at work, and Clark claimed the ditch and all the water in into be his, and insisted that Carson had no right whatever to any of the water, and he again drew off the water into his ditch by openings made by him in different places in the Carson ditch ; and in fine the result is that during the whole period in which the water was a necessity to Carson he was deprived of all benefit from his ditch, and of the water which in virtue of his grant of May, 1868, he claimed title to, and notwithstanding Clark, who beyond all doubt did or caused to b\u00e5 done the acts above mentioned, makes a counter-claim for damages said to have been caused by Carson's fruitless endeavours to repair, and prevent the full force and effect of, the injury done to him by Clark's acts. Carson is in my opinion entitled to recover from Clark substantial damages, and the only danger, I think, is lest a keen sense of Clark's wanton and selfish conduct should induce a judgment which might be excessive. It is difficult to make a just estimate of what loss Carson may have sustained from the want of water in the season of 1884, which is said to have been very dry. Its excessive dryness made the water a greater necessity, but at the same time it increases the difficulty of determining what might have been the result upon Carson's farm if the water he was entitled to draw from Pavilion Creek had not been cut off. I think that a judgment in Carson's ?avour for $600 against Clark, and dismissing his counter-claim with costs will not be excessive, and will at the same time afford reasonable compensation to Carson for what he may have suffered from Clark's conduct. Then as to Martley, he says that he never did any of the acts complained of as having been done by Clark ; that he did nothing whatever in concert with Clark, and that in fact he did nothing at all but put into the ditch where it crossed Island Creek a box to draw off from the ditch 50 inches of water in the place and stead of a box which Carson had removed. If this be so he should not of course be held responsible for Clark's acts.\nWhy he should act in concert with Clark unless they had come to an agreement that they should divide between them the waters of Pavilion Creek it is difficult to conceive. If Clark should succeed in his contention that the ditch called Carson's ditch and all the water therein belonged to him, Clark, as his absolute property, and that Carson had no right to have had any water conveyed thereby to his farm, Martley's claim to 50 inches drawn from the ditch would be utterly gone also unless he should make an agreement for it with Clark. Martley's interest, in truth, depended on his maintaining as against Clark the Carson water grant and the agreement with him, in the sense hereinbefore pointed out to have been its reasonable construction, and the award, for it is plain that his assertion of title to the ditch and the water therein in himself could never be supported, as the only foundation of any title, if any he ever had, in the ditch was claimed in virtue of his estate in the land granted to him by the letters patent of February, 1864, and since August, 1870, that title was vested in Beaven, and in 1884 was claimed by Clark to be in him under his agreement of February, 1883, with Beaven. Martley, therefore, if not claiming the 50 inches of water from Carson's ditch under Carson and his water grant, could have no means whatever of obtaining any water to be diverted from Pavilion Creek into his Grange Farm unless through Clark's ditch by arrangement with him or by means of a ditch to be constructed by himself under a water grant to be obtained by him under the Land Ordinance of 1875. I find a difficulty upon the evidence, in the absence of any agreement between Martley and Clark for a partition between themselves of the waters of Pavilion Creek above the gorge by which it descends into the valley, to find Martley to have been a party with Clark in the committal by him of the injurious acts which Clark undoubtedly committed, although he was present on one occasion with Clark when the latter asserted title in himself in the Carson ditch and the waters therein, and that Carson had no interest whatever therein and committed acts which could only be justified by his succeeding in maintaining such his assertion of title to be well founded. What appears most singular in the case is, that while Clark asserts title in himself in the ditch and the water therein in virtue of the title of Beaven, the owner of the land granted to Martley by the letters patent of February, 1864, and that Carson has no right to any of such water, Martley also asserts the title to be in himself, and that Carson never had any title save under him and by an agreement which, being verbal, he contends is valueless, and it is in virtue of this absolute right claimed to be in himself that Martley justifies putting into the ditch at the Island creek the box which he admits he did put in in June, 1884.\nA letter of the 13th May, 1884, from Carson to Martley, and a letter of the 19th May from Martley to Carson, and a notice of the 30th May from Martley to Carson were produced at the trial but are not in the appeal case before us. If we had them they would probably throw some light upon what Martley did. He says that up to the receipt by him of Carson's letter of the 13th May it was a matter of indifference to him whether Clark had a sufficient supply of water or not, but that from the receipt of that letter he let Clark have all the advantage he could\u2014that is to say by his box in the Carson ditch. That letter I understand contained an objection made by Carson to Martley letting Clark, in addition to the streams on his, Clark's, own farm, have the water taken from his, Carson's, ditch by Martley's box, insisting that under the award Martley had only a right to draw it for his own use.\nI collect also from the short notes of evidence before us that Martley's letter of the 19th May conveyed notice to Carson that he would terminate after the 1st June what he considered to be Carson's title to have any water from the Carson ditch, namely, his, Martley's, verbal permission to take the water from his ditch. I gather also from the notes of evidence that some time in the month of June Martley's supply of water from the Carson ditch at the crossing of Island creek was cut off, and Martley admits that he opened the Carson ditch and put in another box capable of taking 50 inches of water in lieu of the one so removed ; and although this act in itself would be open to the construction that it was done in assertion of a right acquired under Carson in virtue of his water grant, the agreement and award, Martley admits on the record that it was not done upon any such ground but was done under a claim of absolute right and title in himself wholly independently of Carson whose right and title he utterly denies and repudiates.\nNow if it clearly appeared that Carson's reason for removing the box which had been in his ditch at Island Creek was Martley's sharing with Clark the water so drawn off, and if Martley had replaced that box by putting in the one which he admits having put in, in assertion of a right to do so in virtue of Carson's water grant, his agreement and award, the case would have been very different and he might have some show of justice in support of his claim ; but instead of so doing (in accordance, as it appears to me, with his true position and his interests) he asserts title in himself to all the water in the ditch to the exclusion of Carson, and denies and repudiates the title under which Carson had enjoyed the ditch for 15 years, and under which alone Martley himself could substantiate any claim to the 50 inches of water. This assertion of title in himself and repudiation of Carson's appears to have been made before Carson removed the box which Martley replaced, and was naturally calculated to irritate Carson and to invite his interference in assertion of his title ; and now Martley puts upon the record that absolute assertion of the title in himself.\nThis his contention of title being incapable of being sustained judgment must be against him upon that point carrying all costs ; and as the evidence does not, I think, sufficiently bring home to Martley complicity with Clark in the committal of the wrongful acts which he committed the ends of justice will, I think, be obtained by rendering judgment in favour of Carson against Martley for $10 and dismissing his counter-claim with costs.\nAs to Eholt he failed to show any water grant ; he might therefore have been non\u2014suited and as the whole matter in dispute was in reality as to Carson's title to the ditch and his 200 inches of water under his water grant, and the consequences resulting from its being or not being established, I think it will be sufficient simply to dismiss Eholt's claim with such costs to be paid by him as either of the defendants may have been, if either of them was, put to solely attributable to Eholt being a plaintiff, in excess of the costs occasioned by and having relation to the contention between Carson and the defendants. Our judgment therefore, in my opinion, must be to vary the judgment as above, and to dismiss the appeals of the defendants with costs to be paid to the plaintiff Carson.\nAppeal dismissed with costs[5].\nSolicitors for appellant Martley : Davie & Pooley.\nSolicitor for appellant Clark : Charles Wilson.\nSolicitors for respondents : Drake, Jackson & Helmcken.\n[1] L.

The Queen v. The Bank of Nova Scotia (11 Can. S. C. R. 1) followed. Gwynne J. dissenting.\nUnder s. 79 of the Bank Act (R.S.C. c. 120) the note-holders have the first lien on the assets of an insolvent bank in priority to the Crown. Strong and Taschereau JJ. dissenting. But see the present Bank Act (53 V. c. 31 s. 53) passed since this decision.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] in favour of the demandant on a special case.\nThe Maritime Bank was insolvent and the government of New Brunswick was a creditor. The questions presented to the court by the special case were:\u2014\n\"1. Is the Provincial Government entitled to payment in full by preference over the note-holders of the said bank?\n\"2. If not, is the Provincial Government entitled to payment in full over the other depositors and simple contract creditors of the bank?\" The Liquidators of the Maritime Bank of the Dominion of Canada v. The Receiver-General of the Province of New Brunswick.\nThe Supreme Court of New Brunswick decided both these questions in favour of the government and the liquidators appealed to this court.\nThe preference indicated by the first question is now settled by the Bank Act, 53 Vic. ch. 31, sec. 53, which makes the outstanding notes the first charge on the assets of an insolvent bank, claims of the Dominion Government the second charge and claims of the Government of a province the third charge. In the case of The Maritime Bank v. The Queen[2], the Supreme Court of Canada held that the Bank Act then in force, R. S. C. ch. 120, did not give the noteholders a lien in priority to the Crown.\nThe only substantial question raised by this appeal is: Does the provincial government represent the Queen so as to entitle it to priority of payment in full over other creditors of the bank?\nA. A. Stockton and Palmer for the appellants. The provincial government does not represent Her Majesty in the exercise of prerogative rights since confederation. Todd on Parliamentary Government in England[3]; Cox on the Institution of English Governments[4].\nPrerogative cannot be created by statute. Watson's Constitution of Canada[5].\nThe learned counsel referred also to the following authorities: Mercer v. Atty. Gen. of Ontario[6]; United States v. State Bank of North Carolina[7]; United States v. Bryan[8]; Lenoir v. Ritchie[9]; Exchange Bank v. The Queen[10].\nBlair, Atty. Gen. of New Brunswick, and Barker Q. C., for the respondent cited Th\u00e9berge v. Landry[11]; The Queen v. Bank of Nova Scotia[12]; Sloman v. The Governor of New Zealand[13].\nSTRONG J.\u2014This case raises the same question as to priority which was raised in the The Maritime Bank v. The Queen[14] and also another question. As to priority I refer, as in the former case, to The Queen v. The Bank of Nova Scotia (1). As to the second question, the right of a province to exercise and enjoy this prerogative of the Crown, I adhere to what I said during the argument, that there can be no doubt that the provinces have this right. I think the appeal should be wholly dismissed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014The questions raised on this appeal are as follows:\n1. Is the provincial government entitled to payment in full by preference over the note-holders of the said bank?\n2. If not, is the provincial government entitled to payment in full over the other depositors and simple contract creditors of the bank?\nOn the first I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed, and on the second that it should be dismissed.\nI fully concur in the reasons given by Mr. Justice Patterson in support of his conclusion. No costs should be given to either party.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014As I have said in the preceding case I do not see it possible, in view of the wording of the Interpretation Act, to construe the Banking Act as excluding Her Majesty's prerogative rights. I think that the Crown has priority over the note-holders.\nThe appeal on this point should be dismissed.\nAs to the question whether the provincial government is entitled to preference over the other creditors of the bank I would also dismiss the appeal and answer this question in the affirmative as it has been in the court below. In my opinion under the B.N.A. Act the executive power in the provinces is, as a general rule, vested with the same rights and privileges in the administration of the functions, powers and duties thereto assigned under this act as are attached to analogous functions, powers and duties of the executive authority in England. Such was my opinion when, twelve years ago in the Superior Court at Montreal, I determined Church v. Middlemiss[15] and the appellant has failed to change my views on the question, though I admit now that in order to reach this conclusion it is not necessary to hold, as I did in that case, that Her Majesty forms part of the provincial executive authority.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the appeal in this case should be allowed, and that both of the questions submitted in it should be answered in the negative as well for the reasons given by me in the case of The Liquidators of the same Bank v. The Queen[16] as for other reasons. If for the reasons therein given by me the prerogative privilege insisted on does not exist in the interest of the Dominion Government, it cannot in my opinion exist for the benefit of the governments of any of the provinces of the Dominion. However properly by reason of the nature of the constitution given to the Dominion debts due to the Dominion Government may be regarded as debts due to Her Majesty, I can see nothing in the constitution of the provinces of the Dominion which makes debts due to the provincial governments to be, or which requires them to be regarded as being, debts due to Her Majesty, and certainly there is nothing in my opinion which, assuming them to be debts due to Her Majesty, attaches to them the application of the royal prerogative of priority in payment.\nThere is a very distinctly marked difference between the constitution given by the British North America Act to the Dominion of Canada, and that given to the several provinces of the Dominion. As to the constitution of the Parliament of the Dominion the act expressly declares that the Parliament shall consist of \"The Queen\u2014an Upper House called the Senate\u2014and the House of Commons,\"[17] and the Executive Government and authority of and over Canada\u2014that is the Dominion\u2014is declared to continue and be vested in the Queen. The intent of these provisions in my opinion was, and their effect also was, to constitute the Dominion of Canada an integral, and subject only to the provisions of the British North America Act an independent, portion of the British Empire of which the Queen is the executive head and of whose Parliament Her Majesty is an integral and independent part equally as she is, and in the same sense as she is, of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. How different are the terms of the act which define the constitution of the provinces of the Dominion.\nIn the first place, the Lieutenant-Governor of the several provinces is no longer appointed by Her Majesty but by the Governor General in Council and he holds office during the pleasure of the Governor General, subject to this qualification that he shall not be removable within five years from his appointment except for cause assigned which shall be communicated to him in writing within one month after the order for his removal is made, and shall be communicated by message to the Senate and to the House of Commons within one week thereafter, if the Parliament is then sitting, and if not, then within one week after the commencement of the next session of the Parliament. Secondly, the legislatures of the provinces are made to consist of \"the Lieutenant-Governor and one House styled the Legislative Assembly of Ontario\" in the province of Ontario; and in the other provinces of \"the Lieutenant-Governor and two houses styled the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly.\"\nTo the passing of acts by these legislatures Her Majesty is no party, nor is her name necessary to be used as assenting thereto.\nWhile as to the Dominion of Canada the constitutional charter expressly provides that (1):\nIt shall he lawful for the Queen by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons to make laws[18], &c.\nThe provision as to the provinces is that:\nIn each province \"the Legislature,\" that is to say, in Ontario, \"The Lieutenant-Governor and Legislative Assembly of Ontario,\" and in the other provinces, \"The Lieutenant-Governor, the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly,\" \"may make laws, &c.\"\nAnd whereas with respect to the Dominion it is enacted that, when a bill passed by the Houses of the parliament is presented to the Governor General for the Queen's assent, he shall declare either that he assents in the Queen's name, or that he withholds the Queen's assent, or that he reserves the bill for the signification of the Queen's pleasure, the provision made in respect of the provinces is that, when the bill passed by the Houses of the legislature of a province is presented to the Lieutenant-Governor for the Governor General's assent, he shall declare that he assents thereto in the Governor General's name, or that he withholds the Governor. General's assent, or that he reserves the bill for the signification of the Governor General's pleasure, and power is given to the Governor General of the Dominion in Council to disallow any act within one year after a certified copy of the act assented to by the Lieutenant-Governor shall have been transmitted to the Governor General by the Lieutenant-Governor upon whom is imposed the duty of transmitting to the Dominion Government certified copies of all bills assented to by him. It thus appears that Her Majesty's name is not necessary to be inserted in any act of the provincial legislatures, nor is her assent to such acts made necessary. True it is that the legislature of the province of Quebec in passing acts makes use of the form following:\u2014\nHer Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislature of Quebec, enacts as follows.\nOr in other words supplying for the word \"Legislature\" the several parts of which by the British North America Act it is composed, the form would read thus:\u2014\nHer Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lieutenant-Governor, the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly of Quebec, enacts as follows.\nAnd the Legislature of Ontario makes use of the form following:\u2014\nHer Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows.\nThus omitting the \"Lieutenant-Governor,\" who by the British North America Act is expressly declared to be a part of the \"Legislature.\"\nThis use of Her Majesty's name is not required by the British North America Act; as being but matter of form it may be immaterial, but it certainly is not at all necessary to the validity of the acts of the provincial legislatures which would be quite valid and in perfect conformity with the British North America Act, if in all the provinces of the Dominion, whose legislatures have two houses, the form used should be the same as that in use in the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick viz.:\u2014\nBe it enacted by the Lieutenant-Governor, the Legislative Council and Assembly as follows:\u2014\nAnd in those provinces whose legislatures consist of but one House:\nBe it enacted by the Lieutenant-Governor and Legislative Assembly of,\nOr if the form following which would apply to all the Provinces should be that used:\nThe Legislature of the Province of enacts. &c., &c.\nThen upon the provinces is conferred the peculiarly democratic privilege, which is qualified only by the veto power vested in the Dominion Government, of amending from time to time, notwithstanding anything in the British North America Act, the constitution of the provinces except as regards the office of Lieutenant-Governor.\nIt cannot be contended that this royal prerogative right which is invoked, and which may be exercised always to the prejudice and sometimes it may be to the ruin of all the private creditors of a bankrupt corporation, is a necessary incident to these provincial governments, for it surely cannot be argued with any show of reason that this royal prerogative is necessary to the healthy working of governments which partake so much of the democratic element as these provincial constitutions do. To my mind it seems to involve a singular inconsistency that this prerogative right which in its nature is so injurious to the public and is asserted as an ancient common law incident to royalty should be claimed by governments of modern creation and of so democratic a character as are the governments of the provinces of this Dominion. The provincial legislatures have under the British North America Act, unquestionably in my opinion, without any consent of Her Majesty, undoubted power to make all debts due to the provincial governments respectively to be due and payable to, and recoverable by and in the name of, the person for the time being filling the office of Provincial Treasurer or Attorney-General, or the Lieutenant-Governor or any other officer of the provincial government; but inasmuch as Her Majesty is not by the British North America Act, as for the reasons above given I am of opinion that she is not, a party to the passing of any act of the provincial legislatures constituted as they are by the British North America Act, if debts due to the several provincial governments should be regarded as debts due to Her Majesty to which the royal prerogative relied upon necessarily attaches, as is contended, the effect would be that it would be impossible for the provincial legislatures ever to pass such an act as I have suggested, upon the principle upon which the province of New Brunswick now rests its claim for priority in payment of the debts due to it over all the other creditors of this insolvent bank, namely, that the rights of the Crown cannot be affected otherwise than by an express provision contained in an act of parliament to which Her Majesty is a party. If we should so hold we should, in my opinion, without any power or authority so to do, be crippling in a very marked manner the power of the provincial legislatures over a matter which, in my opinion, is beyond all doubt placed under their jurisdiction and control. I can, therefore, as I have already said, see nothing in the British North America Act which requires that debts due to the several provinces should be regarded as debts due to Her Majesty, but much which, as it appears to me, leads to the contrary conclusion, and as the only object to be gained by regarding such debts to be debts due to Her Majesty would seem to be to lay a foundation for the introduction into the constitution of the provinces of this Dominion of a vexatious and obnoxious privilege not introduced by the terms of the British North America Act\u2014wholly un suited to the constitution of the provinces\u2014unjust to their inhabitants and repugnant to the spirit of the age\u2014we are, in my opinion, justified in arriving at the conclusion that debts due to the several provinces of this Dominion are not debts due to Her Majesty, and that therefore the prerogative relied upon cannot be invoked and exercised by or on behalf of the government of any of those provinces.\nAssuming, however, debts due to the several provincial governments to be debts due to Her Majesty, the prerogative privilege relied upon is not, in my opinion, attached to them. It is contended by the province of New Brunswick that the prerogative relied upon is attached to, and can be exercised by its government in respect of debts due it, although the prerogative privilege should not be attached to, or be exercisable in respect of, debts due to either of the provinces of Quebec or Ontario or even in respect of debts due to the Dominion Government. This point of vantage asserted on behalf of the Government of the province of New Brunswick is claimed under sec. 64 of the British North America Act but that section has, in reality, no bearing whatever, in my opinion, upon the point under consideration.\nAs the old province of Canada was by the British North America Act divided into two provinces of the Dominion of Canada as constituted by that act, namely, the provinces of Quebec and Ontario, sec. 63 of the act provides for the formation of the Executive Council, that is to say of the executive authority, of those provinces, by declaring of what officers of the provincial governments those councils shall be composed. The provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia as they respectively existed prior to the passing of the British North America Act had executive councils composed of certain officers of the goverments of those respective provinces. The limits of the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, as provinces of the Dominion of Canada as constituted by the British North America Act, were declared to be the same as the limits of the old provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia respectively had been; it was necessary in like manner to provide for the constitution or composition of the executive authority, that is to say of the executive councils, of those provinces as constituted provinces of the Dominion under the British North America Act, and for this purpose sec. 64 was inserted in the act the sole object and effect of which is to enact that until a different provision shall be made by the new provinces respectively as constituted under the act, the persons who constituted the executive councils of the old provinces of Nova Scotia respectively, shall continue to be the executive authority of the new provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia as constituted under the act, but subject to the provisions of the act; thus placing the executive authority of all the provinces upon a precisely similar footing. The section is supplemental simply to sec. 63 and not, as was contended, to sec. 65 with the subject of which sec. 64 has no relation whatever.\nIt is impossible to contend that by reason of anything contained in the British North America Act the constitution given to any one of the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick, or Nova Scotia is in any respect different from that given to any of the others, or that such an incongruity exists in the act as that one of the provinces constituted by it a province of the Dominion of Canada can exercise a prerogative of the crown which cannot equally be exercised by all of the provinces of the Dominion, and as already shown in the case of The Liquidators of this Bank v. the Queen[19] in the claim of the Dominion Government, the prerogative relied upon does not exist in, and cannot be asserted in the interest of, either of the provinces of Quebec or Ontario, it is impossible that it can consistently be recognized as capable of being asserted in the interest of the province of New Brunswick. Having regard to the nature of the new constitutions given by the British North America Act to the several provinces of the Dominion the only conclusion which, in my opinion, for the reasons I have given, is warranted is that the application of the prerogative relied upon to the case of debts due to any of the provincial governments is necessarily excluded.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The debt in question is for a deposit in the bank of $35,000 of the public moneys of the province of New Brunswick. The questions for the opinion of the court are:\u2014\n1. Is the provincial government entitled to payment in full by preference over the note-holders of the said bank?\n2. If not, is the provincial government entitled to payment in full over the other depositors and simple contract creditors of the bank?\nThe first question is answered in the negative, contrary to the opinion of the court below, by what I have said in the appeal of the present appellants against the Queen (1) respecting the claim made in that case on the part of the Crown for priority over the note-holders.\nThe second question divides itself into two: First, the right of the Crown to priority; secondly, the right of the provincial government to claim that priority in the name of the Crown or by virtue of the prerogative. On both of these branches of the question I agree with the court below.\nThe general right of the Crown has been affirmed in this court in The Queen v. The Bank of Nova Scotia[20] on grounds which, in my judgment, apply to the provincial governments as well as to that of the Dominion, and there is nothing in the Bank Act[21], which act was not in question in the case referred to, or in the Winding-Up Act[22], to limit the right in respect of such assets of the bank as may remain after all outstanding notes are paid.\nOn the question of the right of the provincial government to exercise the prerogative in question I cannot add anything by way of argument or illustration to what has been said in the court below by the Chief Justice and by Mr. Justice Fraser.\nI agree, as I have said, in the conclusion arrived at. It is, in my opinion, borne out by the cases referred to and by the spirit and tenor of the British North America Act, and is in accord with the views which prevail in the bulk of the decisions under the statute although all the opinions expressed, particularly in the earlier cases, may not have been in harmony.\nI shall not attempt to make an independent examination of the cases, and shall merely add that the same apprehension of the status of the provinces on which the judgment proceeds will be found evidenced in the two recent decisions of the Judicial Committee, and in the language of the judgments delivered by Lord Watson, in The St. Catharines Milling Co. v. The Queen[23] and The Attorney-General of British Columbia v. The Attorney-General of Canada[24]; not that these cases bear directly on the point in hand; they are merely instances of late utterances where provincial governments are spoken of in the same terms as the Dominion Government as representing the Queen.\nI have already quoted the questions proposed in the special case for the opinion of the court.\nAt the argument in the court below the case was amended by agreement by stating that the Dominion Government was a simple contract creditor of the bank. That fact does not strike me as of any importance. The circumstance that the same debtor, whether an individual or a corporation, may owe for moneys belonging to the Imperial Government and to one or more colonies or provinces cannot possibly derogate from the rights which the Imperial Government or any one of the colonies or provinces would have if it were the sole public creditor. The very case existed in Re Oriental Bank Corporation[25] in which the motion was on behalf of the Treasury, and on behalf of the premier and treasurer of the Colony of Victoria, and the law officers for the Crown colonies of Ceylon, the Mauritius and Natal.\nOn the first question I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed, although if the second had been the only question my opinion would be that it should be dismissed.\nI would give no costs of appeal to either party, the liquidators of course having their costs out of the estate.\n*Appeal allowed without posts as to priority over note-holders, and dismissed without costs as to priority over other creditors.\nSolicitor for appellants: A.

The defendants pleaded a number of pleas, one being that they undertook to carry the goods under a special contract by the terms of which their liability was to be limited to wearing appared not exceeding in value $100; that they were under no liability as to the goods which were not wearing apparel; and they paid into court $100 as all they were chargeable with under such special contract.\nThe plaintiff made two replications to this plea, the second of which was that the special contract did not relieve the company from liability as the alleged loss and damage arose from the negligence of the defendants within the meaning of the Consolidated Railway Act of 1879 sec. 25, sub-sec. 4.\nThe defendants demurred to this replication on the grounds, among others, that it was a departure from the declaration which was in contract while the replication was in tort, and that the statute did not prevent them showing the terms of the special contract. The demurrer was argued before Mr. Justice Killam and allowed, and on appeal to the full court his judgment was affirmed. The plaintiff then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.
