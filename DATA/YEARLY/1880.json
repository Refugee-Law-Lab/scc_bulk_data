J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nLIFE INSURANCE MISTAKE AS TO AMOUNT INSURED PREMIUM PAROL EVIDENCE COSTS.\nAction to recover the amount of a policy of insurance issued by the appellants for the sum of $2,000, payable at the death of the respondent, or at the expiration of eight years, if he should live till that time. The premium mentioned in the policy was the sum of $163.44. to be paid annually, partly in cash and partly by the respondent's notes. The appellants by their plea alleged that the insurance had been effected for $1,000 only and that the \"policy had by mistake been issued for $2000 * that as soon as the mistake had been discovered they had offered a policy for $1,000, and that previous to the institution of the action they had tendered to the respondent the sum of $832.97, being the amount due, which sum, with $25.15 for costs (which had not been tendered) they brought into court. Since October, 1869, when a new policy was offered, the premiums were paid by the respondent and accepted by the appellants, under an agreement that their rights would not thereby be prejudiced, and that they would abide by the decision of the courts of justice to be obtained after the insurance should have become due and payable. Parol evidence was given to show how the mistake occurred and it was established that the premium paid was in accordance with the company's rates for a $10000 policy.\nHeld,\u20141st. That the insurance effected was for $1,000 only, and that the policy had by mistake been issued for $2,000.\n2nd. As to costs: that appellants not having tendered with their plea costs accrued up to and inclusive of its production, should pay to the respondent the costs incurred in the court of first instance. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), whereby the judgment of the Superior Court sitting at Montreal in favor of appellants, was reversed, and appellants held as to an insurance of $2,000 on a policy which they claim issued by error for $2000 instead of for $1,000.\nThe following special case was agreed to for the opinion of the court:\u2014\n\u201cThe action is founded upon an endowment participating policy, issued by the appellants, dated the thirteenth of October, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, whereby it is declared that the appellants in consideration of an annual premium of one hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-four cents, assured the respondents life in the amount of two thousand dollars until eight years from the date of the policy.\n\"The policy stipulates that the company shall pay the said sum of two thousand dollars to the respondent his executors, administrators or assigns, within ninety days after due notice of the death of him, the respondent, or if the respondent should survive eight years, then the amount insured should be paid to him.\n\"The policy entitled respondent to participation in the profits and dividends accruing to persons holding endowment policies in the company.\n\"The premiums were paid on the half note system ; under which the respondent during the eight years following the thirteenth day of October, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, paid half of the premiums in cash, and gave notes for the remaining half, inclusive of interest at six per cent.\n\"Having survived the respondent, at the termination of the eight years, claimed upon the company for the sum of two thousand dollars and such dividends and profits as had accrued in his favor. \"The company resisted payment for the reasons stated below. Thereupon the respondent entered the present action, whereby he prays that appellants be condemned to pay him the sum of two thousand dollars with interest from the thirteenth of October eighteen hundred and seventy-four and to render him a true and faithful account of his share and proportion of the profits and dividends made and declared by the company within the said period of eight years, and to pay over to the respondent his share and proportion of said profits, and in default of said account, to pay and satisfy to the plaintiff the further sum of five hundred dollars.\n\"The appellants plead that they never insured the respondent for two thousand dollars. That the policy issued in error for the sum of two thousand dollars instead of one thousand dollars, for which latter amount alone it is claimed the respondent was insured. The plea sets out the alleged circumstances under which this alleged error occurred it further set out a tender of the ninth of December, eighteen hundred and seventy-four. With the plea were deposited the following sums : Eight hundred and thirty-two dollars and ninety-seven cents, the result of the statement on the protest of the ninth of December one dollar and fifty-three cents for interest, and twenty-five dollars and fifteen cents, alleged amount of costs due up to but not including return.\n\"The respondent answered specially, alleging that he had always repudiated the pretensions of the tender of the thirteenth day of October eighteen hundred and sixty-nine, setting out the protest of the day following and declaring the tender made by the plea insufficient.\n\"There is a concurrence as to the following facts:\n\"The receipt for the first premium is contained in the policy.\n\"The receipt issued by the company for the premium paid on the thirteenth of October, eighteen hundred and sixty-seven is as follows:-\n\"\u00c6TNA LIFE INSURANCE OF HARTFORD, CT.\n\"Assets, Jan. 1st, 1867, $4,401,833.86.\n\"Hartford, 13th Oct., 1867.\n\"Received from W.

Lighthall, N.P., served a notaries protest on respondent, alleging that by an oversight and by inadvertence a policy was issued to him by the company for the sum of two thousand dollars instead of one thousand dollars, and that the error had only very recently been discovered ; and the protest further demanded the return of this policy and tendered another for the sum of one thousand dollars. The respondent claims that the So offered was in any event incomplete, through its not being countersigned by the local agents, a formality, according to respondent's pretensions, rigorously required by its terms as a condition precedent of effectiveness.\n\"On the thirteenth October eighteen hundred and sixty-nine, the day following the above protest, respondent, by a counter and answering protest served upon the company maintained his right to an insurance and policy of two thousand dollars and tendered the premium due on that date ; by this protest respondent further declared that he would deposit the premium for the benefit of the company in some chartered bank, in the event of a refusal to receive it and further that he would hold the policy in full force and effect.\nFrom this date to the maturing of the policy on the thirteenth October, eighteen hundred and seventy-four, the respondent continued to pay, and the appellants to receive, the annual payments, without prejudice to, and under reserve of all rights on either side. A letter to this effect passed from the company to the respondent as follows:\n\"\u01fctna Life Insurance Company,\n\"Canada Branch Office\n\"20, Great St. James St.\n\"S.

Pedlar & Co.\n\"Managers.\"\n\"This letter was assented to and acted upon by both parties.\n\"The policy matured on the thirteenth of October eighteen hundred and seventy-four. Respondent filed his claim for principal and profits as due on a two thousand dollar policy, and on the twenty-sixth of November following, instituted the present action, returnable on the tenth of December.\n\"On the day previous to the return, appellants, by a notaries tender and protest, served on respondent, set out the details of the profits and of the amounts loaned from their point of view, and tendered respondent the sum of eight hundred and thirty-two dollars and ninety-seven cents, as the balance thus shewn to be due together with the further sum of one dollar and fifty-three cents for interest.\n\"It also asserted the appellants' readiness to pay costs incurred.\n\"The endorsement on the original application was for two thousand dollars at the time the appellants allege they discovered the alleged mistake this was altered to one thousand dollars.\n\u201c In the Court of Queen's Bench doubts existed in the minds of the judges as to the exact amount die respondent for profits under either view of the case. To obviate a return of the record to the Court below for the purpose of obtaining more definite evidence on this point, the parties filed the following admissions :\u2014\n\"1st. That the amount due by appellant to respondents, and to be deducted from any sums payable under said policy, is six hundred and fifty-three dollars and seventy-six cents.\n\"2nd. That the profits on said policy, regarding it as a two thousand dollar policy, would, under the system of distribution of profits followed by said company at the date of the issue of said policy amount to four hundred and eighty-six dollars and seventy-three cents, respondents claiming that they were under no obligation to continue said plan.\n\"3rd. That under the system introduced and adopted by the said Company in the year eighteen hundred and seventy-one, but which appellant protests he never assented to, no profits are divisible in respect of said policy, if it be regarded as for two thousand dollars.\n\"4th. That if said policy is held to be a one thousand dollar policy, the profits upon it under either of said systems would amount to four hundred and eighty-six dollars and seventy-three cents.\n\"The foregoing admissions are under the reserve of the right of respondent to appeal from any judgment rendered on the basis that said policy is to be held a policy for two thousand dollars.\n\"By the judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench, the judgment of the Superior Court was reversed and the company condemned to pay respondent the sum of one thousand eight hundred and thirty two dollars and ninety-seven cents with interest from the twenty-sixth of November, eighteen hundred and seventy-four, and also the costs of suit in the Superior Court, and Court of Queen's Bench. Dorion, C. J., and Tessier, X, dissented.\n\"From the pleadings, admissions, papers and evidence of record, the following question results: Is respondent entitled to recover as upon a policy of two thousand dollars or not, and to receive the amount awarded for profits by the Court of Queen's Bench?\n\"It is agreed that the original record is to be transmitted to the Supreme Court with right to either party to refer to it.\nMr. Bethune, Q. C, and Mr. Trenholme for appellants:\nOur first proposition is that appellants ought not to be condemned as for an insurance of $2,000 on a policy which they claim it is clearly established issued purely by error for $2,000 instead of for $1000 and is not in accordance with the antecedent proposal and bargain for insurance as understood by both parties; certainly as understood by appellants, and as it ought to have been understood by respondent.\nThe company never intended to give more than a $1,000 policy for a yearly premium of $168.44. Although the memorandum of amount of terms in the margin of the application does not alone override the policy, yet it is part of the contract, and that, supported as it is by parol evidence, by the premium paid, the published rates of the company, the contemporaneous entry made by the agent in this register of the correct amount, and other facts and circumstances, entitles the appellants to succeed. Philipps on insurance sec. 68, and 2 Arnould 588, show the margin notes are to be taken as part of the contract.\nThe present case stands on a very different footing from that of an insurance company seeking to turn the loss on the assured after irreparable loss has occurred. It is the case of a company, before loss and while the parties can be practically replaced in their former rights, being compelled to perform a contract it never intended and never did really assent to. The respondent is not contending de damno vitando but de lucro captando. He seeks to obtain $1,000 at the expense of appellants, for which he never gave any consideration, and to profit to that extent by the inadvertence or innocent mistake of the agent who filled up his application at his request. All the equities are on the side of appellants.\nCourts will not compel a party to specifically perform a contract which he never intended to enter into or which he would not have entered into had its true nature and effect been understood d and will act on purely parol evidence.\nKerr on Fraud and Mistake ([1]) ; Principal of Harris v. Pepperell ([2]); Webster v. Cecil ([3]); Wood v. Searth([4]); Calverley v Williams ([5]); Brown v. Blackwell ([6]).\nIf appellants reasonably understood the original proposal and bargain for insurance to be for $1,000, and respondent for $2,000, there is error in corpore and no contract for want of consensus in idem ; Trigge v. Lavall\u00e9e (in the Privy Council) ([7]) ; Fowler v. Scottish Eq. Ass. Society ([8]).\nThe principle of relief against one's own mistake is recognized in every portion of the Civil Code of Quebec, which goes further than the English law, and relieves against the negligence implied by ignorance of law.\nSee Articles 1047\u20141052 ; 1245 ; 2258.\nVide Leprohon v. The Mayor of Montreal ([9]) ; Whitney v. Clark ([10]). Mr. Laflamme, Q. C., and Mr. C. P. Davidson, Q. C. for respondent :\nThere is a point as to costs. The action was returned on the 10th Dec.,1874. On the 9th, defendants made a formal offer of $834.50, being $832.97 for insurance, and $1.50 for interest. No sum of money why tendered for costs.\nThere is an effort made by the plea to conceal this fatal defect. Breaking completely away from the actual contents of the notaries document, it alleges that, in addition to the principal sum, there was by it \" also tendered the costs then due to-wit: $2515 which said tender of debt and costs the said defendants hereby repeat.\"\nIt would, therefore, appear to be incontrovertible that the plea ought to have tendered costs accrued up to and inclusive of its production. These amounted to $50.15 and not $25.15.\nNo sufficient tender was, as a consequence, ever made to respondent, and it is respectfully submitted that whatever the result of the issues between the parties the judgment of the Superior Court discloses a manifest error in adjudging costs since plea pleaded against said plaintiff.\nOn the merits, the only evidence of error is the amount of premium written in the marginal note. Now I challenge the learned counsel for appellants to cite any authority to show that a marginal note not signed or initialed can alter the contents of a signed document. See arts. 294 C. P. C. and Journal du Palais Verbo \"Renvoi\" ([11]).\nIn discussing the question of mistake, we contend :\nFirst.\u2014The mistake has to be shown by incontrovertible evidence and must have been mutual. Second \u2011 If a man manifests an intention to another party so as to induce him to contract he will be estopped from denying that the intention manifested by him was his real intention. Third There has been such acquiescence and laches on the part of the appellants, as to prevent them from effectively pleading mistake, even had it existed at the creation of the policy. The evi-dence of record as to what took place between Brodie and Orr, at the interview which brought about an agreement to insure, is of the most unsatisfactory kind.\nThe admissions by Orr as to what Brodie believed estops him. Meaning one thing and asserting another is not a mistake to be remedied.\nThe mistake of either party in expressing his intention, or in his motives, of which the other party has no knowledge, cannot affect an agreement. Kerr on Mistake and Fraud ([12]) ; Bordman v. Davidson ([13]).\nThe appellants have not presented or proved, with sufficient distinctness the amount due by them for dividends and profits. By the percentage plan of distribution in force at the date of the insurance the premium, irrespective of amount of policy, or its time of maturity, was the only basis on which profits were calculated and as a consequence, respondent's share could not be diminished by any increase in his policy.\nBut admitting error had been proved, this formal contract could not be rescinded, amended, or disturbed without special conclusions to that effect To affirm the principle in the words used by appellants' counsel in another case, where a similar point of procedure was under discussion \" as the defendants did not pray for its cancellation it must stand under the pleas uncancelled.\"\nThe learned counsel referred to Laurent ([14]) ; and Smith v. Hughes ([15]). RITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nI think the judgment of the Superior Court was, as to the amount right and should not have been reversed.\nThe application dated 13th October, 1866, states the desire of Wm. Brodes to effect an insurance with the \u01fctna Insurance Company in the sum of $2,00.0, the only reference in the body of the application as to premium -being in these words :\nAnd I further agree that the assurance hereby proposed shall not be binding on said company until the amount of premium as stated therein shall be received by the said company or by an accredited agent thereof in the lifetime of the said Wm. Brodie.\nIn the margin is the following:\nWhat kind of policy is desired?\nEndorsement at 30 with profits.\nAmount, $1,000\u2014Premium at age 22, $163.44.\nOrr, the agent of the defendants through whom this insurance was effected states the time, place and circumstances under which this application was written by him and signed by plaintiff thus:\nThe time was on the thirteenth day of October, eighteen hundred and sixty-six ; the place was at Mr. Brodie's store, corner of Bleury and Craig streets. About a month or so previously, I had spoken to Mr. Brodie about taking a policy, at which time he informed me that he would not apply again and risk being rejected as he had been a short time previously by an English company. I did not press him,strongly when I learned he had been rejected ; for, looking at his size I felt it would be useless. I called a number of times at his store to try and insure his partner, Mr. Parkyn, but I do not remember seeing Mr. Brodie again after the first interview until the thirteenth day of October above mentioned On that day I was pressing Mr. I'arkyn hard to insure, when he positively refused to do so, but added: u Here is a man that will insure talk to him.'' He alluded to Mr. Brodie, then sitting at the rear of the front office. I then addressed Mr. Brodie, saying to him that I had thought over his case and believed I could insure him on the endowment plan so that he could draw the money at the age of forty, if then living, or at previous death. He replied: \" That would suit me,\" or words to that effect, \" come in here,\" and, so saying, he went into the back office I followed and explained to him that two thousand dollars the amount he had applied for to the other company, would cost him about ninety-five dollars the first year, in cash, the gross premium at his age $179.32, payable half in cash, with six per cent on the balance. He liked this plan of insurance, and authorized me to write up his application therefor.\nThis I proceeded to -do, but while doing so, began to fear that my labour would be in vain with so heavy a man, on so long a term as eighteen years Mr Brodie was at that time about three hundred pounds weight and only five feet nine in height. In the course of the writing he assured me again that he would not apply under any consideration if there was the slightest doubt in my mind of his being accepted. Under these circumstances I told him it would be better to apply on a shorter term, namely, eight years instead of eighteen. He replied that he would rather have it for only eight years and asked what it would cost I answered that it would cost him about one hundred and seventy-three dollars in cash the first year, the full premium being $336.88 for two thousand dollars, payable at the age of thirty, his age at that time being twenty-two. He said that that was too much to pay. \" Well,\" I said, \" take one thousand on the eight year plan, so as to make sure of being accepted, and then there will be a chance of your being insured again : but if rejected now, there would be no use in applying to any company afterwards.\" At this time I had written the whole of the application, except the answers to the questions found along the side. Mr. Brodie having agreed to take the one thousand dollars on the eight-year term I struck out the letters \"even\" which formed part of the word \" eighteen \" in the fifth Une from the top of the application, so as to make it read, term of eight years. \" I should have also changed the word \" two \" found at the beginning of the third line, to the word \" one,\" but neglected to do so inadvertently. I then answered the printed questions in the margin in accordance with the desire of Mr. Brodie, to read as follows : What kind of policy is desired ?\" Endowment at thirty with profits. Amount $1,000. Premium at the age of twenty-two, $163.44.\" This completed the application; whereupon I turned it round to Mr. Brodie, and he signed it in the two places at the bottom and near the top. and I signed my name at the lower left hand corner. I then took the application to Dr. Bessey, the examiner of the company, whose report was favorable, and the result was the issue of a polic\u00eda which was delivered to Mr. Brodie, and the premium was collected by a clerk in the office named Christmas. I am positive that the figures $1,000 after the word \u201camount\" in the margin of the said application were written in the presence of the said Brodie, at the same time that the application was made out.\nThe amount of premiums paid by Brodie during the eight years term was in cash $653.76, and in promissory notes $653.76, making a total sum of $1,307.52.\nAccording to the established rates of the company, $16344 would be the premium on $1000 on the plan on which plaintiff's policy was issued, and the premium for a $2,000 policy on this same plan would, according to the evidence Of Orr, have been just double and this witness also states what would seem to be a self-evident proposition, that it is not possible for an insurance company to do business without incurring serious loss on every policy on the plan of granting a $2,000 policy payable in the terms of plaintiff's policy for the annual premium therein mentioned, the insured being of the age of 22 at the time of the insurance, and therefore a fortiori, there could by no possibility be profits which the endowment plan contemplated accruing due. The witness thus states the principle on which the rate of premium is based:\nIt is a general principle in life insurance as to endowment policies, which are always for fixed periods and not for life\u2014that the total amount of premiums to be collected should be sufficient to pay policy at maturity, after defraying all probable losses by death falling to the share of that policy during the term, and an equitable share of all the expenses, together with some considerable margin for possible contingencies, such as extraordinary death losses, losses, by investments, or by agents or employees, as well as a failure to receive the rate of interest upon which insurance transactions are based when the policy entitles the holder to profits the rates are usually from ten to twenty or twenty-five per cent higher than when a definite contract is made for so much money on so much insurance.\nAnother witness, Pedlar, speaks in these terms of the premium:\nQuestion. Do you know what the premium would be on a thousand dollar policy in your company, issued at the time the plaintiff\u2019s policy in this cause (October, 1866), on the eight year and downward(endowment) plan, and payable in terms of plaintiff's policy, the party insured being 22 years of age at the time of the insurance ?\nAnswer. Yes, $1.63,44 annual premium.\nQuestion. Could any insurance company issue two thousand dollars (policy) for that premium on the similar plan, payable in the same way, on the terms of plaintiff's policy?\nAnswer. It could not.\nQuestion would there be a loss on such an insurance?\nAnswer. There would be a loss equivalent to nearly a thousand dollars.\nQuestion. That is, if a company were to issue a $2,000.00 policy payable on that basis of an annual premium of $163.44, and did business on that system, it would lose nearly $1,000.00 on each policy ?\nAnswer. Yes.\nQuestion. How do you make that out? Approximately?\nAnswer. Without going into the actuarial figures, showing it to a decimal calculation, I would estimate that the policy, making proper allowances for deaths and reasonable expenses that there would be barely a sufficient premium to guarantee a profit to the company that would undertake the risk for $1000 00\nQuestion, What are the funds that a company has, in case of such insurance as that available ?\nAnswer. A company would only have available the amount of the premiums and interest thereon, less the expenses, including commissions and loss by death. The average deductions for expenses in insurance companies are about 20 p.c. In the case of the company defendant it is lower than the average say about 15 p. c.\nAnd Mr. Webster Superintendent of Life Insurance Agencies in Hartford, U. S. A., for the defendants, says:\nThe proper annual premium for a thousand dollar policy issued to a person, in October, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, at the age of twenty-two, payable in eight years, or sooner in case of death, that is, for such a policy as plaintiff's, was one hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-four cents. This was the established rates of the company, and in no case would or did the company depart from them, unless by error. No insurance company could issue such policies for two thousand dollars each for the above annual premium and remain solvent.\nReferring to the policy sued on in this cause plaintiff's Exhibit No* 1, I can say, without hesitation, that there is an error therein; in that the policy was issued for two thousand dollars, whereas the premium charged therein is only the premium for one thousand dollars ; of this there is no doubt.\nHad the above error been discovered, I can say the policy in question would never have left the office of the company.\nOrr shows how the mistake was first discovered by him, and communicated to the company thus:\nIt was with the aid of Mr. Brodie that the mistake was discovered from conversation that I had with him one day. The mistake was discovered by me, by the amount of the policy being mentioned as two thousand dollars by him in the course of a conversation at his store. I was congratulating him on his good health, and he said, yes, he was going to live to draw that two thousand dollars himself. I said, \"Two thousand you mean one thousand?\" Having a rate table in my pocket, I took it out to make sure that I was correct; I then declared again that it was only for one thousand, and asked him to show his policy, saying that if it was as he said, there was some mistake. The policy was not in the store, and so I promised to call next day when Mr. Brodie said that he would have it there for examination. I called the next day and found it, as he said, written out for two thousand dollars, but with the premium due on a one thousand dollar policy only. I then wrote to the company for a copy of the application in order to discover how the mistake had occurred So soon as I saw the copy of the application the whole circumstance of my writing the original and the circumstances connected with it came up fresh in my memory. On discovering how the error occurred the state of the case was communicated to the company, and I was directed. to tender the corrected policy which was done by notaries tender and protest filed.\nIt is true the witness Orr states that he has no doubt and had not then any when the discussion as to the policy took place but Mr Brodie believed that he was insured for $2,000. There was no appearance on the part of the plaintiff of wishing to withhold communication of it from him * and he adds:\u2014\nI have no doubt that the plaintiff always believed that he was insured for two thousand dollars, or certainly so until the mistake was brought to his knowledge. He has never admitted since then that he was wrong. I believe him to be perfectly honest in his belief, and do not think that plaintiff ever had any intention of defrauding or wronging the company. This is certainly rather irreconcilable with the fact if as stated by Orr, that on his suggesting to Brodie \" to take $1,000 on the 8 year plan \" and Brodie, as he says, \" having agreed to take the $1,000 on the 8 year term, \" he (witness) altered the application, and then answered the printed question in the margin, in accordance with the desire of Mr. Brodie, to read as follows:\nWhat kind of policy is desired? Endowment at 30 with profits amount $1,000, premium at age 22, $163.44.\nIt is only reconcilable with the idea that Brodie, having been very anxious to have a $2,000 policy, may have forgotten that a $1,000 policy had been finally agreed upon. However this may be, and notwithstanding this apparent discrepancy I cannot avoid the conclusion that there was on the part of the Insurance Company a mistake, that they never could have intended to insure, plaintiff for 8 years, for a yearly premium of $163,44, in the sum of $2,000 payable with profits if plaintiff lived.\nThe policy says:\nAnd the said Company do hereby promise and agree, to and with the said assured, his executors, administrators and assigns, well and truly to pay or cause to be paid the said sum insured, in the same currency in which the premium is paid, to the said assured, his executors, administrators or assigns, within ninety days after due notice and proof of the death of the said William Brodie, or if the said william Brodie shall survive eight years then the amount insured shall be paid to him and in either case all indebtedness of the party to the Companv shall be deducted from the sum insured.\nI cannot doubt the mistake arose in filling up the policy, and was caused by the amount in the application not having been altered when the terms of the application were finally settled between the agent Orr and Brodie.\nOrr's evidence is corroborated by the entry he produces m his application register; h\u00e9 says : The entry\u2014the defendants Exhibit \" A.B.C. \" filed at my cross-examination\u2014is a folio taken from the application register of the company, defendants, and was used in the Company's office here at the time of taking plaintiff\u2019s application; and for some four or five years afterwards.\nThe entry in said exhibit opposite the date, 13th October. 1866, being the twentieth written line on the page reads as follows each separate item of the line being under its appropriate printed heading : \" William Brodie,\" \" himself,\" \"22,\" \" $1,000.00,\" $1163.44,\" and endowment indicated by marks followed by \" 30.\"\nThe said entry or line, and every item thereof is in my handwriting. and was made immediately after having taken Mr. Brodie's application, but it was evidently not made with the application before me as the date of birth is not inserted\nI swear positively that I made the entry of $11,000.00\" in said line under the head amount of policy \" at the time and not later than a day or two at most after I took the application.\nThe \" 1,000 \" indicates and was an entry of the amount for which the policy was to be. and it refers to the same insurance as the application, defendants Exhibit No. 6.\nI think it is impossible to doubt that such a transaction as insuring a party for $2,000, on the plan and on the terms contemplated, for the premium named, would, if presented to an insurer or insurance company, be looked on as utterly unreasonable and absurd, and such as no sane business man would in the ordinary course of business enter into. Where relief is sought against an instrument signed in due course of business as a legitimate business transaction and where from the nature of the transaction, it is obvious a fair quid pro quo must have been contemplated, and if the inadequacy of the consideration is so very gross indeed as to shock the conscience and understanding of any reasonable man, the Court, I think, ought to infer, from that alone, mistake, inadvertence, or fraud.\nHow can we, then in a case of this kind where we have positive evidence of the mistake and a by no means unreasonable explanation of how it occurred, supported by an inference or presumption from the transaction itself strong if not almost irresistible, reject that evidence and that presumption, and say we think the contract set out in the policy was that which the assurer and assured both understood, agreed on and intended to be the contract between them and that there was no mistake.\nI agree with Chief Justice Dorion that the judgment of the Court below should not have been interfered with, except as to costs that the judgment of the Court of Appeal must be reversed, and the judgment of the Superior Court affirmed.\nSTRONG, J. :\u2014\nI concur with the Chief Justice that the judgment of the Court below ought to be reversed.\nFOURNIER, J. :\u2014\nL'Intime Brodie, demandeur en Cour inf\u00e9rieure, a poursuivi l'Appelante pour $2,000 sur une police d'assurance sur sa vie pour le terme de huit ans.\nL'Appelante a plaid\u00e9 \u00e0 cette action que la somme de $2000 a \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9e par erreur dans cette police au lieu de celle de $1,000 pour laquelle l'assurance a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite.\nLa d\u00e9fense all\u00e8gue en outre qu'aussit\u00f4t que l'erreur a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverte la compagnie a offert \u00e0 l'Intime par prot\u00eat en date du 13 octobre 1869, une autre police pour la somme de $1,000, et que par un autre prot\u00eat en date du 9 d\u00e9cembre 1874 la dite compagnie a offert la somme de $83297 montant qui serait d\u00fb sur une police d'assurance de $1,000 d'apr\u00e8s le syst\u00e8me de participation dans les profits, en m\u00eame temps qu'une somme de $2..15 pour les frais de l'action que l'Intime avait alors fait \u00e9maner sur sa police de $2000.

Y a-t-il eu erreur en \u00e9mettant une police de $2,000 au lieu de $1,000.\n20. Dans le cas o\u00f9 la police doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme n'\u00e9tant que do $1,000, les offres telles qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par le prot\u00eat du 9 d\u00e9cembre 1874, sontelles suffisantes et conformes \u00e0 la loi ?\nSur la premi\u00e8re question, je suis d'opinion qu'il y a eu erreur. Elle me para\u00eet expliqu\u00e9e d'une mani\u00e8re satisfaisante par le t\u00e9moignage do William Orr, l'agent de la compagnie qui a re\u00e7u l'application de Brodie pour] assurance qui fait le sujet de la pr\u00e9sente difficult\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s avoir dit qu'il avait d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 question d'une assurance pour 18 ans, il donne de la mani\u00e8re suivante les raisons qui ont fait adopter le terme de huit-ans ([16]).\nOn voit par l'application de Brodie product dans la cause que le chiffre de $2,000 y est mentionn\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant celui du montant d'assurance demand\u00e9 mais \u00e0 la marge on y trouve celui de $1,000, au sujet duquel 1 agent d\u00e9clare: I am positive that the figures $1,000 after the words \" amount\" in the margin of the said application were written in the presence of the said Brodie, at the same time that the application was made out.\nLe montant de la prime y est porte comme fix\u00e9 \u00e0 $163,34. Ce montant d'apr\u00e8s los taux fixes par la compagnie suivant lesquels elle fait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement ses affaires, est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment celui d'une assurance de $1,000 dans des conditions semblables \u00e0 celle dont il s'agit. La preuve \u00e9tablit de plus, d'une mani\u00e8re certaine, qu'il serait impossible \u00e0 la compagnie de faire des affaires en adoptant le taux quo veut faire pr\u00e9valoir l'Intime, sans perdre-pr\u00e8s de la moiti\u00e9 du montant de l'assurance sur chaque police. Pour faire voir qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9, dans ce cas, il faudrait au moins prouver quo la compagnie, pour quelque raison de faveur particuli\u00e8re, a d\u00e9rog\u00e9 \u00e0 ses taux ordinaires Au contraire, il para\u00eet que Brodie, \u00e0 cause de son poids excessif, n'\u00e9tait pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un sujet favorable pour une assurance sur la vie. D'ailleurs pour d\u00e9roger aux conditions ordinaires de la compagnie, il aurait fallu \u00e0 l'agent un pouvoir sp\u00e9cial qu'il n'avait pas.\nCette application ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e au bureau principal de la compagnie, la police fut \u00e9mise conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la somme mentionn\u00e9e dans le corps de la police, $2,000, au lieu de cello de $1,000 qui se trouvait en marge. Dans plusieurs entr\u00e9es faites au bureau de la compagnie \u00e0 Montreal concernant cette police, Orr l'agent, dit qu'elle y est mentionn\u00e9e comme une police de $1,000. Ces circonstances me portent \u00e0 croire qu'il y a eu erreur, et quo le montant de $1,000 au lieu de $2,000 aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre ins\u00e9r\u00e9 dans cette police.\nMais si la compagnie no voulait accorder qu'une police do $1,000 aux conditions ordinaires, et si do son c\u00f4t\u00e9 l'Intime no voulait pas en prendre une do moins do $2,000, pour la memo prime, parties n'ayant point donn\u00e9 leur consentement sure le m\u00eame objet, il ne devrait pas y avoir de contrat. C'est sans doute ce qui E devrait \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9, si les parties apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9couverte de cette erreur n'en \u00e9tait pas venu \u00e0 un arrangement pour s'en rapporter aux tribunaux pour d\u00e9cider la question du montant d'assurance. Les prot\u00eats respectifs des parties en date des 12 et 13 octobre 1869 la lettre de la compagnie du 13 octobre 1869 accusant r\u00e9ception de la prime et d\u00e9clarant que la police serait continu\u00e9e sous la r\u00e9serve en ces termes des droits de chaque partie \u00b0. \" the present premium and all future similar payments \" not in any manner to affect the rights and pretentions \" of the parties respectively in regard to the amount for \" which the policy should be held.\" Ces termes d\u00e9montrent de la part de la compagnie une intention d'ex\u00e9cuter un contrat. D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, Brodie en payant la prime pendant cinq ans, apr\u00e8s cette lettre avec l'espoir sans doute de faire maintenir la police pour $2,000 n'entendait certainement soumettre aux tribunaux que la question de savoir si la police devait \u00eatre de 2,000 an lieu de 1,000 et non pas faire d\u00e9clarer qu'en cons\u00e9quence du malentendu existant entra l' agent et lui, il n'y avait eu aucune assurance. Je crois avec les deux cours qui ont d\u00e9\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9es \u00e0 se prononcer sur cette cause, qu'il y a eu un contrat d'assurance, bien qu'elles n'aient \"pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d'accord sur le montant. D'ailleurs le special case contient \u00e0 ce sujet une d\u00e9claration des parties qui ne' laisse pas de doute sur cette question.\nEn cons\u00e9quence je suis d'avis qu'il y a en un contrat d'assurance entre les parties, et que la preuve \u00e9tablit que le montant de ce contrat \u00e9tait de $1, 000. Le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure accordant $832.97, comme le montant revenant \u00e0 l'Intime sur une assurance de $1,000 d'apr\u00e8s le syst\u00e8me adopt\u00e9, me para\u00eet correct sur ce point. Mais il contient une erreur evidente quant aux offres r\u00e9elles qui sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9es l\u00e9gales et suffisantes, erreur qui a eu l'effet d'entra\u00eener contre l'Intime une condamnation \u00e0 tous les d\u00e9pens.\nCette erreur a sans doute \u00e9t\u00e9 commise en prenant pour vraie l'all\u00e9gation du plaidoyer qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 offert \u00e0 l'Intime $25.15 pour ses frais avant l'entr\u00e9e de l'action en m\u00eame temps que la somme de $832.97 pour son assuranee. Le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ces deux sommes accompagnait le plaidoyer. Si ce fait ainsi plaid\u00e9 \u00e9tait prouv\u00e9, le jugement serait correct Mais en r\u00e9f\u00e9rant au prot\u00eat en date du 9 d\u00e9cembre 1874, on y voit que la somme de $832.97 est offered dans les formes voulues par l'art. 1163 C. 0.\" et les art. 538 et sec. C. P. C. mais quant aux frais, il n'en est pas ainsi. Le prot\u00eat ne contient que la d\u00e9claration que la compagnie est dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 payer les frais encourus par le procureur de Brodie ; elle est en ces termes \" and furthermore the said company are willing to pay and hereby offer to pay the costs incurred \" by the said William Brodie to his attorney and which \" costs the said company have already heretofore tendered to the said William Brodie.\" Le special case soumis par les deux parties contient \u00e0 ce sujet la d\u00e9claration suivante : \" It also asserted the Appellant's readiness to pay costs incurred.\" Ainsi il n'y a pas \u00e0 se tromper sur la nature des offres concernant les frais. C'est une simple d\u00e9claration de la volont\u00e9 de la compagnie de les payer. Mais cela n'est pas suffisant pour des offres l\u00e9gales quant aux frais., Pour que les offres r\u00e9elles soient valables suivant l'art. 1163 paragraphe 3, \" Il faut qu'elles soient de la totalit\u00e9 de la somme exigible, des arr\u00e9rages ou int\u00e9r\u00eats dus, des frais liquid\u00e9s, et d'une somme pour les frais non-liquid\u00e9s, sauf \u00e0 parfaire.\"\nD'apr\u00e8s cet article, pour que les offres fussent valables il \u00e9tait de rigueur de mentionner une somme d\u00e9termin\u00e9e comme offerte pour les frais avec la d\u00e9claration sauf \u00e0 parfaire\u2014avec de plus description des esp\u00e8ces offertes afin de constater, comme pour la somme principale, que cette offre \u00e9tait faite en monnaies courantes et en esp\u00e8ces r\u00e9gl\u00e9es par la loi.\u2014Cela n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, les offres faites \u00e9taient insufficient et auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9es telles. Le jugement do Ia Cour Sup\u00e9rieure qui les a d\u00e9clar\u00e9es l\u00e9gales est en violation de l'art. 1163. Le judgment de la Cour du Banc de la Reine, les a d\u00e9clar\u00e9es insuffisantes \u2014 mais comme cette Cour donnait gain de cause \u00e0 Brodie principalement sur le principe que la police \u00e9tait de $2,000, elle n'est pas entr\u00e9e dans l'examen de la question de la suffisance des offres quant aux frais. Elle se borne \u00e0 les d\u00e9clarer insuffisantes d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ; mais cette d\u00e9claration portant aussi bien sur l'insuffisance des offres quant aux capital quo par rapport aux frais, on doit en faire application aux frais, quoiqu'elle ne puisse l'\u00eatre au capital, dont les offres suivant mon opinion auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisantes si celle des frais e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 legalmente faite.\nEtant d'avis qu'il v a eu erreur dans l'insertion de la somme de $2000 an lieu de celle d\u00ba $1000 comme le montant de la police d'assurance, je crois que la Cour du Banc de la Reine aurait d\u00fb en d\u00e9clarant les offres insuffisantes, ne donner jugement toutefois quo pour $832.97 avec les d\u00e9pens dans los deux cours.\nJe suis d'opinion quo tel devrait \u00eatre le jugement de cette Cour.\nHENRY, J. :\u2014\nThe action in this case is on- a policy of the appellant company, dated the 13th of October, 1866, on the life of the respondent for eight years, for $2,000 payable to his personal representatives in case of his death before the expiration of the eight years, or, in case of his surviving for that period, to himself.\nThe defence is founded on a general denial and an allegation that the policy was, by mistake issued foi $2,000 instead of $1,000. In the margin of the policy is written and printed the following:\u2014 Endowment participating policy\u2014 annual premium $163.44. Note for half each year. Term 8 years, sum insured $2,000.\"\nFor two years the respondent paid the premiums and gave his notes as provided for by the policy, and receipts therefore were given him signed by the Secretary of the company at Hartlord, and countersigned by S. Pedlar & Co., agents.\nThey are dated at Hartford in 1867 and 1868. That for 1867 is as follows:\u2014\" Received from W. Brodie one hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-four cents, premium due 13th Oct., 1867, on policy No. 26,863, insuring $2,000 for 12 months, ending on the 13th day of Oct., 1868, at noon. Not binding until countersigned by S. Pedlar & Co., agents at Montreal, Canada: Premium, $163.44. P. & Co., \"The receipt given in 1868 is the came as the previous one, except its date, and by it the insurance is extended to the 15th of Oct. 1869. Thus the company received, altogether, three annual premiums at the rate provided by the policy, and in the two receipts stated. It is shown, however, that the premium paid was that applicable to a policy for $1,000, and consequently only half of that payable for $2,000.\nPrevious to the falling due of the fourth premium the appellants, through their agent Orr (who was also agent when the policy was issued, being one of the firm of S. Pedlar & Co.,) objected to receive the premium as before and insisted that inasmuch as the premium paid was that applicable to a policy of but $1,000, they would receive the premium thereafter as for a polic\u00eda for that amount only that the insertion of $2,000 instead of $1,000 was a mistake, or error, and that the respondent only applied for, and was entitled to receive, a policy for $1,000. Protests were made on both sides, but it was finally agreed, at the suggestion of the company, that the policy should remain, and that the respondent should continue to pay the same premium as previously, the question of the amount for which the company should be liable to be the subject of a future arrangement or legal decision.\nThe respondent paid up all the necessary premiums and the company received them under that arrangement.\nIt is, therefore, a question to be decided by the evidence, whether the application was for but $1,000, as alleged by the appellant, and that both parties so understood it. It might have been made a question whether a binding agreement had at all been entered into, for if one understood the agreement and arrangement to have been for $1000 and the other for $2000 the appellants by defending on that ground might, if the evidence so warranted, have avoided the contract altogether. That, however is not their defence, nor could they possibly, after the understanding in 1869, have set it up. We have no reason to doubt that one of two mistakes was made either as to the amount of the policy or of the annual premium to be paid The appellants had the choice when putting in their defence to adopt either but having made their selection they must prove the defence as alleged Had the mistake been in reference to the amount of the premium they could have so alleged either to cancel the policy or to get credit for the difference as a set off to the amount of the policy. That the premium charged was inapplicable to a policy for any amount beyond $1,000, alone proves but little.\nIf the respondent intended to have a policy for $2,000, and the agent by mistake told him and inserted in the papers but half the correct amount of the premiums, the policy would be good for the whole amount and binding, unless relieved from it in equity. If, however, an agreement was reached as to the amount of the policy and the premiums, and a mistake in the policy was alleged it would be a matter to be determined by evidence as the case might be. If the mistake, however, was as to the premium, there is no defence to the claims for the $2,000, for the plea only raises the issue as to the amount of the policy. It may be urged that it is hard upon the company to pay double for the amount of the premiums they received, but the mistake whatever it was, was theirs, and if they have chosen to put their defence upon an issue they have not proved, the legitimate legal consequences should result. The principles of law and evidence applicable to a procedure to reform a written contract are those to be applied in this case; and to set aside or vary such by parol testimony the most conclusive evidence is necessary, and it must be clearly shown to have been an error in the contract in reference to what both parties agreed to, and understood.\nWe are not to enquire, under the defence set up in this action, whether a definite contract was agreed upon, for it is admitted by the plea that such was the case, and our enquiry is therefore limited to the ascertaining what that contract was. The policy is sufficient evidence of it, and under the parol evidence we are to be satisfied, beyond every reasonable doubt, that not only the agent of the company, but the respondent, intended and agreed for a policy for $1,000, and not for $2,000 as stated in the policy. Had the written application been for $1,000 we would have had something reliable to guide us, but the body of that document over the signature of the respondent asks for a policy for $2,000. In the margin, however, it is stated to be for $1,000. That margin was filled in by Orr, as he says, in the presence of the respondent before h\u00e9 signed the application. There is however no evidence that the respondent knew what was there written, for Orr does not allege that the respondent either read it, or that he ( Orr) read it to him or told him of it ; and when we consider Orr's evidence, we, I think, would be justified in concluding that if the respondent had known of it no insurance would have been effected, or the amount in the margin would have been altered. Orr, in the first \"place states in most positive terms that the final arrangement was for a policy for $1,000 for 8 years. If that statement had not been refuted by what he said subsequently we might have been guided by it, but such a position is to my mind wholly inconsistent with other parts of his testimony. In-his evidence, he makes this important statement :\nI have no doubt that the plaintiff always believed that he was insured for two thousand dollars, or certainly so until the mistake was brought to his knowledge. He has never admitted since then that he was wrong: I believe him to be perfectly honest in his belief, and do not think the plaintiff ever had any intention of defrauding or wronging the company.\nThen again:\nI think Mr. Brodie said at that conversation (referring to the time when the application was signed) \"that he would have nothing to do with anything but a $2,000 policy, or something to that effect. It certainly was two thousand dollars that he wanted.\nIt needs no logic to prove that, if the statements in those extracts be true, it is simply impossible that the respondent ever agreed to take an insurance for $1,000 only. So far there is evidence that he understood he was getting a policy for $2,000. But, even if the evidence does not necessarily go that far, the statements in the quoted evidence entirely neutralize the original one that he agreed to one for $1,000. Orr is the only witness to sustain the plea that such an agreement was entered into, by which we are asked to vary a solemn written document understood to be deliberately prepared, examined, signed and countersigned, and acted upon for nearly three years.\nIt must be remembered that this is not an application to vacate or cancel a contract on the ground of a mistake of one of the parties. The rules and principles of law and equity applicable to such a case are very different from those applicable to this case. When, previous to the receipt of the fourth premium, after the alleged mistake was communicated to the respondent, the company, finding one of two mistakes had been made by their agent and others representing them, had it open to them to have the policy cancelled, and in that case proof of such a mistake on their part, independently of the respondent, would have enabled them to have the policy set aside or cancelled ; but they could not get that done except on terms of such equitable relief as the respondent would have been entitled to. Here an attempt is made to avoid the consequences of the gross errors and culpable negligence of the officers and agent of the company without any of the legal consequences. The respondent, who must be presumed to have intended to get and to have agreed for a policy for $2,000, is to be deprived of his right to have the policy he wished and intended, and to have one fastened upon him which, as Orr himself says, he said he would not have. It is inequitable and unjust that the respondent should suffer through the mistake or negligence of the other parties, and that he should be kept about three years in the dark.\nOrr says that he knew at once, as soon as the respondent said the policy was for $2,000, that there was a mistake ; but that he could not tell where it was until he got back the application, and then the circumstances came to his mind. It is, to say the least, a little singular that he countersigned the policy having m the margin conspicuously placed in large figures, and quite near together, the amount of the policy and the annual premium. He also signed two receipts, both stating the policy at $2,000, and the annual premiums paid. One would certainly have thought that the first glance at the margin of the policy or at the receipts which he signed would have shown that there was an error to one who, so soon after, was so immediately affected by the mention of the amount of the policy by the respondent. What, too, can be said of those at the head office? They issued and entered the policy endorsed and filed away the application, marking it for $2,000 and the annual premium payable, and they filled up and forwarded receipts for two years as for a policy for that amount. I have no hesitation in saying there was culpable and gross negligence in repeating so often the mistake, whatever it was, and after which the company comes with a bad grace, to ask for rectification. When it was at last accidentally discovered that either the policy was too large, or the premium too small, the company, I think, were not justified by the evidence in the position they adopted. That position could only be sustained by clear satisfactory and unsuspicious evidence that both parties agreed for a policy for $1,000. To vary an agreement such evidence has always been considered necessary, and called for. I cannot find it in this case. It is more than doubtful, as I view it, and leaves the strong and irresistible impression that the respondent never agreed to accept a policy for less than $2,000; that both parties intended a policy for $2,000, but that Orr, by mistake, inserted the wrong amount of premium. If his statements, which I have quoted, are correct, and being made against his own and his company's interest we must so take them, no other than the conclusion I have drawn can legitimately be arrived at.\nIf, as Orr stated, \" the plaintiff always believed he was insured for $2,000, \" and \" that he has never ad-mitted since then that he was wrong ; \" that he believed him to be perfectly honest in his belief, and that he did not think he ever had the intention of defrauding the company, or wronging the company, and that when effecting the insurance he said. \"that he would have nothing to do with anything-but a $2,000 policy,\" and that \"it certainly was $2,000 that he wanted, and that he has always since contended for it \" how can anyone conclude that he agreed to a policy for $1,000 ? If that be the true position, where, then, under the pleading, is the defense to the respondent's claim? I must say I can see none. Besides, the respondent was examined as a witness on the part of the appellants, but his evidence was put aside by them a fact which should have some weight when he and Orr were alone present at the time of the application. The company took the risk of examining him, and must submit to the reasonable construction to be put upon their excluding his evidence matter in itself not, perhaps, of much weight, but significant, when considering the very doubtful and suspicious position created by Orr's testimony and the other circumstances in evidence. Orr says he (the respondent) always, in good faith, considered himself insured for $2000 and if so it is not difficult to divine what his evidence was on that \"point. If the case other-wise were clear as to the amount of the policy, the rejection of the evidence would, of course, have little weight ; but, under the circumstances, I think it is entitled to some consideration. Independently, however, of that consideration, I think the evidence is altogether too suspicious, contradictory and defective to sustain the defence set up by the pleas. I think the appeal should be dismissed, and the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench affirmed, with costs.\nGWYNNE, J. :\u2014\nIf when the mistake which the appellants insist there was in the amount stated in the policy was first discovered and the appellants caused to be offered to the respondents an identical policy for $1000 instead of for $2,000, and the respondent refused to accept such policy, the appellants had then taken proceedings calling upon the respondent to exercise an option to have the \"whole contract annulled or to have the policy for $1000 in substitution for the one for $2,000, and if upon such proceedings the appellants had satisfied the court that the mistake which they insisted upon did in fact exist, although it may have been unilateral only that is the mistake of the appellants and their officers only, both upon principle and upon the authority of (Garrard v. Frankel ([17]) and of Harris v. Pepperell ([18]) the appellants would have been entitled to succeed.\nWhen upon the l3th October, 1869, appellants agents, Pedlar & Co. sent to the respondent the letter of that date, wherein they say : \" We herewith hand you the company s receipt, keeping your policy No. 26,863 in. force, the company however claiming to be liable there-under only to the extent of one thousand dollars for the reasons stated in their tender and protest by J, H. Isaac-son. N. P. of the 12th instant, you, on the other hand, claiming to hold said policy for the full amount of two thousand dollars, for the reasons stated in your tender and protest by Mr. Lighthall, N. P., of 13th October, this day, the present payment of premiums and all future similar payments not in any manner to affect the rights and pretensions of the parties respectively in restart to the amount for which the policy should be hell ; \"and when this letter was assented to by the respondent, and was acted upon by both parties, we must, in order to give precise effect to this agreement, hold that the parties have asserted that the policy shall be treated as a policy for $1,000, if the appellants should succeed in satisfying the court that the policy was issued by them by mistake for $2,000, and the same question is now open notwithstanding the additional lapse of time, and notwithstanding that the respondent is plaintiff in an action seeking to enforce the policy as one for $2,000, as if proceedings had been taken in 1869 by the appellants as plaintiffs calling upon the respondent to exercise the option of accepting a substitutionary policy for $1,000, or of wholly avoiding the contract. For the reasons stated by the Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench, sitting in appeal, I think it clearly established that the policy was issued by mistake for $2,000, when one for $1,000 was all that was really intended to have been given for the consideration agreed to be paid. The statement in the margin, which is positively sworn to have been there inserted before the respondent signed the application, is wholly inconsistent with the amount being intended to be for $2000 as stated in the body, and I can see nothing in the evidence to contradict this statement for I must say I attach no weight to the evidence of Mr. King It was argued that the reading the matter in the margin so as to affect what was in the body of the application was a violation of the principle that a marginal note upon an instrument, which marginal note was, as was contended, not signed, could not override the instrument which was, signed. But this principle has no application here, for that there was a mistake in inserting the $2,000 in the policy and in the body of the application also, is a fact which the appellants may establish by any evidence they can adduce, parol or otherwise, and the variance between the amount mentioned in the margin and in the body of the application is only referred to as a piece of evidence to assist in establishing the mistake insisted upon ; and assuming that marginal entry to have been, as it is sworn to have been, made before the respondent signed the application, it is certainly a very strong piece of evidence. But independently of this, the witness Orr clearly establishes the mistake if his evidence is to be relied upon; and, to my mind, the fact, which seems clearly established that if the policy was sustained as one for $2000 it would amount to the gift of about $1,000, for which the company (appellants) received no consideration whatever, seems strongly to support Orr's evidence. There are other \"points which also seem to support that evidence. It is, indeed, as it seems to me uncontradicted in any material point\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the appellants were entitled to the relief sought had they taken proceedings for that purpose in 1869 ; that they are entitled to the same relief now ; and that, therefore, the judgment on appeal should be. reversed, and the judgment of the . Superior Court restored, except as to the costs, which will follow the judgment delivered by His Lordship the Chief Justice of this Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs to plaintiff in the Superior Court, no costs to either party in the Court of Queens Bench, and costs to appellants in this Court.\nSolicitors for appellants: Trenholme & Maclaren.\nSolicitors for respondents: Davidson, Monk & Cross.\n[1] Pp. 411, 418 Am. ed., pp. 343, 349 Eng. ed. and authorities there\n[2] L.

J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nAssets of first and second community\u2014Transfer of arrears of lije. rent by wife to the grandson of her second husband, validity of\u2014\u2014 Edit de secondes noces 1560 Arts 279 282 and 283 Custom of Paris and Arts. 1760, 1265 and 774 C. C. (P. Q.) Costs\u2014Error of date in deed of transfer.\nOn the 17th February. 1841, C. and wife acknowledged by the deed that they were indebted to one 8. N., widow of one P.. in a sum of $140, due to her late husband. On the same day C. and wife, the son-in-law and daughter of S. N. and P., also acknowledged to be indebted to S. N.. in an annual life-rent, in consideration of certain real estate given to them previously by the late P. and S. N., by deed of gift, 16th February, 1830. On 19th February, 1841, the widow, S. N., married one J. B. L. On the 21st January, 1870, J. B. L. and his wife, S. N., transferred to P. L., the grandson of J. B. L.., all the arrears of life-rent due them by C. and his wife as well as the sum of $140, being the amount of the obligation.\nOn an action brought by P. L. against C. and wife, to recover \u00a31,325 for 26 years of said life-rent, and \u00a335 for the amount of the obligation of the 17th February, 1841 ;\nHeld,\u20141. Affirming the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal side), that the arrears of the life-rent which accrued during the second marriage of S.N. belonged to the community which existed between her and her second husband J. B. L.., and that the husband as head of the community could legally dispose of his share in the community, viz : one-half of said arrears, in favor of his grandson P. L.,but the transfer as to the other half belonging to his wife, S. N., was null, as by law S. N. could not transfer to any of her husband's descendants, who, in such a case are, by law, considered as persons interposed to secure directly to the husband a benefit which cannot be conferred to him directly -Art. 774 0. C. (P. Q.)\n2. Reversing the judgment of the Court a quo. that although the sum of $140 formed part of the movables belonging to the first community, yet the half of said sum belonging to S. N. at the time of her second marriage formed part of the second community, and her husband, J. B. L., could legally dispose of his share in said sum, viz. : $35 in favor of his grandson, the transfer of the balance, viz.. $105, being null and void.\nIn this case both parties appealed to the Supreme Court, the respondent, A. M. et ux. having succeeded in getting the judgment of the Court a quo reversed on the second point and con-firmed on the first point, were allowed costs of a cross appeal.\nIn plaintiffs declaration it was alleged that the arrears of rent transferred to him and which he claimed from defendants were due in virtue of a liferent constituted by a deed of cession dated 16th February, 1828, and in the Superior Court, after argument, a motion was made by plaintiff to discharge the d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 inasmuch as it was discovered at the argument that a clerical error of a serious nature to the interests of the present plaintiff had inadvertently crept into one of the authentic documents invoked by the plaintiff in support of his action, such error being as to the date of a certain donation upon which the action is mainly based ; arid inasmuch as such clerical error can most easily be remedied by referring to the minute of the notary who passed the deed or otherwise, this motion was . granted, and a second motion was made by the plaintiff en reprise d'instance, praying to be allowed to amend the declaration by adding under count No. 10 in the declaration the following to wit. i That the date of the constitution of the rent above mentioned was erroneously mentioned in the deed of transfer above related as being made by and in virtue of the contract of marriage of the said A. C., dated the 7th February, 1828.\n\"That the said constituted rent is made by a deed of the 16th February, 1830, as it appears from an authentic copy of said deed forming part of exhibit number one of the plaintiff in this cause, and that the intention of the parties to the' said deed of transfer at the time of the execution thereof was to transfer the arrears of rent constituted by the said defendant on the 16th February, 1830. The said rent being the only one due by the said A. G to the said S. N.\"\nHeld (affirming the judgment of the courts below), that the error in the transfer as to the date of the deed under which the life-rent was due, was a mere clerical error. There was no other liferent to which the transfer could apply but the one in question The claim was sufficiently identified by the description of the ' deeds and the date of their registration, under the special allegations of the plaintiff and the evidence which he has adduced.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Court or Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal side), reversing a judgment of the Superior Court for Lower Canada, by which the plaintiff, Pierre Lalonde, then represented by his widow Dame Albina Mallette, as tutrix to his two minor children had been condemned to pay to the respondent es-qualit\u00e9 the sum of $5,143.00 with interest and costs, the Court of Queen's Bench reducing the condemnation to $2,101.77 with costs of appeal against the respondent es-qualit\u00e9.\nThe judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, (Appeal side) Was appealed from to the Supreme Court by the present appellants on the ground that the condemnation was yet excessive. At the same time the respondent. es-qualit\u00e9, appealed also from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal side), on the ground that the judgment of the Superior Court ought to have been affirmed This second appeal was treated by the Court as a cross-appeal under the Supreme Court rules.\nThe facts of the case as stated by Sir A. A. Dorion, C. J. of the Court below, are as follows :\nOn the 7th of February, 1828, Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Pilon, then a minor issue of the marriage of Joseph Pilon and Scholastique Neveu, married one Antoine Charlebois.\nJoseph Pilon was a party to the contract of marriage and gave to the future consorts certain real estate of which he reserved for himself as well as for his wife the enjoyment (l'usufruit) as long as they lived.\nOn the 16th February 1830, Pilon and his wife made a transaction with Charlebois and his wife by which in consideration of an annual life-rent (rente viag\u00e8re) payable in kind, they released the enjoyment (l'usufruit) which they had reserved by the first deed.\nPilon died in 1839 and his wife survived him\nOn the 17th of February, 1841, his widow, Scholaslique Neveu gave to Charlebois and his wife, a discharge, in full for all the arrears of this life-rent which were due to her up to the 17th of February 1841. The arrears have also been paid since for the year 1842, 1843 and 1844, as admitted in the plaintiff's declaration.\nOn the same day, 17th February, 1841, Charlebois and wife acknowledged by a notarial obligation that they were indebted to Scholastique Neveu, widow Pilon, in a sum of 840 francs ancient currency, equal to $140, due for the amount of an obligation of the 18th of September, 1830, by Charlebois to the late Joseph Pilon.\nHaving thus settled her affairs with her daughter and her son-in-law, Scholastique Neveu married one Jean Baptiste Lacombe, on the 19th day of February following (1841). Lacombe was a widower and had a daughter by his first marriage. Her name was Marie Virginie Lacombe. She married Pierre Moise Lalonde, and had by this marriage a son whose name was Pierre Lalonde.\nOn the 21st of January 1870, Lacombe and his wife Scholastique Neveu, the mother of the appellant, transferred to this Pierre Lalonde, the grandson of Lacombe, all the arrears of life-rent which were due by Charlebois and his wife to Scholastique Neveu, from December, 1844, to December, 1869.\nIn the deed of transfer it is erroneously stated that the arrears of life-rent so transferred are due by virtue of the contract of marriage of Charlebois and his wife of the 7th February, 1828, and also by virtue of deed of transfer of the 16th February 1828 written at the foot of the said contract of marriage while this life-rent was created by an act of the 16th of February 1830 already mentioned, which act is how ever written at the foot of the original contract of marriage of the 7th of February, 1828.\nLacombe and wife also transferred by the same deed to Lalonde the 840 francs or $140 due by Charlebois and his wife by their obligation of the 17th of February, 1841.\nOn the 27th of March following (1870), a little over two months after the date of this transfer Scholastique Neveu died.\nShortly after her death, Pierre Lalonde brought the present action against Charlebois by which he has claimed:\u2014\n1st. For 26 years of life-rent transferred to him by Scholastique Neven under the above transfer.\n\u00a31,325 5 10\n2nd. The amount of the obligation of the 17th of February, 1841, 840 francs equal to\n35 0 0 3rd. For the funeral expenses and expenses of the last sickness of Scholastique Neveu paid for by the defendant Charlebois and his wife\n35 11 6\nMaking a total of\n\u00a31,394 0 4\nEqual to $5,576066 with interest from the 28th of April, 1871, and costs.\nTo this demand the defendant Charlebois pleaded the facts already stated, and further, that the life-rent transferred by Scholastique Neveu to Lalonde represented to the extent of one-fifth the individual estate (les propres) of the said Scholastique Neveu and for four-fifths the properties acquired during the first community ; that no part of the four-fifths of his life-rent, which represented the properties acquired during the first community, could form part of the second community ; that Scholastique Neveu had no right during her marriage to give any of her property to her husband Lacombe, nor to his grandson Lalonde ; that the sum of 840 francs ancient currency was also a conquet of the first com-munity and that the transfer made to Lalonde was only valid as to one-tenth of the arrears of life-rent which was the share of Lacombe in one-fifth of such arrears which had fallen into the second community and Charleboi]s offered to confess judgment for $312 as the value of the share of arrears of said life-rent which Lacombe was entitled to transfer.\nTo this plea the plaintiff answered generally ; also that Scholastique Neveu had made a will by which she had disposed of all her properties in favor of her husband Lacombe, and that the defendant had therefore no interest in asking that the transfer of the 21st of February, 1870, be annulled.\nOn this contestation, the Superior Court holding that the transfer was not affected by the Edit des secondes noces and that Scholastique Neveu had the right to transfer her claims to Lalonde, as she had done condemned the defendant Charlebois to pay to the plaintiff a sum of $5,143.21 with interest from the 29th of April 1871, and costs. This sum of $5,143.21 is composed of $ 1,860.30 for the value of 26 years of arrears of life-rent, $140 amount of the obligation of the 17th of February, 1841 and $142900 paid for the defendant for the funeral expenses, etc., of Scholastique Neveu.\nThere was no dispute about this last claim of $142.90 which was admitted by the appellants.\nThe only other facts requiring to be noticed with reference to this appeal are, that Pierre Lalonde, the original plaintiff, died before judgment was rendered in the court below and that Antoine Charlebois, the original defendant, died since the judgment. They are now respectively represented in the cause, Charlebois by the appellants and Lalonde by the respondent.\nAs the pretended will of Scholastique Neveu invoked by the plaintiff in his answers to the defendant's plea the date of which is not even indicated, was never fyled, it was found unnecessary to examine whether or not it would have been a good answer to the defendant's pretensions had it been produced.\nMr Pagnuelo, Q. C., for appellants :\nThe first question that naturally comes up under the plea of general denial is whether the plaintiff as assignee under the deed of the 21st January, 1870, can claim any of the arrears of pension due by the defend-ant to Schoiastique Neveu.\nThe deed under which the pension was constituted was passed on the 16th Feb., 1830; this is the only deed under which a pension may be claimed from the defendant; but by the transfer of the 21st January 1870, Scholastique Neveu and J. B. Lacombe assigned over to the plaintiff the arrears of a pension which might be due to S. Neveu in virtue of the contract of marriage of the 7th February, 1828, between the defendant and A. Pilon, and under a deed of cession bearing date the 16th February, 1828, written at the end of the said contract of marriage.\nNo such pension exists, and plaintiff has failed to prove any title to the pension which he claims in this cause. The plaintiff felt it so much that after the case had been argued and taken en d d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9,\" he moved that the \"d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9\" be discharged in order that he might be allowed to amend his declaration. This motion was granted and the amendment allowed, hut illegally as the defendant submits: 1st. The motion was not stamped and this is fatal ([1]). 2nd. The amendment was allowed on payment of $60 costs, which have not been paid. 3rd. No. verbal evidence of the transferer's intentions could be adduced. The evidence of the notary, who is about the only witness brought up, and who throws the blame of what he calls an error on his clerk to whom be dictated the deed, is illegal as tending to prove against a written document and to contradict it.\nBesides, no proof of the intent of the late donor, but suppositions only could be made, which are destroyed by the following circumstances : (a) The old lady never intended to claim this life-rent, which she had not claimed for 25 years ; (b) it was only on her death bed, aged 78 years, that she was beset by her husband's family to make her husband's grandson this transfer, which meant the total ruin of her only child. This error might have been a very clever mode of evading the obsessions she was beset with, without ruining her child. Suppositions will not be strained to help committing an injustice.\nThe following are in point to prove that the absence of date or a false date given in the enregistration of deeds is fatal, and carries with it the complete nullity of the enregistration :\nCass. (Ehrard) S. V. 12, 1, 182, id. Coll. nouv. 3, 1, 421, D. a, 9, 11 Nov. 1811 ; Bruxelles (Haumont) S. V. Coll. N. 3, 2, 509 Cass. (Lahaye) S. V. 7, 1, 234, 22 avril 1807 ; C.

Art. 2148, s. 3, Nos. 1 et 2 ;Zacharie, t. 2, s. 276, No. 7, t. 3, sur No. 276, p. 344 and foll ; Solon, Des nullit\u00e9s, t. 1, No. 362 : \" The false enunciation of the date of the instrument creating the debt is sufficient to make the inscription null ;\" Cass. 7 Septembre 1807 (Lef\u00e8vre) S. V. 8,1, 92 ; Rouen, 8 f\u00e9vrier 1806 (Langlois) S. V. Coll. N. 2, 2 113 and others.\nAccording to all these decisions and authorities the enregistration of the present transfer would be a complete nullity because the date of the deed creating the hypothec, to-wit, the deed constituting the pension of date 16th February, 1830, is not given in the transfer and would not appear in the registrar's books. If the date were in the transfer but not in the inscription, the inscription would be null. For the same reason the error being in the transfer itself, such transfer is null and void ; no debt is transferred, because the one which is mentioned does not exist and the one which exists is not mentioned.\nHow can a debt be sold which is not described ? Art. 1576 C. C., says :\"The seller of a debt or other right is bound by law to the warranty that the debt exists and is due to him:\nHow could such a warranty exist when no debt is mentioned ? But here the debt mentioned does not exist and whether so declared on purpose or not matters not.\nThe plaintiff shows no title to claim from defendant the pension due in virtue of the deed of 16th February, 1830, and if he has any recourse against J. B. Lacombe or Dame S. Neveu let him exercise it.\nA second preliminary point was invoked by the appellant, under the plea of general denial, viz. : that there is no proof that the transfer in favor of plaintiff has ever been enregistered ; no certificate of enregistration has been fyled ; a certificate of service of the transfer only has being fyled.\nOn the merits of the case we submit first that the transfer of the wife's share in the arrears of the life rent was void as made by a wife to her husband through an interposed person, being a benefit between husband and wife conferred during marriage by act inter vivos.\nMarriage covenants, whether determined by the parties or settled by law, are irrevocable ([2]).\nIt is a public law ; the nullity is absolute ([3]).\nTherefore a wife cannot give any of her own property to her husband, either directly or indirectly, nor relinquish any of her rights in the community property.\nAccording to the old custom of Paris, man and wife could not benefit each other during marriage either by donation or will ([4]).\nA provincial statute passed in 1801 has taken away the prohibition of conferring benefits by will, as it gives full power to bequeath, all or any property in favor of any person whatsoever. The Civil Code of Quebec maintains the prohibition as to Acts inter vivos only, but the plaintiff wants to have it said that the liberty of conferring benefits by last will implies the liberty of conferring benefits inter vivos and even has abolished all restrictions to marriage covenants, made, of course, before marriage, by persons marrying a second time and having children from a first marriage. But such a pretension is clearly untenable.\nArt. 7T4, C. C;, defines who are interposed persons s it is the ascendants, the descendants, the presumptive heir at the time of the gift, and the consort of the per-son incapable, unless the presumption established by law be rebutted by services rendered or relations of kindred. There is no such pretension here, and the charge imposed is quite foreign to the wife, and only the discharge of a duty devolving upon the husband, J.. B. Lacombe, and the done.\nIt is objected that the arrears of the pension fell into the community of property existing between J. B. Lacombe and Scholastique Neveu ; that J. B. Lacombe, as head and master of the community, could dispose of the same absolutely, even in fraud of his wife's interest in them, saving the wife's recourse for indemnity upon the husband's property after the dissolution of the community ; that there was no fraud against the wife, as she was a party to the deed Of transfer; and finally that the defendant cannot oppose fraud as he is not heir to Scholastique Neveu.\nWe answer by saying, first, that the husband, as head of the community, may dispose of its property absolutely, provided it be, 1st, in favor of persons capable of receiving ; 2nd, without fraud ([5]). That supposing the arrear did fall in the community of J. B. Lacombe and Scholastique Neveu, which we do not admit, the donation by the husband of his wife's share to one of his descendants is a complete and absolute nullity ; is null and void, as contrary to a public law ; the donation by the wife, or her joining her husband in the donation to the husband's grand-child is also void as an indirect advantage to the husband. She might, after the dissolution of the community, claim indemnity on her husband's property if she chose, but she is at liberty, specially if the husband has divested himself of all his estate, to claim the things given, whether movable or immovable, from whomsoever is in possession of them, and the reimbursement of the sums of money so given and paid ([6]).\nAd\u00e9laide Pilon was the only child and natural heir to her mother Scholastique Neveu, and was seized of all her mother's rights and estate by law without any act of apprehension ; it is sufficient if she does not renounce the succession, C. C. 607.\nIt was therefore sufficient to mention that Ad\u00e9laide Pilon was the daughter of Scholastique Neveu, in order to establish that she was seized of the property, rights, and actions of Scholastique Neveu against the plaintiff. As she was in community of property with the nal defendant, Antoine Charlebois, the latter, as head of the community was also seized by her decease of said rights of Scholastique Neveu. Besides, it is not necessary that the child should be heir to his mother as he takes as child and not as heir the property acquired by his mother during her first community. Pothier, Contrat de mariage, No. 645.\nA fourth question is : What portion of the life-rent fell into the community ? We say only one-fifth. The pension represented for four-fifths the joint acquets of the first community of property which had existed between Joseph Filon and Dame S. Neveu and S. Neveu could not dispose of any portion of the said first community's property in favor of he second husband, neither directly nor indirectly, under Art. 279 of the Custom of Paris. Any property coming to her through her first community was substituted to her children, issue of the first and second marriage by the event of her second marriage She could not dispose of it in favor of any one else. Pothier, Contrat de mariage, Nos. 630, 639.\nSuch property did not fall into her second com-munity, Id. No. 643;\nIt is objected that arrears of a life-rent are not a capital sum, but the fruits and revenues of a capital sum, and as such fall into the second community.\nThey may fall into a first community, but all movables which fall into an ordinary community do not fall into a second community, they do not when they have been acquired during the first community, art. 279 of the Coutume de Paris including movables as well as immovable\u2019s in the property of the first community substituted in favor of the children, in the event of their mother marrying again.\nTroplong, contrat de mariage, t.1, No. 68, 441 ; Pothier, communaut\u00e9, No. 102 ; id contrat de mariage, 0.0. 1272, 882; Guyot, Rep. v.

'\nThen there are three sorts of life-rent * some are given or bequeathed as aliments ; some are bought for a capital sum paid-up cash, and some are constituted as the price of sale of movable or immovable property. The life-rent in question here belongs to the last category.\nWhen the life-rent is bequeathed as aliment or bought for a sum of money, the rent is the capital or thing given or bought ; the sum of money paid is the price of it. When it is constituted for the price of an immovable then the immovable is the thing sold and the life-rent is the price. The arrears of the life-rent are not considered in such a case as fruits or interest but as a capital sum.\nTroplong, contrats alev., Nos. 216, 217, 218 ; Dalloz A. Cass, 86, 1, 4G9 ; Pothier, rente, Nos. 614, 615.\nFour-fifths of the pension represented immovables belonging to the first community of property of Scholas-tique Neveu, and, as such, did not fall into the second community with J. B. Lacomb ([7]).\nA fifth question regards the transfer of 840 francs ($140) by J. B. Lacombe and S. Neveu to the original plaintiff. We submit that the unanimous arrr\u00eat of our Court of Queen's Bench which held such transfer void is correct under the second head of the Edict of Francois II. on second nuptials (made in 1560) ([8]). The first head enacts that a widow marrying again cannot settle on her second husband a greater portion of her own property than on her child least taking ; the second head forbids her settling on her second husband, or disposing in favor of any other party but the children of her first marriage, any property coming to her from the liberality of her first husband. Then comes art. 279 of the Custom of Paris, already cited substituting in favor of the wife's children any property acquired during the first community as community property ([9]).\nThat debt of 840 francs was due under an obligation passed in 1841 a few days before the second marriage, but was a debt due to the first community, being only a renewal of a former obligation passed in 1830, during the first marriage.\nBy law, Adelaide Pilon was owner of one-half of it as heir to her father, Joseph Pilon, and therefore it was not due to her mother If the latter did acquire it from her late husband say under his will (nothing shows how she did, and the obligation of 840 francs seems to have renewed for the whole under a misapprehension,) then it was a liberality of her first husband, and, as such, became her child's property from the moment of her second marriage, under the second head of the Edict. As to the other half belonging to S. Neveu, for her share in the community, it was a sum of money acquired during her first community, and also substituted to Adelaide Pilon her only child, under art. 279 of the Custom of Paris.\nIt is objected that all the restrictions imposed by the Edict and art. 279 of the Custom were abolished, first, by the statute of 1801, granting freedom of making wills ; and, in the second place, by art. 764 C. C.\nTo say that the withdrawal of one prohibition implies the withdrawal of all other restrictions is going too far.\nFormerly a testator could make no dispositions in favor of his wife, and many other persons who were incapable of receiving under a will, nor under a donation inter vivos ; power was given by the statute of 1801 to every person to receive under a will, but the prohibitions as for donations inter vivos were not altered ([10]).\nAs for art. 764 C. C. it revoked all restrictions imposed on widows contracting marriages, but it stipulated only for future marriages. This is formally mentioned in s. 128, 29 Vic, c. 41 (1865), adopting the draft of the code.\nNo other interpretation can be given without giving the code a retroactive effect and destroying acquired rights. The only question raised by commentators has been whether we must consider the first or second marriage and most of them hold for the time of the first marriage because the law did then settle the rights of the children. But here both the first and second marriage took place long before the code was enacted.\nThe codifiers gave as the law in force in 1865 the dispositions of the edict on second nuptials and art. 279 of the custom, which they proposed to abrogate for the future, and for future marriages ; this suggestion was adopted by the legislature, and is now art. 764 of our Civil Code.\nMr. Laflamme, Q. C., for respondents :\nIt is unnecessary to dwell at any length on the preliminary points which were urged in the courts below by the defendants and which have been over-ruled by both Courts. It is sufficient to mention them with a few observations :\nThe party took advantage in the first court of clerical error which had occurred in the description of the deed constituting the life-rent, which had been mentioned as being due by virtue of the contract of marriage of the 7th February, 1828, instead of the donatinn of the 16th of February 1830. This error was rectified by an amendment of which the defendants acknowledged having received due notice, and conclusive evidence was adduced by the admission of defendant himself that the transfer was made of the life-rent in question, and both Courts unanimously held that it was a clerical error which could in no manner affect the plaintiff's title, Another objection was also raised, arising from the absence of registration of the transfer. This was not set up in the plea, but set forth only at the argument in appeal. The defendants invoked art. 1570 of the Code, in support of his pretension.\nThis article says that \" the buyer of a right of action has no possession available against third parties, until signification of the act of sale, and a copy delivered to the debtor.\"\nBut the Art. 2127 establishes the penalty in consequence of such omission, in these words : \"If these formalities be not observed, the conveyance or transfer is without effect against subsequent transferees who have conformed to the above requirements.\"\nThis provision of Art. 1570 has consequently no effect, except when there is a subsequent transfer made of the same claim but cannot be of any avail to the debtor when called upon to pay the amount transferred after due notification of the same as was made in this cause.\nAs these points have been formerly adjudicated upon by both Courts against the defendant, and are matters of form this Court would not for that reason alone reverse the judgment of the lower courts.\nThe respondent in this case, complaining that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench was erroneous, and contending that the judgment of the Superior Court ought to have been confirmed in every particular, also appealed from the judgment now on appeal before this Court, and, as the appeal taken by the respondents is to be treated by the Court as a cross appeal I will first urge the reasons why I believe the judgment of the Superior Court ought to have been maintained.\nTo maintain the correctness of the judgment of the Superior court and establish the error of the alterations made thereto by the judgment of the Court of Appeals. the plaintiff asserts as undoubted legal propositions : 1st. That the annual profits of a life-rent, created during a previous marriage, but accruing during the second, and a claim for a sum of money which originated during the first, but remained unpaid during the second marriage, appertains to the second community\nUnder Art. 1272 of our Code there can be no question that the obligation for 840 livres and the rent reserved to the donors Joseph Pilon and his wife, Scholastique Neveu, became assets of the community, this article stating that all movable property, and rents, revenues, interest and arrears of whatsoever nature they may be, belong to the community.\nThis article is not new law, but the re-enactment of Art. 220 of Coutume de Paris, from which it is derived. See Pothier, Trait\u00e9 de la Communaut\u00e9 ([11]) ; Denizart, Communaut\u00e9 ([12]).\nThese authorities above quoted enunciate the unquestionable principles of our law respecting the property which falls into the community, and over which the husband has an absolute and unlimited control ; the arrears of rent accrued during the community, either that existing under the first marriage of Scholastique Neveu and Joseph Pilon, or under the second community of the said Scholastique Neveu, with her second husband, Jean Baptiste Lacombe, were chattels belonging, by law, to the community.\nThe same rules apply to the obligation of the 17th of February, 1811, for 840 livres which was transferred to Pierre Lalonde, on the 21st of January, 1870. This obligation was granted by the debtor to the widow after the dissolution of the first community. Whether the cause was a claim of this community or not makes no difference, as Pothier says : We consider only the thing due without any regard to its origin or to the cause from which it is derived. It is impossible -to conceive under what rule of law the defendants in the Court below, could assert the proposition that the life rent represented the immovable property which was granted to Ad\u00e9laide Pilon by the deed of donation.\nThis alienation was unquestionably the free act of the father and mother in favor of their common child.\nThe usufruct, which was first reserved, may be considered as a joint acquest, immovable or real estate, and, admitting even that it represents in any proportion the value of the property given, the fruits or revenues derived from such usufruct undoubtedly accrued to the community as they became due.\nThe second conversion took place by the abandon-ment of the usufruct, on the part of the father and mother to their child, in consideration of which the liferent was constituted by the donees in favor of the donors ; and it cannot be pretended for a moment, that the arrears of the life-rent do not fall into the com-munity.\nThe defendants alleged that two of the immovable\u2019s, so given were propres (i. e., the separate and absolute property) of the wife, and the other two, joint acquests \u2014What belonged to her absolutely, she had power to dispose of as she thought fit ; what belonged to the community the husband had absolute authority to con-vey.\nIt matters not whether they were propres or conquets, or what proportion of value any of these properties bore respectively, we have to deal only with chattels, which are part of the community ; which, as such, were under the control, and at the disposal of the husband, and which he validly assigned, with the consent and concurrence of his wife.\nThe next proposition is that the husband had power to dispose of such property absolutely, and the convey-anee of it, made by the husband jointly with his wife, to his grandson, is not made in fraud to a person interposed, but, if done to the prejudice of the wife, it gives rise only to a claim by her or her heirs for, compensation. See Art. 1292 0. C. (P. Q.) ; Arts. 225, 233 Coutume de Paris (Duplessis), 375 ; Pothier, Traite de la Communaut\u00e9, 708, 715, 720.\nThese authorities leave no room for doubt as to the absolute right of the husband to execute a valid conveyance of any chattel, even to his presumptive heir, issue of a previous marriage. \"Whether it be acquired during the community or previous, it equally appertains to the community and, as such is at the absolute disposal of the husband, leaving the wife after the dissolution of the community, or her heirs to urge any objection as to the disposal by him made of any effects of the community, and to claim compensation therefore.\nMy third proposition is : There is no restriction or exception to the right of the community over movable property, or to the authority and control of the husband. over it, by reason of the previous marriage of the wife.\nThere existed under our old laws several prohibitions and restrictions on the property possessed by a widow or widower who contracted a second marriage when there existed any children, issue of the first marriage. The most important of these prohibitions is contained in the edict of Francis II., 1560.\nBut all these prohibitions have been abrogated by the statute of 1801, which gave unlimited power to parties to dispose of their property in favor of whomsoever they please, without any restriction or limitation ([13]).\nThen we have our own article of the Code 764 C. C. L. C.\nNow, admitting for a moment that the prohibitions existing under the edict of Francis IT and the article 379 of the Coutume de Paris were still in force the edict could not be held to apply to the transfer of the 21st of January, 1870.\nThe prohibitions of the edict affect only what the consorts hold by a donation or liberality of their deceased husband or wife. This cannot be said to comprehend the property which was acquired during the community as his or her share, this not being given by the husband or wife, but acquired by law in virtue of marriage, and the prohibition applies only to direct gifts of property obtained from the liberality of a previous consort made to a consort in second marriage.\nThe only grounds, therefore, which the defendants could urge to impugn the transfer would be the Art. 279 of the Coutume de Paris (if it were still subsisting), which precludes the wife from giving any portion of the joint acquits of her first community to the prejudice of the children issue of the first marriage and this article would apply solely to the transfer of the 840 livres.\nThis is no more the law of the Province of Quebec and was not in existence at the date of the transfer in question, and cannot, therefore, be invoked by the defendants as applicable.\nThe Code was published and came in force on the 1st of August, 1866, and the transfer in question was made on the 21st of January, 1870.\nEven under the old law and the prohibition of Art. 279 of the Coutume de Paris, it never was pretended that the issues and profits or the annual income of property of any of the consorts, were subject to the restrictions of the edict or of the Coutume.\nSee Bourjon Droit Commun ([14]) ; Lauri\u00e9re, Coutume de Paris ([15]) ; Merlin, Repertoire ([16]). But there is another ground upon which the respondents must succeed in getting the judgment of the Superior Court in their favor affirmed, viz :\u2014\nThe debtor or the party who consented to the obligation transferred is not competent to raise the question of the validity of the transfer,\u2014such right is exclusively reserved to the wife and to her heirs.\nAccording to the law of the Province of Quebec all rights, obligations, debts and claims, personal and real special or otherwise, devolve to the heir the nearest of kin in case of intestacy, or to the universal legatee in case of a devise by will. After the death of the defendant and original debtor, Antoine Charlebois, pending the suit, his wife continued the proceedings as his representative, but not as heir or representative of her mother and she no more than her husband could urge these grounds which were reserved to the heirs in such capacity. It is a violation of an elementary principle of our law which precludes anyone from setting up the rights of third parties to avoid their liabilities. Defendant had no title, interest, or capacity to urge. Merlin, Rep.([17]).\nUnless she assumed the quality of heir of her mother which would make her irrevocably liable for all obligations and debts of the estate, she could not claim any right to the property transferred by her mother, or question the title. If she had assumed her heir ship, the plaintiff was entitled to contest it or to show that there existed a will which disposed of this claim. The principle that such claims arising from transfers of movable property, by parties who contracted second marriages, could be made only on assuming the title of heir, and, as such, was so universally acknowledged in France, before the cession of Canada that Bourjon in his work ([18]) says : The Courts universally held that it was only a. reservation made by law in favor of the heir and which he could not urge if he renounced the estate.\nThis rule should have its application in Canada with greater force after the statute of 1801 which removed all restrictions and limitations as to the disposal of pro-perty, even between husband and wife, whether propres, acquets or conquets. It cannot be doubted that Adelaide Pilon, the mother, could have disposed by will of all her share of the first community in favor of her second husband. If the defendant had claimed as heir of her mother, the plaintiff would have been entitled to set up the will and deny her quality ; not doing so, the defendant had no ground to repel the action of the plaintiff.\nWhen we come to consider the reasons given by the Court for the reduction of one-half on the claim arising from the assignment of the arrears of rent accrued from the 21st January, 1844, it is impossible to escape the conclusion that it is the result of an oversight on the part of the learned judges, of the true principles which regulate such matters and to which their attention was not called\nThe judgment admits that the arrears of rent are the property of the second community, and are not subject to the reservations and restrictions contained in the Edict or in the Art. 279 of the Coutume. Under these circumstances, it is clear the respondents must succeed on their cross appeal, and the appellants' appeal be dismissed.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by FOURNIER, J. :\nL'action en cette cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e par Pierre Lalonde contre Antoine Charlebois. Les demandeurs et d\u00e9fendeurs, d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s tous deux pendant l'instance, sont maintenant repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, le demandeur Lalonde, par son \u00e9pouse Albina Malette en qualit\u00e9 de tutrice des enfants issus de leur mariage, assist\u00e9e d'Emery Brunet son second mari, en qualit\u00e9 de tuteur conjoint aux enfants du premier mariage de la dite Albina Malette.

B. Lucombe et Scholastique Neveu.\nQu'une partie seulement des arr\u00e9rages de la rente viag\u00e8re, savoir : 1\/5 comme repr\u00e9sentant les biens propres de S.

Que les restrictions et prohibitions de l'\u00e9dit des secondes noces et de l'article 279 Coutume de Paris ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abolies par l'effet du statut de 1301, au sujet de la facult\u00e9 de tester et par l'article 764 C. C.\nNe diff\u00e9rant d opinion d avec la Cour du Bane de la Reine que sur un seul point, cette Cour ne croit pas devoir entrer dans la consid\u00e9ration d\u00e9taill\u00e9e de toutes les questions que pr\u00e9sente cette cause. Elle se bornera en cons\u00e9quence \u00e0 exprimer son concours dans ceux des motifs du jugement qu'elle approuve, en limitant ses observations \u00e0 la seule question sur laquelle ii y a divergence d'opinion.\nEn donnant gain de cause aux appelants Pilon et al quant \u00e0 la totalit\u00e9 de l'obligation de 840 frs., dont moiti\u00e9 appartenait \u00e0 Scholctslique Neveu, comme sa part dans cette somme qui \u00e9tait un conqu\u00eat de sa m\u00e8re communaut\u00e9, la Cour du Bane de la Reine donne par l\u00e0 sans restriction, son approbation \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re proposition des appelants, savoir, qu'aucune partie des biens-meubles provenant d'une premi\u00e8re communaut\u00e9 ne peut tomber dans une seconde. Cette Cour ne saurait admettre cette proposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, qui, si elle \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e, comporterait une prohibition absolue \u00e0 la femme et au mari qui passent \u00e0 de secondes noces de faire entrer en communaut\u00e9 aucune partie quelconque des biens de leur premi\u00e8re communaut\u00e9. Il est indubitable que l'\u00e9dit des secondes noces et l'article 279 Coutume de Paris ont apport\u00e9 des restrictions importantes aux donations et avantages que peut faire \u00e0 son conjoint la personne qui passe \u00e0 de secondes noces. Ces prohibitions sont : 10. Qu'une veuve ayant enfants d'un premier ou autre subs\u00e9quent mariage ne pent, en se remariant donner \u00e0 son mari directement ou indirecte ment par personnes interpos\u00e9es, plus que la part de l'un de ses enfants le moins prenant\u201420.

Lacombe.\nLa 2\u00e8me interdisant \u00e0 la femme le no mien donner do ce qui lui provient des lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s do sos pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents maris et l'obligeant \u00e0 los r\u00e9server pour ses enfants, s'applique \u00e0 la moiti\u00e9 des 840 francs dont S Neveu est devenue propri\u00e9taire par la lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 do son premier mari. Le transport \u00e9tant de la somme do 840 frs doit en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul pour la moiti\u00e9, comme \u00e9tant fait en contravention \u00e0 cette prohibition. L'autre moiti\u00e9 lui appartenant par son droit do communaut\u00e9 pouvait, sons certaines restrictions expliqu\u00e9es ci-apr\u00e8s, tomber dans la seconde communaut\u00e9.\nLa 3\u00eame, qui est une extension de l'\u00e9dit, defend \u00e0 la femme do rien donner do ses conqu\u00eats \u00e0 ses seconds et autres subs\u00e9quents maris an pr\u00e9judice des enfants des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents mariages. La jurisprudence, dit Pothier \u00e0 ce sujet (No. 636, Mariage) est conforme \u00e0 l'esprit do l'art. 279. Il faut cependant remarquer qu'il y a une diff\u00e9rence consid\u00e9rable entre cette derni\u00e8re prohibition et la seconde. Elle restreint, il est vrai la libert\u00e9 de la femme \u00e0 disposer do sos conqu\u00eats, mais elle no constitue pas sur cette esp\u00e8ce do biens une substitution l\u00e9gale comme celle \u00e9tablie par le second chef \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des biens dont la femme qui se remarie a \u00e9t\u00e9 avantag\u00e9e par ses pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents maris. Mais cette d\u00e9fense do donner de ses conquets peut-elle \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme interdisant \u00e0 la femme le droit do faire entrer dans une seconde communaute aucune partie do ses biens-mobiliers provenant d'une premi\u00e8re? La Cour du Bane do la Reine semble avoir admis l'affirmative ; car en d\u00e9clarant quo la moiti\u00e9 des 840 frs. appartemant \u00e0 S. Neveu pour sa part dans le conqu\u00eat de la premi\u00e8re communaut\u00e9, n'avait Pu pour aucune partie quelconque \u00eatre valablement transport\u00e9e par Lacombe, c'\u00e9tait effectivement d\u00e9cider qu'aucune partie do cette somme n'avait Pu lui appartenir par son droit do communaut\u00e9. C'est admettre la premi\u00e8re proposition des appelants qu'aucuns biens d'une premi\u00e8re communaut\u00e9 no peuvent tomber dans une seconde. C'est sur ce point seulement que part la divergence d'opinion entre cette cour et celle du Bane do la Reine. Au soutien de cette partie du jugement los appelants citent un arr\u00eat du 4 mars 1694 rendu sur les conclusions du chancelier Daguesseau qui l'aurait ainsi d\u00e9cid\u00e9. Est-ce bien la question qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e ? La lecture do cet arr\u00eat fait voir quo los appelants lui ont donn\u00e9 uno plus grande port\u00e9e quo celle qu'il doit avoir. Cot arr\u00eat a jug\u00e9 quo le terme \"conqu\u00eat,\" dans la derni\u00e8re partie do l'art. 279, comprend le mobilier comme I\u2019 immobilier acquis pendant la dur\u00e9e d'une communaut\u00e9, lors qu'il s'agit do l'ex\u00e9cution de l'\u00e9dit des secondes noces et do l'art. 279 do la Coutume do Paris concernant los donations et avantages prohib\u00e9s. Cette doctrine est sans doute correcte ; mais elle n'a pas l'effet do prohiber la communaut\u00e9 l\u00e9gale dans le cas do secondes noces, ni par cons\u00e9quent d'emp\u00eacher quo des biens-meubles provenant d'une premi\u00e8re communaut\u00e9 no puissent entrer dans une seconde. Il no faut pas non plus perdre do vue quo dans le cas do cot arr\u00eat, comme dans los autres quo l'on trouve sur le sujet, ii s'agissait toujours do donations et de lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s faites contrairement \u00e0 l'\u00e9dit et \u00e0 l'art. 279 et dont la r\u00e9duction \u00e9tait demand\u00e9e. Merlin an mot Noces, secondes, le dit positivement : L'interdiction no s'applique qu'aux actes de donation pure. Dans le cas actuel les appelants ne demandent pas la r\u00e9duction d'une lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 qui leur a cause du pr\u00e9judice ; ce qu'ils demandent c'est la nullit\u00e9 absolue du transport des arr\u00e9rages de rente et de la somme de 840 frs. sur le principe qu'aucuns biens-mobiliers d' une premiere communaut\u00e9 ne peuvent, sans violation de l'art. 279, entrer dans une seconde. Mais cet article, en d\u00e9fendant \u00e0 la femme de disposer de ses conqu\u00eats an prejudice de ses enfants, la prive-t-elle du droit de contracter une communaut\u00e9 l\u00e9gale et la facult\u00e9 d'y faire entrer une partie quelconque de ses biens-mobiliers lui est-elle aussi inter-dite ? Certainement non. Les autorit\u00e9s suivantes le prouvent en m\u00eame temps qu'elles \u00e9tablissent que la seule restriction \u00e0 cette communaut\u00e9 est que la femme n'y peut pas apporter plus que son mari, sans faire \u00e0 celui-ci un avantage que la loi ne frappe pas de nullit\u00e9 absolue, mais qu'elle d\u00e9clare seulement sujet \u00e0 r\u00e9duction, s'il en r\u00e9sulte un pr\u00e9judice pour les enfants.\nPothier\u2014Mariage, No 550 :\nLa communaut\u00e9 do biens qui est \u00e9tablie entre une veuve et son second mari, est une esp\u00e8ce de contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9, qui ne renferme aucun avantage au profit du second mari, lorsqu'iI a apport\u00e9 autant que sa femme : mais lorsque l'apport est in\u00e9gal et que la veuve a apport\u00e9 plus que n'a apport\u00e9 le second mari ; ainsi, si la femme a apport\u00e9 4,000 en communaut\u00e9, et que le second mari n'en ait apport\u00e9 que 1,000; cette in\u00e9galit\u00e9 forme au profit du second mari un avantage sujet \u00e0 la r\u00e9duction de l'\u00e9dit.

Rep. Merlin\u2014Vo. Noces (secondes) :\nXIV.\u2014La stipulation de communaut\u00e9 de biens, lorsque les apports sont \u00e9gaux, n'est pas un avantage, elle en est un lorsque les apports sont in\u00e9gaux de la part du second mari ou de la seconde femme. L'avantage est de la moiti\u00e9 de ce que l'autre \u00e9poux a apporte de plus. Ainsi, le partage \u00e9gal de la communaut\u00e9 ne peut se faire qu'apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9falqu\u00e9 les apports de part et d'autre.\nXV.\u2014La communaut\u00e9 l\u00e9gale qui s'op\u00e8re en vertu de la Coutume et sans contrat de mariage, devient aussi Un objet de reduction; Si le mobilier de la veuve est. plus consid\u00e9rable que celui du second \u00e9poux, l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9 fait au profit de celui-ci un avantage comme lin\u00e9galit\u00e9 des apports dans la communaut\u00e9 stipul\u00e9e. Cet avantage est \u00e9galement sujet au retranchement, car quoique le second mari ne semble le tenir que de la loi qui a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 Ta communaut\u00e9 et lee biens qui la composent, cependant comme ii d\u00e9pend des \u00e9poux d'adopter ou non les dispositions de Ia Coutume \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, et quills ne peuvent, l'adopter sans une convention tacite, c'est de cette convention, de ce consentement tacite de la femme et non de la loi, que le second \u00e9poux est cens\u00e9 tenir imm\u00e9diatement ces avantages. La veuve en ne se r\u00e9servant pas ses propres, comme elle le pouvait, et en laissant \u2022 tomber \u00e0 dessein dans la communaut\u00e9 ce qu'elle avait de plus en mobilier que son second mari, est cens\u00e9 lui avoir fait en cela le m\u00eame avantage que celui qui est fait dans le cas d'une communaut\u00e9 conventionnelle, lorsque Ta femme y apporte plus que lui i et ii est \u00e9galement sujet \u00e0 Ta reduction de l'\u00e9dit. C'est dans ce sens qu'il faut entendre l'arr\u00eat du 29 janvier 1658 qui a jug\u00e9, dit Denizart, \" que Ia communaut\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par la Coutume entre conjoints par mariage, se trouvant excessive de Ia part de celui des deux conjoints qui s'est remari\u00e9, est un avantage indirect au profit de l'autre, sujet \u00e0 Ia r\u00e9duction en faveur des enfants du premier lit, et qu'apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9duction faite, le surplus de la communaut\u00e9 se doit partager entre ces enfants et le survivant des conjoints.\nMerlin, p. 556, vol. 8 :\nXIV.

L'avantage est de Ta moiti\u00e9 de ce que l'autre \u00e9poux a apport\u00e9 de plus.\nXV La communaut\u00e9 qui s'op\u00e8re en vertu de la Coutume et sans contrat de mariage deviant aussi un sujet de r\u00e9duction ; si le mobilier de la veuve est plus consid\u00e9rable que celui du second \u00e9poux, l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9 fait au profit de celui-ci un avantage, comme l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9 des apports dans la communaut\u00e9 stipul\u00e9e. Cet avantage est \u00e9galement sujet au retranchement Arr\u00eats de Brillon. V. Avantage, p. 804 :\nLa communaut\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par la Coutume entre conjoints par '.

Serve, T. 2. 1 ch. 86, rapporte l'arr\u00eat du 22 janvier 1658.\nD'apr\u00e8s les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es, ii est \u00e9vident qu'en l'absence d'un contrat de mariage ii y a en communaut\u00e9 de biens suivant la loi entre J. B. Lacombe et S. Neveu. Cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait lors de son mariage cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re de l'obligation de 1811, et de la rente viag\u00e9re. Ces cr\u00e9ances, ou partie d'icelle, sont-elles tomb\u00e9es dans cette communaut\u00e9 ?\nQuant \u00e0 l'obligation de 840 francs, ii y a une distinction \u00e0 faire. S. Neveu en \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire pour une moiti\u00e9 comme sa part dans cette cr\u00e9ance provenant de la premi\u00e8re communaut\u00e9. Cette moiti\u00e9 d'apr\u00e8s les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es est entr\u00e9e dans la seconde communaut\u00e9 mais sujette \u00e0 la condition d'\u00eatre r\u00e9duite au cas o\u00f9 elle constituerait un avantage an profit de son second mari. Quant \u00e0 l'autre moiti\u00e9, comme ii faut conclure d'apr\u00e8s les faits de la cause que S. Neveu en \u00e9tait devenue propri\u00e9taire \u00e0 titre de lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 de la part de son premier mari, elle est rest\u00e9e en dehors de la communaut\u00e9. Non-seulement la loi (le 2nd chef de l'\u00e9dit,) lui faisait d\u00e9fense absolue den avantager son second mari, mais elle \u00e9tablit sun les biens qui lui proviennent de cette mani\u00e8re une substitution en faveur de ses enfants. Ainsi ii y a eu dans ce cas, substitution en faveur d'Ad\u00e9lof\u00edde Pilon de cette moiti\u00e9 des 840 francs qui na pu entrer dans la communaut\u00e9. A la mont de sa m\u00e8re, donnant ouverture \u00e0 cette substitution, elle est devenue propri\u00e9taire de cette somme que, d'apr\u00e8s la loi, elle est cens\u00e9e tenir de son p\u00e8re et non de sa m\u00e8re\nL'autre moiti\u00e9 des 840 francs, c'est-\u00e0-dire 420 francs, \u00e9tant entr\u00e9e dans la 2nd communaut\u00e9, J.-Bte. Lacombe en a acquis une moiti\u00e9 par son droit de communaut\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire 210 francs \u00e9gal \u00e0 $35. Si l'entr\u00e9e de cette somme dans la communaut\u00e9 exc\u00e9dait ce que Lacombe y avait apport\u00e9 Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Pilon aurait pu en demander la r\u00e9duction. Mais pour cela ii aurait fallu plaider et prouver quels avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 les apports respectifs des conjoints et constater qu'il y avait eu de la part de S. Neveu un exc\u00e9dant suj\u00e9t \u00e0 r\u00e9duction.\nRien de cela n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 ni all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ni prouv\u00e9 que S. Neveu ait fait des apports plus consid\u00e9rables que son second mari. D'apr\u00e8s la preuve tons ses biens n'auraient consist\u00e9 que dans les deux seuls articles en question en cette cause, la rente viag\u00e8re et 840 francs. Il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait aucune preuve des apports du mari mais ii est assez facile de constater par le trans-port m\u00eame dont Ta nullit\u00e9 est demand\u00e9e que ceux qu'il a faits devaient \u00eatre au moins \u00e9gaux \u00e0 ceux de sa femme. En effet, par cet acte ii transporte \u00e0 Lalonde en outre de 840 francs et des arr\u00e9rages do Ta rente de diverses autres sommes, savoir : 5,200 francs et tous les int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9chus ; 300 francs de rente viag\u00e8re \u00e0 lui due personnellement en vertu d'un acte ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 son mariage avec S. Neveu, et tous les arr\u00e9rages de cette rente. En l'absence d'une preuve positive constatant les apports, on no peut pas pr\u00e9sumer qu'il y ait eu in\u00e9galit\u00e9, seule condition qui aurait pu faire maintenir une demande pour cette moiti\u00e9 des 840 francs. Comme propri\u00e9taire par droit de communaut\u00e9 d'un quart des 840 francs, 1.-Bte. Lacombe pouvait en faire le transport \u00e0 Lalonde sans tomber sous l'effet d'aucunes restrictions, pas plus sous celles do l'\u00e9dit que sous celles du code, Pour ces motifs le jugement de la cour du Bane do Ta Reine devrait \u00eatre reform\u00e9 et un quart des 840 frs devrait \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 \u00e0. Ta somme dont Lacombe pouvait disposer.\nQuant aux arr\u00e9rages do Ta rente viag\u00e8re, cette cour est d'opinion pour les raisons donn\u00e9es par Sir A. A. Dorion, qu\u2019ils sont entr\u00e9s dans Ta seconde communaut\u00e9. Les autorit\u00e9s sont d'accord \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer que pendant le mariage tous les revenus, de quelques sources qu'ils proviennent tombent dans la communaut\u00e9. Le second mari n'est pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 avantag\u00e9 par le surplus d\u00e9devenus que sa femme apporte \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9.\nPothier, au No 552 :\nLe second mari n'est cens\u00e9 avantag\u00e9 que de ce que la femme a apport\u00e9 de plus que lui en principal : ce que la femme apporte de plus en revenus, n'est pas r\u00e9put\u00e9 un avantage prohib\u00e9 et r\u00e9ductible qu'elle fasse \u00e0 son second mari; c'est pourquoi, si une femme qui a par exemple dix mille livres de revenus s'est mari\u00e9 \u00e0 un homme qui n'en a pas la dixi\u00e8me partie, et a contract\u00e9 avec lui communaut\u00e9 de biens, dans laquelle entreront ses revenus pendant tout le temps qu'elle durera.\nRicard decide qu'en ce cas, quoique le second mari profite des revenus de la femme, n\u00e9anmoins, cette communaut\u00e9 nest point r\u00e9put\u00e9e Un avantage qui puisse \u00eatre r\u00e9ductible suivant l'\u00e9dit. Merlin, rep. vo., Secondes noces, dit pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la m\u00eame chose. On trouve dans les arr\u00eats de Brillon, vo. Avantage, p. 305, qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9, au sujet d'une rente viag\u00e8re rempla\u00e7ant un conqu\u00eat, que cette jouissance, \u00e9tant un droit qui s'\u00e9teint par la mort du mari, ne pouvait former l'objet d'une demande en indemnit\u00e9 11 est clair d'apr\u00e8s les autorit\u00e9s que les prohibitions de l'\u00e9dit des secondes noces et de l'art. 279 ne s'appliquent pas aux arr\u00e9rages de la rente en question.\nAinsi d'apr\u00e8s les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es le transport est valable pour la part qui appartenait \u00e0 Lacombe dans les cr\u00e9ances transport\u00e9es, savoir : moiti\u00e9 des arr\u00e9rages de la rente vignetta moiti\u00e9 de 420 frs, partie de l'obligation de 18 11 tomb\u00e9e dans Ia communaut\u00e9. Il est nul pour partie comme contraire au second chef de l'\u00e9dit des secondes noces pour te moiti\u00e9 de 840 frs, qui \u00e9tait une lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 de son premier marl que S, Neveu \u00e9tait tenue de r\u00e9server \u00e0 son enfant. Mais ind\u00e9pendamment de l'\u00e9dit, ce transport est encore nul pour toute la part de S. Neveu dans les cr\u00e9ances en question comme \u00e9tant en contravention aux articles 1260 et 1265 Code Civil concernant l'irr\u00e9vocabilit\u00e9 des conventions matrimo-niales et comme constituant un avantage indirect con-\" ferr\u00e9 par la dite S. Neveu. Sur ce point qui forme le sujet de la troisi\u00e8me proposition des appelants, cette cour partageant l'opinion de Sir A A. Dorion, se borne \u00e0 la citer comme une r\u00e9ponse complete aux arguments contraires de l'Intim\u00e9.\nThere remains, however, the prohibitions of articles 282 and 283 of the Custom of Paris (articles 1260, 1266 and 774 of the Civil Code) that after marriage, the marriage covenants cannot be altered, nor can the consorts confer any benefits by acts inter vivos upon each other, except by means of life insurances. In the face of these pro habitations Scholdstique Neveu could not transfer her share in the second community, nor in the life-rent or arrears thereof, which formed part of the second community, to her husband, for this would have been altering the conditions of their marriage, by conferring upon him a pecuniary advantage. She was equally forbidden from transferring them to any of his descendants, who in that case are, by law, considered as persons interposed to secure indirectly to the husband a benefit which cannot be conferred to him directly. (Civil Code 774).\nIt has been said that the above rules merely apply to gratuitous contracts and that the \"transfer to Lalonde was made for a valuable consideration but the consideration mentioned in the deed that Lalonde should take charge of his own father and mother, the latter being the daughter of Lacombe, is one which was altogether for the advantage of Lacombe and his family \u2022 and in which the wife Scholastique Neveu had no interest whatsoever, since she was not bound by law to contribute to the maintenance of the children of her husband by a first marriage. (Civil Code, art. 1304).\nPour termini ii ne reste plus que quelques mots \u00e0 dire sur les propositions des intimes. La premiere, savoir qu'il n'y a aucune diff\u00e9rence entre une communaut\u00e9 ordinaire et une seconde, n'\u00e9tant que la contrepartie de celle des appelants, la r\u00e9ponse se trouve d\u00e9j\u00e0 donn\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s ci-dessus cit\u00e9es \u00e9tablissant quelles sont les restrictions apport\u00e9es par la loi \u00e0 une seconde communaut\u00e9.\nIl en est de m\u00eame de leur pretention que l'autorit\u00e9 du mari est la m\u00eame sur les biens d'une seconde communaut\u00e9 que sur ceux d'une premi\u00e8re. La r\u00e9ponse se trouve dans la citation de l'opnnion de Sir A. A. Dorion, d\u00e9montrant clairement que les articles 1265 et 774 Code Civil, ne reconnaissent pas au mari une autorit\u00e9 aussi \u00e9tendue sur les biens de la communaut\u00e9 que les intimes le pr\u00e9tendent.\nLa derni\u00e8re question d'apr\u00e8s l'ordre ci-dessus indiqu\u00e9 et qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre la premi\u00e8re si elle devait \u00eatre r\u00e9solue en faveur des Intimes est celle de l'abolition des prohibitions de l'\u00e9dit des secondes noces et de l'article 279 de la Coutume de Paris. L'Intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que ces restrictions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abolies d'abord par le statut de 1801 qui a introduit la libert\u00e9 illimit\u00e9e de tester puis ensuite par l'acte 764 C.C., auquel ii attribue un effet r\u00e9troactif.\nLe statut de 1801 a sans doute proclam\u00e9 la libert\u00e9 illimit\u00e9e de tester, et fait dispara\u00eetre toutes les incapacit\u00e9s de recueillir des legs \u00e0 l'exception de celle concernant les mains-mortes. Mais cette r\u00e8gle n'est pas\u00e9tendue \u00e0 la facult\u00e9 de donner entrevis dans des cas o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait interdite. La loi est rest\u00e9e ce qu'elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Apr\u00e8s la passation de ce statut, les biens d'une personne d\u00e9c\u00e9dant ab intestat \u00e9taient encore sujets aux r\u00e9serves coutumi\u00e8res et aux autres restrictions introduites par l'\u00e9dit et l'article 279. Pour exercer la facult\u00e9 introduite parle statut de 1801 et \u00eatre affranchi de toutes restrictions existantes auparavant il fallait disposer de ses biens par testament. C'est ce que la cour du Bane de la Reine a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la cause de Quint\u00edn vs. Girard le premier mans 1858, ([19]). Ni ce pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent ni le statut ne peuvent avoir d'application au cas actuel, parce que la disposition dont il s'agit en cette cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par acte entrevis, savoir par le transport du 21 f\u00e9vrier 1870.\nQuant \u00e0 l'art. 764, Code Civil, il est bien vrai qu'il d\u00e9clare \" que les prohibitions et restrictions des donations par un futur conjoint dans le cas de secondes \"noces n'ont plus lieu,\"\u2014mais cette d\u00e9claration peut-elle avoir un effet r\u00e9troactif et affecter des actes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accomplis avant sa promulgation ?. Non, car l'art. 2,613 d\u00e9clare que la loi en force avant le Code r\u00e9git les actes faits ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 sa promulgation. Et d'ailleurs, c'est un principe bien reconnu que les droits des \u00e9poux sont irr\u00e9vocablement fixes par le mariage ; one c'est aux lois alors en force ou aux conventions matrimoniales des parties qu'il faut recourir pour les d\u00e9terminer en ce qui concerne les droits acquis ([20]). Nul doute qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de leur mariage, J.-Bte. Lacombe et S. Neveu \u00e9taient soumis \u00e0 toutes les prohibitions ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9es de l'\u00e9dit et de l'art. 279. Les droits alors acquis entre eux doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9gis par ces lois. Mais en doit-il \u00eatre de m\u00eame des r\u00e9serves faites en faveur des enfants * peut-on les consid\u00e9rer comme des droits acquis avant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de leur m\u00e8re ? Les auteurs d\u00e9clarent qu'ils n'ont encore qu'une expectative qui ne peut So r\u00e9aliser que dans le cas o\u00f9 ils lui survivront ([21]). Lorsque la loi leur accordant conditionnellement ces r\u00e9serves est ensuite chang\u00e9e comme elle l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 dans ce cas par lar 764 C.C., le conjoint auquel ces restrictions \u00e9taient impos\u00e9es est-il par l\u00e0 m\u00eame rendu capable d'en disposer ?\nIl est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement admis que les lois concernant la capacit\u00e9 des personnes prennent leur effet \u00e0 dater do leur promulgation et n'ont point d'effet r\u00e9troactif ([22]). Mais ce principe ne saurait avoir d'application \u00e0 cette cause. Que S. Neveu ait \u00e9t\u00e9 on non lors du transport du 21 f\u00e9vrier 1870 rendue par l'art. 764, capable do disposer de ses biens par acte entrevis sans \u00e9gard aux restrictions do l'\u00e9dit et de l'art. 279, c'est une question quo les faits de cette cause ne permettent pas aux Intimes de soulever ici. En serait-il autrement s'il s'agissait d'une disposition que S. Neveu aurait faite a d autres qu'\u00e0 son mari ? On pourrait probablement alors se demander si ce n'est pas la loi en force le 21 f\u00e9vrier 1870 qui devrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e et non parcella en force lors de leur mariage. Cette question est toute diff\u00e9rente de celle que soul\u00e8ve le transport dont ii s'agit en cette cause et la cour pour cette raison s'abstient d'exprimer aucune opinion \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nQuant \u00e0 l'effet du transport sur cette cause on pourrait m\u00eame admettre avec los Intimes l'abolition des restrictions do l'\u00e9dit et de l'art. 279 sans quo le r\u00e9sultat leur f\u00fbt plus favorable. En effet ces restrictions disparues, ne reste-t-il pas celles des art. 1260, 1265 et 774 auxquelles il est manifestement contraire ?\nL'art. 764 permet bien aux conjoints dans le cas de secondes noces de s'avantager sans \u00e9gards aux restrictions ci-devant existantes. Mais la facult\u00e9 qu'il leur donne no pout \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e qu'au moment o\u00f9 ils r\u00e8glent leurs conventions matrimoniales. C'est aux futurs conjoints qu'elle est donn\u00e9e et non pas aux \u00e9poux. Une fois le mariage conclu, los conjoints tombent sous l'effet de l'art. 1265 qui leur d\u00e9fend de faire aucun changement aux conventions matrimoniales. Ainsi b\u00e9 transport doit, ind\u00e9pendamment de l'\u00e9dit et do l'art. 279 \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nub pour la part do Scholastique Neveu comme \u00e9tant fait en contravention \u00e0 l'art 1265\nPour toutes ces raisons cette cour est d'avis quo l'appel de Pilon et al, vs. Brunet et at, doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens en faveur des Intimes. Et quant \u00e0 l'appel do Brunet et al vs. Pilon et al cette cour \u00e9tant d'opinion qu'une partie de la somme de 840 francs, savoir un quart, est devenue la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 do J. Bte. Lacombe, par son droit do communaut\u00e9 avec Scholastique Neveu, le transport qu'il en a fait aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre maintenu pour autant, $35.00.\nLe jugement de la cour du Banc de la Reine doit en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre modifi\u00e9, en ajoutant au montant de lacondamnation la somme de $35.00 ce qui porte \u00e0 la somme de $2136.77 le montant pour lequel ii y a jugement, sans modification de la condamnation aux d\u00e9pens prononc\u00e9e par la cour du Banc de la Reine.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, and on cross-appeal judgment varied with costs of such cross-appeal.\nSolicitors for appellants : Duhamel, Pagnuelo & Rainville.\nSolicitors for respondents : R. & L.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nHypothecary action\u2014Delegation of payment in hypothec\u2014Sale of property en bloc prior to acceptance of delegation\u2014Personal liability under delegation\u2014Ventilation.\nOn the 14th October, 1874, Mrs. R. sold to one Q. the south half of the cadastral lot No. 4679, in the city of Montreal, and on the same day Mrs. C. sold him the north half of the same lot. On the 17th October, 1874, Q. sold to G., and to L. & R. three undivided fourths of the two properties en bloc for a sum, of $49,612.50, in deduction of which purchasers paid cash $22,246.87\u00bd, and covenanted to pay the balance for Q. to Mrs. R. Mrs. R. was not a party to this last deed, and did not then accept the delegated debtors. In June, 1876, Mrs. R. sued G. et al. hypothecarily for sums due to her on the deed of sale by herself to Q., and thereupon G. abandoned (delaiss\u00e9 en justice) his undivided fourth of the said south half of lot No. 4679. On the 4th December, 1877, Mrs. R. accepted the delegation of payment made in her favor by Q., in the deed of the 17th October, 1874, and afterwards brought the present action against G. for one-third part of the debt of $27,356.63, with interest due her in virtue of said delegation of payment. G. contended that the acceptance of the delegation of payment being subsequent to the hypothecary action and his delaissement was null and of no effect, and therefore he could not be sued for any portion of the money.\nHeld,\u2014That, under these circumstances, G. was relieved from personal liability under the delegation of payment, but only to the extent of his interest in the south half of said lot No. 4679, and remained liable for his interest in the remainder of the property, the amount to be estimated by a valuation (ventilation) of the south half of the lot proportionately to the price of the whole property.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), confirming the judgment of the Superior Court (Montreal), and dismissing the appellant's action[1].\nThis was an action brought by Dame Marguerite E. V. Reeves against Frederick Geriken, to recover $8,937, to wit: $6,841.40, as being the amount of three instalments of $2,280.46 2\/3 each, on the sum of $9,121.87\u00bd, balance due on a sale made by one Joseph Quesnel to Frederick Geriken, which balance the latter agreed to pay to Mrs. Reeves on account of a larger amount due her by Quesnel, and $1,915.59 for interest on the $9,121.87\u00bd, up to the 14th of October, 1877.\nDuring the pendency of this suit Dame M. E. V. Reeves (plaintiff) died, and F. Geriken (defendant) became insolvent; and the present appellant, as Dame M. E. V. Reeves' universal legatee, was substituted as plaintiff, and the present respondent, as assignee of the insolvent estate of Geriken, was substituted as defendant.\nThe facts are fully stated in the judgment of the Court hereinafter given.\nMr. Doutre, Q.C., for appellant, contended:\u2014\nThat the respondent could not, by surrendering his interest in the property in a former action (hypothecary) relieve himself of his personal obligation\nThe respondent became bound to the plaintiff (now appellant), by the acceptance of the delegation of payment from Quesnel, for the whole amount he agreed to pay, on the principle (1) that, in the absence of delegation, Quesnel could claim the whole from him; and the plaintiff, exercising the action of Quesnel, claims on the same ground; if Quesnel were plaintiff, the respondent would have no answer in law or equity to oppose, and the appellant, representing Quesnel, cannot be answered otherwise than Quesnel could.\nIn matter of hypothecs, every particle of land is hypothecated to the whole amount of the claim secured by such hypothec; the surrender of a portion left the remainder, to-wit: the portion sold by Mrs. Cadieux, hypothecated for the whole purchase money due to plaintiff, and the personal liability still subsisting, combined with the hypothec, prevented respondent from obtaining a release by surrendering a portion.\nAdmitting, by hypothesis, the principle invoked in the plea and in the judgment, the respondent was not impleaded in this action in respect to the land he surrendered. Art. 2013 C.C. and Art. 736 C. C. P. See also Merlin[2].\nAt the time the plaintiff brought her hypothecary action, she was not vested with the rights of Quesnel, either personal or hypothecary, unless she was vested by the mere registration of, Quesnel's sale to respondent, according to the doctrine held in Pattenaude & Leriger[3], which, after all, is immaterial. See also Ryan v. Halpin[4].\nThe only relief the respondent could claim from his surrender was that, through it, he had paid portion of his purchase money, such portion being determinable by means of a ventilation; but the respondent, not having pleaded any payment, there is no occasion for that enquiry.\nMr. Pagnuelo, Q.C., for the respondents, contended: 1st. That the amount claimed is the instalment and interest which the defendant had promised to pay Quesnel, represented by plaintiff, for the purchase of \u00bc of the south portion of lot 4679. 2nd. He has been evicted from this \u00bc by a hypothecary creditor of Quesnel, with the knowledge and sanction of Quesnel, the vendor.\n3rd. Quesnel was bound to repel this hypothecary action, or to indemnify the defendant; therefore, he is bound to return defendant the portion of the price which he has received cash from him at the time of the sale, and for the same reason he cannot claim the balance of the price; it would be absurd to make a man pay for a property from which he has been evicted for a cause whereof the vendor is responsible.\n4th. The plaintiff, who claims to exercise the actions of Quesnel, is repelled by the same plea or exception of warranty.\n5th. Moreover, there never was a delegation, even imperfect, in favor of plaintiff against defendant. She refused to accept defendant as her debtor, preferring to exercise her own hypothecary rights; this repudiation of the proffered delegation concludes her and liberates the debtor for ever.\n6th. The plaintiff, even if she had any right under this delegation of payment without a formal acceptance thereof, has entered with defendant into a judicial contract, duly executed, which had the effect of depriving defendant of the land he bought, and this finally settles the question.\nThe learned counsel relied on the following authorities and cases in support of his proposition: Duvergier, De la Vente[5]; Seaver v. Nye[6]; Dubuc v. Charron[7]; Banque du Peuple v. Gingras[8]; Art. 554 C. C. P.; Arts. 2016, 2017, 2058, 2061, 2062, C. C.; Troplong, De la Vente[9]; Troplong, Hypot heques[10]; Lauriere, Cout. de Paris[11].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\u2014 TASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nThe late dame M. E. V. Reeves, plaintiff in the court of first instance, alleged in her declaration that by deed of sale of 14th Oct., 1874, registered on the 20th of the same month, she sold to J. A. Quesnel, Sheriff of Arthabaska, a lot of land described at length, and designated as part of No. 4679, on the plan and book of reference made for the parish of Montreal, and composed of two pieces of land, the first of which containing 41 arpents and 13 perches, the second containing 28 arpents and 37 perches, the whole adjoining a lot of land, sold the same day, to the said Quesnel, by one dame Cadieux, also part of said cadastral lot No. 4679; that it was agreed in the said deed, that the said sale was made for the sum of $700 per superficial arpent, which, from the calculations made by the surveyor and accepted by the parties to the deed, amounted to a total sum of $48,650, in deduction of which the purchaser paid cash $12,162.50; and as to the balance, to wit $36,487.50, the said purchaser promised to pay it to the said plaintiff, in four annual and consecutive payments of $9,121.87\u00bd each, the first of which would be due and payable on the 14th October, 1875, and every other, at the same date, at each consecutive year, with interest at 7 per cent. reckoning from the date of the said deed, said interest payable semi-annually; and for surety of the payment of the said balance, and of the interest to accrue, the said lands were declared hypothecated by privilege of bailleur de fonds, vendor; that the said purchaser had taken possession of the said lands from the date of the said deed; and that there was due and owing to the said plaintiff, on the principal of the said purchase money, $27,365 62\u00bd, and $7,662.36 for interest accrued on the said sum of $36,487.50, since the date of the said deed; that the two sums added together formed $35,027.48\u00bd, on which she had received only $732.89, to be imputed on the interest; that by another deed of sale passed on the same day, dame Domitilde Meunier, wife separated as to property of Manass\u00e8s Cadieux and by him duly authorized, sold to the said J. A. Quesnel, present and accepting, a lot of land contiguous to the lots above mentioned, composed of two pieces, being all the north-east part of said lot 4679 of the cadastral plan and book of reference of the parish of Montreal, containing altogether 41 arpents and 49 perches; that the deed last mentioned had been registered on the 20th October, 1874; that by a deed passed on the 17th October, 1874, the said J. A Quesnel sold to the defendant (respondent), to the Hon. T. Robitaille and to the Hon. M. Laframboise, the three undivided fourths of the two immoveables above described, acquired by him, one from the said Domitilde Cadieux and the other from the plaintiff, forming, the said two immoveables, the total extent of the cadastral lot No. 4679; that the said sale, from J. A. Quesnel to the defendants, Robitaille and Laframboise, had been made for the sum of $49,612.50, in deduction whereof Quesnel acknowledged having received from the purchasers the sum of $22,246.87\u00bd; that it had been covenanted, in the said last mentioned deed, that, as to the balance of the purchase money, to wit, $27,365.62\u00bd the said defendant and his co-purchasers, Laframboise and Robitaille, would pay it or would cause it to be paid, each for a third part to the acquittal and discharge of the said Quesnel, to the said plaintiff or representatives, as follows, to wit: in four annual and consecutive payments of $6,841 each, the first of which would become due and payable on the 14th October, 1875, and so on, at each of the three consecutive years then following; that these payments put together were the same as those mentioned in the deed of the 14th October, 1874, by the plaintiff to the said Quesnel; that it had moreover been covenanted in the said deed, from Quesnel to the defendants, Robitaille and Laframboise, that the said balance of $27,365.62\u00bd would produce interest at 7 per cent. per annum, to be reckoned from the 14th October, 1874, which interest the said purchasers bound themselves each for a third to pay or cause to be paid to the plaintiff, every six months, to the acquittal of said Quesnel; that on the 14th October, 1877, there were due and payable three of the said payments and that the defendant was indebted in one-third of the said three payments, to wit: $6,841.40; that no interest had been paid on the said sum, since the 14th October, 1874, and that the said interest amounted, on the 14th October, 1877, to $1,915.59, the two sums forming together that of $8,757; that, at Montreal, the 4th day of December, 1877, by deed before l'Archev\u00eaque, notary public, the plaintiff had accepted the delegation of payment made in her favor, by the said Quesnel, in the deed of the 17th October, 1874, and had declared to be willing to constitute the said defendants, Laframboise and Robitaille her personal debtors, according to the terms of the said delegation; that on the 15th December, 187,7, that acceptation had been served upon the said Quesnel, and on the 19th December, 1877, upon the defendant, by notarial deeds; that under these circumstances, the plaintiff was entitled to claim from the defendant the said sum of $8,957 which the defendant refused to pay, wherefore she prayed for judgment, for principal, interest and costs.\nTo that action the respondent pleaded that on 1st June, 1876, the plaintiff impleaded the said Laframboise, Robitaille and Geriken, by action under No. 2298, declaring on the deed of sale by herself to Quesnel of the 14th October, 1874, alleging that the latter owed her $9,121.86\u00bd for the payment falling due on the 14th October, 1875, with $3,831.18 for interest, at 7 per cent. on the sum of $36,487.50, from the date of the said deed, until the 14th April, 1876, with interest at 6 per cent. on the sum of $2,554.12\u00bd from the 2nd December, 1875, date of the institution of an action against Quesnel, and with interest, from the date of said action, on $1,377.06, balance of the said interest until final payment; that these sums added together formed $12,953.05; that the said plaintiff further alleged in the said action that the three defendants were in possession, as proprietors, of three undivided fourths of the immoveable described in the said deed of sale, and she prayed hypothecarily against the said three defendants that the three undivided fourths of the said immoveable be declared hypothecated for the said sums, principal, interest and costs and that they be condemned to abandon the said three undivided fourths or to pay; that in conformity with the option offered by the plaintiff to the said defendants, the said Geriken had, on the 10th November, 1876, abandoned (d\u00e9laiss\u00e9 en justice) his undivided fourth of the property described in the declaration in this cause and in the deed of the 14th October, 1874, according to law, and that he had moreover, the same day, signified his abandonment to the plaintiff; that subsequently, the 28th December, 1877, judgment was rendered, by which the immoveable described in this cause and in the said deed of the 14th October, 1874, was declared hypothecated in favor of the plaintiff, for the said sum of $12,953.05, composed as above, with hypothecary condemnation against the said Laframboise, Robitaille and Geriken; that it follows from the foregoing that the pretended acceptation of delegation by the plaintiff was null and of no effect, and that the defendant Geriken could not be held in any manner to pay, either to the plaintiff or to Quesnel, any part of the purchase money which he had promised to pay for the property so abandoned by him, and of which he had suffered eviction by the act of the plaintiff and he prayed for the dismissal of the action. This was followed by a general issue.\nThe plaintiff answered generally, denying all the facts alleged in the plea and reiterating the affirmations of her declaration.\nThe evidence consists of the documents alleged in the declaration and the plea. Upon this evidence the Superior Court, sitting at Montreal, dismissed the plaintiff's action. On appeal, the Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the said judgment, and the plaintiff has thereupon brought the case to this court.\nI may here immediately remark that the case of Lacombe v. Fletcher[12], though it has not been cited by the parties, has not escaped my attention. It was there held by the Court of Appeal that the purchaser of an immoveable property, who has accepted an assignment of the price of sale, cannot set up, in answer to the claim of the assignee, a d\u00e9laissement (not a demand en d\u00e9laissement as the heading of the report states) made by him, so long as he has not been judicially dispossessed. In the present case, as in that one, the defendant merely alleges a d\u00e9laissement, without showing that any proceedings have been taken upon it. By art. 1521 C. C. this would seem sufficient. See also Dorwin v. Hutchins[13]. But without entering into the consideration of this question of law, as the parties have not raised it themselves, I may say that I think there is a distinction to be made of the present case from Lacombe v. Fletcher. There the plaintiff in the hypothecary action, on whose demand the defendant had abandoned the property, and the plaintiff in the personal action against the same defendant, were two different persons. Whilst here, the plaintiff in the hypothecary action and the plaintiff in the personal action are one and the same person. Now here, when the defendant pleaded his abandonment of the property, if the plaintiff, on whose demand this abandonment has been made in the hypothecary action, intended to renounce this abandonment, or not to proceed on it, she should have pleaded it by a special answer to the defendants' plea. She did not do so, but merely filed a general answer to the plea. Now, she cannot be presumed to have renounced her rights on the hypothecary action, and the judgment she obtained thereon. I then take it that the abandonment made by the defendant is complete and must be taken as such, in the consideration of the present case, and so it seems to have been treated in the two courts below.\nAnother point which has not been noticed by the parties, has presented itself to my mind.\nBy art. 1180 C. C. the debtor consenting to be delegated cannot oppose to his new creditor the exceptions which he might have set up against the party delegating him, although at the time of the delegation he were ignorant of such exceptions.\nIt may be that this only applies to a perfect delegation, and when novation has taken place and the first debtor discharged, though Demolombe[14] is of opinion that this rule applies even when the first debtor has not been discharged, as is the case here. See on the question Duranton[15], Laurent[16], and authorities there cited. It is possible also that as Mrs. Reeves did not accept the delegation, but accepted it only later by a separate deed, this may render this rule inapplicable to this case. I presume that she must have thought so, since she did not avail herself of it in answer to the defendant's plea. However, as the question has not been raised, nor argued, either before us or in the court below, I do not give any opinion on it.\nI then take it that the defendant can oppose to the plaintiffs demand all the exceptions he could have opposed to Quesnel, in whose rights she stands in this case.\nNow if Quesnel himself was suing the defendant for his share of the price of the sale made by him Quesnel to this defendant and Laframboise and Robitaille, the defendant could plead in answer to Quesnel's demand that he has been evicted of the property sold to him. For the abandonment (d\u00e9laissement) of the property made by the defendant is, in law, an eviction:\nC'est pourquoi les demandes en revendication, les demandes en action hypothecaire qui sont donn\u00e9es contre quelqu'un, sont appell\u00e9es, dans le language du Palais, des \u00e9victions[17].\nThe defendant, when sued in an hypothecary action by Reeves, could have, in the same suit, sued Quesnel en garantie, but his failure to do so does not free Quesnel from his obligations as warrantor, as it is not pretended that he had any ground of defence to the hypothecary action,[18]. It is clear also that Quesnel, as the defendant's warrantor, could now be sued by the defendant in a direct action[19].\nNow, celui qui a taction a l'exception, and the defendant has the right to invoke against Quesnel's demand (and against Reeves, his locum tenens), those obligations of Quesnel, as such warrantor[20], resulting from the eviction from this property which he, the defendant, has had to submit to[21]. Just as he would under article 1535 C. C., (if, instead of having actually been evicted, he had only cause to fear being disturbed by Reeves' hypothecary action,) be entitled to delay the payment of the price of sale to Quesnel, until he,\nQuesnel, caused such disturbance to cease, or gave security.\nI may here remark that the opinion seems to have been expressed in the courts below, and it has been repeated at the argument here, that Geriken has a ground of exception against the plaintiff's demand, on the fact that he was sued hypothecarily, and had to abandon the property for Laframboise and Robitaille's share of the price of sale, as well as for his own share.\nThis is an error resulting, I am sure, from the fact that it has been overlooked that in Quesnel's sale to Geriken, Laframboise and Robitaille, though each of the purchasers is personally charged with one-third of the balance of the price of sale, yet, all they bought, that is to say, the three-fourths of the property, was mortgaged for the whole of the balance due\u2014that is to say, Geriken does not only mortgage his fourth of the property for his share of the price, Robitaille his share of the property for his share of the price, and Laframboise his share of the property for his share of the price, but the whole of their shares together are mortgaged for the whole of the balance due. So that each share of the property is mortgaged, not only for what is due by the holder of that share, but also for what is due by the holders of the other two shares. The deed is clear on this:\nAnd as security for the payment of the said sum or balance of the price of sale, the undivided three-fourths of the above described land and dependence, now sold, remain specially affected and hypothecated by privilege of vendor expressly reserved.\nSo that though, personally, Geriken, Laframboise and Robitaille owe each only one-third of the balance of the price of sale, yet each of them mortgaged his share of the property for the two-thirds due by the two others as well as for his own. Of course, not being personally responsible for Laframboise and Robitaille's two shares, Geriken, when sued hypothecarily for these two shares, could abandon the property, as he did, and free himself from any further liability quoad these two shares[22]. But he cannot oppose this abandonment quoad these two shares to Quesnel. It is obvious, that if he mortgaged his property in favour of Quesnel as security for Robitaille's and Laframboise's shares, he cannot invoke against him, Quesnel, as a ground of exception to the demand of the price of sale, that he has been sued on that mortgage. I do not lose sight of the fact that the hypothecary action against Geriken was based on Reeves' sale to Quesnel, and that it is only in Quesnel's sale to Geriken and others that this joint mortgage for the whole sum on each share of the property is created. But, as an answer to Quesnel, this, it seems to me, is of no importance. But it is not only for Robitaille and Laframboise's shares, as well as for his own, that Geriken has been sued hypothecarily, and has abandoned this property, but he was so sued, and made such abandonment, for Quesnel's share as well. Now for this share of Quesnel he was guaranteed by Quesnel against all trouble and eviction. As I have remarked previously, even if he had not been sued hypothecarily, and had not thereupon abandoned the property, if Quesnel sued him for the price of sale, Geriken could plead fear of trouble under art. 1535 C. C. and delay his payment till Quesnel paid his share of the price, or got in some manner a discharge of the mortgage for his share, or gave security to the amount thereof.\nIt seems clear, also, that if Reeves had accepted the delegation in her favour by the deed itself which has created it, and then had sued Geriken for his share of the price of sale, as she does in the present case, then Geriken would also, against her demand, have been entitled to plead, under the provisions of art. 1535, his fears of being troubled for Quesnel's mortgage, for his own share of the price. Why could he not now plead against her demand the eviction he has had to submit to, as he could plead it against Quesnel himself?\nBut the direct question raised here is whether Reeves, having sued Geriken hypothecarily, can now sue him personally for his share of the price of the sale made by Quesnel to him and to others, on the acceptance of the delegation therein, which acceptance she has made since her hypothecary action and the abandonment thereon by Geriken.\nIn France, an abandonment may be made without a demand of it being made by a mortgagee, and the authors treat extensively the question whether an abandonment can be made voluntarily and be forced upon the mortagees when the price of sale is still due by the holder of the property. But that is not the question here. Reeves herself has demanded from Geriken the abandonment of this property and he has abandoned it only upon her own summons to him to do so. Of course, if it was only for his share of the price of sale that he had been sued, there would be no question that Geriken could never rid himself of his obligations under the contract of sale, but he has been sued hypothecarily and has abandoned for Quesnel's share of the price as well as for his own. Now, the authorities seems to me clear against Reeves' right, under such circumstances, of now asking against Geriken a personal condemnation for his share of the price of sale. Troplong[23], has no doubt on this. Pont[24] agrees with Troplong, and says that the jurisprudence has settled the point according to Troplong's views. After speaking of the personal action of the party to whom the delegation has been made against the party delegated, he adds:\nSeulement, les cr\u00e9anciers devront soigneusement \u00e9viter, dans ces divers cas de mettre en avant l'action hypoth\u00e9caire, s'ils tiennent \u00e0 conserver l'action personnelle qu'ils ont contre le tiers d\u00e9tenteur; s'ils concluaient tout d'abord au d\u00e9laissement, on s'ils proc\u00e9daient aux poursuites par la sommation de payer ou de d\u00e9laisser ils seraient cens\u00e9s renoncer par cela m\u00eame \u00e0 l'action personnelle, et desormais, ils seraient non recevables \u00e0 l'exercer. C'est la remarque de M. Troplong; elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la jurisprudence[25].\nIn a case of Hulot v. Arjambault, decided by the Court of Appeal, Orleans, on the 28th May, 1851, it was specially held that if in such a case a personal creditor sues hypothecarily, he loses his personal action.\nI would refer also to the cases of Duplessis v. Poulet and Vernor v. Roy, decided in the same court in 1847 and 1849. These three decisions are to be found in Devilleneuve and Carette[26].\nThe case of Geoffroy v. Duplessis, decided by the Cour de Cassation on July 1st, 1850,[27] may be also cited as being on questions relating to this one. There the surrender of the property was annulled, because the price of sale was more than sufficient to pay the mortgagees. There can be no such question raised on the present case. The sum due by Geriken was not sufficient to pay Quesnel's debt.. If he had paid his share, he would have had to pay Quesnel's share besides, pay two shares, the half of the price, instead of one share, the fourth of the price. He could not, by paying his share of the price of sale, free the property from the mortgage lying upon it for Quesnel's share of this price. He could then surrender the property and thereby free himself from his own personal obligations at the same time as from the mortgage upon the property for Quesnel's share. Reeves cannot complain of it, since she herself gave him the option to surrender the property, and Quesnel (or Reeves in his name) cannot complain of it either, since he has lost his right of action against the defendant for the price of sale, by not fulfilling his share of the contract of sale, that is to say, his obligation of warranty towards the defendant against all trouble and hypothecs. Laurent says[28];\nIl reste une hypoth\u00e8se sur laquelle il ne reste aucun doute. Le prix ne suffit pas pour d\u00e9sint\u00e9resser les cr\u00e9anciers; ceux-ci agissent hypoth\u00e8cairement; c'est leur droit et leur int\u00e9r\u00eat. L'acqu\u00e9reur d\u00e9laisse, comme il en a le droit. Dans ce cas le vendeur ne peut pas intervenir pour s'opposer au d\u00e9laissement et pour en demander la nullit\u00e9. En effet, le vendeur n'a d'autre action contre l'acqu\u00e9reur que l'action personnelle pour le contraindre \u00e0 payer son prix; mais il exercerait vainement cette action; dans l'esp\u00e8ce, la poursuite ne d\u00e9sint\u00e9resserait pas les cr\u00e9anciers, puisque le paiement du prix ne d\u00e9gagerait pas l'immeuble de toutes les charges hypoth\u00e9caires qui le gr\u00e8vent; de sorte que l'acqu\u00e9reur, tout en payant, resterait expos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'action hypoth\u00e9caire des cr\u00e9anciers qui ne seraient pas d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9s; Or, d\u00e8s qu'il est tenu hypoth\u00e9cairement et poursuivi comme tiers d\u00e9tenteur, il a le droit de d\u00e9laisser. Ce sont les termes de l'arr\u00eat que nous venons d'analyser (No. 282). La doctrine est d'accord avec la jurisprudence.\nThe case of Dubuc v. Charron[29], decided by Mr. Justice Badgley, at Montreal, in 1865, is precisely in point, and maintains the same doctrine. The case of La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Permanente de Construction v. Larose[30], in the Court of Review, Montreal, 1870, though not exactly on facts similar to those in the present case, virtually decides the point in the same sense as Dubuc v. Charron. There the purchaser had specially stipulated that he would have the right to surrender the property, but the court in its consid\u00e9rants says that this was a right which he had by the operation of the law. Then there is the case of La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction de Montreal v. D\u00e9saultels[31], decided in April last by the Court of Review, at Montreal, where it was held that hypothecary creditors, whom a purchaser had obliged himself to pay by his deed of purchase, forfeit their rights to a personal action against him, by suing him hypothecarily. I refer also specially to 20 Duranton Nos. 252 to 257.\nIt appears to me there can be no doubt upon this question of law.\nAnother possible point of view in this case is this: Reeves accepted the delegation only after Geriken had surrendered the property on the hypothecary action. Till then, Quesnel was alone Geriken's creditor[32]. He could till then have revoked that delegation[33], and even without doing so, and notwithstanding the delegation, he could sue Geriken for the price of sale if any was due[34].\nReeves could never, against her will, be bound to accept this delegation. The question whether the registration of the deed constituting the delegation was a sufficient acceptance of the delegation cannot be raised here, because she never intended to avail herself of the delegation till she accepted it by the deed of December 4th, 1877. On the contrary, she virtually refused the offer of this delegation by proceeding hypothecarily. It may be that, under certain circumstances, registration of a deed containing a delegation may be invoked by the party to whom the delegation is made, as an acceptance or equivalent to an acceptance of it, but it cannot be contended that such registration operates a forced acceptance of the delegation, and imposes it against his will on the creditor. Here it is only by the deed of December 4th, 1877, that Reeves accepted this delegation. But at this date Geriken owed nothing. The contract between him and Quesnel had been resiliated. Upon being evicted from the property for a mortgage against which his vendor was obliged to guarantee him, he ceased to be bound by his obligations under this contract. Had he paid his purchase price before being evicted he could have recovered it back from his vendor[35]; not having yet paid it, he can, on the same grounds, resist his vendor's demand for it He was entirely relieved from this price of sale. So that, when Reeves accepted the delegation, she was too late; Geriken had been freed from his obligations.\nBut now, as to a question of fact, I have so far supposed that Geriken has been evicted from the whole of the property he bought from Quesnel. But is that so? Certainly not. He bought from Quesnel the whole of lot 4679, but he has been evicted from the south part of that lot only, from the part sold to Quesnel by Reeves. This appears by his own plea. He alleges that he has been evicted from the part of the property described in Reeve's deed to Quesnel, of the 14th of October, 1874. Indeed, Reeves had no hypothec by her own deed of sale on the other part of the lot, which Geriken bought on the same day from Mrs. Cadieux, and then, of course, had no hypothecary action against Geriken, as holder of the Cadieux lot, in virtue of his own deed to Quesnel. Geriken has, then, been evicted from a part only of the property sold to him by Quesnel. He thus can claim to be relieved from the payment of the value of that part only, as he holds the other part, and Mrs. Reeves' acceptance of the delegation is valid for the part for which the sale stands good. The value of this part, for which he has not to pay, is, according to Art. 1518 C. C., to be estimated proportionately upon the price he had agreed to pay for the whole property. So that a relative valuation of this south part of the lot has to be made before the amount to be deducted from the price of sale, and from the three instalments thereof claimed in the present case, can be ascertained[36].\nThe defendant has contended before us that he has paid Quesnel in cash for the Cadieux lot; that is to say, for one-fourth his share of it. He wants us to find in the sale from Quesnel to him and his co-purchasers, that the balance due thereon is due for the Reeves lot only. But this is hardly covered by his plea, and then that may have been the intention of the parties to that deed, but that is not what they did. The sale is purely and simply of the three-fourths of the whole of the lot 4679 for one sum en bloc, and for that sum the purchasers have mortgaged, not only this Reeves' lot, but also the Cadieux lot, so that Reeves now, as cessionaire of Quesnel, has a mortgage on the Cadieux lot. The deed expressly says that the balance due is due for the sale of the three-fourths of the two lots. The mortgage is stipulated for the said price of sale, that is, for the price agreed upon for the said three-fourths of the two lots, not for the price of the Reeves lot only.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs, and that the plaintiff should have judgment for part of the three instalments due to her; the amount to be established by the valuation to be made of the part of the property abandoned by the defendant proportionately to the price agreed to as the price of the whole of it. Perhaps the parties may agree as to that valuation, and as to the amount for which judgment should be entered. GWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nI concur in the judgment of my brother Taschereau. I think the plaintiff is entitled to recover the difference, if any there be, between the value of the one-fourth part from which Geriken was evicted and the amount claimed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Doutre, Branchaud & McCord.\nSolicitors for respondent: Duhamel, Pagnuelo & Rainville.\n[1] 2 Legal News 67.\n[2] Vo.

J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nCanada Temperance Act, 1878, Constitutionality of\u2014Powers of Dominion Parliament\u2014Secs. 91 and 92, B. N. A. Act, 1867\u2014Power to prohibit sale of Intoxicating Liquors\u2014Distribution of Legislative Power.\nHeld,\u20141. That the Act of the Parliament of Canada, (41 Vic., c. 16,) \"An Act respecting the traffic in intoxicating liquors,\" cited as \"The Canada Temperance Act, 1878,\" is within the legislative capacity of that body.\n2. That by the British North America Act, 1867, plenary powers of legislation are given to the Parliament of Canada over all matters within the scope of its jurisdiction, and that they may be exercised either absolutely or conditionally; in the latter case the legislation may be made to depend upon some subsequent event, and be brought into force in one part of the Dominion and not in the other. 3. That under sub-sec. 2 of sec. 91, B. N. A. Act, 1867, \"regulation of trade and commerce,\" the Parliament of Canada alone has the power of prohibiting the traffic in intoxicating liquors in the Dominion or in any part of it, and the Court has no right whatever to enquire what motive induced Parliament to exercise its powers.\n[Henry, J., dissenting.]\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, quashing a return to a mandamus nisi, and ordering a peremptory mandamus to be issued in the cause.\nOn the 1st day of May, 1878, the second part of The Canada Temperance Act, 1878, which prevents the sale of spirituous or intoxicating liquors, with certain exceptions, was brought into force in the City of Fredericton, N. B., pursuant to the provisions of the first part of that act.\nOn the 18th day of October, 1878, The Supreme Court of New Brunswick, upon the application of Thomas Barker, who kept an hotel in Fredericton, issued a mandamus nisi to the Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the City of Fredericton, commanding them to issue a license to the said Thomas Barker, to sell spirituous liquors by retail within the said city in his hotel, or to shew cause to the contrary.\nThe Mayor, &c., duly made answer and return to the writ of mandamus, refusing to grant the license for the following reasons viz: \"That The Canada Temperance Act, 1878, was declared in force in the City of Fredericton, on the first day of May last, and therefore the city council could not grant a license to Thomas Barker to sell spirituous liquors by retail contrary to the provisions of that act.\"\nUpon motion to quash the return and for the issue of a peremptory mandamus all parties were heard by counsel. It was agreed that the only question which the Court should be called upon to decide was as to the power of the Parliament of Canada to pass The Canada Temperance Act, 1878; all technical and other objections were waived.\nIn Michaelmas Term, 1879, the Court, consisting of the Chief Justice Allen and Judges Weldon, Fisher, Wetmore, and Palmer, gave judgment, holding The Canada Temperance Act, 1878, void, as being ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada; Palmer, J., dissenting[1]. The issue of a peremptory mandamus was then ordered.\nFrom this judgment the Mayor etc. appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMr. Lash, Q. C., for appellants:\nThe question to be decided on this appeal is whether Mr. Barker was entitled to a mandamus compelling the City Council to give him a license to sell spirituous liquors in the city of Fredericton, where The Canada Temperance Act, 1878, was brought into force. None of the detail provisions of the Act are brought in question for decision, the broad question being the power of the Parliament of Canada to pass the second and third parts of the Act, which prohibit under certain penalties the sale of spirituous liquors except upon certain specified conditions.\nI propose to submit to the Court three positions upon which I intend to base my argument:\u2014\nFirst.\u2014That as to all matters relating to the internal affairs of Canada and the Provinces composing it, and to the good government of the same, full legislative authority is vested either in the Parliament of Canada, or in the Provincial Legislature, or in both; in other words, that there is no reserved power respecting those matters in the Imperial Parliament. Second.\u2014That the Provincial Legislatures have only such legislative powers as have been specifically conferred upon them by the B. N. A. Act, and that the whole balance of the legislative power over the internal affairs of Canada and the Provinces composing it rests with the Parliament of Canada. Third\u2014That when the powers specifically conferred upon the Dominion Parliament clash with the powers of the Provincial Legislatures, the latter must give way.\nIf these propositions be sound it follows, that in order to establish, as between the Dominion Parliament and the Provincial Legislatures, that a power does not exist in the Dominion Parliament, it must first be shewn that such power is vested in the Local Legislatures.\nI will therefore first argue that the power to pass The Canada Temperance Act, 1878, is not within the legislative authority of the Provincial Legislatures. The act by sec. 99 prohibits the sale of liquor by every body in those places within which the act may be brought into force, except for certain purposes. Then, by the 100 section et seq. the act provides for penalties and prosecutions for offences against the second part of the act. Can it be said that the power to pass this legislation exists in Provincial Legislatures? It is contended on the part of the respondent that the act is within the powers of those Legislatures because they have power over the subject of \"Shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer and other licenses, in order to the raising of a revenue for Provincial, Local or Municipal purposes\"[2], and over the subject of Municipal Institutions and of property and civil rights in the Province[3], and over \"matters of a merely local nature in the Province[4].\nIt will be observed that the 9th sub-section gives legislative authority over the licenses to be issued and not over the traffic to be carried on in the shop, saloon, &c. Legislative authority over that part of the business relating to the sale of liquor by a saloon-keeper, as well as to the sale of goods and merchandise by a shop-keeper, belongs exclusively to the Parliament of Canada, by reason of the commercial nature of the transactions. The case of Severn v. The Queen[5] seems to admit, that Provincial Legislatures cannot pass any law which would amount to prohibition. But, it is said, this act virtually takes away the right specifically given to Local Legislatures to issue tavern licenses. I submit it does not do so, for the power to issue the license remains, but I must admit that its usefulness is gone.\nI contend that if there be legislative authority over any particular subject matter, that authority may be exercised notwithstanding that the exercise of it may affect the revenue derived from the precise condition of that matter before the exercise of such authority.\nFor instance, the Local Legislatures have authority to impose direct taxation for the purpose of raising a revenue. Suppose the Legislature imposes a poll tax upon aliens, that would not prevent the Dominion Parliament from naturalizing those aliens, thus depriving the Province of that source of revenue. So with the sale of liquor. If the Parliament of Canada can as a regulation of trade prevent its sale, the fact that the prevention will deprive the Provincial Authorities of a source of revenue cannot affect the power to prevent. Some other clause, then, must be looked to.\nThe next clause relied upon is sub-section 8, relating to \"Municipal institutions in the Provinces.\" It is said that Fredericton, being a municipalty having control over this subject before confederation, the power cannot be taken away. I contend that the Dominion Parliament can pass laws which interfere with the powers exercised by municipalities previous to confederation, so far as relates to matters within the authority of Parliament. Will it be said, that Parliament has no control over the power possessed by municipalities before confederation over weights and measures. Such power existed previous to confederation, in certain municipalities. The same might be said of other matters.\nIt is also contended that this law, having for its object the suppression of drunkenness, is a police regulation and so within the powers of municipalities, and reference is made to the remarks of Your Lordship, the Chief Justice, in Regina v. Justices of Kings[6].\n[THE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014I think I said nothing that may be interpreted as to say the Local Legislatures had power to prohibit?]\nNo, my Lord, and what was stated is quite consistent with the fact\u2014that the Local Legislatures have certain powers, the exercise of which would tend to prevent drunkenness, but it does not follow that the sole right to legislate so as to prevent drunkenness rests with the Local Legislatures; the Legislatures may attain that end in one way, Parliament may attain it in another. The question here is not: is the object of this legislation within the powers of Parliament or of a Legislature? But the question is, are the means used within those powers? The means used in this case are certainly not in the local authority.\nGreat stress has been laid by the Court below upon the preamble of the Act, and it is said that it is not within the powers of Parliament, because the preamble shews that it is an Act for the promotion of temperance, and not a regulation of trade or commerce.\nTo this I answer, (a) that if Parliament possessed power to pass the Act without any preamble shewing its reasons for passing it, the insertion of the preamble declaring the reasons could not take away or affect the power so possessed, and that although the preamble may properly be looked to for the purpose of assisting in the construction of the Act as passed, and of ascertaining the meaning of the language used, yet it can have no effect upon the power of Parliament to pass the Act nor can it limit, except as a matter of construction, the effect of the language used, (b) that if the preamble be looked at at all, it must be looked at as a whole, and it expressly declares one of the reasons for passing the Act to be \"that there should be uniform legislation in all the Provinces respecting the traffic in intoxicating liquors.\"\nMr. Justice Fisher in his judgment says that the Act is not a regulation of trade and commerce, because in his opinion its provisions are unnecessary to such regulation, but he admits that, if such provisions be necessary, the Act is within the powers of Parliament.\nTo this I answer that the necessity for an Act is a matter entirely for decision by Parliament, and that the Court, except as a matter of construction, cannot deal with it.\nJudges Fisher and Weldon refer to the unequal partial effect of the Act, and seem to rely upon this as a reason why it is not a regulation of trade.\nTo this I answer, that the power of our Parliament to regulate trade does not depend upon the effect of the regulation being equal with respect to all, or upon the regulation effecting all parts of Canada at once.\nThe next sub-section relied on by the respondent is 13 of sec. 92., viz.: \"Property and Civil Rights in the Province.\" I do not understand that the respondent contends that by virtue of those powers the legislature could have passed this Act, but they say it is an interference with such powers. The appellants contend that this fact does not affect the general powers of Parliament, as if there be such interference the powers of the Local Legislature must give way. The respondents are therefore confined to the contention that the necessary power exists in the legislature under sub-section 16 of sec. 92, relating to matters of a merely local or private nature in the Province.\nTo this it is answered, that by the latter part of sec. 91, it is expressly provided that any matter coming within sec. 91, shall not be deemed to come within the class included in sub-section 16 of sec. 92.\nIt is further said that, as by the sec. 121 of the British North America Act provision is made that articles, the growth &c. of one Province, shall be admitted free into the other Provinces, the power to import implies the power to sell, and that Parliament could not therefore interfere with that power. But the right to sell exists quite independently of the right to import. The B. N. A. Act does not declare that any article, which may be admitted to pass from one Province to another, may be sold in that other Province. It is not because an article is admitted to pass free from one Province to another that it can be legally sold. Immoral prints might be sent from one Province to another, but they could not be sold without an offence being committed, because the law says such things shall not be sold. There must be some legislative authority to destroy the power to sell. Certainly it can only be the authority of the Dominion Parliament.\nIt is contended that because the Act affects only particular districts, it is not general legislation, and therefore ultra vires. There is nothing in the B. N. A. Act which says that the powers of Parliament must be executed in any particular way or over the whole of Canada at once. Constantly there is partial legislation in a geographical sense. Take, for instance, the Blake Act against the carrying of fire arms. There is no authority to say it must be exercised generally in a geographical sense. In addition to the regulation of trade and commerce, I will also contend that under the 27 sub-section of sec. 91, relating to the criminal law, the Dominion Parliament had power to pass this Act.\nThe power to legislate upon the Criminal law includes the right to declare Acts, in themselves lawful, to be no longer lawful, if Parliament thinks that the public good requires it. Drunkenness is a fruitful source of all kinds of crime. In legislating to promote temperance, Parliament is, in an eminent degree, dealing with the criminal law.\nIt is not obliged to wait till liquor has been sold and then drunk till intoxication has ensued and crime has been committed, before dealing with the subject. It has the fight to legislate and attack the cause. Finding a cause lawful in itself productive of such criminal effects, it can, as part of the criminal law, declare that cause to be an offence, and so if possible obliterate the most fruitful source of crime known to exist. Drinking liquor was not per se a criminal offence, but this law was against the sale, not against the drinking of liquor. Carrying arms was not per se unlawful, but Parliament in its wisdom has deemed it advisable to make it an offence. Drunkenness, according to the reports of grand juries and other authorities, was one of the most fruitful sources of crime, and there was no reason why Parliament should not deal with it as had already been done with the practice of carrying arms.\nThe remaining point taken by the respondent is, that this act is a delegation of powers and that the Dominion Parliament has no power to delegate its powers. In this case there has been no delegation of authority, but merely conditional legislation. See Queen vs. Burah[7]. Here the act has been passed and its effect is suspended, until certain conditions precedent are performed, and then the act by virtue of its own self comes into force. I contend that the same power, with respect to the matters within its control, exists in the Parliament of Canada as exists in the Parliament of Great Britain, and if the power of delegating it exists here, the British North America Act itself is a delegation of authority from the Imperial Parliament. To sum up shortly I contend:\n(1). That the Act is within the powers of Parliament because it could not have been passed by the legislature of the Province.\n(2). That it is a regulation of trade and commerce.\n(3). That even if not a regulation of trade it is within the Criminal law.\nMr. Maclaren followed on behalf of the appellant:\u2014.\nAs to the question of delegation, the cases cited in the respondent's factum are State decisions in the United States. It is scarcely necessary to point out the difference between the two systems. There the residuum of power is in the people and not in the legislature. It is however now recognized, that conditional legislation, or laws known as local option laws, are quite within the limits of their powers. See Cooley on Cons. Lim.[8].\nIn Quebec a large number of by-laws depend on their going into effect on the vote of the people. If the Local Legislatures had this power, surely the Parliament of Canada had the same power.\nThe Dunkin Act, which this act supersedes, came into force in the same way, for it left it optional to the municipalities to put it into operation. The constitutionality of that act was never questioned, before confederation. Then also there is the Act 32 Vic. c. 24, since confederation, \"An Act for the better preservation of peace in the vicinity of Public Works,\" which provides that arms are not to be carried nor liquors to be sold within certain limits of Public Works. This last act was only brought into force at the option of the Governor in Council. This last act also shows that the prohibition of the sale of liquors, has been considered as coming within the criminal jurisdiction given to the Dominion Parliament. I might also cite the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act which came into force by proclamation.\nHowever, the appellant chiefly relies on sub-sections 2 and 27 of sec. 91, as giving power to the Dominion Parliament to pass The Canada Temperance Act, 1878.\nA great deal of stress is laid on the preamble of the act, which seems to be the stumbling block to the working of the act in New Brunswick. The Judges of the Court below have assumed that this is not an act to regulate trade and commerce, but only to promote temperance.\n[THE CHIEF JUSTICE: If the power to regulate trade and commerce exists and the exercise of that power has an effect on temperance, can it be a reason to interfere with the power?]\nOur answer is that they have power to regulate trade and commerce in such a way as to promote the good government of the country. Then also it is said, that this act interferes with the exclusive control given to the Local Legislatures over municipal institutions in the Province, and matters affecting civil rights and property. My contention is that the Dominion Parliament has full power to legislate upon all matters strictly within its jurisdiction, no matter what effect it may have on classes of matters comprised in those assigned by sec. 92 to the legislatures of the Provinces; and I base my contention on the concluding lines of sec. 91. The Court below has not given full force to the words, \"shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local &c.\"\n[THE CHIEF JUSTICE: The Dominion Parliament can deal with shipping, and can it not do so irrespective of the power given to the Local Legislatures as to the civil rights over the subject?]\nCertainly, my Lord, my impression is that that subsection 16 of sec. 92 includes many subjects previously mentioned.\n[HENRY J.: Do you draw any line as to trade and commerce? This question is the most important one bearing upon the case. In dealing with trade and commerce, there is hardly any question of property or civil rights which could not be touched upon in some way. The main question is as to where the line should be drawn?]\nAltho' I do not feel confident in drawing a line, I would say this: Where there is an apparent conflict, in so far as it is a bon\u00e2 fide regulation of trade and commerce, the local interest must give way. I think this is a fair construction to put on the concluding words of section 91.\nIf the law were otherwise, the sub-section 13, civil rights, would take away the Dominion power altogether. In dealing with property and civil rights, there are many matters of commerce with which the Local Legislatures could deal, if Dominion authority was not considered paramount. The Dominion Parliament could not even legislate on criminal matters. All I am prepared to argue for the present is that the preamble of the act comes within sub-sec. 2 of sec. 91.\nThe word traffic is synonymous with trade. The traffic in intoxicating liquors has always been considered a branch of trade. The first decision is to be found in the legislative Journals of 1855 of the old Province of Canada (p. 957, 2 part). A Bill was introduced to prevent traffic in intoxicating liquors, and Speaker Sicotte, now one of the Judges of the Superior Court of Quebec, decided that the Bill related to trade, and as such should have originated in committee of the whole, and on that ground it was thrown out. The courts in Quebec have unanimously held that the Local Legislatures had no legislative authority to pass a prohibitory liquor law. See Sauv\u00e9 v. The Corporation of the County of Argenteuil[9]; Hart v. La Corporation du Comt\u00e9 de Missisquoi[10]; Poitras v. Corporation of the City of Quebec[11]; Cooey v. Corporation of the County of Brome[12]; Spedon v. Parish of St. Malachie[13]; and Regina v. The Justices of King's County[14].\nThe power of the Parliament of Canada over this subject matter is much more extensive than that of Congress in the United States. Parliament has power to deal with foreign as well as domestic trade, while Congress only deals with the former. Story on Constitution of United States[15]. It is also contended that this is not a regulation of trade and commerce, but a prohibition. To this it is answered that, whether the Act be a prohibition or a regulation of the sale, it is equally within the powers of Parliament which alone can deal with respect to the Criminal law and to trade and commerce. Story on the Constitution of the United States[16]; Gibbons v. Ogden[17].\nChief Justice Allen in the Court below says: \"had this Act prohibited the sale of liquor, instead of merely restricting and regulating it, I should have had no doubt about the power of Parliament to pass such an Act.\"\nThe next inquiry is, whether an Act can be unconstitutional from the motives with which it is passed. I contend the motive cannot be inquired into. Story, ibid.[18].\nMr. Kaye, Q. C., for respondent:\nIn the distribution of Legislative powers, the British North America Act, 1867, part 6, section 92, assigns exclusively to the Provincial Legislatures the power of legislation in relation to all matters coming within inter alia\u2014\nClass 8\u2014Municipal Institutions in the Provinces.\nClass 9\u2014Shop, Saloon, Tavern, and other Licenses, in order to the raising of a Revenue for' Provincial, Local, or Municipal purposes.\nClass 13\u2014Property and Civil Rights in the Provinces.\nClass 16\u2014Grenerally all matters of a merely local or private nature in the Province.\nThe power thus assigned excludes any like power in the Parliament of Canada.\nThe exception in sub-section 29 of sec. 91 qualifies anything done of a private or local nature under the enumerated powers of sec 91 and not any thing done under sec. 92. The object was, that if the Dominion Parliament, in legislating on some of the subjects enumerated in sec. 92, necessarily comprised something of a private or local nature, such legislation would still be valid. Matters of a public nature are not qualified. If a power of a public nature is given by sec. 92 to the Local Legislatures, there is no power given to the Dominion Parliament to destroy that power. Thus the power given of raising a revenue, either by direct taxation, or by shop and saloon licenses, is a matter of a public nature, and I coutend that there is no power vested in the Dominion Parliament by which it might destroy the sources of Provincial revenue. The introduction of these words local or private must have some meaning. Now, the only meaning you can give to the words local or private is, that if there are public matters assigned exclusively to the Local Legislatures by the 92 sec., then the Dominion Parliament cannot affect them. If the raising of money is not a public matter, my argument goes for nothing, but if it is, upon the plain language of the Act, there is no power in the Dominion Parliament to destroy it. The Provinces consented to a union on the condition of being able to raise a revenue out of licenses.\n[THE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014Your reasoning would lead you to the belief that the Provincial Legislatures have power to prohibit the sale of liquors.]\nI cannot see that it leads to that.\n[THE CHIEF JUSTICE: \u2014Then according to your argument you must hold that there is no power in Canada to deal with these matters, and that our Parliament had not, as Mr. Lash contended it had, a Constitution as perfect with reference to matters placed under its control as that of Great Britain.]\nI do not think it possible to say this Dominion has such a Constitution as that of Great Britain. Their power is unlimited, because it is uncontrollable. Is it the same here? is not the power here controlled by the British Parliament? Whatever power exists, must be found in the British North America Act. If it had been the intention to give unlimited power to the Dominion, why not have had Legislative Union. What power exists to do away with the French language. So it is, I contend, with this subject-matter; it is not one which comes within the control of the Dominion Parliament.\nIt is contended that The Canada Temperance Act legislates on a matter which comes within class 2 of sec 91: \"The Regulation of Trade and Commerce.\"\nNow, the same remark applies here, that the exercise of the power under class 2 cannot affect any matters in section 92 which are of a local or private nature; and that as class 9 of section 92 is of a local or private nature, it is not within the competency of the Dominion Parliament to legislate upon it.\nFurther, I submit that the term \"Regulation\" applies only to what concerns Trade as such\u2014something having for its object to advance or benefit trade, and not to regulate the morals of traders. Thus it would not be competent to the Dominion Parliament to declare that no person should trade who was addicted to the habit of smoking, or that no one should be allowed to trade unless he attended some Christian place of worship.\nIt may be difficult to give the exact definition of \"Regulation,\" but it is submitted that a law against drunkenness is in no sense a law for the regulation of trade,\nIt is to-day urged that this law was for the purpose of increasing sobriety, but to-morrow a law might be passed to make the people religious,, or to make them follow a certain religion. The simple question is, can this law be said to be a regulation of trade, or is it merely a law for another purpose but affecting matters of trade?\nSee Colder Navigation Co. v. Pilling[19], where a distinction is made between the laws which a Canal Corporation were empowered to make for the good and orderly using the navigation, and rules which the Corporation made to regulate the moral and religious conduct of bargemen employed on the canal.\nThen, it is said, that The Canada Temperance Act legislates on a matter which comes within the class of subjects No. 27, \"The Criminal Law.\"\nThis power is limited, so far as concerns the class of matters in section 92, in its exercise to such of the matters enumerated in that section as are of a local or private nature. Thus, it would not be competent to the Dominion Parliament to declare that it shall be a crime to amend the constitution of the Province (sub-section 1), or to impose direct taxation within the Province, in order to raising of a revenue for Provincial purposes; neither can it make it a crime to do any of the matters in sub-sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9; none of which are matters of a local or private nature. So it would not be competent to the Dominion Parliament to declare it criminal to solemnize marriage in the Province.\nLocal Legislatures have the power to deal with police regulations, and to impose fines for a breach of the laws. Municipalities have power to prevent the sale of liquor on Sunday, and I do not think it would be for a moment contended that the Local Legislature had not power to authorize these restrictions. If it is held that this was a regulation of trade, and that the Dominion Parliament had power to override the Provincial laws and to legalize the sale of liquor on Sunday, it will considerably astonish the people who had advocated Confederation. Under the pretext of regulating trade they might prohibit the sale of tobacco. The simple statement of an object in passing a certain law cannot justify the Dominion Parliament in interfering with matters under control of the Local Legislatures. If this is not a regulation of trade it is a police matter, not a criminal law. It is not to prevent crime, for selling liquor is no crime; but to prevent the consequences of selling liquor.\nBesides which, the British North America Act assumes the existence, after Confederation, of \"Taverns,\" from which licenses can be issued, in order to the raising of a revenue for Provincial, local, or municipal purposes, and it could not be the intention of the act to include under the term \"Criminal Law,\" those matters which are by the British North America Act held to be legal, and which are relied upon as a source of revenue for the Provinces. It is, therefore, submitted that The Canada Temperance Act is not an act of legislation on Criminal Law within the meaning of the British North America Act, class 27, sec. 91.\nNow, if we take up the B. N. A. Act and read the 91st section, we find there that certain powers are given to the Dominion Parliament. It is the voice of the Provinces, speaking through the Imperial Parliament, giving to the Senate and the House of Commons power to make laws for them. In this case Parliament has not exercised these powers, but allows the present law to come into force, when sanctioned by a portion of the people. This is a violation of the fundamental principle upon which this power was given to them, it virtually delegates: to a portion of the people the power of controlling the legislation of the Province. The great struggle in consummating Confederation was to protect the minorities. The strongest guarantee of integrity in the Dominion Parliament is the responsibility of members to their constituents, but such a law as this is nothing less than an attempt to shift that responsibility to a section of the people. By referring to the Debates on Confederation, p. 547, it will be seen that the intention of the framers of the Quebec resolutions was to preserve the family life of the Provinces, and that it was for the purpose of having a uniform law throughout the Dominion, that the legislative control over the criminal law was given to the Parliament of Canada. This law, however, makes it a crime to sell spirituous liquors only in certain sections of the Dominion. The question here is whether they could delegate their power and ask the people to say whether a crime would be created. Local option laws involving the delegation of power might occur in the States, or in England, where there are legislative bodies with plenary powers, but not in Canada. Where the carrying out of a law is left to the people, it is not delegation, but is execution. To carry out a law already passed, is different from legislating one for one section of the Dominion.\nThe question here seems to me to be what Parliament did, had they power to do? We do not come to ask where the power exists.\nThere is another point to which I will refer before concluding:\u2014 The British North America Act, section 121, provides that all articles of the growth, produce, or manufacture of any one of the Provinces shall, from and after the union, be admitted free into each of the other Provinces. The power to import free, implies a power to sell.\nThe Canada Temperance Act takes this power from the importer of beer, ale, cider, and other liquors, as well where these liquors are the manufacture of another Province, as in other cases; it therefore violates the provisions of section 121.\nSection 121 was intended to secure free trade between the Provinces in all articles of growth, produce, or manufacture of any one of the Provinces. The Canada Temperance Act gives a local manufacturer of certain articles, e.g. beer, etc., a power to sell, while it takes such power from the manufacturer in another Province. This is opposed to the spirit and meaning of the 121 section, and I submit that on this ground the act is ultra vires.\nMr. Christopher Robinson, Q.C., followed on the part of the Respondent:\u2014\nMy learned friend who is with me has exhausted the points, and put them so forcibly that there can be no advantage in repeating them. I will however make a few observations as to the rules to be observed in construing this act. I think in construing our Constitution we may look at the debates, especially when the words of the act are to be found in the resolutions passed previously. Now, if we find that the construction given to these resolutions is that construction which we represent ought to be put on these important sections of the B. N. A. Act, it cannot be said not to be a valuable authority, just as the Federalist is looked upon as of the greatest authority in construing the United States constitution. In Smiles v. Belford[20] the Court read the debates. Now, we find that previous to Confederation the Provinces had plenary powers of legislation and the B. N. A. Act was to give certain powers belonging to them to the Federal Parliament. We know that it was desirable, as stated by Sir John A. Macdonald, to have federal laws uniform, and that the Provinces reserved to themselves all laws not uniform and general.\nThe language used by Lord Selborne in the case of L. Union S. Jacques v. Belisle[21] is very applicable. \"Their Lordships observe that the scheme of enumeration in that section is to mention various categories of general subjects which may be dealt with by legislation. * * * Well, no such general law covering this particular association is alleged ever to have been passed.\" Now, I cannot help thinking that looking at the powers given to the Dominion Parliament by this act, we are wrong in saying our constitution, is similar in principle to that of Great Britain. The British Parliament is supreme, whilst here any party can refuse to obey an act until he has tested in the courts the constitutionality of that act.\nIt is said we have no right to question the motive or intention of the Legislature. Now, in order to keep a Legislature within its limits, it is necessary often to ascertain what the motive was.\nTake for example the License cases[22]. If they impose licenses for other than legal purposes, then the act is void. The same principle was laid down in Gibbons v. Ogden[23]. Here we contend that the act was not a regulation of trade and commerce, and it is therefore necessary to look to the motives. Altho' it must be admitted that the act does touch regulations of trade and commerce, yet it cannot be denied, as appears by the preamble of the act, that they had some other object in passing the act, and if that object is beyond their jurisdiction, the law must be declared unconstitutional. This act is sustained upon the ground (inter alia) that it is a criminal law. Of course so soon as an action is made a crime by law, the law referring to it must be held to belong to the criminal code. But if the Dominion Parliament can make anything a crime, they can practically get possession of all the civil rights exclusively assigned to the Local Legislatures.\nIt is also contended that it comes within the class of subjects enumerated in the 91st section, under \"trade and commerce.\" No doubt the subject-matter of trade and commerce is within the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament, but only in so far as not affected by the police regulations made by the Provincial Parliament. Local Legislatures have certain powers over \"trade and commerce,\" viz.: prohibition of trading on Sunday and of selling liquor within prescribed hours, and to that extent \"trade and commerce\" is within the supervision of the Local Legislatures.\nThe learned counsel then referred also to the following authorities:\u2013Abbott's Law Die Vo. \"Regulation\"; Cooley on Constitutional Limitations[24]; Hardcastle on Construction of Statutes[25]; Sedgwick, Stat, and Cons. Law[26].\nMr. Lash, Q. C., in reply:\u2014\nSec. 92 B. N. A. Act is qualified by sec. 91. The following words are very important:\" And for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms of this section, it is hereby declared that, notwithstanding anything in this Act, \"the Parliament has under that section absolute and complete power over the subject-matters defined in the section notwithstanding anything in sec. 92. Under section 129 the power is given to change the existing law, and it is for the Court to say where the power exists. I claim that the power to change the law in force at the time of Confederation, so as to prohibit the sale of liquor or other things, does not belong to the Local Legislatures, and, therefore, it must be within the powers of the Dominion Parliament.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014\nThis is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, quashing a return to a mandamus nisi and ordering a peremptory mandamus to be issued in this cause.\nThe Supreme Court of New Brunswick, by writ of mandamus nisi, commanded the appellants to grant a license to Thomas Barker, to sell spirituous liquors by retail within the city of Fredericton, in the hotel occupied by him in that city. The appellants returned to this writ that they refused and still did refuse to grant such license,\" for the following reasons to the contrary, viz.:\u2014The Canada Temperance Act of 1878 was declared in force in the said city of Fredericton, on the 1st day of May last, and therefore the City Council could not grant a license to the said Thomas Barker to sell spirituous liquors by retail, contrary to the provisions of that Act.\"\nThe Supreme Court, upon reading the mandamus nisi, the said return, and upon hearing counsel of the respective parties, made an order that the said return be quashed and that a peremptory mandamus be issued.\nThe present appeal is from the order so made.\nThe Respondent contends that the return is insufficient and that the order for the issue of a peremptory writ of mandamus should be affirmed, on the ground that The Canada Temperance Act of 1878 is ultra vires the Parliament of Canada; and this is the only point submitted for our consideration.\nThe Act in question is entitled \"An Act respecting the traffic in intoxicating liquors,\" and the preamble sets forth that\nWhereas it is very desirable to promote temperance in the Dominion, and that there should be uniform legislation in all the Provinces respecting the traffic in intoxicating liquors:\nTherefore Her Majesty, &c., enacts, &c.\nAfter several preliminary sections, the first of which declares that \"this Act may be cited as \"The Canada Temperance Act, 1878,\" and the second defines the meaning of the expression \"intoxicating liquors,\" and others, not pertinent to the question now to be discussed, the Act is divided into three parts. The first provides for \"Proceedings for bringing the second part into force;\" and the second provides for the \"Prohibition of traffic in intoxicating liquors;\" and the third for \"Penalties and Prosecutions for offences against the second part.\"\nThe preliminary proceedings necessary to be taken, before the Act can come into operation, are to be commenced by a petition to the Governor in Council, praying that the second part of the Act shall be in force and take effect in the county or city named, and that the votes of the electors be taken for and against the adoption of the petition, and such petition is to be embodied in a notice to the Secretary of State, signed by electors qualified and competent to vote at the election of a member of the House of Commons, in the county or city, to the effect that the signers desire that the votes of all such electors be taken for and against the adoption of the petition; and that together with, or in addition to, every such notice, there shall be laid before the Secretary of State evidence that there are appended to it the genuine signatures of at least one-fourth in number of all the electors in the county or city named in it, and that such notice has been deposited in the office of the Sheriff, or Registrar of Deeds, of or in the county or city, for public examination by any parties, for ten days preceding its being laid before the Secretary of State and that two weeks previous notice of such deposit had been given in two newspapers published in or nearest to the county or city, and by at least two insertions in each paper; and in case it appears to the satisfaction of the Governor General in Council, that such notice has appended to it the genuine signatures of one-fourth, &c., and has been duly deposited, &c., His Excellency may issue a proclamation under this part of this Act.\nThe Act then prescribes what is to be set forth in the proclamation, and makes provisions special and general for the holding of a poll for taking the votes of the electors for and against the petition, with numerous other provisions in connection therewith for securing a fair and honest vote, and for the prevention of corrupt practices, &c., &c.\nThe 96th section provides that\nWhen any petition embodied as aforesaid in any notice and in any proclamation under this the first part of this Act has been adopted by the electors of the county or city named therein and to which the same relates, the Governor General in Council may, at any time after the expiration of sixty days from the day on which the same was adopted, by Order in Council published in the Canada Gazette, declare that the second part of this Act shall be in force and take effect in such county or city upon, from and after the day on which the annual or semi-annual licenses for the sale of spirituous liquors then in force in such county or city will expire; provided such day be not less than ninety days from the day of the date of such Order in Council; and if it be less, then on the like day in the then following year; and upon, from and after that day the second part of this Act shall become and be in force and take effect in such county or city accordingly.\nProvision is then made that such Order in Council shall not be revoked for three years, and then only on similar petition, notice and similar proceedings.\nIt is contended, that assuming the Parliament of Canada has the power to pass an Act for the prohibition of traffic in intoxicating liquors provided for by the second part of the Act, that the first part of the Act is a delegation of legislative powers to a portion of the people; that the Dominion Parliament have no right to delegate such powers, or to make its regulation subject to, or conditional on, its acts being adopted by any other body.\nIt cannot be doubted, and indeed it was admitted by Mr. Kaye in his very able argument on behalf of the respondent, that the Parliament of Great Britain has the general power of making such regulations and conditions as it deems expedient with regard to the taking effect or operation of laws, either absolute, or conditional and contingent; and in his factum he says:\u2014\nIt may also be conceded that a body like that of the Provincial Parliament before Confederation could and did pass acts of a like kind, which it was not competent to a judicial tribunal to question.\nAlthough the Dominion Parliament does derive its powers from the British North America Act, it cannot, I think, be successfully disputed that with respect to those matters over which legislative authority is conferred, plenary powers of legislation are given \"as large and of the same nature as those of the Imperial Parliament itself,\" and therefore they may be exercised either absolutely or conditionally, and, as was established by the Privy Council in the case of The Queen v. Burah[27], cited in Valin v. Langlois[28], leaving to the discretion of some external authority the time and manner of carrying its legislation into effect, as also the area over which it is to extend. The Parliament of Great Britain having, as I think, conferred on the Dominion Parliament this general, absolute, uncontrolled authority to legislate in their discretion, on all matters over which they have power to deal, subject only to such restrictions, if any, as are contained in the B. N. A. Act, and subject, of course, to the sovereign authority of the British Parliament itself, with reference to the question under consideration, I can find in the B. N. A. Act no limitation, either in terms or by necessary implication, of the general power so conferred, and without which the legislative power should not, in my opinion, be limited by judicial interpretation. In the United States, where frequent discussions have arisen under the written constitutions, Federal and State, by which the legislative powers are limited and restricted, Mr. Cooley, in his work on statutory limitations thus states the doctrine as there understood[29]:\nBut it is not always essential that a legislative act should be a completed statute, which must in any event take effect as law at the time it leaves the hands of the legislative department. A statute may be conditional, and its taking effect may be made to depend upon some subsequent event.\nIt has likewise been urged that this Act affects only particular districts, that it is not general legislation, and therefore is ultra vires. I am entirely unable to appreciate this objection. If the subject matter dealt with comes within the classes of subjects assigned to the Parliament of Canada, I can find in the Act no restriction which prevents the Dominion Parliament from passing a law affecting one part of the Dominion and not another, if Parliament, in its wisdom, thinks the legislation applicable to and desirable in one part and not in the other. But this is a general law applicable to the whole Dominion, though it may not be brought into active operation throughout the whole Dominion.\nThis brings us to the consideration of the really substantial question in this case, which arises under the second part of the Act, viz.: Has the Dominion Parliament the power of prohibiting the traffic in intoxicating liquors in the Dominion or in any part of it?\nSec. 99 enacts that\u2014\nFrom the day on which this part of this Act comes into force and takes effect in any county or city, and for so long thereafter as the same continues in force therein, no person, unless it be for exclusively sacramental or medicinal purposes, or for bon\u00e2 fide use in some art, trade or manufacture under the regulation contained in the fourth sub-section of this section, or as hereinafter authorized by one of the four next sub-sections of this section, shall, within such county or city, by himself, his cleric, servant or agent, expose or keep for sale, or directly, or indirectly, on any pretence or upon any device sell or barter, or in consideration of the purchase of any other property give, to any other person, any spirituous or other intoxicating liquor, or any mixed liquor capable of being used as a beverage, and part of which is spirituous or otherwise intoxicating.\nThe second sub-section provides that\u2014\nNeither licenses to distillers or brewers,\u2014nor for retailing on board any steamboat or vessel,\u2014nor yet any other description of license whatever,\u2014shall in any wise avail to render legal any act done in violation of this section.\nSub-section 3 provides for the sale of wine for exclusively sacramental purposes, and sub-section 4 for the sale of intoxicating liquor for exclusively medicinal, or for bon\u00e2 fide use in some trade or manufacture.\nSub-section 5 contains a proviso\u2014\nThat any producer of cider in the county, or any licensed distiller or brewer, having his distillery or brewery within such county or city, may thereat expose and keep for sale such liquor as he shall have manufactured thereat, and no other; and may sell the same thereat, but only in quantities not less than ten gallons, or in the case of ale or beer not less than eight gallons at any one time, and only to druggists and others licensed as aforesaid (that is to sell for sacramental, medicinal and trade purposes,) or to such persons as he has good reason to believe will forthwith carry the same beyond the limits of the county or city, and of any adjoining county or city in which the second part of this Act is then in force, and to be wholly removed and taken away in quantities not less than ten gallons, or in the case of ale or beer not less than eight gallons at a time. Sub-section 6 contains a proviso of a similar character in favor of\u2014\nAny incorporated company authorized by law to, carry on the business of cultivating and growing vines and of making and selling wine and other liquors produced from grapes, having their manufactory within such county or city.\nWith a further proviso by sub-section 7\u2014\nThat manufacturers of pure native wines made from grapes grown and produced by them in the Dominion of Canada, may, when authorized to do so by license from the municipal council or other authority having jurisdiction where such manufacture is carried on, sell such wines at the place of manufacture in quantities of not less than ten gallons at one time, except when sold for sacramental or medicinal purposes, when any number of gallons from one to ten may be sold.\nAnd by sub-section 8 it is provided also\u2014\nThat any merchant or trader exclusively in wholesale trade, and duly licensed to sell liquor by wholesale, having his store or place for sale of goods within such county or city, may thereat keep for sale and sell intoxicating liquor, but only in quantities not less than ten gallons at any one time, and only to druggists and others licensed as aforesaid, or to such persons as he has good reason to believe will forthwith carry the same beyond the limits of the county or city, and of any adjoining county or city in which the second part of this Act is then in force, to be wholly removed and taken away in quantities not less than ten gallons at a time.\nIt is contended that this is strictly a temperance act, passed solely for the promotion of temperance, and not an act dealing with any of the matters within the power of the Dominion Parliament\u2014that the power to deal with the sale of spirituous liquors and the granting of licenses therefor, and laws for the prevention of drunkenness, and of the like character of preventive means, are within the exclusive power of the Local Legislatures, and the recital of the Act is relied on as indicating conclusively its character.\nIf the Dominion Parliament legislates strictly within the powers conferred in relation to matters over which the British North America Act gives it exclusive legislative control, we have no right to enquire what motive induced Parliament to exercise its powers. The statute declares it shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, in relation to all matters not coming within the class of subjects by this act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the Provinces, and, notwithstanding anything in the act, the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the classes of subjects enumerated, of which the regulation of trade and commerce is one; and any matters coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated shall not be deemed to come within the classes of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by the act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the Provinces. If then, Parliament, in its wisdom, deems it expedient for the peace, order and good government of Canada so to regulate trade and commerce as to restrict or prohibit the importation into, or exportation out out of the Dominion, or the trade and traffic in, or dealing with, any articles in respect to which external or internal trade or commerce is carried on, it matters not, so far as we are judicially concerned, nor had we, in my opinion, the right to enquire whether such legislation is prompted by a desire to establish uniformity of legislation with respect to the traffic dealt with, or whether it be to increase or diminish the volume of such traffic, or to encourage native industry, or local manufactures, or with a view to the diminution of crime or the promotion of temperance, or any other object which may, by regulating trade and commerce, or by any other enactments within the scope of the legislative powers confided to Parliament, tend to the peace, order and good government of Canada. The effect of a regulation of trade may be to aid the temperance cause, or it may tend to the prevention of crime, but surely this cannot make the legislation ultra vires, if the enactment is, in truth and fact, a regulation of trade and commerce, foreign or domestic.\nThe power to make the law is all we can judge of; and the recital in the act so much relied on ought not, in my opinion, to affect in any way the enacting clauses of the act, which are in themselves abundantly plain and explicit, requiring no elucidation from and admitting of no control by the recital, which can only be invoked in explanation of the enacting clauses if they be doubtful. Why it was deemed necessary to insert the self-evident abstract proposition that \"it is very desirable to promote temperance in the Dominion,\" and to enact that this Act may be cited as \"The Canada Temperance Act, 1878,\" does not seem very apparent, when the title of the Act itself was \"An Act respecting the traffic in intoxicating liquors,\" and it contained a recital, that it was desirable there should be uniform legislation in all the Provinces respecting such traffic, which shows the legislation on its face immediately within the power of Parliament. It may be, that all who voted for this Act may have thought it would promote temperance, and were influenced in their vote by that consideration alone, and desired that idea should prominently appear. Still, if the enacting clauses of the Act itself deal with the traffic in such a manner as to bring the legislation within the powers of the Dominion Parliament, no such declaration in the preamble or permissive title can so control the enacting clauses as to make the Act ultra vires; though it cannot be doubted that the introduction of this temperance element on the face of the Act may have very much stimulated the idea, which has been so much relied on, that the legislation was not a regulation of trade and commerce, but was for the suppression of intemperance, a matter assumed to be within the exclusive power of the Local Legislatures, and so beyond the powers of the Dominion Parliament. If we eliminate from the recital in the Act the abstract proposition and the permissive clause to cite the Act as \"The Canada Temperance Act, 1878,\" there does not appear to be a word in the title, preamble or enacting clauses from which the slightest inference could be drawn that Parliament was dealing with a subject-matter, other than simply as a regulation of trade and commerce in respect to the traffic in those particular articles of intoxicating liquors.\nIt has also been contended that no legislative powers to prohibit exist in the Dominion. I must respectfully, but most emphatically, dissent from this proposition. I cannot for one moment doubt, that by the B. N. A. Act plenary power of legislation was vested in the Dominion Parliament and Local Legislatures respectively to deal with all matters relating to the purely internal affairs of the Dominion, unless, indeed, anything could be found in the Act in express terms limiting such power, each, of course, acting within the scope of their respective powers; and, therefore, where one has not the power so to legislate, it necessarily belongs to the other. If this be so, then the question is: is this legislation within the powers conferred on the Dominion Parliament, or does it encroach on the powers exclusively confided to the Local Legislature? For, with its expediency, its justice or injustice, its policy or impolicy, we have nothing whatever to do.\nMuch has been said as to the analogy of the Dominion Parliament and Local Legislatures with the Congress of the Federal Government and the State Legislatures of the United States. But the constitution of the United States and the constitution of the States as regards the powers which each may exercise, are so different from the relative powers of the Dominion Parliament and Provincial Legislatures, that the cases to be found in the American books, with regard to the powers of the State Legislatures in prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors, afford no guide whatever in the determination of the powers of the Local Legislatures and the Dominion of Canada. The Government of the United States is one of enumerated powers, and the Governments of the States possess all the general powers of legislation. Here we have the exact opposite. The powers of the Provincial Governments are enumerated and the Dominion Government possesses the general powers of legislation. Therefore we are told by Mr. Cooley that\nWhen a law of Congress is assailed as void, we look in the National Constitution to see if the grant of specified powers is broad enough to embrace it, but when a State law is attacked on the same ground, it is presumably valid in any case, and this presumption is a conclusive one, unless in the Constitution of the United States, or of the State, we are able to discover that it is prohibited. We look in the Constitution of the United States for grants of legislative power, but in the Constitution of the State to ascertain if any limitations have been imposed upon the complete power with which the legislative department of the State was vested in its creation. Congress can pass no laws but such as the Constitution authorizes, either expressly or by clear implication, while the State Legislature has jurisdiction of all subjects in which its legislation is not prohibited[30].\nWith us the Government of the Provinces is one of enumerated powers, which are specified in the B. N. A. Act, and in this respect differs from the Constitution of the Dominion Parliament, which, as has been stated, is authorized \"to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by the Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces\";\u2014and that \"any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\" Therefore \"the regulation of trade and commerce,\" being one of the classes of subjects enumerated in sec. 91, is not to be deemed to come within any of the classes of a local or private nature assigned to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nTo my mind, it seems very clear that the general jurisdiction or sovereignty which is thus conferred emphatically negatives the idea that there is not within the Dominion legislative power or authority to deal with the question of prohibition in respect to the sale or traffic in intoxicating liquors, or any other articles of trade or commerce.\nIt is said that a power to regulate does not include a power to prohibit. Apart from the general legislative power which, I think, belongs to the Dominion Parliament, I do not entertain the slightest doubt that the power to prohibit is within the power to regulate. It would be strange, indeed, that, having the sole legislative power over trade and commerce, the Dominion Parliament could not prohibit the importation or exportation of any article of trade or commerce, or, having that power, could not prohibit the sale and traffic, if they deemed such prohibition conducive to the peace, order and good government of Canada.\nThere seems to be no doubt on this point in the United States. Mr. Story on the Constitution of the United States, with reference to the regulation of foreign commerce, which belongs to the National Government (as the regulation of both foreign and internal trade and commerce does to the Dominion Government) says:\nThe commercial system of the United States has also been employed for the purpose of revenue; sometimes for the purpose of prohibition; sometimes for the purpose of retaliation and commercial reciprocity; sometimes to lay embargoes; sometimes to encourage domestic navigation, and the shipping and mercantile interests by bounties, by discriminating duties, and by special preferences and privileges; and sometimes to regulate intercourse with a view to mere political objects, such as to repel agressions, increase the pressure of war, or vindicate the rights of neutral sovereignty[31].\nSo in the case of the United States v. Halliday[32], in reference to the rights of Congress under its power to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes, the Supreme Court of the United States held that that power extended to the regulation of commerce with the Indian tribes and with the individual members of such tribes, though the traffic and the Indian with whom it was carried on were wholly within the territorial limit of the State. The Act made it penal to sell spirituous liquors to an Indian under charge of an Indian agent, although it was sold outside of an Indian reserve and within the limits of a State. The Court held the Act constitutional and based upon the power of Congress to regulate commerce with the Indians.\nThe contention in this case, as put by the learned Judge who delivered the judgment of the Court, was, \"that so far as the Act was intended to operate as a police regulation to enforce good morals within the limits of a State of the Union, that belongs exclusively to the State, and there is no warrant in the Constitution for its exercise by Congress. If it is an attempt to regulate commerce, then the commerce here regulated is a commerce wholly within the State\u2014among its own inhabitants or citizens, and not within the powers conferred on Congress by the commercial clause.\" But the Court thus deals with this contention\u2014Mr. Justice Miller says:\nThe Act in question, although it may partake of some of the qualities of those Acts passed by State Legislatures, which have been referred to the police powers of the State, is, we think still more clearly entitled to be called a regulation of Commerce. \"Commerce,\" says Chief Justice Marshall, in the opinion in Gibbons vs. Ogden to which we so often turn with profit when this clause of the Constitution is under consideration, \"Commerce undoubtedly is traffic, but it is something more, it is intercourse\" The law before us professes to regulate traffic and intercourse with the Indian Tribes. It manifestly does both. It relates to buying and selling and exchanging commodities, which is the essence of all commerce, and it regulates the intercourse between the citizens of the United States and those Tribes, which is another branch of commerce and a very important one.\nIf the Act under consideration is a regulation of commerce, as it undoubtedly is, does it regulate that kind of commerce which is placed within the control of Congress by the Constitution? The words of that instrument are: \"Congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\" Commerce with foreign nations, without doubt, means commerce between citizens of the Unitea States and citizens or subjects of foreign governments, as individuals. And so commerce with the Indian Tribes, means commerce with the individuals composing those Tribes. The Act before us describes this precise kind of traffic or commerce, and therefore comes within the terms of the constitutional provision.\nIs there anything in the fact that this power is to be exercised within the limits of a State, which renders the Act regulating it unconstitutional.?\nIn the same opinion to which we have just before referred, Judge Marshall, in speaking of the power to regulate commerce with foreign States, says: \"The power does not stop at the jurisdictional limits of the several States. It would be a very useless power if it could not pass those lines. If Congress has power to regulate it, that power must be exercised wherever the subject exists.\" It follows from those propositions, which seem to be incontrovertible, that if commerce or traffic, or intercourse, is carried on with an Indian tribe, or with a member of such tribe, it is subject to be regulated by Congress, although within the limits of a State. The locality of the traffic can have nothing to do with the power. The right to exercise it in reference to any Indian Tribe, or any person who is a member of such Tribe, is absolute, without reference to the locality of the traffic, or locality of the Tribe, or of the member of the Tribe with whom it is carried on. It is not, however, intended by these remarks to imply that this clause of the Constitution authorizes Congress to regulate any other commerce, originated and ended within the limits of a single State, than commerce with the Indian Tribes. It has been likewise very strongly urged that the Dominion Parliament cannot have the right to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors as a beverage, because to do so would interfere with the right of the Local Legislatures to grant licenses and to deal with property and civil rights and matters of a purely local character, and so with the right of the Local Legislatures to raise a revenue by means of shop and tavern licenses. I fail to appreciate the force of this objection. If substantial, it would prohibit to a great extent the Dominion Parliament from legislating in respect to that large branch of trade and commerce carried on in intoxicating beverages, and so take away the full right to regulate alike foreign and internal commerce. If they cannot prohibit the internal traffic because it prevents the Local Legislatures from raising a revenue by licensing shops and taverns, the same result would be produced if the Dominion Parliament prohibited its importation or manufacture. For by the same process of reason it must follow that they could not prohibit its importation or manufacture, or in any way regulate the traffic, whereby the sale or traffic should be injuriously affected and so the value of licenses be depreciated or destroyed. In my opinion, if the Dominion Parliament, in the exercise of and within its legitimate and undoubted right to regulate trade and commerce, adopt such regulations as in their practical operation conflict or interfere with the beneficial operation of local legislation, then the law of the Local Legislature must yield to the Dominion law, because matters coming within the subjects enumerated as confided to Parliament are not to be deemed to come within the matters of a local nature comprised in the enumeration of subjects assigned to the Local Legislatures; in other words, the right to regulate trade and commerce is not to be overridden by any local legislation in reference to any subject over which power is given to the Local Legislature.\nA case, precisely analogous in principle to this, is to be found in the Reports of the United States' Supreme Court[33], where the State Legislature had the control of the internal commerce, and the Federal government the right to raise a revenue by licenses, while here the Dominion Government have the control of the internal trade and commerce, and the Local Legislatures the right of raising a revenue by granting licenses. It was not doubted that where Congress possessed constitutional power to regulate trade and commerce, it might regulate it by means of licenses, and in case of such a regulation a license would give authority to the licensee to do whatever its terms authorized, but that very different considerations applied to the internal commerce or domestic trade of the States, over which Congress had no power to regulate, nor any direct control, but the power belonged exclusively to the States. There the power to authorize a business within the State was held plainly repugnant to the exclusive power of the State over the same subject. So here, over trade and commerce the Local Legislature have no power of regulation nor any direct control, and therefore the power of the Local Legislature to authorize a business is equally repugnant to the power of the Dominion Parliament over the same subject; and therefore, while Congress had the power to tax, it was held to reach only existing subjects and could not authorize a trade or business within a State, in order to tax it; that if the licenses were to be regarded as giving authority to carry on the branches of business which they license, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile the granting of them with the constitution. But it was held that it was not necessary to regard the laws as giving such authority, that, so far as they related to trade within State limits, they gave none and could give none.\nIf this same principle is applied here, the right of the Local Legislatures to tax by means of licenses gave the licensees no authority to exercise trade or carry on business prohibited by the Dominion Parliament having this control of trade and commerce. I think it equally clear, that the Local Legislatures have not the power to prohibit, the Dominion Parliament having, not only the general powers of legislation, but also the sole power of regulating as well internal as external trade and commerce, and of imposing duties of customs and excise; and having by law authorized the importation and manufacture of alcoholic liquors, and exacted such duties thereon, and so far legalized the trade and traffic therein, to allow the Local Legislatures, under pretence of police regulation, on general grounds of public policy and utility, by prohibitory laws to annihilate such trade and traffic, and practically deprive the. Dominion Parliament of a branch of trade and commerce from which so large a part of the public revenue was at the time of confederation raised in all the Provinces, and has since been in the Dominion, never could have been contemplated by the framers of the B. N. A. Act, but is, in my opinion, in direct conflict with the powers of Parliament, as well over trade and commerce, as with their right to raise a revenue by duties of import and excise.\nWhen I had the honor to be Chief Justice of New Brunswick, the question of the right of the Local Legislatures to pass laws prohibiting the sale or traffic in intoxicating liquors came squarely before the Supreme Court of that Province and that Court, in the case of Regina v. The Justices of King's County[34], unanimously held that under the B. N. A. Act the Local Legislature had no power or authority to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors, and declared the Act passed with that intent ultra vires, and therefore unconstitutional. I have carefully reconsidered the judgment then pronounced, and I have not had the least doubt raised in my mind as to the soundness of the conclusion at which the Court arrived on that occasion. I then thought the Local Legislature had not the power to prohibit. I think the same now. I then thought the power belonged to the Dominion Parliament, I think so still, and therefore am constrained to allow this appeal.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nAfter having carefully considered the important questions which arise on this appeal, and having had the opportunity of taking communication of the able and elaborate judgment of the Chief Justice, I need only say that I entirely concur in the view taken by him as to the constitutionality of The Canada Temperance Act, 1878, and that the appeal should be allowed.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThis case\u2014argued before us a few weeks ago\u2014being, in my judgment, one of the most important that has arisen, or is likely to arise and be presented for our decision, called for the most serious and deliberate consideration.\nThe issue raised is as to the constitutionality of an Act passed by the Parliament of Canada, in 1878, entitled, \"An Act respecting the Traffic in Intoxicating Liquors,\" and which provides that it may be cited as, \"The Canada Temperance Act, 1878.\" Prefixed to the Act is a preamble as follows:\nWhereas it is very desirable to promote temperance in the Dominion, and that there should be uniform legislation in all the Provinces respecting the traffic in intoxicating liquors.\nThe second section provides for the repeal of several sections of the Act of Canada, known as \"The Temperance Act, 1864.\" The Act also indirectly repeals all the Acts in force, in all the Provinces, for the issue of licenses, for the sale of intoxicating liquors, and thereby necessarily affects and controls the Provincial legislative functions provided for by sub-section 9 of section 92 of the \"British North America Act, 1867.\"\nIt provides, that on a petition of one-fourth of the electors of any county or city, to the Governor General in Council, a poll shall be taken; and a majority of the electors are authorized to decide, whether or not the Act shall go into operation within the county or city, as the case might be. If the answer should be in the affirmative, the prohibition contained in section 99, and the following sections, called the \"Second Part\" of the Act, become operative.\nIt has, I think, been legitimately contended, that in reference to all but one or two subjects, not in any way connected with the matter under consideration, the legislative powers of the Parliament of Canada and Local Legislatures are not concurrent, but fully distributed, and in part enumerated.\nIt is contended that Parliament had the necessary power to pass the Act\u20141st, under the general provision of section 91; 2nd, under the 2nd sub-section, \"The regulation of Trade and Commerce\"; and 3rd, under sub-section 27, \"The Criminal Law,\" except the constitution of \"Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction,\" but including the \"Procedure in Criminal cases,\" and, in connection with, and supplementing them, the concluding clause of section 91 which provides that:\nAny matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces. That position is contested on the other side.\nThe right to provide for the issuing of licenses for the sale of spirituous liquors is claimed for the Local Legislatures.\nThe leading clause of section 92 is as follows:\nIn each Province the Legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects next here\" inafter enumerated, that is to say, &c.:\nSub-section 9:\u2014\nShop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer, and other licenses, in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial, local, or municipal purposes.\nSub-section 13:\u2014\nProperty and civil rights in the Province.\nSub-section 15:\u2014\nThe imposition of punishment by fine, penalty, or imprisonment, for enforcing any law of the Province made in relation to any matter, coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section.\nAnd 16:\u2014\nGenerally all matters of a merely local or private nature in the Province.\nIt has been properly said, that it is a serious matter to consider and decide that an Act of a Legislature is ultra vires; but it is much more serious and unfortunate, by any judicial decision, to destroy the constitution of a country. The importance of our decision arises, not nearly so much from any effect it may have on the Act in question, which, in itself, claims from us the most patient and deliberate consideration, but from the general result, in view of the constitutional relations established by the Imperial Act in question, as provided in the sections referred to in regard to other subjects.\nA few days ago, I ascertained that my learned brethren were disposed to arrive at conclusions different from those which I considered the correct ones; and I have endeavoured, as far as other judicial duties permitted, to formulate the views I entertain, so as, at as early a moment as possible, to be able with my colleagues to give the result of our deliberations. Knowing the great interest taken in the subject, and it being desirable that Parliament\u2014now sitting\u2014should be informed of the result, I have felt bound to hasten the preparation of my judgment, but, in doing so, am obliged rather to give the conclusions at which I have arrived, than the argument at length in favor of them, or in detail the reasons by which I have been actuated.\nIt is contended that, inasmuch as the Local Legislatures could not provide as is done by this Act, Parliament necessarily must have the power it exercised. The proposition, as a general one, may be admitted, but there may be, and, I think, there are, exceptions, and that this may fairly be considered one of them. The position was assumed at the argument by the Counsel of the appellant, but not debated.\nIt was decided by the Court in New Brunswick, that municipal authorities under the Local Legislature had not the right to refuse to grant licenses, because it was an interference with trade and commerce; but the Court in Nova Scotia decided to the contrary. It has, therefore, not had that judicial sanction either way that would call upon us, without full independent consideration and inquiry, to adopt either view. I think that in this case we are to be guided by other considerations. If the Local Legislatures have not the power to refuse licenses, or to authorize municipal bodies to do so, because interfering with the prerogative of Parliament as to trade or commerce, it does not necessarily follow that Parliament can do so. If by the Imperial Act the Local Legislatures have the prerogative, of dealing with the subject of shop and tavern licenses, that prerogative is just as full and complete as that of Parliament in the other case, and as much entitled to be maintained independent of the consideration of the other proposition. We must decide upon the relative functions and prerogatives by the several specific and general provisions of the Imperial Act, and our ascription of powers to either must be in accordance with, and can go no further than, the Act prescribes.\nIf there be not concurrent legislative powers and the act is intra vires, then the necessary conclusion is, that all the local legislation on the subject of shop, saloon, tavern, and auctioneers' licenses since the first of July, 1867, has been ultra vires. Under such circumstances, it would be interesting to enquire, where there is any law in force restraining the sale of spirituous liquors in counties or cities who have not adopted The Canada Temperance Act, 1878.\nBy the construction put by the Supreme Court of the United States upon its constitution, concurrent jurisdiction has been found to exist in relation to several subjects; and legislation, by the States, has been decreed to be intra vires in many cases, until Congress legislated on the same subject. The Imperial Act, however, provides against such intermediate legislation, and gives to Parliament and the Local Legislatures exclusive jurisdiction, not contingent upon previous legislation by either. If this act is sustained as intra vires, the result is to leave the sale of spirituous liquors contingent upon the vote of each county or city. One county or city where the act is applied will have the prohibition, and the county or city which has not, or does not adopt it, will have no legislative restriction upon the sale. A decision of this case contrary to my views must produce that result. It is therefore most important, in the best interests of the country, that the correct solution should be reached.\nIn order properly to construe the Imperial Act, it is necessary and proper to consider the position of the United Provinces before the union. Each had what may be properly called plenary powers of legislation, in respect of provincial subjects. In the agreement for the union, provision was made for the general powers of Parliament and the Local Legislatures, as well as for the \"ways and means\" by which each was to be sustained. It was by a surrender of the local legislative power, to the extent agreed upon, that the powers of the Parliament were agreed to be given. It was in the nature of a solemn compact, to be inviolably kept, that the rights and prerogatives of both were adopted, and the agreements entered into were intended to be carried out by the Act mentioned. That that compact cannot be changed by one, any more than another of the contracting parties, is a proposition embodied in despatches from the Imperial Government, and one of which, I think, cannot be gainsaid. It is, therefore, only permissible to construe the act in conformity with that consideration.\nThe first, and, as I think, the only important consideration, is the extent to which effect should be given to the provision \"The regulation of Trade and Commerce and, admitting for the moment the power of Parliament to pass the act in reference to that subject, has it properly dealt with it? In deciding upon this question, our first inquiry is, whether Parliament intended the act as a regulation of trade or commerce? It does not necessarily follow, that if one in the pursuit of one purpose or object does an unjustifiable act, he can take shelter under a right he did not intend to assert or act on. There are circumstances in which, in such a case, the party would not be held justified.\nThe preamble of an act will not, of course, by itself, give or take away jurisdiction to legislate. If, however, the legislature plainly shows by the preamble and provisions of the act that the legislation was directed, not in the pursuance of legitimate power, but in reference to a subject over which it had no jurisdiction, I am far from thinking it would be legitimate. We cannot assume any legislature would so act.\nThe preamble informs us that it was \"very desirable to promote temperance,\" and the Act is provided to be cited as \"The Canada Temperance Act, 1878.\" The object is therefore patent, but it is contended that the subsequent words in the preamble\u2014\nAnd that there should be uniform legislation in all the Provinces respecting the traffic in intoxicating liquors\u2014\nmakes a direct reference to trade and commerce. If the words last quoted stood alone, they would, to the extent they go, support the contention, but following the previous expression of the desire to promote temperance, we should construe them as only the expression of the idea, that to promote temperance uniform legislation respecting the traffic in spirituous liquors was deemed necessary as a means to the end, and not as at all intended as a regulation of trade and commerce.\nBy the 3rd section, certain sections of the Temperance Act of 1864, were repealed, but nothing is contained in the Act at all referring to trade or commerce. It is, therefore, plain and palpable, that the subject of trade or commerce was not at all present in the Parliamentary mind. The act, taken all together, shows it was not passed by Parliament as a regulation of trade or commerce. I have serious doubts, whether in such a case we would not be wrong in concluding that Parliament ever intended it as such, or that we should, in view of any power it had over the subjects of trade or commerce which it clearly did not intentionally exercise, give effect to the Act passed avowedly for a totally different purpose. It is not however, necessary for me to rest my decision wholly on that point, as there are others more serious and important. The great and important question arises as to the effect to be given to the term \"The regulation of Trade and Commerce,\" taken as we are bound to take it, in connection with the provision for licensing shops, saloons, taverns, &c. We are to consider the matter of the regulation of trade and commerce, not only as to the scope and meaning of the term in its full force, but in relation to the licensing power expressly given to the Local Legsislatures.\nMr. Story, in his work of high authority on the constitution of the United States[35], quotes approvingly from a judgment of the Supreme Court principles of construction applicable to this case:\u2014\nThe Government, then, of the United States can claim no powers which are not granted to it by the constitution, and the powers granted to it must be such as are expressly given, or given by necessary implication. On the other hand, this instrument, like every other grant, is to have a reasonable construction according to the import of its terms. And when a power is expressly given in general terms, it is not to be restrained to particular cases, unless that construction grow out of the context expressly, or by necessary implication. The words are to be taken in their natural and ordinary sense, and not in a sense unreasonably restricted or enlarged.\nHe says[36]:\nOn the other hand, a rule of equal importance is not to enlarge the construction of a given power beyond the fair scope of its terms, merely because the restriction is inconvenient, impolitic, or even mischievous. * * * Nor should it ever be lost sight of, that the Government of the United States is one of limited and enumerated powers, and that a departure from the true import and sense of its powers is pro tanto the establishment of a new constitution.\nVattel in his second book, chap. 17 sections, 285, 286 says:\nBut the most important rule in cases of this nature is, that a constitution of Government does not, and cannot, from its nature, depend in any great degree upon verbal criticism or upon the import of single words. Such criticism may not be wholly without use; it may sometimes illustrate or unfold the appropriate sense; but unless it stand well with the context and subject matter, it must yield to the latter. While, then, we may well resort to the meaning of single words to assist our enquiries, we should never forget that it is an instrument of Government we are to construe; and, as has been already stated, that must be the truest exposition which best harmonizes with its design, its objects and its general structure.\nTaking, then, the provisions in regard to trade and commerce, according to the reliable authority I have first quoted, and all governing ones, in their natural and obvious sense in the relation in which they are placed, \"and not in a sense unreasonably enlarged,\" how should we construe them?\nThe right to legislate in regard to the licenses in question is clearly with the Local Legislatures, if not controlled by the provision for the regulation of trade and commerce alone, or through the operation of the concluding clause of section 91. If the two sub-sections stood alone, I should have little difficulty in concluding that sub-section 9 of 92 was intended to and does control sub-section 2 of 91, for, I think, we would be bound to conclude that by the express and specific terms of sub-section 9 of 92, the subject matter was intended to be free from the operation of the general provision in regard to trade and commerce. We are not to decide upon the comprehensiveness, of the latter provision as if standing alone, but to ascertain if, in the employment of the general term, and the giving of power to another body to deal specifically with a subject that might be otherwise considered to be embraced by the general term, it was not intended that the specific power should not be considered as excepted from the general provision. We are bound, 1 think, to conclude that in using the general term it was not intended to reach the subject specifically provided for in sub-section 9 of 92. It was clearly intended to give the licensing power to the Local Legislature, because the section so plainly and unequivocally so provides; but then it is contended the concluding clause of 91 over-rules the specific provision in sub-section 9 of 92, and virtually ignores it, if the general term as employed in regard to trade and commerce includes the subject matter. That, however, drives us back to the original proposition, and makes the contention no better. So that, if the regulation of trade and commerce, as provided for in the general terms used, was not intended to embrace the subject so far as to nullify the specific provision for shop and other licenses, and therefore not to that extent included in the general provision for trade and commerce, the concluding clause would be inapplicable to it. There are, however, other important considerations not to be lost sight of.\nWhen the union was negotiated and the Imperial Act passed, the leading idea was that in the large and extensive subjects affecting all the Provinces the General Parliament should legislate, and the smaller and less important subjects should be left to the Local Legislatures; and from the whole object of the union, and the Act by which it was formed, we may gather that the same principle would be properly applicable to the matter of trade and commerce.\nWe may therefore, I think, reasonably conclude that the regulation of trade and commerce referred to was, when taken in connection with the whole scope and object of the act, intended to apply to the general features, and not to the minute and trifling subjects, which might otherwise be considered as included. There are numberless subjects, more or less connected with trade and commerce, and which would be properly classed as coming within the classes of subjects given expressly to the Local Legislatures, but which are of so unimportant a character, as affecting the general trade and commerce of the Dominion, that the Union Act may be fairly construed as not intended to give to the general Parliament the power to regulate them; but if everything connected with trade or commerce, however remotely, is decided to be exclusively with the general parliament, all the local acts in reference to such matters would be ab initio void. The general Parliament legitimately provides for manufactures, and for the importation of goods. It provides rules to govern parties importing such goods. Free interchange of all articles was provided for between the United Provinces, and when spirituous or other articles are imported, and the duties paid, they pass free from one Province to another. They are then clear of any claim over them of the general Parliament or government, and under the terms \"property and civil rights\" become amenable to local legislation. Taking, then, the provision for the legislation as to licenses for the sale of spirituous liquors in shops, &c., and the whole act, and its objects, can it be reasonably claimed that that provision was not intended to leave the subject matter clear of the operation of the general provision in regard to trade and commerce?\nA question has been raised, whether the general Parliament could not wholly prohibit the manufacture, or importation of spirituous liquors. That question, however, is not involved in the issue before us. It is time enough to debate it when a necessity arises to do so. The one we have to consider is that Parliament, having authorized the importation and manufacture of spirituous liquors, and having received the revenue therefrom can it, by assuming the right to legislate for the promotion of temperance, although to some extent affecting trade and commerce, deprive the Local Legislatures, and the people of the several Provinces, of the right to raise the revenue from it specifically provided by sub-section 9?\nAs I before stated, the Imperial Act was founded on a compact for the federative union of the several Provinces; and from the explicit and unequivocal terms of section 9 we must conclude that the revenues to be derived from the issue of the licenses mentioned was intended to be permanently secured to the local authorities. Previously to the union, the revenues derived from licenses for the retail of spirituous liquors, I have reason to believe, in all the Provinces, were given to, and appropriated by municipal bodies, for municipal purposes, and I must conclude they were intended to continue so, or, at all events, to leave it to the Local Legislatures to decide whether they should so remain, or be appropriated for other local, or provincial purposes. Whether such revenues were great or insignificant, the principle applicable must be the same. If they amounted to several thousands of dollars, as I presume they did in some of the Provinces, it must be concluded that their retention by the local authorities was considered of importance, and accordingly was a part of the compact. The protection of the right to those revenues is a matter relatively of as much importance to the several Provinces as the protection of the right of the Dominion to the millions of dollars which the act enabled its government and Parliament to collect from the whole body of the people for Dominion purposes. I am free to admit the full scope and meaning of the grant of the power to regulate trade and commerce, and that but for the specific grant of the power to the Local Legislature by section 9 the ground might be covered, but, in the language and doctrine of Vattel,\nWhile we may well resort to the meaning of single words, to assist our inquiries, we should never forget that it is an instrument of Goverment we are to construe and * * * that must be the truest exposition which best harmonizes with its design, its objects, and its general structure.\nI am of the opinion that is the way we should construe the act of union, and, if we do, we can have but little difficulty in reaching the conclusion that the Act in question is an usurpation of power, and an inroad upon the constitution and prerogatives of the Local Legislatures, and results in depriving them of one of the reservations for local objects intended and provided for by the compact and act of union.\nIf the General Parliament had the power to legislate as the Act provides, it is only under the provisions I have referred to, and, that power once admitted, what is there to restrain its further legislation\u2014what is there to prevent it from changing and altering the whole principle and framework of the Act, so as, by \"the regulation of trade and commerce,\" to provide for licenses for the sale of spirituous liquors for any purpose, and to collect a revenue therefrom? The present Act, if intra vires, virtually repeals all local acts on the subject of licenses. It prohibits, if the majority in a county or city so wills, the sale of spirituous liquors except for certain purposes mentioned; but, if it has full and complete power over the subject matter, it may remove at any time the prohibitions, and provide for licenses for the sale for other purposes, prescribe duties to be paid for them, and take the revenues that were clearly to my mind, intended for Provincial, Local, or Municipal purposes. This may be called an extreme proposition, on the ground that Parliament would be restrained by motives of expediency; but, in the first place, the working out of the local constitution should not depend upon Parliament, and, in the next, if the Local Legislatures have no power over the subject matter, Parliament must take cognizance of it, or the sale will be wholly unrestricted. These considerations are of importance to exhibit the difficulties and wrongs involved in the validation of the Act; but they are insignificant compared with the consequences, which, in my opinion, must necessarily result in regard to other subjects, and in other respects. If it be finally decided, that the provision for \"the regulation of trade and commerce\" overrides the power of the Local Legislatures in the matter of licenses, I see no impediment in the way of legislation, in regard to matters affecting in the remotest way trade and commerce, that would not merely restrain and control, but completely nullify, the Local Legislative power in respect of \"civil rights and property\" and other important interests. It may be said, there is no danger to be apprehended in this respect, and that Parliament could not be expected to legislate with such a result, but my answer is, that we cannot allow any such considerations to affect our judgment. We are required to estimate the powers given severally to Parliament and the Local Leglatures, and it is our duty so to define them that neither will have to depend on the forbearance of the other.\nI am fully sensible of the difficulty of laying down any general rule of construction applicable to all cases, or of drawing any line. Each case must largely depend upon its own merits as it arises, and when principles are applied to one case all similar ones will be determined by them. I consider the subject of licenses for the retail of spirituous liquors in shops, saloons, and taverns, is wholly one of the nature of a police regulation, and that it was not intended, either by the compact for union, or the act passed therefor, that the local power should be affected, restrained, or controlled, by any Dominion legislation.\nThere were other objections to the act, raised by counsel, to which I have not thought it necessary to refer, as I think those I have given sufficient. I have, however, considered the ground taken on the other side, that Parliament had the right to pass the act under the provision of sub-section 27 of sec. 91, \"The Criminal Law,\" but have been unable to accede to the proposition. I cannot think it was the intention, under that general term, to give to Parliament power to the extent contended for, and I cannot find by the act itself anything that would bring the subject within the category of criminal jurisprudence.\nFor the reasons I have rather hastily, (when the importance of the issue is considered,) put together, and so imperfectly but I trust intelligibly expressed, I think the appeal should be dismissed, and the judgment below affirmed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\nI am of opinion to allow this appeal. It is clear that The Canada Temperance Act, 1878, could not be enacted by the Provincial Legislatures, for the simple reason, that they have only the powers that are expressly given to them by the B. N. A. Act, and that the said B. N. A. Act does not give them the power to effect such legislation. This has been held in Reg v. The Justices of King's[37], in Hart v. The Corporation of Missisquoi[38], in Cooey v. The Municipality of Brome[39], (reversed in Queen's Bench, Montreal, but judgment of Queen's Bench, reversed in Supreme Court, by consent), and in Poitras v. The Corporation of Quebec[40]; and, in fact, seems to be admitted by all the learned Judges of the Court below who have held this Act to be ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament. Well, it seems to me, the admission that the Local Legislatures could not pass such an Act implies an admission that the Dominion Parliament can do so. Once the power of legislation over a certain matter is found not to vest in the Provincial Legislatures, the question is solved, and that power necessarily falls under the control of the Dominion Parliament, subject, of course, to the exigencies of our Colonial status.\nSection 91 of the Imperial Act is clear on this. It expressly authorizes the Federal Parliament to make laws in relation to all matters not exclusively assigned to the Provincial Legislatures, and enacts in express terms, that the enumeration given of the classes of subjects falling under the control of the Federal Parliament is given for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the rights of the Federal Parliament generally over all matters not expressly delegated to the Provincial Legislatures.\nIf this Temperance Act would be ultra vires of the Provincial Legislatures, because the B. N. A. Act does not give them the power to enact it, I fail to see why it is not intra vires of the Dominion Parliament. Then, it seems to me, that under the words \"regulation of trade and commerce\" the B. N. A. Act expressly gives the Dominion Parliament the right to this legislation. It may, it is true, interfere with some of the powers of the Provincial Legislatures, but sect. 91 of the Imperial Act clearly enacts that, notwithstanding anything in this Act, notwithstanding that the control over local matters, over property and civil rights, over tavern licenses for the purpose of raising a revenue, is given to the Provincial Legislatures, the exclusive legislative authority of the Dominion extends to the regulation of trade and commerce, and this Court has repeatedly held, that the Dominion Parliament has the right to legislate on all the matters left under its control by the Constitution, though, in doing so, it may interfere with some of the powers left to the Local Legislatures. That the Act in question is a regulation of the trade and commerce in spirituous liquors seems to me very clear. It enacts when, where, to whom, by whom, under what conditions, this traffic and commerce will be allowed, and carried on. Are these not regulations? Some of the learned Judges in the Court below say that the Act is ultra vires because it prohibits and does not regulate, whilst another learned Judge of that Court says that it is ultra vires because it regulates and does not prohibit. To my mind, it is a regulation, whether it is taken as prohibiting or as regulating the trade in liquors. A prohibition is a regulation.\nBut it has been said The Temperance Act is not an Act concerning the regulation of trade and commerce, because it is not an Act for the regulation of trade and commerce, but only a Temperance Act. To this, I may well answer by the following words of Taney, C.J., in re the License cases[41]:\nWhen the validity of a State law, making regulations of commerce is drawn into question in a judicial tribunal, the authority to pass it cannot be made to depend upon the motives, that may be supposed to have influenced the legislation, nor can the Court inquire, whether it was intended to guard the citizens of the State from pestilence and disease, or to make regulations of commerce for the interests and convenience of trade. * * * * * *The object and motive of the State are of no importance and cannot influence the decision. It is a question of power.\nThese words may well be applied here. Is The Temperance Act of 1878 a regulation of trade and commerce, or of an important branch of trade and commerce? I have already said that it seems to me plain that it is so. Then, is it the less so because it has been enacted in the view of promoting temperance, or of protecting the country against the evils of intemperance? If for this object the Parliament has thought fit to make a regulation of the trade and commerce in spirituous liquors, does it lose its character of being a regulation of this trade by reason of the motive which prompted the legislator to enact this regulation? I cannot see it.\nI hold, then, that The Canada Temperance Act, 1878, is constitutional, and that this appeal should be allowed with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nAll the arguments upon which has been based the contention, that the Act in question, \"The Canada Temperance Act, 1878,\" is ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament, are attributable wholly, as it seems to me, to a want of due appreciation of the scheme of constitutional government embodied in the B. N. A. Act, and to a misconception of the terms and provisions of that Act. Historically we know, that the terms of a feasible scheme of union of all the B. N. A. Provinces, constitutes a subject, which, for many years, engaged the attention of public men in those Provinces\u2014that the matter became the subject of debate in the legislatures of the several Provinces\u2014that eventually the views of public men of all political parties were moulded into the shape of resolutions, which, having been subjected to the most careful consideration and criticism in the Provincial Legislatures, and to the consideration also of the Imperial Authorities, in consultation with delegates sent for the purpose to England, by the respective Provinces, were, after having been revised and amended, reduced into the form of a Bill, which the Imperial Parliament, at the special request of the Provinces, passed into an Act.\nThe object of this Act was, by the exercise of the Sovereign Imperial Power, called into action by the request of the then existing Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, to revoke the constitutions under which those Provinces then existed, and, as the preamble of the Act recites, to unite them federally into one Dominion, under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with a constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom\u2014to sow, in fact, the seed of the parent tree, which, growing up under the protecting shadow of the British Crown until it should attain perfect maturity, would in the progress of time become a nation, identical in its features and characteristics with that from which it had sprung, and to which, in the meantime, should be given the new name of \"Dominion,\" significant of the design conceived, and of the anticipated fortunes of this new creation.\nThe Act then proceeds to show, that the mode devised for founding this new \"Dominion,\" and for giving to it a constitution, similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom, was to constitute it as a quasi Imperial Sovereign Power, invested with all the attributes of independence, as an appanage of the British Crown, whose executive and legislative authority should be similar to that of the United Kingdom, that is to say, as absolute, sovereign and plenary as consistently with its being a dependency of the British Crown it could be, in all matters whatsoever, save only in respect of matters of a purely municipal, local, or private character\u2014matters relating (to use the language of a statesman of the time,) \"to the family life,\" (so to speak,) of certain subordinate divisions, termed Provinces carved out of the Dominion, and to which Provinces legislative jurisdiction limited to such matters was to be given.\nThe inhabitants of those several Provinces, being, as such, members of this quasi imperial power termed the Dominion of Canada, might, in some matters, have interests, qua inhabitants of the particular Province in which they should live, distinct from, or conflicting with the general interests which they would have as constituent members of the Dominion. In order to prevent the jarring of those distinct, or conflicting interests, and to maintain the peace, order, and good government of the whole, it would be necessary, in any perfect measure, that provision should be made for such a contingency, that the subordinate should yield to the superior\u2014the lesser to the greater; and that, in respect of any matter over which the several Provinces might be given any legislative authority concurrently with the Dominion Parliament, the authority of the latter, when exercised, should prevail, to the exclusion, and, if need be, to the extinction of the provincial authority.\nThe scheme therefore comprised a fourfold classification of powers. 1st. Over those subjects which are assigned to the exclusive plenary power of the Dominion Parliament. 2nd. Those assigned exclusively to the Provincial Legislatures. 3rd. Subjects assigned concurrently to the Dominion Parliament, and to the Provincial Legislatures. And 4th. A particular subject, namely, education, which, for special reasons, is dealt with exceptionally, and made the subject of special legislation.\nTo give effect to this scheme the B. N. A. Act, in its 3rd clause, enacts that, upon proclamation being made by Her Majesty, by and with the advice of Her Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council, within six months after the passing of the Act, the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, should form and be one Dominion under the name of Canada.\nImmediately upon the proclamation being issued, the above named Provinces, by force of the above clause, became and were to all intents and purposes divested of their former existence, and became merged in the Dominion so created; and then the 5th clause, out of the Dominion so created, carves four subordinate creations called Provinces and named Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, the two latter of which, although being coterminous with those of the extinguished Provinces of like names merged into the Dominion, are notwithstanding wholly new creations, brought into existence solely by the B. N. A. Act. The executive and legislative authority of all the Provinces, as at present constituted, as well as of the Dominion, are due to the B. N. A. Act, which now constitutes the sole constitutional charter of each and every of them, and which, with sufficient accuracy and precision, as it seems to me, defines the jurisdiction of each.\nThe 9th section declares, that the executive government and authority of and over Canada continues to be and is vested in the Queen; and as to the legislative power the 17th section enacts, that\nThere shall be one Parliament for Canada, consisting of the Queen, an upper house, styled the Senate, and the House of Commons.\nAnd the 91st section, that\nIt shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and the House of Commons, to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of Canada, in relation to all matters not coming within the class of subjects by this act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nBy this clause, the absolute sovereign power of legislation is vested in a Parliament, consisting of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Commons, in respect of all matters of every nature and description whatsoever, save and excepting only matters coming within the class of subjects by the Act itself assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces: over all matters whatsoever, excepting only the excepted matters, the legislative power of the Dominion Parliament is made absolute.\nHerein consists the great distinction between the constitution of the Dominion of Canada, and that of the United Stales of America,\u2014a distinction necessary in a constitution founded upon, and designed to be similar in principle to, that of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, but deliberately designed specially, as I have no doubt, with the view of avoiding what was believed to be a weakness and defect in the constitution of the United States, and to have been the cause of the civil war out of which that country had then but recently emerged. Instead of a confederation of several distinct, independent states, which, while retaining to themselves sovereign power, have agreed to surrender jurisdiction over certain matters to a central government, we have constituted one supreme power, having executive and legislative jurisdiction over all matters, excepting only certain specified matters, being of a local, municipal, domestic, or private character, jurisdiction over which is vested in certain subordinate bodies, termed Provinces, carved out of the territory constituting the Dominion, and which jurisdiction is subject to the control of the Dominion Executive, as the legislative power of the Dominion Parliament is itself subject to the control of Her Majesty in Her Privy Council.\nAll that is necessary, therefore, in order to determine whether any particular enactment is intra or ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament, is to enquire: does or does not the enactment in question deal with, or legislate upon, any of the subjects assigned exclusively to the Provincial Legislatures? If it does, it is ultra, and if it does not, it is intra vires of the Dominion Parliament; but lest, by possibility, doubts might arise in some cases in determining whether a particular enactment did or not deal with any of the subjects assigned exclusively to the Provincial Legislatures, the 91st section ex majori cautel\u00e2 proceeds to enact\nFor greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms of this section, it is hereby declared, that (notwithstanding anything in this Act) the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within any of the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated, that is to say; (here follow 29 items) and any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nHere, then, to dispel all doubts, if any should perchance arise in certain cases, and to remove all excuse for any encroachment by the Dominion Parliament upon the jurisdiction of the Local Legislatures, or for any assumption by the latter of the sovereign power and authority of the former, two tests are given by our charter for the ready determination in every case of the question, whether a particular enactment is or not ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament, or of the Local Legislatures; namely:\nFirst,\u2014if to the question \"Does the particular enactment deal with any of the particular subjects enumerated in the 92nd section, assigned exclusively to the Local Legislatures? a plain answer in the affirmative or negative can be given free from any doubt,\u2014that settles the point. If the answer be in the affirmative, the enactment in question is beyond the jurisdiction; if in the negative, it is within the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament.\nThe power to legislate upon every subject rests either in the Dominion Parliament, or in the Local Legislatures, and the Act is precise, that all matters not exclusively assigned to the Local Legislatures fall under the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament.\nBut to remove all doubts, in case the enactment under consideration should be of a nature to raise a doubt, whether it does or not deal with one or other of the matters particularly enumerated in the 92nd section, the second test may be applied, namely: \"Does the enactment deal or interfere with any of the subjects particularly, and for greater certainty, enumerated in the 91st section? If it does, then, (notwithstanding that it otherwise might come within the class of subjects enumerated in the 92 section), it is within the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament, for the plain meaning of the closing paragraph of the 91st section is that, notwithstanding any thing in the Act, any matter coming within any of the subjects enumerated in the 91st section shall not be deemed to come within the class of subjects enumerated in the 92nd section, however much they may appear to do so.\nIt was argued, that what was intended by this clause was to exclude the subjects enumerated in the 91st section from a portion only of the subjects enumerated in the 92nd section, namely: those only \"of a local or private nature,\" the contention being that the 92nd section comprehends other subjects than those which come under the description of \"local or private\" and so that, in effect, the intention was merely to declare, that none of the items enumerated in section 91 shall be deemed to come within item 16 of sec. 92. If this were the true construction of the clause, it would make no difference in the result, nor would it effect any thing in aid of the contention in support of which the argument was used, for the previous part of the 91st section in the most precise and imperative terms declares, that, \"notwithstanding any thing in the Act,\" notwithstanding, therefore, any thing whether of a local or private nature, or of any other character, if there be anything of any other character enumerated in the 92nd section, the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the class of subjects enumerated in the 91st section; but, in truth, all the items enumerated in the 92nd section are of a provincial and domestic, that is to say, of a \"local or private\" nature. The frame of the 92nd section differs from that of the 91st in its form. That of the 91st is general, of the 92nd particular; but this is precisely in character with the nature of the jurisdiction intended to be given to each. By the 91 section, the Imperial Parliament unequivocally, but in general terms, declares its intention to be to place under the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament all matters, excepting only certain particular matters assigned by the Act to the Local Legislatures. This mode of expression seemed to require a particular enumeration of those subjects so to be assigned to the Local Legislatures. The 92nd section, therefore, instead of dealing with the subjects to be assigned to the Local Legislatures in the same general terms as had been used in the 91st section, by placing under the jurisdiction of those legislatures all matters of a purely local or private nature within the Province, (a mode of expression which would naturally lead to doubt and confusion, and would be likely to bring about that conflict which it was desirable to avoid,) enumerates, under items numbering from 1 to 15 inclusive, certain particular subjects, all of a purely provincial, municipal and domestic, that is to say, \"of a local or private\" character, and then winds up with item No. 16\u2014a wise precaution, designed, as it seems to me, to prevent, the particular enumeration of the \"local and private\" matters included in the items 1 to 15 being construed to operate as an exclusion of any other matter, if any there might be, of a merely local or private nature. The wisdom of this mode of framing the 91st and 92nd sections appears when we read the items enumerated in the 91st section, some of which might be well considered to be matters which would come within some of the subjects enumerated in the 92nd section, but the scheme of the Act being to vest in the local legislatures all matters of a purely provincial, municipal and domestic, or \"of a local or private \"nature, and in the Dominion Parliament all matters which, although they might appear to come within the description of provincial, or municipal, or \"local or private,\" were deemed to possess an interest in which the inhabitants of the whole Dominion might be considered to be alike concerned, and that, therefore, these matters should be under the control of the Dominion Parliament, in order to prevent doubt as to those matters it was, as it seems to me, a necessary and wise provision to make, that notwithstanding any thing in the Act, and however much any of the items enumerated in the 91st section might appear to come within the subjects which, as being of a purely \"local or private\" nature, were enumerated in the 92nd section, yet they should not be deemed to come within such classification or description. We may, then, as it appears to me, adopt, as a canon of construction of these two sections, the rule following:\nAll subjects of whatever nature, not exclusively assigned to the Local Legislatures, are placed under the supreme control of the Dominion Parliament, and no matter is exclusively assigned to the Local Legislatures, unless it be within one of the subjects expressly enumerated in sec. 92, and is at the same time outside of all of the items enumerated in sec. 91, by which term \"outside of\" I mean does not involve any interference with any of the subjects comprehended in any of such items.\nIt was argued, that this rule could not be adopted as one of universal application\u2014that it would not apply to the terms \"marriage and divorce,\" in item 26 of the 91st sec., contrasted with \"solemnization of marriage,\" in item 12 of the 92nd section, but these matters respectively are placed in those sections in perfect accord with the scheme of the Act as above defined and with the above rule.\n\"Solemnization of marriage,\" that is to say, the power of regulating the form of the ceremony\u2014the mode of its celebration\u2014is a particular subject expressly placed under the jurisdiction of the Local Legislatures, as a matter which has always been considered to be purely of a local character. It was a matter purely of provincial importance whether the ceremony should take place before the civil magistrate, or whether it should be a religious ceremony; this was a matter in which the inhabitants of the different Provinces might take a different view. It was, therefore, a matter essentially to be regarded as \"local,\" and as such to be placed under the jurisdiction of the Local Legislatures. It is, therefore, specifically mentioned as exclusively assigned to these Legislatures but, as it is the solemnization of the marriage which is the only matter in connection with marriage which is so exclusively assigned, then all other matters connected with marriage are, by the express terms of the act, independently of the particular enumeration in the 91st sec., vested in the Dominion Parliament. That there are other matters connected with and involved in the term \"marriage\" besides the form of the ceremony of its solemnization, there can be no doubt, as, for example, the competency of the parties to the contract to enter into it\u2014the effect upon the status of the children, if presumed to be de facto entered into by persons not competent by law to enter into it\u2014its obligatory force when entered into\u2014the power of dissolving the tie when entered into\u2014these are all matters which (inasmuch as the solemnization of the ceremony is all that is mentioned in the 92nd sec. in relation to marriage), would come under the control of the Dominion Parliament by the mere force of the clause which enacts that the Dominion Parliament shall have jurisdiction over all matters not exclusively assigned by the Act to the Local Legislatures, without any enumeration whatever of items in the 91st sec.: but, for greater certainty, the Act expressly mentions in the 91st sec. \"marriage and divorce,\" and the rule taken from the Act says in effect, that these terms, so used in item 26 in the 91st sec., shall not be deemed to come within the term \"solemnization of marriage\" in item 12 of the 92nd sec. The matters mentioned in these respective items are then declared to be diverse and distinct. \"Solemnization of marriage,\" is, then, a matter \"outside of\" the term \"marriage and divorce,\" in the 91st sec., and the result is that the application of the rule (in perfect conformity with the theory of the scheme of the Act as above defined,) leaves the power of legislating as to the form of the ceremony as a purely local matter, under the control of the Local Legislatures, and places all other matters connected with marriage, including divorce, under the control of the Dominion Parliament.\nThe only question, then, which we have to consider is, does the matter which is the subject of legislation in the The Canada Temperance Act, 1878, come within any of the subjects by the B. N. A. Act exclusively assigned to the Local Legislatures?\nIn the court below, it seems to have been considered sufficient to make the Act to be ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament, if its provisions are of a nature to affect injuriously the power given to the Local Legislatures, under item 9 of sec. 92, to legislate in respect of\nShop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer, and other licenses, in order to the raising of a revenue for Provincial, Local, or Municipal purposes.\nBut this is clearly an erroneous view, for nothing can be more explicit than the provision of the statute which declares that, if power to legislate upon the matter in question is not given, and exclusively given, to the Local Legislatures, it is vested in the Dominion Parliament. One of the learned Judges in the Court below seems to have inverted the rule expressly laid down in the B. N. A. Act for our guidance when he says that,\nUnless the power to pass The Canada Temperance Act is given under the enumerated classes of subjects exclusively assigned to Parliament, the act is ultra vires, as interfering with property and civil rights in the Province, the right to legislate on which is exclusively assigned to the Local Legislatures.;\nThe converse of this is what in fact the Act says, and although it may be admitted, that if the power to legislate upon any subject is not in the Dominion Parliament it is in the Provincial Legislatures, for all matters must come within the jurisdiction either of Parliament or of the Local Legislatures, yet the unerring test to determine whether the power to pass the act is, or is not, vested in the Dominion Parliament is to enquire, under the application of the rule as I have above stated it, does it, or does it not, deal with a subject jurisdiction over which is given exclusively to the Local Legislatures? for, if not, it is vested in the Parliament.\nNow, that the intemperate use of spirituous liquors is the fruitful cause of the greater part of the crime which is committed throughout the Dominion\u2014that it is an evil of a national, rather than of a local or provincial character, will not, I apprehend, be denied. The adoption of any measures calculated to remove or diminish this evil is, therefore, a subject of national rather than of provincial import, and the devising and enacting such measures into law, as calculated to promote the peace, order, and good government of Canada, is a matter in which the Dominion at large and all its inhabitants are concerned.\nWhen we find, then, the design of the B. N. A. Act to be to impart to the Dominion Parliament a quasi national character, and to assign to the legislatures of the Provinces carved out of and subordinated to the Dominion matters only of a purely provincial importance, if the question, whether the power to pass such an Act as the one under consideration, arose upon the construction of the Act, as if it contained the clause, that: It shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the advice, and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the class of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the Provinces\u2014\nfollowed by the enumeration of the items in the 92nd section assigned to the Local Legislatures, and without any enumeration of the items which for greater certainty have been inserted in section 91, I should have great difficulty in coming to the conclusion that, under the terms of the 13th item of section 92, namely: \"property and civil rights in the Province,\" any power was given to pass such an Act as The Canada Temperance Act, 1878, which undoubtedly professes to deal with a subject of a national, rather than of provincial import, but with the enumeration of the particular items inserted in section 91, and regarding the whole scope, object and frame of the Act, it is clear beyond all question, that the Act under consideration is ultra vires of the Provincial Legislatures.\nTurning to the Act, we find it to be entitled, \"An Act respecting the Traffic in Intoxicating Liquors,\" its object, as stated in its preamble, is to promote temperance as a thing most desirable to be promoted in the Dominion; the means adopted in the Act for attaining this end consist in regulating and restraining the exercise of the trade or traffic in intoxicating liquors. Reading, therefore, the object of the Act to be as it was read in the Court below, namely: to endeavour to remove from the Dominion the national curse of intemperance, and observing that the means adopted to attain this end consist in the imposition of restraints upon the mode of carrying on a particular trade, namely: the trade in intoxicating liquors, it cannot admit of a doubt, that power to pass such an Act, or any Act, assuming to impose any restraint upon the traffic in intoxicating liquors, or to impose any rules or regulations, not merely for municipal or police purposes, to govern the persons engaged in that trade, and assuming to prohibit the sale of liquors, except under and subject to the conditions imposed by the Act, is not only not given exclusively, but is not at all given to the Provincial Legislatures. The principle of Regina v. Justices of King[42], decided, and properly so decided, in the Court from which this appeal comes, is equally applicable to exclude from the jurisdiction of the Local Legislatures all power to pass such an Act.\nThe Act, then, being ultra vires of the Provincial Legislatures, as dealing with a subject not exclusively assigned to the Provincial Legislatures, cadit questio, for that point being so determined, it follows, by the express provision of the B. N. A. Act, that it is within the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament.\nThis Court has no jurisdiction other than is given to it by the Act of the Dominion Parliament which constitutes it, and that Act does not authorize it to assume to impose restrictions upon Parliament as to the terms, conditions and provisions to be contained in any Act passed by it upon any subject which is within its jurisdiction to legislate upon. That point being determined, the jurisdiction of Parliament as to the terms of such legislation is as absolute as was that of the Parliament of Old Canada, or as is that of the Imperial Parliament in the United Kingdom, over a like subject.\nWhat, therefore, may be the opinion of text writers, or what may be the decision of the United States Courts, as to the powers of the Central Government and Congress, or of the legislatures of the several States, upon the like subject, is unimportant, for, as the Dominion Government and Parliament are founded upon the model of, and made similar in principle to, those of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, it follows that, once it is established that the subject matter of The Temperance Act of 1878 is a matter within the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament to legislate upon, the provisions of that Act are as valid and binding, and beyond the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with, otherwise than by construing it, as The Temperance Act of 1864, from which the Act of 1878 is taken, was valid and binding, and beyond the jurisdiction of the Courts of Old Canada to deal with, otherwise than by construing, and as a similar Act in Great Britain, if passed by the British Parliament, would be valid and binding upon the Courts there.\nIt is unnecessary, therefore, to discuss any of the other matters, relied upon in the Court below, and referred to in the argument before us, and the appeal must be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Beckwith & Seeley\nSolicitor for respondent: H.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne J. J.\nControverted Elections Act, 1874\u2014Gifts and subscriptions for charitable purposes\u2014Payment of a just debt without reference to Election, not bribery.\nHeld\u20141. That if gifts and subscriptions for charitable purposes, made by a candidate who is in the habit of subscribing liberally to charitable purposes, are not proved to have been offered or made as an inducement to, or on any condition that, any body of men, or any individual, should vote or act in any way at an election, or on any express or implied promise or undertaking that such body of men, or individual, would, in consequence of such gift or subscription, vote or act in respect to any future election, then such gifts or subscriptions are not a corrupt practice, within the meaning of that expression as defined by the Election and Controverted Elections Acts, 1874.\n2. That the settlement by payment of a just debt by a candidate to an elector without any reference to the election is not a corrupt act of bribery, and especially so when the candidate distinctly swears he never asked the elector's support, and the elector says he never promised it and never gave it.\n[Gwynne and Taschereau, J. J., doubting whether the transactions proved were not within the prohibitory provisions of the Act.]\nThis was an appeal from a judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Gall on the 14th January, 1870, dismissing the election petition filed against the return of the respondent as member of the House of Commons for the electoral district of the south riding of the county of Ontario.\nThe petition was in the ordinary form, and charged that the respondent, by himself and his agents, was guilty of corrupt practices within the meaning of that expression, as defined by the Election and Controverted Elections Acts, and by the common law of Parliament. There were in all 53 charges mentioned in the particulars, to which several others were allowed to be added during the trial.\nThe judgment appealed from declared none of these charges were sustained, either against the respondent or his agents.\nThe appellant, by notice, limited his appeal to the amended particulars delivered before the trial as Nos. 7. 31, 37, 47, 50, 51 and 53, and to those added at the trial numbered 6 and 7.\nThey were given as follows in the amended particulars:\nNumber.\nName of Person Bribing.\nName and Address of Person Bribed\nTime.\nPlace.\nNature.\n7\nJohn Spink.\nLouis O'Leary, Pickering\nBetween 15th August and Sept. 10, '78.\nFrenchmen's Bay.\nPromise to procure office.\n31\nF.

The said respondent, in the month of May, 1878. at Oshawa, corruptly made a gift of trees to a cemetery of the Roman Catholic Church, to induce Roman Catholic voters and others generally, to vote or refrain from voting at said election.\n50. The said respondent, on the first July, 1878, at Oshawa, gave money and other valuable considerations to members of the Roman Catholic Church, at a pic-nic then being held, to induce the members of such Church, and others generally, to vote or refrain from voting.\n51. Also, the respondent, at Duffin's Creek, during the canvass at said election, corruptly made gifts of money, and other valuable considerations, to the members of the Roman Catholic Church, to induce the members of the said Church, and others generally, to vote or refrain from voting at said election.\n53. The respondent, during the canvass for the said election, at divers other times and places, corruptly made gifts of money, and other valuable considerations, to other religious and charitable associations, and to other laudable and popular undertakings, to induce electors in general to vote or refrain from voting at said election.\nAnd in the particulars added at trial, by leave of the Judge:\n6. Dingle.\u2014Glen promised Thomas Dingle a contract if he would support Glen. This was promised in June last.\n7. James Wallace, bribed by Higgins at Whitby, by promise of office.\nThese charges and the material parts of the evidence bearing upon them are reviewed at length in the judgment of the Chief Justice hereinafter given.\nMr. H. Cameron, Q. C., for appellant:\u2014\nThe appellant, by his notice, has limited his appeal to the charges numbered in the particulars delivered before the trial as Nos. 7, 31, 37, 47, 50, 51 and 53, and to those added at the trial, numbered 6 and 7.\nThe first case I will take up is No. 7, the Spink-O'Leary case. This is a charge of bribery. The bribe Was the procurement for O'Leary of the office of Landing Waiter at Frenchman's Bay, through the exertions of one Spink, whose agency cannot be seriously disputed. [The learned Counsel then reviewed the evidence on this case.]\nIt sufficiently appears that O'Leary, whatever his secret determination may have been\u2014and it is one of the suggestive features of the case that, although Spink deposes that O'Leary, having informed him that he had made up his mind never to vote with the Conservatives again after the Orange riots at Montreal, O'Leary never alludes to this change of sentiment on his part \u2014 could not induce Mr. Spink to move on his behalf, or to make him any promise until he distinctly announced his determination to vote, if he voted at all, for the Respondent; that thereupon Mr. Spink did promise to procure the office, and the pretence set up is a palpable absurdity. It would not be easy to make out from the mouths of unwilling witnesses more damning evidence of a corrupt bargain.\nThe next case is what I call the Glen-Pedlar case, No. 31 of the particulars. This is a personal charge against the Respondent. It is that, in consideration of obtaining the vote of one George H. Pedlar, or to prevail on him to keep quiet and not to vote, he (the respondent) paid a claim of Pedlar's against him.\n[The CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014Have any cases gone so far as to hold the payment of a legal debt to be a corrupt act?]\nIf done with the corrupt purpose of influencing the voter. The evidence clearly shows that the settlement took place for the purpose of obtaining Pedlar's neutrality. This, I contend, is a corrupt act within the meaning of the section. There is a case Re North Ontario (not reported) in which the Court of Appeal for Ontario declared that the payment of even a just debt, never disputed by the debtor, if for the purpose of inducing an elector to vote, or to refrain from voting, is bribery, and, as the exercise of a perfectly lawful right, if done for the purpose of influencing an elector, is undue influence and unlawful. Norfolk case[1]; Blackburn case[2]; North Allerton case[3]; so may the doing of a perfectly lawful act be bribery\u2014See Cooper v. Slade[4].\nThe charges No. 37 and No. 6 of added particulars, Dingle's cases, may be treated together. [The learned counsel argued that the result of the evidence in these charges was that they had been fully sustained.]\nAs to the charges of colorable charity, the respondent is charged with giving with more than his usual liberality to churches and charities, with a corrupt motive. The respondent himself admitted that he had never before been so liberal in his charitable expenditure, and he further admitted when asked his object in thus spending money liberally on behalf of the Roman Catholic body, that he \"did not know that he could say any particular object; to have their goodwill in the first place;\" and he admits that it was to make himself popular with the Catholic people of the riding. Again, the respondent admits that the Catholic electors of the riding, of whom he estimates there are about one in every eighteen or twenty usually supported his opponent, Mr. Gibbs, were of great importance in the contest. To break the force of these admissions, the respondent, in his examination by his own counsel, stated very broadly, that \"for the past ten years my average to all charitable purposes would be one thousand dollars a year.\" But this was qualified, and in effect done away with, by the admissions already extracted, and by what he was compelled on re-examination to concede. The question on these facts is, as put by Mr. Justice Grove in the Boston Case[5], whether these distributions were made with the intention of, in legal language, \"corrupting\" the electors. It is urged that these donations were in view of the impending dissolution of Parliament\u2014so much is in terms almost admitted by the respondent; that no reasonable motive or object is pretended for them; that they were excessive, judged by the respondent's former practices; that they were mainly to one denomination, whose influence it was desirable to secure, and the vote of the electors belonging to which decided the contest in the respondent's favour. Can it be said, in view of the warnings that have been given (see Boston Case, already cited, and South Huron Case[6],) that these donations were not corrupt in the sense in which the word is used? See the Launceston Case[7]; Drinkwater & Deakin[8].\n[As to the Wallace case, the learned counsel argued that the evidence of Mr. Wallace was very clear and that there were many of the surrounding circumstances which go far to support his veracity, and concluded by stating:]\nIt is a remark that is applicable to this as well as other charges in appeal, that the evidence of no witness, on whose testimony reliance is placed by the appellant, has been discredited by the learned Judge who tried the petition. The Supreme Court is, therefore, in as good a position to determine on which side the truth lies as was the learned Judge. And the Controverted Election Act, expressly allowing an appeal on questions of fact, the appellant is entitled to the judgment of the Court on them, irrespective of the views entertained by the learned Judge who heard the evidence.\nMr. Robinson, Q. C., and Mr. J. D. Edgar for respondent: There are some general considerations entitled to weight in deciding upon the various charges.\nThe Court below remarked that the enquiry into the circumstances of the election had not been rendered incomplete by the action of any of the parties to the petition, and that there was no evidence of illegal expenditure. The respondent is therefore entitled to contend that the character of the evidence shows that the election was conducted in accordance with the Dominion Elections Act, and that the sense of the constituency having been obtained, it would not be judicious to set aside the election on suspicious evidence, especially when the learned Judge who has seen and heard the witnesses declared in favour of the respondent. Moreover, the respondent showed by his words and conduct that up to the 19 May, 1878, he sought to bring others forward as candidates, and did not seek or desire the position himself. This must materially weaken inferences of corrupt intent sought to be drawn from his conduct prior to that date.\n[The learned counsel then reviewed in detail the following charges: Charge 1. Louis O'Leary bribed by John Spink, by promise to procure office; Charge 31. The bribery by respondent of Geo. H. Pedlar, by the settlement of claim and money; Charge 37 and Charge 6, amended particulars, as to bribery of Thomas Dingle, by promise of office for his son and a contract for himself; Charge 7, of added particulars, James Wallace bribed by Higgins by promise of office; and contended that the alleged attempts of bribery had not been proved, that the testimony of the appellant's witnesses, was contradicted by respondent's witnesses, that the payment of a just debt, without any reference to the election before the respondent was nominated, cannot be said to be a corrupt act, and referred to; The Windsor case[9]; The Mallow case[10]; The Boston case[11].]\nThe next cases are those of colorable charity.\nThe respondent was, during 16 or 17 years before the election, very liberal to Roman Catholic objects; the Roman Catholics often spoke of his generosity, and he had a general reputation for that quality for years. Indeed, respondent is uncontradicted in his statement that he had given as much away, on an average, during the previous ten years as he did the year of the election. His was no suddenly developed zeal for charitable, or public, or religious objects. If he had any corrupt intentions he would not have allowed his political opponents to be aware of his gifts and charities; while the fact is, that at the Dominion Day picnics he went to Mr. Dingle, an active opponent, to have his cheques cashed for the money he is accused of spending corruptly.\nIt is contended by the Appellant that these corrupt charities influenced the Roman Catholic vote, and thereby decided the contest in Respondent's favor. To prove this, the Respondent's opponent, Mr. Gibbs, was called, and he attributed his defeat partly to the defection of the Catholic vote. This is pure speculation, under the ballot, and it seems to have been founded upon curious reasoning, because Mr. Gibbs was defeated once before by 150 when he thinks he received the Catholic vote. From Mr. Gibbs' own evidence, another inference may be fairly drawn. In the year 1872 his expenditure was four or five thousand dollars and his majority but 93; whereas in 1873 he spent ten or eleven thousand dollars and raised his majority to 242. It is therefore more fair to assume that election expenditure affected the results than that the Catholic electors swayed the elections in that riding. The authorities applicable to this case are: Drinkwater v. Deakin[12]; The Stafford case[13]; The Youghal case[14]; The Windsor case[15]; Somerville v. Laflamme[16].\nMr. Cameron, Q.C., in reply.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014\nThis is an appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Galt, dismissing the Election Petition filed against the respondent, charging him and his agents with corrupt practices, as defined by section 49 of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act of 1874, and by the Dominion Elections Act, 1874, and by the common law of Parliament, whereby the election and return of the respondent are void.\nIn the original particulars 39 cases of bribery were charged; 3 cases of undue influence, threatening and intimidation; 1 of treating; and 10 of corrupt practice's. Amended particulars were filed in which there were 39 cases of bribery; 3 cases of undue influence, intimidation and threatening; 1 case of treating; and on the trial 7 more were added by leave of the Judge, making in all 103 cases. Of these, 43 were charges against the respondent personally. In the opinion of the learned Judge, none of these charges were sustained, either against the respondent or the other persons charged.\nThe appellant has taken no exception to the disposal of 96 of the cases, but has limited, by notice, his appeal to 9, viz:\u2014Nos. 7, 31, 37, 47, 50, 51 and 53 in the particulars delivered before the trial, and Nos. 6 and 7 of those added at the trial.\nIt is a notable fact, that there is no allegation or indication in the evidence of any general bribery, or corrupt practices, or improper conduct in connection with the election itself, which would seem to have been conducted, so far as appears before us, apart from the cases now to be considered, in the most correct and unimpeachable manner; and the respondent testifies that, with, regard to the election, he took special means to prevent bribery; that he asked his friends to offer a reward; and he says 60 of the leading Reformers signed a paper offering a reward of $50; it was offering a reward for the conviction of bribery on either side. Five hundred of these bills were printed and distributed. \"I warned my friends in every meeting I had, but especially at my committee meetings, to be careful and to crush out anything like bribery.\"\nOf the nine cases we have to deal with, No. 7 is a charge of bribing one O'Leary with a promise of office by J. Spink. No. 31 is a charge of bribing one Pedlar by settlement of claim and money by respondent. 37 and 6 of added particulars, bribing one Dingle by promise of office for son and of contracts for himself by respondent. 47, corrupt practices towards a number of R. Catholic voters by gift of trees to R. C. Cemetery by respondent. 50 and 51, similar charge towards same by gifts of large sums of money at pic-nic by respondent. 53, similar charge as to whole constituency by subscriptions to charitable and other objects by respondent.\nIn considering Nos. 47, 50, 51, 53, which are cases of alleged profuse liberality by which the whole community or certain denominations were bribed by subscriptions to charitable and other objects, it must be borne in mind that the respondent was not a non-resident, or comparative stranger coming to the locality, seeking election as its representative. He was and had been for years, not only a resident, but largely and personally interested in its welfare and progress, and in its industrial, social and religious institutions, and had been for years a uniform, consistent and liberal contributor, especially to charitable and religious objects\nThe first, No. 47, is the gift of trees to the Roman Catholic Cemetery.\nI can discover nothing whatever in this transaction of a corrupt or illegal character. The Catholics, about two years before, had established a cemetery a short distance from Oshawa; it is described as being a bare looking place. We all, I suppose, know that of late years a very great change has taken place with reference to the character and adornment of the places where the dead are interred, and which is strikingly evidenced in the picturesque rural cemeteries now substituted in many places for the old-fashioned grave yards, as they were not inappropriately designated. As to the cemetery in question, the respondent thus details his connection with it:\nQ\u2014You are not a Roman Catholic, I believe; that is not your religious persuasion? A\u2014No, sir.\nQ\u2014Did you at any time last year make any contribution towards laying out the grounds of the cemetery in connection with the Roman Catholic denomination? A\u2014I gave some trees.\nQ\u2014When was that? A\u2014In January or February I promised to give them. I offered them.\nQ\u2014Who did you offer them to? A\u2014To Father McIntee.\nQ\u2014Where is the cemetery? A\u2014Two miles and a-half about from Oshawa.\nQ\u2014Does it belong to Oshawa parish? A\u2014I so understand.\nQ\u2014And you reside in Oshawa? A\u2014Yes.\nQ\u2014In January or February, what was the offer made? A\u2014To give him some trees if he would plant them in the cemetery.\nQ\u2014Were you in the tree business? A\u2014My brother was.\nQ\u2014Where does your brother reside? A\u2014Rochester, U. S.\nQ\u2014Was that a purely voluntary offer on your part? A\u2014It was.\nQ\u2014What was the size of the cemetery? A\u2014From five to eight acres.\nQ\u2014How long has there been a cemetery there. How long has this place been a cemetery? A\u2014About two years I should say, perhaps three years.\nQ\u2014Was this your first donation towards beautifying the cemetery? A\u2014Yes.\nQ\u2014Had you taken any interest in it before this? A\u2014I don't know that I had. Q\u2014Can you tell how it was, in January or February, you happened to think of the cemetery\u2014the Roman Catholic cemetery? A\u2014Father McIntee and I were very good friends; and I had a very good old friend\u2014Mr. Welch\u2014buried there. On driving past it, it looked to me very bare. I took an interest in tree growing and planting. I remember the offer I made very well.\nQ\u2014You say Father McIntee, a very old friend; friendship of long standing? A\u2014Not very long.\n* * * * *\nQ\u2014Then as to this tree planting; what was the first thing induced you to think of planting trees? A\u2014I spent ten years of my life in the horticultural business in Rochester; I had a great deal of taste for tree planting; I would like to see every cemetery in the land beautified by trees; I have often urged that between Oshawa and the township they ought to buy a lot of land and make a beautiful cemetery; I think it very desirable for any community to have a handsome cemetery; ever since I came to Oshawa I have urged that.\nThe respondent could procure these trees from his brother at wholesale prices. It is not, to my mind, difficult to understand, if Mr. Glen had any taste for the business he had been engaged in, how much a cemetery bare of trees would suggest so appropriate a contribution, and induce a man, ordinarily free in his gifts, to be at the expense of the trees, if the proprietors of the cemetery would be at the expense of setting them out, as they undertook to do in this case.\nThis gift, in itself, exhibits, to my mind, only good taste and good feeling, and not by any means, I am happy to think, of an extraordinary or unusual character. What then makes this a corrupt act of bribery? The offer was made in January or February. Mr. Glen was not spoken of as a probable candidate till March; he appears not to have desired to be a candidate, and endeavored, though unsuccessfully, to induce others to accept a nomination, and was not himself nominated till 31st May, 1878. Parliament was not dissolved till two or three weeks before the 17th September, and the elections did not take place till that date. Who was to be bribed? It is not pretended that this gift was offered, or made as an inducement to, or on any condition that, any body of men or any individual, should vote or act in any way at any election, nor is there the slighest evidence that there was, on the part of any body of men, or any individual, any promise or undertaking express or implied, that they or he would, in consequence of such gift, vote or act in respect to any future elections, otherwise than they should or would do if no such gift had been made. The utmost that can be said of this transaction in reference to election matters is, that it might possibly, and probably would, commend the donor generally to the good or favourable opinion of the denomination to whose church the cemetery belonged. In my opinion, it ought to commend him favorably to every person of good taste who might have occasion to pass the cemetery, as a general benefactor. We may as well here see what the cases say with reference to matters of this kind.\nIn the Westbury case[17], it was proved (as part of the recriminatory case) that the petitioner had sent a check for \u00a310 as a subscription to a dissenting congregation almost at the same time as he issued his address as candidate. Mr. Justice Willes:\u2014\nI wish I could be spared the theological part of the case unless it is a very clear case.\nMr. Cole:\u2014\nIf your Lordship thinks nothing of it I will not press it?\nMr. Justice Willes:\u2014\nNo, I do not say I think nothing of it. I have myself often observed that people who mean to become candidates often subscribe to things they would otherwise not have subscribed to, but I think that is a step off corrupt practices, it is charity stimulated by gratitude or hope of favors to come.\nIn the Hastings case[18], it was proved that previous to the election a lavish household expenditure had gone on in the establishment of the Respondent, and this was said to have been done for the purpose of influencing the election generally, but not of influencing any vote in particular.\nMr. Justice Blackburn says:\u2014\nThere is no law which says that any lavish expenditure in a neighborhood with a view of gaining influence in the neighborhood and influencing an elector is illegal at all. In order to constitute anything which would be a corrupt practice in respect of expenditure of that sort, it must be made with a view of influencing a particular vote. If such an expenditure is made at a place with a tacit understanding of this kind: \"I will incur bills and spend my money with you, if you will vote for me,\" that being not the side on which you intended to vote; if it is intended to produce that effect upon the voter it amounts to bribery.\nIn the Belfast case[19], it was proved that the respondent gave a subscription towards an Orange Lodge although he was not an Orangeman properly so called, nor were his opinions identical with those of the Lodge. It was contended on the part of the petitioners, that this was a corrupt payment within the meaning of the Corrupt Practices Act 1834.\nBaron Fitzgerald, in his judgment, said as to this:\nThe profession of a candidate of holding certain opinions is a legitimate mode of influencing voters, and if the respondent thought that it would be for his benefit with reference to his election to inform orangemen and others that he did entertain opinions in favor of institutions of this kind, I can see nothing illegitimate in that. The case appears to me identically the same as if he had written a pamphlet in support of such institutions as Orange halls and had paid the printer for publishing it.\nIn the Boston case[20], in which the respondent was unseated by reason of the manner in which the agent distributed the gifts, Mr. Justice Grove thus treated of charitable gifts. He says:\nWe know, for instance, that persons, looking forward to be candidates for Parliament, are generally pretty liberal to the charities in the district, and such liberality, so far as I am aware, has never been held to vitiate the election; I suppose on the ground that such persons do not select voters as contradistinguished from non-voters as the objects of their charity, that the object itself is good and that, although the donors may, in so bestowing their charity, look to their personal interests and personal ambition, still a man is not to be injured in an object of personal ambition merely because he does good, which, perhaps, without that stimulus, he might not have been induced to do.\nIn the Stroud case[21], Bramwell, J., says:\nThe Act does not say that liberal conduct towards your men, or such a thing as I suggested\u2014for instance, the putting up of a drinking fountain, or what not\u2014although it may be done very much to influence voters, is an act of bribery. I do not think that it was the intention of the Legislature to prevent the doing of any act, liberal and good in itself. * * * The Legislature intended to prohibit acts done with the specific object of influencing the mind of the individual voter to whom they had relation by the particular temptation held out to him, but it did not intend to prevent an act being done to a person, kind and good in itself, merely because it had a tendency to make the person favorable to the persons doing it.\nThe grievance appears to be that this was a Catholic cemetery, and the object was to secure Catholic influence at the election, and so the contributions to the Sisters of Charity are likewise brought forward.\nRespondent is asked:\nQ\u2014Is this the first time you had done any in this way to the Roman Catholic denomination? A\u2014By trees, you mean?\nQ\u2014Or in any other way? A\u2014No, sir. I had always subscribed every time I was asked for charitable purposes. I do not think I ever refused.\nQ\u2014What would be the extent of subscription? A\u2014I think in the fall of 1877 I gave about sixty dollars, about Christmas time; previous to Christmas.\nQ\u2014That would be the Christmas of 1876, you mean? A\u2014The Christmas of 1877.\nQ\u2014What was that for? A\u2014I sent it to the Sisters. Some turkeys and some flour and other things to distribute among the poor.\nQ\u2014Did you do that voluntarily, without being requested? A\u2014I did, sir. I do not think I was invited to assist. Q\u2014Were you seized at that time with a universal fit of benevolence? A\u2014I gave a great many turkeys away.\nQ\u2014To any other religious denomination? A\u2014That is the only denomination, the Roman Catholics; not to any other religious denomination.\nQ\u2014Then the only denomination were the Roman Catholics? A\u2014I sent these to the Sisters. I sent none to any other denomination then.\nQ\u2014Then this you did without being solicited at all, to the value of sixty dollars? A\u2014Yes; about that.\nQ\u2014Had you ever done anything of that nature before? A\u2014Not of that nature; but I did in money whenever I was asked to.\nQ\u2014But it was at Christmas, 1877, you first voluntarily contributed in that form? A\u2014I gave some money before that when I was not solicited.\nQ\u2014When was that? A\u2014I think probably in October, 1877.\nQ\u2014For what purpose? A\u2014To pay their taxes.\nQ\u2014You were not solicited in 1877, and you gave the money. Whom did you send it to? A\u2014I sent it to the Sisters.\nQ\u2014We hear a good deal about exemption in these days. Were they not exempt? A\u2014They were taxed. It was brought up before the council. The half of the tax was remitted; the other half was not. I brought the matter up in the council, and the half the council did not remit I voluntarily paid myself.\nQ.\u2014How much was that? A\u2014Ten or fifteen dollars\u2014whatever the deficiency was.\nThe contribution to the Sisters of Charity, to enable them to furnish the poor with a Christmas dinner, and the contribution towards their taxes, is, I think, not very generously brought up against the respondent. The respondent was a large manufacturer in the town in which he lived, and must have been the employer of much labor, and would naturally feel a peculiar interest in looking- after those in whom he must necessarily be more or less interested, and who, on their part, would be more or less dependent on him as a large employer. The giving of turkeys and providing otherwise for securing a good dinner on Christmas day to those unable to procure it for themselves is, I am happy to think, by no means a rare occurrence; and, in view of the respondent's character and position in Oshawa, it would have been remarkable, if at Christmas time he had forgotten the poor. The circumstance of selecting the Sisters of Charity to dipense his liberality and the nature of the gift, a Christmas dinner, which we may fairly assume would be distributed only among those not able to procure one for themselves and family, and therefore a class of the community least likely to be voters or to have political influence, ought to disarm the act of a corrupt intent.\nWith respect to the expenditure of money at pic-nics and bazaars.\nIt would be absurd for us to affect not to know that all sorts of devices are resorted to at these gatherings to induce the parties who attend to spend their money, and that many who so attend are induced to expend more than they contemplated, and that not a few are debarred on that very account from attending at all. And among the novelties modern ingenuity has invented for extracting money is the procuring a comparatively trifling present, and the putting up the names of rival politicians, or others, to be voted for by their respective friends, the present so provided to be presented to the successful candidate. The more tickets sold the more successful the scheme. No doubt on such occasions a very considerable amount of excitement or enthusiasm (though very absurd in the eyes of some) is got up, as appears to have been the case in the instance complained of, where the present was a biscuit basket, and the candidates were the wives of the respective candidates before the community for election to Parliament. Respondent appears to have bought tickets largely and distributed them among his friends to vote for his wife, and a strong supporter of the rival candidate bought and distributed largely among his friends to vote for the opposite side. Mrs. Glen appears to have had the most votes and got the biscuit basket, but who was bribed by this operation? To the minds of many this would be considered perhaps a very foolish affair, but to the demonstration it answered the purpose for which it was intended; but where was the bribery? The friends of both these ladies, or possibly the friends of their husbands, respectively, bought the tickets, but I fail to see in this any connection with the Dominion Election; in fact Dingle, the supporter of Mr. Gibbs, the treasurer of the day for the Sons of England, I think, conclusively shows this transaction to have been without any corrupt intent in connection with the election. He says:\nI was treaasurer of the day for the Sons of England. I was endeavoring to promote the interests of the society and get as much money as I could.\nTo Mr. Robinson\u2014I am sure that he told me he had been to the Roman Catholic meeting, and had returned. I think between one and two o'clock I cashed the cheque for fifty dollars; then between three and four o'clock he wanted me to cash the other cheque to patronize the Sons of England. I did cast a thousand votes at that pic-nic. I was doing it to patronize the Sons of England; we wanted to get all the money we could for them. I knew if I cast the votes for Mr. Gibbs, that Mr. Glen had borrowed money for the purpose, and he would use that money in return; he was bound to win the pitcher, and I did not care how much money he spent so long as we got a good day. My object was to make him spend as much money as I could; it was no part of my duty particularly to make Mr. Gibbs popular; I do not think I had done anything for Mr. Gibbs in the canvass; I did not know as I was doing anything improper for Mr. Gibbs at the time.\nAnd the respondent gives this account of the affair:\nA\u2014I was at the Sons of England pic-nic most of the time.\nQ\u2014What was going oh there? A\u2014A baby show, horse races, a game of cricket or lacrosse with the Indians, and a competition among the bands, an exhibition of carriage horses, and all that sort of thing, to draw.\nQ\u2014A kind of English entertainment, including a baby show? A\u2014Yes. Then there was an election between John A. and Mackenzie, for a cake basket, to be presented to the wife of the candidate who got the largest number of votes. Then there was a competition in the same way for a pitcher and two goblets between my opponent and myself, to be presented to the wife of the candidate who got the most votes. These were got up to draw a crowd there.\nQ\u2014Did that cost you a trifle? A\u2014Yes.\nQ\u2014How much did you spend? A\u2014About one hundred and seventy-five dollars.\nQ\u2014At the baby show? A\u2014Principally over the pitcher and the cake basket.\nQ\u2014I hope Mrs. Glen got the pitcher? A\u2014She did.\nQ\u2014And Mrs. Mckenzie the cake basket? A\u2014She did.\nQ\u2014What was the total vote polled? A\u2014I think 5,600, to the best of my recollection, at ten cents a vote.\nQ\u2014On the two, or on the one? A\u2014Between my opponent and myself.\nQ\u2014How much of the five hundred and sixty dollars did you contribute? A\u2014From one hundred and seventy-five to two hundred dollars.\nQ\u2014How much did the cake basket draw? A\u2014I do not remember. A good deal smaller than that.\nQ\u2014Did you contribute towards winning the cake basket? A\u2014Some.\nQ\u2014Altogether there must have been about two hundred and fifty dollars contributed by you? A\u2014I mean my own altogether from one hundred and seventy-five to two hundred dollars.\nQ\u2014Where are the Sons of England head-quarters? A\u2014I do not know.\nQ\u2014Is there any branch about the riding? A\u2014A branch in Oshawa.\nQ\u2014Has the branch been in existence long? A\u2014I think two or three years. I am not certain.\nQ\u2014Was this the first demonstration they had? A\u2014As far as I know.\nQ\u2014The first time that you spent two hundred dollars at all events? A\u2014The first thing of any extent they had.\nQ\u2014What was the object\u2014surely you were not desirous of winning the pitcher? A\u2014Well, the affair was done in the excitement of the election between Gibbs and I who should get the pitcher.\nQ\u2014Was it done to secure the good will of the Sons of England? A\u2014I had not the least idea of that. If I had thought of it in the morning that I would have spent so much that day, I would have deemed myself crazy.\nQ\u2014It was not a profitable investment? A\u2014No.\nQ\u2014It did not make much difference how you spent it. You were desirous of winning the election? A\u2014It was done in a state of excitement to win the pitcher.\nQ\u2014Are you an excitable individual? A\u2014Sometimes. The pitcher contest got very warm. It was all done in about an hour. I suppose. Nine-tenths of the money was spent in the course of an hour.\nThe respondent appears to have attended another pic-nic\nQ\u2014Was there any other Catholic pic-nic attended during the canvass? A\u2014Yes; at Duffin's Creek.\nQ\u2014That is in the constituency? A\u2014Yes.\nQ\u2014When was that held? A\u2014I think in June.\nQ\u2014Before the First of July, or after? A\u2014Before the First of July, I think.\nQ\u2014How much did you contribute there? A\u2014I took tickets on a pipe between Mr. Spink and Mr. Moodie; I think to the amount of ten or twelve dollars on the outside.\nQ\u2014Speak positive on that? A\u2014I gave two ladies four or five dollars-each to vote for me; and I think I gave one or two dollars more; and I think part I had to borrow.\nQ\u2014Who were the ladies? A\u2014Mrs. Higgins and Mrs. Donovan; she lives in Whitby; Mrs. Higgins, she is the wife of W. H. Higgins.\nQ\u2014Duffin's Creek; what parish is that in? A\u2014It is in the Township of Pickering.\nQ\u2014Who is the Priest? A\u2014Father Beausang.\nQ\u2014I suppose the result of all the liberality on your part was that you grew in favour with the Catholic body? A\u2014I cannot say whether that was the result or not.\nQ\u2014You cannot say that was the result? A\u2014I cannot say.\nQ\u2014Then, you would not swear to it as a fact? A\u2014No: I would not.\nQ.\u2014Will you tell what was your motive or object in thus spending money liberally on behalf of the Roman Catholic body at that time?\nA\u2014I do not know that I can say any particular object: to have their good-will in the first place.\nAs with the trees, so with these pic-nics, I can discover neither bribery or corruption.\nSo with reference to the subscription to a small church at Frenchman's Bay, (at the Bible Christians' meeting,) not a Catholic body, when they wanted to raise a sum of money to pay off a debt on the church. The respondent had been asked to preside at the supper; the subscriptions, he says, went a little slow, two or three appeals were made not very successfully, when, the respondent says, \"I finally started with $25 and Mr. Bunting from Duffin's Creek with $15.\" He is then asked this question:\nQ\u2014He, Bunting, was contributing to his own denomination and you were contributing to make thing go a little quicker? A\u2014The crowd began to disperse, I doubled my subscription on condition that Mr. Bunting would double his, then finally we gave a little more\u2014I gave $54 altogether\u2014the amount required was $150.\nHe is asked:\nQ\u2014I am told only eighty-six dollars were wanted at the time? A\u2014I think one hundred and fifty is the amount stated to me at the time.\nQ\u2014That was the first time you ever contributed to the Bible Christians? A\u2014I think when they built their church in Oshawa I gave something.\nQ\u2014How much? A\u2014May be twenty-five or fifty dollars; I cannot say the sum; I am not positive; it is a good many years ago; perhaps ten years ago.\nQ\u2014Within the last ten years did you contribute anything? A\u2014If I had been asked I would have, no doubt.\nQ\u2014Have you been asked? A\u2014Not that I recollect of.\nWith respect to these charges of bribing the whole constituency or any portion of it by subscriptions, &c., to charitable objects, Mr. Glen swears that for the last 10 years his charitable gifts, including his own church, would average $1000 a year, and being asked, \"Have your charities been confined to your own church at all?\" He answers, \"I never thought of my own church, except that I had more frequent applications from my own church. I never thought of confining my gifts to any one church.\" And being asked, \"You had given to the Roman Catholics before that?\" answered, \"I had. I do not think I ever refused applications from the Sisters. I think I have assisted at pic-nics or anything that has happened in the Catholic body for the past 8 or 10 years. 1 first began when Father Shea came to Oshawa. He and I were warm friends.\" And this is confirmed by Higgins, a Roman Catholic, who says he has known Glen since he came to Oshawa 16 or 17 years ago intimately. During all that time he has been very liberal to Roman Catholic objects, that was his habit; to my knowledge he has year after year given to them liberally. I know at the Catholic bazaar four years ago he contributed very liberally.\nAll the acts charged were entirely consistent with the respondent's established character for charity, generosity and liberality, and with his previous acts; these were not gifts to individual voters, they were gifts to the poor, a gift to ornament the, place where repose the dead; they were expenditures in aid of churches and expenditures at bazaars or pic-nics, by no means inconsistent with what usually takes place under similar circumstances wholly unconnected with bribery and corruption. Mr. Glen distinctly affirms that the amount expended by him in all did not exceed his usual annual expenditure, and was not in any way connected with the elections.\nGlen says:\nQ\u2014In addition to every thing you have been asked here to-day, do you know of any circumstance, any' attempt at corruption, or any corrupt act committed on your behalf by any person? A\u2014I do not.\nQ\u2014Do you believe or know of any bribery, or attempt at bribery, during the election? A\u2014I asked my friends to warn all parties against anything of the kind; and I have not heard of a single case of bribery or attempt at bribery; and I myself carefully avoided it as as far I knew the law.\nQ\u2014Was the subject of the election ever mentioned in connection with any of your gifts? [This question asked by Mr. Robinson.] A\u2014Never in the slighest degree whatever; in connection with the Rifle Association, or any of the others.\nQ\u2014Was it mentioned in connection with any of your charities? A\u2014Never mentioned or alluded to in the slightest degree whatever.\nI think, therefore, the conduct of the respondent, for years before this election, in respect to contributions to charitable and religious objects, justifies the conclusion that he was actuated by legitimate motives; rather than, that what he did was done in an illegitimate sense to influence his election. No doubt liberality of that kind would not operate unfavorably to him, but naturally the reverse, still, the fact that what he did would gain him popularity would not make that corrupt which otherwise would not be corrupt.\nIn the Windsor case[22], it was proved that respondent some long time before the election gave away \u00a3100 among his tenants, some of whom were voters and some not, and who paid him altogether about \u00a33,000 a year in rent. This money was spent in coals, beef and tea, and the respondent, on being asked, whether when he made those gifts he had in view the election for the Borough, admitted that to a certain extent he had. It was argued that the gift of this money was a corrupt act, on account of which the respondent should be unseated.\nBaron Bramwell, in his judgment, said:\nIt is certain the coming elections must have been present to his mind when he gave away those things. But there is no harm in it, if a man has a legitimate motive for doing a thing, although in addition to that he has a motive which, if it stood alone, would be an illegitimate one. He is not to refrain from doing that which he might legitimately have done, on account of the existence of this motive, which by itself would have been an illegitmate motive. If the respondent had not been an intending candidate for the Borough, and yet had done as he has done in respect to these gifts, there would have been nothing illegal in what he did, and the fact that he did intend to represent Windsor, and thought good would be done to him, and that he would gain popularity by this, does not make that corrupt which otherwise would not be corrupt at all.\nThe principle here enumerated is also applicable to the Pedlar case.\nIt is very clear there were unsettled accounts between Glen and Pedlar, in which I think it very clearly appears Glen was indebted to Pedlar, and which accounts ought to have been arranged long before. I cannot think Glen's doing what Pedlar wished, and claimed to have done wholly apart from political or election considerations, and which it was Glen's duty to do, to settle his accounts and pay his just debts, can be construed into a corrupt act of bribery, and especially so as Glen distinctly swears he never asked Pedlar's support, Pedlar never promised it, and. Glen never got it. He may have been anxious to secure Pedlar's neutrality, but both he and Hawthorn, who was instrumental in the bringing about of a settlement of the account, but who was not shewn to have been an agent of respondent as respects the election, say, that nothing was ever said to the respondent about the settlement of this account in relation to the election, and that the settlement was never hinted to him as referring to the election.\nAs regards the O'Leary case.\nIf O'Leary is to be believed, though he had been a conservative, he had made up his mind how he was going to vote before he thought of the office, and that Spinks, who it is alleged bribed him, appears to have distinctly stated to him he did not care how he voted, what he was doing for him, he was not doing it on that head at all; and being asked \"what he was doing it for?\" answered, \"Because for services rendered to him previous to that personally.\"\nSpinks says:\nHe told him he was not going to do anything that would in any way tend to affect the election. Mr. O'Leary told me then that he had never told me before that Mr. Long and him \"had made up their minds long before, after the Montreal affair, never to vote for the conservative party again, and that he was going to vote for the reform party if he voted at all.\" I told him that I wished to be very careful and to avoid everything that would in any way tend to influence a voter to change his views by offer or otherwise, as on consulting my lawyer he had told me to be careful not to do anything that would in any way affect the election. I told O'Leary that I had taken the advice of a lawyer on the matter, and he told me not to have anything to do with it, if it was going to have the effect of changing a voter's mind. I told him he might vote for Gibbs, or work for Gibbs, or anything he had a mind to, I would sign the petition all the same. I said to him I would do all I could for him in any case. He said the fact of the matter was this, that Long and he had both pledged their words to change after the Orange procession in Montreal; they would not support the conservative party hereafter. That being the case, I had no objection to sign the petition. I told him I would only do anything in the matter because I distinctly understood my doing so would have no effect on his action.\nI can find nothing in his evidence to lead me to the conclusion that Spinks was not acting bon\u00e2 fide in thus separating the transaction from the election.\nAs to the Wallace case.\nThe office, with the promise of obtaining which respondent is alleged to have been bribed, was not in existence. Wallace was not bribed, but voted for and was an active supporter of Mr. Gibbs at the election. Respondent appears to have looked on his (Wallace's) attempt to get an office created, and to which he looked forward to being appointed, rather as a joke. I can discover no evidence whatever of bribery in this case. Wallace appears to have been an active and consistent supporter of the defeated candidate throughout, and to have voted for him.\nWith respect to this, in the Windsor case[23], Bramwell, J., says:\nTo my mind a threat must be an operative threat at the time of the election, and if it were a bribe it must be an operative bribe at the time of the election. An offence might be committed, although the bribe was not operative at that time. * * * Unless you can shew that the bribery or threat is one the force of which is in existence continuing till the time of the election, although the bribe or threat which has been given or made may have subjected the parties to penalties, it is not a bribe or threat which will avoid the election.\nWe had occasion not very long ago to point out the authorities in the Privy Council and in the House of Lords, which very clearly established the position that an appellate Court ought not to be called upon, on a mere balance of evidence, to decide which side preponderates, but to procure a reversal it should be shewn that the judgment complained of in a matter of fact is entirely erroneous. It may be safely affirmed that where a Judge has had the advantage, which we have not had in this case, of hearing the evidence given, and of seeing the demeanor of the witnesses, his decision on any question of fact, as was said in Ungley v. Ungley[24], ought not to be over-ruled on slight grounds, but very strong grounds should be shown. At the same time in a proper case we must not shrink from acting upon our own view of the evidence, giving, of course, always great weight to the consideration that the demeanor and manner of the witnesses are very material elements in judging of their credibility, bearing also in mind that when the question of fact is as to the effect of the facts proved in raising inferences of fact the rule does not apply; and bearing in mind the principles laid down in the Mallow case[25], which commend themselves to my mind as just and reasonable, and which are thus stated by the learned Judge:\nI have desired to apply two rules to work out my judgment. They are shortly these:\u2014First, that I should be sure, very sure, before I come to a decision adverse to any party where his character or credit is involved. Secondly, that offers or conversations unaccompanied by any acts should be much more strongly proved in evidence than where some definite act has followed the alleged offer or conversation.\nNow, in reference to the Dingle case.\nThe learned Judge who tried the petition says as to No. 37, and the promise of procuring an office for his son, and No. 6, the promise of a contract for himself if he would support the respondent:\nThese two charges may be considered together, and if the evidence given by Dingle himself be accepted as true, they might be considered as proved, but he is contradicted in every particular.\nI have read with a great deal of care the evidence, and I find this party contradicted by no less than six witnesses, and on so many different and material statements, that I should think it presumptuous were I to overrule the finding of the learned Judge on the questions of fact to which these contradictions refer, he having had the opportunity of seeing and hearing the witnesses, and therefore so much better qualified to form a correct opinion as to their credibility.\nAs to the office for the son.\nThough opposed in politics, the respondent appears to have been on very friendly terms with Dingle, and to have befriended him on previous occasions. Mr. Garvin, a brother-in-law of Dingle, who applied to respondent, as he says, at the request of Dingle, says:\nQ\u2014Mr. Dingle had requested you to interest yourself with Mr. Glen; to get him to use his influence to get a position for his son? A\u2014I urged the appointment of Mr. Dingle's son to a position very strongly.\nQ\u2014What did Mr. Glen say? A\u2014He said he had done everything in his power for Dingle in contracts and otherwise, and would continue to do so irrespective of politics; he said, I cannot make promises to Dingle in view of the election, because it would be used against me. In regard to the election, I said to Mr. Glen, that nothing I said to him must be taken with respect to the elections. He promised to interest himself on behalf of the young man; he declined to make a promise of getting him a situation; he said he would do what he could for him on personal grounds.\nGlen says:\nI never asked or authorized Mr. Garvin to speak or write to Mr. Dingle about getting an office for his son. I told Garvin I had always been friendly towards Mr. Dingle; I had been friendly in a number of ways. I was instrumental in securing him the contract for building the Oshawa Stove Works; the wood-work for the Mason's Company's Works; I also gave him the contract for our own extension some-time ago,; I was his security in building the town hall; and I also offered to be his security for the building of the additions to the Agricultural College near Guelph. That is what I referred to when speaking to Mr. Garvin.\nAs to the contract.\nMr. Glen spoke no doubt to Dingle about estimating and contracting for the work of a factory Glen was about erecting, but I fail to discover a trace in the evidence, apart from the evidence of Dingle, of a bribe to Dingle by promise of a contract to vote or abstain from voting at the election. So far from Dingle being bribed, Glen gave the contract to another party, and Dingle not only voted, but used every exertion against Glen at the election, and when we have the statement of Glen: \"I never spoke to Dingle about his support in connection with this contract at all. I may have asked him to support me. I never spoke of his support in reference to this contract,\" and the statement of a witness, apparently disinterested, that Dingle stated to one Hurst that \"Glen never offered him or his son any office, either in a bank or any other place\"; and when by another witness, it was remarked to him, \"Glen wants you to vote for him, Dingle replied no; he never asked me to vote for him, he knows which way I go, only he does not want me to do anything against him\"; and again to another, \"if Glen had acted the gentleman with me, and done the work as he agreed to do, he could not have expected me but to vote against him, but I would not have done any more than that; he could not expect me but that I would vote against him, give my silent vote against him\"; and the many other contradictions as to the contract ever having been promised him at all; all these circumstances, taken in connection with the proved and not contradicted statements as to the openly declared desire of respondent, that nothing should be done to jeopardize the election, and which I can discover nothing in the evidence to lead me to suppose was merely simulated, and not with the intention they should be acted on, I cannot conceive it possible that any Court would with propriety say the Judge who saw all the witnesses and heard the evidence from their own mouths did wrong in refusing to give credence to a witness so discredited, or that we can say all these parties should be disbelieved, and the statements of this witness credited. Independent of this, taking the whole evidence together and considering all the surrounding circumstances, I think, so far from saying the Judge was wrong, we ought to arrive at a similar conclusion.\nI note the following cases as bearing on the points raised:\nIn the Lichfield case[26], the alleged bribery was of one Barlow, whom petitioners alleged to have been bribed by a promise of a place in a hospital. Willes, J., says:\nTo prove a corrupt promise, as good evidence is required of the promise illegally made as would be required if the promise were a legal one to sustain an action by Barlow against the respondent upon Barlow voting for him for not procuring or trying to procure him a place in the hospital.\nAnd in the same case, as to one Baxter, who had been in the employment of an agent of respondent and had left in consequence of a dispute and was anxious to get back, the Judge says:\nAn insensible influence existed in consequence of this upon the mind of Baxter at the time when Baxter voted for respondent. Baxter was taken into Symonds' employment very soon after the election, and it was proved that Symonds would not, or probably might not, have taken Baxter back unless he so voted. That does not prejudice the decision of the case. But it was not proved that Symonds made any express promise to Baxter to do so, it was left to inference amounting to suspicion only, and upon such inference and suspicion I must decline to act for the purpose of defeating the election.\nIn the Wigan case[27], Baron Martin says:\nIf I am satisfied that the candidates intended honestly to comply with the law and meant to obey it, and that they themselves did no act contrary to the law, their desire and object being that the proceedings in reference to the election should be pure and honest, I will not unseat such persons upon the supposed act of an agent unless the act is established to my entire satisfaction. And in the Westminster case[28], he says:\nI think I am justified, when I am about to apply such a law, in requiring to be satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the act of bribery was done, and that unless the proof is strong and cogent, I should say very strong and very cogent, it ought not to affect the seat of an honest and well intentioned man by the act of a third person * * * I should require to be satisfied and certain that there could be no mistake with reference to the alleged act.\nIn the Penryn case[29] it was submitted, that, what was said to the voter, as to the respondent getting him employment, did amount to a promise to him conditional upon his voting for the respondent. As to this Willes, J., says he must not make the vote a condition of giving employment:\nBut the employment of persons to do work must go on in election times as well as others, the affairs of life cannot be brought to a standstill. If you have a sum of money or a benefit, for which nothing is returned, conferred upon a voter, you have a tangible case which cannot be explained away by saying \"I did it, and I had no particular reason for it.\" You have then a case in which a member or his agent must be called upon to give an account of what they meant and to show satisfactorily that that which prima facie was giving a benefit to a person which might have the effect of inducing him to vote for the member was really done with some other and innocent motive. I am clear that where an unfavorable inference is to be drawn from the fact that some person has been employed, one ought to become quite sure that there is something more than merely getting the man's work for that which is the real equivalent for the man's work.\n[The Chief Justice then referred orally to the case of the loan of a steam thresher to one Farewell, and stated that the loan of this machine had taken place in the ordinary course of Mr. Glen's business, as president of the Hall Manu'f Co., as an advertisement. The reasons which he had given for his decision in the other cases applied with equal force to the present case. He did not think the evidence on this charge of such a nature as to warrant a reversal of the judgment of the Court below.]\nSTRONG and FOURNIER, J. J., concurred. HENRY J.:\u2014\nThe respondent in this case was a successful candidate at the election to the House of Commons for the electoral district of the South Riding of the County of Ontario, holden on the 17th of September 1878, and the appellant was a petitioner against his election and return. The petition contained charges of bribery to the number of 53, as given in the particulars, and other corrupt practices, against the respondent and his agents, and several others were subsequently added. The petition was tried before Mr. Justice Galt, who gave judgment for the respondent, and from that judgment it has come by appeal to this Court. In all cases of doubt or uncertainty it is the province of the presiding judge, exercising at the time also the functions of a jury, to decide; and where there are doubts arising from conflict of testimony, or otherwise, we would be almost bound to uphold his decision. It is only in cases where the law is not administered, or the evidence misinterpreted, or insufficient effect manifestly given to the weight of it, that we should in any case interfere Bearing such in mind, we must reverse his finding only where misapprehension of the law or evidence has clearly existed. There is no charge of effective or consummated bribery alleged to have been proved either by the respondent or his agents. What, however, amounts to the same thing in law, attempts to influence voters by promises and payments of money, and otherwise, are charged. The rule with respect to such charges by Baron Martin in the Cheltenham case[30] having been adopted and acted upon by other judges in England and Ireland, is, I think, a safe one for our guidance.\nHe said:\nWhere the evidence as to bribery consists merely of offers or proposals to bribe, the evidence required should be stronger than that with respect to bribery itself or where the alleged bribing is an offer of employment * * * it ought to be made out beyond all doubt, because where two people are talking of a thing which is not carried out, it may be that they honestly give their evidence; but one person understands what is said by' another differently from what he intends it.\nMr. Justice Willes in the Coventry case[31] says substantially the same thing. Speaking of such an offer or proposal to bribe, he says:\nIt is a legal offence, although these cases have been spoken of as being an inferior class by reason of the difficulty of proof by the possibility of people being mistaken in their accounts of conversation in which offers were made, whereas there can be made no mistake as to the actual payment of money.\nMr. Justice Morris in the Mallow case[32] said:\nI have desired to apply two rules to work out my judgment by. They are shortly these: First.\u2014That I should be sure, very sure, before I come to a decision adverse to any party where his character or credit is involved. Secondly.\u2014That offers or conversations unaccompanied by any acts should be much more strongly proved in evidence than where some clear definite act has followed the alleged offer or conversation.\nThese citations, copied from the judgment of Mr. Justice Galt, show, as I think, most properly, his adoption of the principles announced in them. They were applicable to the case, and I entirely approve of his decision which gave effect to them.\nThere is another important consideration which, in the case of a charge of individual bribery by offers or proposals, should not be lost sight of. Where there is no reasonable ground from the evidence to conclude there was anything like general bribery by the expenditure of large sums of money or otherwise at the election, the proof of individual bribery by promises should be stronger than where the opposite is the case. As regards the respondent, there is no evidence of such a character, and therefore not the same reason to suppose that in reference to some of the cases he was simulating innocence, when in reality he intended a violation of the law. If therefore the evidence rebuts the idea of general illegal or improper conduct of the election, and shows general propriety of conduct, the evidence of bribery by an offer or proposal should be proportionately clear and undoubted. The presiding judge finds specifically \"that corrupt practices have not, nor is there reason to believe that corrupt practices have, extensively prevailed at the election.\"\nBefore considering the only cases to which I think it is necessary specially to refer, I may say, that I can find nothing objectionable in the judgment, either as to the law or in respect of the evidence given on the trial. The onus of proof was on the appellant, and he was required to give such positive or circumstantial proof as would leave no reasonable doubt of the guilt of the respondent or his agents of one or other of the offences known to the law and charged against him or them. If reasonable doubts remain as the result of the whole evidence, the respondent is entitled to our judgment sustaining, as it will do, that of the learned judge at the trial. And we must arrive at our decision, after making proper allowance for the weight that should always be given to conclusions arrived at from the evidence by the presiding judge. The credibility of the witnesses is a matter solely, in the first place at all events, with him. If apparently he had reason to disbelieve a witness, it is not for us to correct an alleged error on his part, unless indeed it be a very gross one.\nKeeping these views before me, I will briefly refer to the several cases urged upon our attention.\nIn the particulars, from number 44 to 52, the respondent is charged with corruptly giving personally, or by his agents, various sums to charitable or other institutions and societies, public and private, and to religious bodies and associations sums of money or other valuable considerations, to induce members of such institutions, societies, religious bodies and associations \"and others, generally, to vote or to refrain from voting at the said election.\" Some of the sums are alleged and shown to have been given some months before the respondent was declared a candidate, the others afterwards, but the most of the latter over two months before the election, and two during the canvass. The offence, as charged in the alternative, constitutes in substance two distinct ones, and should not have been so charged. It is an offence to give money to induce a party to vote for a party, but it is a totally different one if the object was to induce the party to abstain from voting.\nIt is in the nature of a criminal charge; for the accused party is subject to be indicted and disqualified. It is contrary to every principle of pleading to include in that way the two offences. A count in an indictment or criminal information so framed would be bad in law, and no judgment could be rendered on it. The verdict in such cases is either to find the accused \"guilty or not guilty\" of the charge in one or more counts. With a verdict, of guilty on a count charging two different offences the court could not deal, for it could not say he was guilty of the two offences by the one act of giving one sum of money which are inconsistent the one with the other. It could not be given to induce a man to vote and at the same time to abstain from voting. Taking then the petition with the particulars subsequently given, no one could say which offence was charged. The appellant had, however, on the trial the benefit of this improper way of stating the charges, which he would not have had if proper means had been taken to require the petitioner to have made his election, or at all events to have stated positively each offence as a separate and distinct charge. The petition is general and merely alleges that the respondent \"before, during, and after the election, was by himself and his agents guilty of corrupt practices within the meaning of that expression as defined by section of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, 1874, and by the Dominion Elections Act, 1874, and the common law of parliament.\"\nIt therefore contains no specific charge. A man might as correctly be tried under an indictment charging him with \"a malicious injury\" under the statutes, naming them, without particularising any one of the numerous offences called malicious injuries created by the several sections of them. Looking then at the particulars we will see they are equally defective. There is in the heading of them. \"Name of person bribing.\" \"Name of person bribed,\" \"Time,\" \"Place\" and \"Nature.\" All the necessary information is given under each heading but the last; and when we look under the heading \"Nature\" we find only a statement of what was alleged to have been given or promised, but nothing to shew whether in any one case the money or promise was given or promised, so as to bring the case within any one of the numerous cases of accomplished bribery or offer, or proposal to bribe, or what the corrupt object was in giving the money or making the offer or proposal, The respondent is not informed, because no particular offence is charged, and he does not therefore know, whether he has to meet a case of bribery at common law or under the statutes, or whether he has to meet a charge of accomplished bribery, and if so, what the nature of it is, or in case of promises merely, to whom they were made or the object of them, whether to induce the party to whom or on whose behalf they were made to vote, or to abstain from voting, or whether he is charged with corruptly doing any of the alleged acts, on account of the voter having voted, or refrained from voting. To constitute an offence, the statute prescribes and requires that in the one case the object must be \"in order to induce any voter to vote or refrain from voting,\" and in the other \"on account of such voter having voted or refrained from voting.\" By the prohibition\nEvery person who directly or indirectly gives, lends, or agrees to give, or lend, or offers, or promises any money or valuable consideration, or promises or endeavours to procure any money or valuable consideration, to or for any voter, or to or for any person on behalf of any voter, or to or for any person, in order to induce him, &c.\nWe have under the heading as to many of the cases simply and solely the word \"money,\" to others the words \"promise to procure office,\" to others the word \"work,\" and besides others, not necessary to be stated, to one, the word \"unknown.\" How then, having only the petition and particulars to direct him, could any one know which of the numerous offences he was charged with, and be prepared to meet, or how could any judge say what issue he was to try? The term \"bribery\" has a technical meaning, but that term is not used in the petition, and the term used \"guilty of corrupt practice\" is no more definite, sufficient, or intelligible, than the \"guilty of a criminal act\" would be in an indictment. As I have already shown, the \"particulars\" are no more explicit than the petition; which then of the numerous statutable or common law offences is the respondent notified to meet? To ascertain what an issue is we are to be informed and guided by the record. If that furnishes no evidence of one, there is nothing to try. The practice is not so technical in the election cases as in ordinary ones, but still, before a petitioner can expect a court to unseat a member prima facie legally returned, he should allege some one or more specific offences which under the statutes or common law would be sufficient to unseat or disqualify him, or both, otherwise his complaint amounts to nothing tangible, and there would be no jurisdiction for inquiry. A judge is authorized by the statute to investigate a complaint of any one or more specific offences, either by statute or common law, but if none such is alleged, he has no power or jurisdiction. Here neither the petition, nor the particulars, separately or unitedly, have formulated a charge of the commission of any one of such specific offences. It may however be urged, that if the particulars were defective the respondent might have caused them to be amended. Admitting that he might, was he bound to do so? I think not. If a plaintiff serves a declaration so defective that no material issue can be taken thereon, with or without sufficient particulars, the defendent is not bound to demur, but may take advantage thereof at the trial; as it is only on material and proper issues that a judgment can be regularly founded.\nA judge in an election case has a prescribed and special jurisdiction and can only try the specific offences created. I am therefore strongly inclined to the opinion, that for the reasons I have given there was strictly no jurisdiction in this case, and therefore that our judgment should be based on that conclusion. If the judgment appealed from had been against the respondent I think it would for that reason be liable to be reversed; but as it is in his favor, if I am correct as to the position taken, all that would be necessary would be to confirm it.\nI will, however, refer to the cases relied upon by the appellant.\nThe charges as in the particulars, from number 44 to 52 inclusive, are for monies given to societies, associations and religious bodies. The record does not shew how the gifts were intended to operate, whether to induce the parties interested in the gifts to vote or to abstain from voting, and the evidence gives us no information on the point. I cannot therefore by my judgment convict the respondent in the alternative and disqualify him under the statute.\nBut, apart from that consideration, is the evidence such as to sustain either case? It is not contended that the gifts produced any improper results and there is no evidence to sustain such a position, if taken. It must therefore (if anything) be not for accomplished bribery, but for the attempt to commit it by gifts of money or otherwise. It is well settled, that an election may be illegal by general distributions of money at or shortly before an election, or indeed at any previous time, if made for any of the objects forbidden by law. Several elections have been set aside in England for such a corrupt practice. Improper influences which prevent unrestrained expression of the voters' wishes, if operating so largely that a free election cannot be said to have taken place, have been in many cases; in England the grounds for avoiding an election. It has not, however, been decided, that a man, who entertains an idea that he may possibly be a candidate at an election subsequently to take place, shall immediately cease and desist from giving aid to public or charitable bodies or associations, as he had been in the habit previously of doing. Some of the charges refer to cases several months before the respondent had been decided upon as a candidate, and the donations made in those cases arc not necessarily presumed to have been from corrupt motives. He was himself the only witness examined in proof of those charges. He gives the details as to them and positively negatives the charge of corrupt motive. He proves he had previously for some years expended annually in much the same way as large an amount. He is a pretty extensive manufacturer, and such persons not unfrequently are found, from benevolent feelings or policy in regard to their business, to do as the respondent alleges he was in the habit of doing, irrespective of political results, and the law is not so unreasonable as to oblige a man, who intends to be a candidate at an election to stay his hand in such cases. He is not certainly to use money to secure or aid in his election, but he is not required to injure his prospects by withdrawing the usual support or aid to such benevolent or public objects he would be expected under ordinary circumstances to afford. I think the evidence shows little, if at all, beyond his accustomed gifts to the same and similar objects. The learned Judge who tried the case was of the opinion that the circumstances did not show general bribery or corruption, and I am of the opinion, that according to the current controlling authorities, it would be wrong for this Court to interfere with his decision.\nNo. 53 I think is of the same character.\nCharge No. 9 of particulars is for bribery of Louis O'Leary by John Spink as agent of respondent.\nThe result of the evidence is, that shortly before the respondent became a candidate, and about five months before the election, a situation in the Custom House near the residence of O'Leary, became vacant. O'Leary, who had been a warm supporter of Spink when recently a candidate as a municipal officer, applied to the latter to aid him in getting the office, which he did. It is shown they were warm personal friends, and they both swear that the matter of the election had nothing to do with Spink's aid towards getting him the office, and that the election was not spoken of. O'Leary, however, volunteered to tell Spink he had made up his mind for other reasons to vote for the respondent. He swears such was the case, and I don't think we are required to say his statement was untrue. There is no evidence, in my opinion, of any corrupt practice in this case.\nThe gravamen of the charge is not in mere giving, but giving with the alleged corrupt intent. The corrupt intent is necessary to be sustained by proof either of a positive or of a necessarily inferential character. If nothing is said to base the act upon a promise in regard to the election (and none is shown in this case), it is only from all the surrounding circumstances a judgment is to be formed. The principle upheld in English cases and in this Court is, that if an act be done by a party, either a candidate or an agent, which from the evidence is capable of two constructions, one, that it was stimulated by a friendly feeling alone, and the other that it was corruptly done, the conclusion should be in favor of the former, and that the charge of corrupt motive is not necessarily inferred. There is nothing in the evidence before us to prove that what was done would not have been done were no election in prospect or taking place. The petitioner was bound to prove the corrupt motive, but he cannot do so by proving an act not necessarily improper.\nThese observations apply to all the remaining cases.\nIn respect to Pedlar's case, there is no evidence to prove an illegal or corrupt act. It is quite true that in the payment of a legal debt, bribery may be committed. If at one time disputed, but subsequently at an election, or in view of one, a party who is a candidate or agent makes an agreement which is carried out on condition that the party shall vote for the candidate or abstain from voting, I have no doubt it would be a corrupt practice, whether the party voted or refrained from voting as agreed upon. The party here was paid, but there is no proof of an illegal compact. He employed Hawthorne as his agent to collect the debt, and not then feeling personally friendly to Mr. Gibbs, he told Hawthorne, that if the respondent settled the claim he might promise what he pleased about the election. Hawthorne and the respondent both positively swear this remark of Pedlar was not communicated to the respondent, and that the account was settled without any reference to the election. There is no law that I can find to justify us in saying a corrupt practice of any kind was proved. Pedlar never ceased to oppose the respondent and use his influence against him. If indeed he had changed, had left his political party and voted for the respondent, there might have been some reason to contend that, altho' not shown, there was some secret and implied agreement between the parties. Nothing of the kind could be contended here, for Pedlar would, I presume, have been quite willing to say so if he could have truthfully done so. Whatever motive actuated the respondent, we have only to deal with the charge of a corrupt one. It is sufficient to say that the proof of such is entirely insufficient. Every one is presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty. Here, without proof, we are asked to assume guilt.\nIn the alleged charge of corrupt practices in respect of Dingle: 1st. By promise of office for his son, and 2nd. By promise of a contract.\nThese two charges were attempted to be sustained by the testimony principally of Dingle himself. In his important statements he is contradicted by several witnesses to such an extent that the learned Judge who heard the several witnesses places little reliance on his statements. He was evidently much incensed against the respondent, who gave the contract alleged to have been promised to him to another party before the election, and exhibited vindictive feelings against him. It was shown, that the respondent on several previous occasions had largely befriended him, although they were politically opposed to each other. The respondent, however denies the statements,, made by Dingle, and the surrounding circumstances, and the testimony of others, go largely to sustain the statements of the respondent. Under the whole of the circumstances, I feel bound to sustain the finding of the learned Judge, that as to the alleged corrupt offer of the contract the case was not proved.\nThen, as to the promise of office for his son, the particulars state the charge: \"Promise of office for son.\"\nThe statutory provision for the \"prevention of corrupt practices\" at elections, under which this charge is made, is contained in sub-section two of section 92, of the Dominion Elections Act of 1874.\nThe 92 section, which relates to this charge, provides that \"the following persons shall be guilty of bribery and shall be punished accordingly,\" and sub-section 2 is as follows:\nEvery person who directly or indirectly, by himself or by any other person on his behalf, gives or procures, or agrees to give or procure, or offers, or promises any office, place or employment, or promises to procure, or to endeavor to procure any office, place or employment, to or for any voter, or to or for any other person, in order to induce such voter to vote or refrain from voting, &c.\nOf the several offences created by that section, the one charged against the respondent is, as before stated, \"promise of office for son.\" It is not a charge that he gave or procured the office, but that he agreed, or promised, or offered to give the office. It is not that the respondent promised to procure or to endeavor to procure the office. Each is created a separate and distinct offence, and the charge must be proved as alleged. The interpretation of the provision I take to be, that the terms \"gives,\" \"agrees to give,\" \"offers,\" or \"promises\" any office, refer to an office in the gift or at the disposal or under the control of the party himself, but the terms \"agrees to procure,\" promise to procure,\" \"or to endeavor to procure,\" refer to an office in the gift or at the disposal or under the control of some other person or persons. The statute, then, having made a plain and palpable distinction, the charge of a corrupt practice by the promise of an office for his son must be held to be some office in the gift or at the disposal of the party charged, and is not sustained by proof of a promise to procure or endeavor to procure an office in the gift or at the disposal of another. Taking, then, the evidence given by Dingle to the fullest extent, it makes out, not the case charged, but one essentially different, if an offence at all. The statute, in my view, points to some specific office, place, or employment to be stated and understood by the parties, or in the alternative to certain ones stated. I am therefore inclined to think, that some one or more specific office or offices, &c., should be stated and referred to, and that it should be so stated in the particulars if called for.\nThe evidence, however, does not reach the point in another aspect. The alternative in the provision is \"in order to induce any voter to vote or to abstain from voting.\" Taking the whole evidence together, the conclusion I would draw from it amounts to this: Dingle was an active and energetic supporter of the party opposed to the respondent, and Mr. Gibbs ranks him amongst his leading supporters. There was a misunderstanding between him and Dingle, Pedlar and others of his leading supporters, at a recent municipal election, and it would appear that knowing this the respondent may be assumed to have hoped, not to get their support, or that they would not vote for Mr. Gibbs, but that Dingle might be induced to moderate his opposition to him and his exertions for Mr. Gibbs. That is, I think, the reasonable deduction from the evidence, and, if so, any thing said or done by the resdondent was neither to induce Dingle to vote for him or to refrain from voting for his opponent. He has not therefore, in my opinion, been shown to be amenable to any provisions of the statute, and after diligent search I can find no other law under which his seat could be vacated or a charge for bribery or corruption successfully made against him.\nI have applied the principles I have enunciated to the remaining cases, and I see no reason to differ from the learned Judge who tried the petition, in the conclusions at which he arrived in respect to them and the whole of the others to which I have particularly referred.\nMr. Gibbs in his evidence, so far from suggesting bribery or corrupt practices on the part of the respondent, uses this language:\nI attribute my defeat at the last election to two causes. First, a misunderstanding between myself and my leading supporters in my own town. This has been alluded to several times during the progress of this trial. Pedlar, Dingle, Thomas and others of my leading supporters, owing to some misunderstanding at the previous municipal election. This caused a considerable coolness towards me. This influenced the election to a considerable extent. The other cause to which I attributed my defeat is the defection of the Roman Catholic vote.\nFrom that and other reliable evidence we may fairly assume, that there was nothing like general bribery or corruption. That the election was generally fairly conducted, and that position of affairs calls for stronger and more unequivocal proof of a corrupt motive in reference to the matters with which the respondent is specifically charged.\nI think the conclusions of the learned Judge were right, and therefore that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nWhen so many learned Judges have concurred in acquitting the respondent of all conduct impeachable as corrupt within the meaning of the Act, I cannot but feel great distrust in my own judgment, which compels me to say that the matter has not struck my mind in the same light. In my mind, I confess it has appeared, that the Statute is less potent than I had taken it to be to prevent corrupt practices at elections, if some of the transactions complained of, and which the respondent himself admits, are to be regarded as unobjectionable and not within the prohibitory provisions of the Act.

J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, J. J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nPetition of Right\u2014Demurrer\u20149 Vic., c. 37\u2014Right of the Crown to plead prescription\u201410 years prescription\u2014Good faith\u2014Translatory title\u2014Judgment of confirmation\u2014Inscription en faux\u2014Improvements, claim for by incidental demand\u2014Arts. 2211, 2251, 2206, C. C. (L. O.); Art. 473, C. P. C. (L. C)\nN. C., the suppliant, by his petition of right, claimed, as representing the heirs of P. W. Jr., certain parcels of land originally granted by Letters Patent from the Crown, dated 5th January, 1806, to P. W. Senr., together with a sum of $200,000 for the rents, issues and profits derived therefrom by the Government since the illegal detention thereof.\nThe Crown pleaded to this petition of right\u20141st, by demurrer, defense au fonds en droit, alleging that the description of the limits and position of the property claimed was insufficient in law; 2nd, that the conclusions of the petition were insufficient and vague; 3rd, that in so far as respects the rents, issues, and profits, there had been no signification to the Government of the gifts or transfers made by the heirs to the suppliants.\nThese demurrers were dismissed by Strong, J., and it was Held, That the objection taken should have been pleaded by exception \u00e0 la forme, pursuant to art. 116 C. C. P., and as the demurrer was to all the rents, issues and profits as well those before as those since the transfer, it was too large and should be dismissed, even supposing notification of the transfer necessary with respect to rents, issues and profits accrued previous to the sale to him by the heirs of P. W. Jr.\nThis judgment was not appealed against. As to the merits the defendant pleaded\u20141st. By pre-emptory exception, setting up title and possession in Her Majesty under divers deeds of sale and documents; 2nd. Prescription by 30, 20 and 10 years. An exception was also fyled, setting up that these transfers to petitioner by the heirs of P. W. Jr. were made without valid consideration, and that the rights alleged to have been acquired were disputable, droits litigieux. The general issue and a supplementary plea claiming value of improvements were also fyled.\nTo first of these exceptions the petitioner answered that the parties to the deeds of sale relied upon had no right of property in the land sold, and denied the legality and validity of the other documents relied upon, and inscribed en faux against a judgment of ratification of title to a part of the property rendered by the Superior Court for the district of Aylmer, P. Q. To the exception of prescription the petitioner answered, denying the allegations thereof, and more particularly the good faith of the defendant. To the supplementary plea, the petitioner alleged bad faith on the part of defendant. There were also general answers to all the pleas.\nOn the issues thus raised, the parties went to proof by an enqu\u00eale had before a Commissioner under authority of the Court, granted on motion, in accordance with the law of the Province of Quebec.\nThe case was argued in the Exchequer Court before J. T. Taschereau, J., and he dismissed the suppliant's petition of right with costs. Whereupon the suppliant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld, (Fournier and Henry, J. J., dissenting.) 1. That before the Code, and also under the Code (art. 2211), the Crown had, under the laws in force in the Province of Quebec, the right to invoke prescription against a subject, which the latter could have interrupted by petition of right.\n2. That in this case the Crown had purchased in good faith with translatory titles, and had, by ten years peaceable, open and uninterrupted possession, acquired an unimpeachable title.\n3. That in relation to the Inscription en faux, the Art. 473 of the Code of Procedure is not so imperative as to render the judgment attacked an absolute nullity, it being registered in the Register of the Court.\n4. That the petitioner was bound to have produced the minute, or draft of judgment attacked, but having only produced a certified copy of the judgment, the inscription against the judgment falls to the ground.\n5. That even if S. O's title was un titre pr\u00e9caire, the heirs by their own acts ceded and abandoned to L. all their rights and pretensions to the land in dispute, and that the petitioner C. was bound by their acts.\nHeld, also, That the impenses claimed by the incidental demande of the Crown were payable by the petitioner, even if he had succeeded in his action.\nPer H. E. Taschereau and Gwynne, J.J., That a deed, taken under 9 Vic., c. 37, sec. 17, before a notary (though not under the seal of the Commissioners) from a person in possession, which was subsequently confirmed by a judgment of ratification of a Superior Court, was a valid deed, that all rights of property were purged, and that if any of the auteurs of the petitioner failed to urge their rights on the monies deposited by reason of the customary dower, the ratification of the title was none the less valid.\nAppeal from a judgment rendered by Mr. Justice J. T. Taschereau in the Exchequer Court of Canada, dismissing appellant's petition of right with costs.\nThe suppliant, as representing the heirs of one Philemon Wright Jr., by his petition of right, claimed from Her Majesty certain parcels of lands forming part of lots Nos. 2 and 3 in the 5th range of Hull, held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada, and including portion of the works, booms and canals, known as the Gatineau works, and demanded $200,000 for rents, issues and profits derived therefrom by the Government since their illegal detention thereof. The petition set up Letters Patent from the Crown to Philemon Wright Senr., a transfer from Philemon Wright Senr. to Philemon Wright Jr.; the marriage of Philemon Wright Jr. to Sally Olmstead without marriage contract; the death of Philemon Wright Jr., in Dec, 1821, leaving 8 children, issue of his marriage with Sally Olmstead; the right of dower in the widow, called customary dower, consisting in the usufruct for the wife and ownership for the children, after death of the husband, of the real estate held by Philemon Wright Jr., at the time of his marriage with Sally Olmstead; and the donations and transfers by the children of Philemon Wright Jr. to the suppliant, executed in favor of the suppliant after the death in 1871 of their mother, who, subsequent to the death of Philemon Wright Jr., had married one Nicholas Sparks.\nThe crown pleaded to this petition of right: 1st, by demurrer, defense en droit, because the petition failed to describe by a clear and intelligible description the limits and position of the lots in question, as in the possession of Her Majesty; and, also, because the petition was insufficient in law in so far as the petitioner had failed to allege any signification to Her Majesty of the deeds of gift or transfer in virtue of which he chimed the said property and said rents, issues and profits, which he estimated to amount to $200,000.\nThese demurrers were argued before Strong, J., and the following judgment was rendered, and was not appealed from:\u2014\n\"The Court having heard the parties on the demurrers by the said defendant firstly, secondly and thirdly pleaded. Considering that as to the said demurrer in the cause firstly pleaded the objection thereby taken to the petition, should, pursuant to article 116 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Province of Quebec, have been taken and set forth by way of exception to the form of the petition, and not by way of demurrer. And considering further, that the position, boundaries and extent of the land of which the petitioner prays to be declared proprietor are set forth with sufficient certainty and particularity in the petition, doth dismiss the said demurrer first pleaded with costs, distraits to the Attorney for the said petitioner.\n\"And considering, with respect to the demurrer in this case by the said defendant secondly pleaded, that the said second demurrer is addressed to the whole of the petitioner's claim to the rents, issues and profits of the lands in the petition mentioned, and that by virtue of article 1,498 of the Civil Code of the Province of Quebec, the petitioner is entitled to recover so much of the said rents, issues and profits as have accrued since the sale and transfer to him the petitioner as alleged, without shewing any notice or signification to have been made of the said deeds of sale, and transfer to the Crown or its officers, whereby it appears that, assuming the pretention of the defendant to be right as regards the rents, issues and profits, accrued prior to the date of the said deeds of sale and transfer, the conclusion of the said second demurrer is too large, and covers a portion of the petitioner's conclusions in respect of which he is entitled to recover, doth dismiss the said demurrer secondly pleaded with costs, distraits to the Attorney for the petitioner.\n\"And as to the demurrer in this cause thirdly pleaded, considering that the grounds of the said demurrer are the same as those severally comprised in the first and second demurrers, for the reasons already given as to the first and second demurrers doth dismiss the said demurrer so thirdly pleaded with costs, distraits to the Attorney for the said petitioner.\"\nAs to the merits the defendant pleaded\u20141st. Prescription by 30 and 20 years; 2nd. Prescription by 10 years; 3rd. By exception, setting up title and possession in Her Majesty under divers deeds of sale and documents to the Crown, the deeds relied upon being a notarial deed from Sally Olmstead, 12th Sept., 1849, to Her Majesty, of 21 acres, 1 rood and 25 perches of the property claimed by suppliant; two notarial deeds by one Andrew Leamy et ux., dated respectively 27th March, 1854, and 7th May, 1855, of 65 acres and 2 perches of the property, and a deed of sale and quit claim, dated 3rd Feb., 1853, and registered after the fiat was granted, alleged to have been executed by some of the heirs in favor of Leamy; 4th. By exception, alleging that by 9 Vic., c. 37, the Commissioners of Public Works were authorized to take possession of the lands and water-courses necessary, in their judgment, for the construction of Public Works, and to contract and agree with all persons, guardians, tutors, &c., and all such contracts and agreements, and all conveyances and other instruments made in pursuance thereof, were declared to be valid and effectual to all intents and purposes whatever, and provision was thereby made for the payment of the compensation to be paid for such land and waters, to the owner and owners, occupier or occupiers thereof; that in conformity with said statute, and the law in force in that behalf, the said Commissioners of Public Works caused the said titles or conveyances to Her Majesty the Queen to be deposited with the Prothonotary of the Superior Court, in the District of Ottawa, said Court representing the Court of Queen's Bench, and fully complied with all and every the requirements of said statute and of law, in order to obtain the confirmation of said several deeds or conveyances; and that by judgments in due form of law, rendered in said Court, and now in full force and effect, the said titles and conveyance were confirmed and the claims of the persons under whom petitioner set up title were thereby barred.\nAn exception was also fyled, setting up that the donations to petitioner were made without legal and valid consideration, and by concert and collusion with the donors and with knowledge of the titles and possessions of the Crown, and that the rights alleged to have been acquired by the donations were uncertain, disputed, and disputable, droits litigieux. A defense en fait, or general issue, was also fyled.\nThe answers to the pleas of prescription denied that Her Majesty the Queen and her auteurs had been in possession, use and occupation of the land in said petition mentioned, peaceably, openly, uninterruptedly, and in good faith, and with good and sufficient title, and alleged specially that Sally Olmstead had no right to convey the property referred to, having only a usufruct; that the judgments of ratification could not affect the rights of the real owners; that the judgment of confirmation had been entered in the Register from a pretended draft of judgment illegally made, and signed by the Prothonotary, and was null and void; and that Leamy had only an usufructuary possession derived from Sally Olmstead.\nA motion for an Inscription en faux was made by petitioner against the judgment of ratification of title and against the draft of the judgment, and also against the register in which the judgment was registered.\nAn incidental demande was put in on behalf of the Crown, setting up that improvements had been made on the property since the occupation by defendants, and that the value of these improvements should be set off pro tanto against any rents or revenues.\nIssue was joined on this incidental demande, and an admission given as to certain improvements having been made. And the incidental demande came up for hearing with the merits of the case.\nThe other allegations of fact in the pleadings and the oral and documentary evidence given at the trial, sufficiently appear in the judgments hereinafter given.\nThe case was argued on the merits in the Exchequer Court before J. T. Taschereau, J., who delivered the following judgment:\n\"Le p\u00e9titionnaire r\u00e9clame en cette cause contre Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine: \"1o. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'une \u00e9tendue de terre que Sa Majest\u00e9 poss\u00e8de comme formant partie des Lots. 2 et 3, du 5e rang du township de Hull, en la Province de Qu\u00e9bec;\n\"2o. Une somme de $200,000 comme fruits et revenus de cette \u00e9tendue de terre qu'il all\u00e8gue \u00eatre ill\u00e9galement d\u00e9tenue par le gouvernement de Sa Majest\u00e9.\n\"Le p\u00e9titionnaire fonde sa r\u00e9clamation sur un grand nombre de titres, et notamment sur plusieurs actes de donation produits en cette cause comme \u00e9manant des h\u00e9ritiers de feu Phil\u00e9mon Wright, concessionnaire originaire de ces lots de terre en vertu de lettres patentes en date du 3 janvier 1806.\n\"Sa Majest\u00e9 en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette p\u00e9tition a plaid\u00e9:\n\"1o. Insuffisance dans la description de l'\u00e9tendue et du site actuel des parties de lots de terre en question et comme poss\u00e9d\u00e9s par Sa Majest\u00e9.\n\"2o. Insuffisance dans la p\u00e9tition, en autant qu'elle n'all\u00e8gue pas que le p\u00e9titionnaire ait signifi\u00e9 au gouvernement de Sa Majest\u00e9 les divers actes de donation, cessions ou transports en vertu desquels il (le p\u00e9titionnaire) r\u00e9clame la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des lots et les fruits et revenus qu'il estime \u00e0 la somme de $200,000 et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des dits lots de terre.\n\"3o. Par exception p\u00e9remptoire en droit, Sa Majest\u00e9 a plaid\u00e9 prescription de 10 et 20 ans, et de plus celle de trente ans (30 ans).\n\"4o. Sa Majest\u00e9 a invoqu\u00e9 au soutien de sa d\u00e9fense divers documents, entre autres:\n\"1o. Un acte de vente fait et pass\u00e9 pardevant Mtre. R. A. Young et confr\u00e8re, notaires, le 7 mai, 1855, consenti par Andrew Leamy et Erexina Wright, son \u00e9pouse, au gouvernement du Canada, contractant par la minist\u00e8re de W. F. Coffin et Thomas McCord, Ecr., pour et au nom du Commissaire des Travaux Publics.\n\"2o, Un acte de ratification (dudit acte de vente), pass\u00e9 \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, devant Mtre. Petitclerc et confr\u00e8re, notaires publics, le 19 mai, 1855, des deux lots de terre vendus \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 par l'acte ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9 comme portant date 7 mai, 1855.\n\"3o. Que cet acte de vente du 7 mai, 1855, fut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au bureau du Protonotaire de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour le District d'Ottawa, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 un statut de la L\u00e9gislature du Canada, 9 Vic. ch. 37, \u00e9tablissant les Travaux Publics et que cet acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par jugement de cette dite cour, prononc\u00e9 le 3 juillet, 1856, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence, en vertu des diverses sections du dit statut et du dit jugement, tout droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, hypoth\u00e8que, droit de mineurs, et m\u00eame douaire non ouvert, si aucuns exist\u00e8rent, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 purg\u00e9s et enti\u00e8rement \u00e9teints, quant aux immeubles acquis par le gouvernement de Sa Majest\u00e9.\n\"4o. Sa Majest\u00e9 a \u00e9galement invoqu\u00e9 un titre de donation fait et pass\u00e9 \u00e0 Hull, le 6 f\u00e9vrier, 1865, devant Larue et confr\u00e8re, notaires, par lequel acte, Andrew Leamy et la dite Erexina Wright, vendirent au gouvernement de Sa Majest\u00e9, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par l'Honorable Charles Chapais, en sa qualit\u00e9 de Commissaire des Travaux Publics, un certain lot de terre y d\u00e9sign\u00e9 et en a obtenu un jugement de confirmation aux m\u00f4mes effets que celui ci dessus \u00e9nonc\u00e9.\n\"5o. Sa Majest\u00e9 a \u00e9galement invoqu\u00e9 en sa plaidoirie divers autres actes pour appuyer sa d\u00e9fense et elle en all\u00e8gue l'enregistrement, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi.\n\"La p\u00e9titionnaire Chevrier a r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9, sp\u00e9cialement, que le jugement de confirmation du 3 juillet, 1856, par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure du District d'Ottawa, \u00e9tait faux, et il s'est inscrit en faux contre cet acte et a plaid\u00e9 mauvaise foi \u00e0 l'encontre des diff\u00e9rentes prescriptions invoqu\u00e9es par Sa Majest\u00e9, et a pr\u00e9tendu que les divers titres d'acquisition ci-dessus \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s, n'\u00e9taient pas dans la forme prescrite par le 9 Vic. ch. 37, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence Sa Majest\u00e9 n'en pouvait tenir aucun avantage.\n\"Comme Ton voit, cette cause est tr\u00e8s compliqu\u00e9e et soul\u00e8ve nombre de questions importantes. Et j'avoue que la plaidoirie orale des habiles avocats des parties m'a beaucoup aid\u00e9 dans le d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9. Je suivrai dans le cours de mes observations, autant que possible, l'ordre dans lequel les diff\u00e9rents points de la demande et de la d\u00e9fense, m'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s.\n\"Insuffisance des all\u00e9gations de la d\u00e9claration ou p\u00e9tition.\n\"Le p\u00e9titionnaire dit que le gouvernement de Sa Majest\u00e9 est actuellement en possession de 159 acres de terre, situ\u00e9s dans les Nos. 2 et 3, du 5e rang du Township de Hull, y compris un \u00e9tang (a pond); il ne donne pas les tenants et aboutissants de ces 159 acres, ni l'\u00e9tendue ou superficie de l'\u00e9tang; cette irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9, si elle e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9e par exception \u00e0 la forme serait fatale et aurait indubitablement entra\u00een\u00e9 le renvoi de la p\u00e9tition quant \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent et sauf \u00e0 se pourvoir; mais Sa Majest\u00e9 n'a pas plaid\u00e9 par exception \u00e0 la forme, mais bien par une d\u00e9fense ordinaire en droit. Tout l'effet de cette derni\u00e8re d\u00e9fense a \u00e9t\u00e9 de mettre le Requ\u00e9rant sur ses gardes, et s'il e\u00fbt demand\u00e9 \u00e0 amender cette partie de sa petition ab initio, ou m\u00eame pendant l'instance, je lui aurais accord\u00e9 ce droit d'apr\u00e8s la r\u00e8gle 57, Cour d'Echiquier, page 231 du Manuel de Mr. Cassels, mais le p\u00e9titionnaire n'en a rien fait, pas m\u00eame lors de la plaidoirie devant moi. Aujourd'hui, si j'avais \u00e0 prononcer en faveur du p\u00e9titionnaire, je ne pourrais savoir ni indiquer o\u00f9 se trouvent les 159 acres de terre en question, y compris le pond (\u00e9tang), dans le 2 ete 3e rang, je ne sais o\u00f9 arr\u00eater au nord comme au sud, \u00e0 l'est comme \u00e0 l'ouest. Je serais dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 de prononcer d'une mani\u00e8re certaine avec une base si incertaine. Pourrais-je m\u00eame aujourd'hui renvoyer les parties \u00e0 rectifier cette irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9? C'est possible, mais cet amendement n'obligerait-il pas le p\u00e9titionnaire \u00e0 recommencer l'enqu\u00eate ab initio apr\u00e8s une plaidoirie nouvelle de la part de Sa Majest\u00e9, car je ne puis d'avance pr\u00e9voiries cons\u00e9quences d'un tel amendement sur la plaidoirie. Mais je crois qu'\u00e0 cet \u00e9tage de la cause le p\u00e9titionnaire n'a pas droit de demander \u00e0 faire cet amendement: je consid\u00e8re que le droit d'amendement qu'accorde la r\u00e8gle 57, (page 281, Manuel Cassels), ne s'applique qu'au temps de l'instruction de la cause et non au temps de la plaidoirie (argument) de la cause, apr\u00e8s que les parties l'ont termin\u00e9. D'ailleurs le requ\u00e9rant n'a fait aucune demande de permission, ce qui met fin \u00e0 la question.\n\"Ainsi, en supposant pour un instant que sur tous les autres points, je serais convaincu de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 des p\u00e9titions du p\u00e9titionnaire, je suis d'opinion qu'il devait faillir relativement \u00e0 cette irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle il n'a pas voulu y rem\u00e9dier et qui a pour effet de rendre impossible un jugement en sa faveur.\n\"Sa Majest\u00e9 a plaid\u00e9 que le p\u00e9titionnaire n'est pas saisi d'un droit d'action contre elle, tant pour la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e que pour les fruits et revenus au montant de $200,000, parce qu'il n'a pas signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 avant de produire sa p\u00e9tition de droit, ni en aucun temps depuis, les actes de donation sur lesquels il fonde cette p\u00e9tition. C'est un principe incontestable d'apr\u00e8s le Code Civil, que le cessionnaire de droits de cr\u00e9ances et de droits d'actions n'a pas de possession utile \u00e0 rencontre des tiers tant que l'acte de vente n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 et qu'il n'en a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9 copie au d\u00e9biteur. De fait il n'est pas saisi du droit d'action, il ne peut poursuivre sans avoir au pr\u00e9alable effectu\u00e9 cette signification, son droit n'est pas n\u00e9 et n'existera que lors de cette signification des transports, ou donations, qu'il tient des pr\u00e9tendus h\u00e9ritiers, ou repr\u00e9sentants, de feu Phil\u00e9mon Wright. \"Les d\u00e9cisions de nos plus hauts tribunaux sont en ce sens, surtout depuis les articles 1570, 1571 du Code Civil Canadien.\n\"Les articles 1689 et 1690 du Code Napol\u00e9on dont la r\u00e9daction est en termes \u00e9quivalents \u00e0 ceux de notre Code Civil Canadien, et M. Troplong en son trait\u00e9 de la vente, No. 909, d\u00e9montre que les actions, m\u00eame de droits immobiliers, ne peuvent \u00eatre c\u00e9d\u00e9es qu'\u00e0 la charge d'une signification du titre de cession.\n\"Mr. Toullier, Vol. 17, continuation de Duvergier, page 215, No. 18, \u00e9nonce cette m\u00eame doctrine, m\u00eame quant aux cessions de droits d'actions immobiliers. Telle est la loi, surtout en la Province de Qu\u00e9bec, depuis le Code Civil Canadien.\n\"Il n'y a aucun doute que les actes de donation, ou cession, que lui ont faits les repr\u00e9sentants Wright ne contiennent;\u2014\n1o. Qu'un transport de fruits et revenus;\n2o. Qu'une cession de droits d'action pour recouvrer ces fruits et de droit d'action contre Sa Majest\u00e9 pour recouvrer certains immeubles. Or, tout cela est transport de droits d'action, exigeant signification au d\u00e9biteur pour que le cessionnaire en soit l\u00e9galement saisi et puisse les exercer en justice.\n\"Le p\u00e9titionnaire pr\u00e9tend que le titre principal que Sa Majest\u00e9 invoque, et cit\u00e9 en sa d\u00e9fense comme vente par Andrew Leamy et Erexina Wright, son \u00e9pouse, ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 le 7 mai, 1855, par-devant Young et coll\u00e8gue, est nul et ne peut produire les effets que Sa Majest\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend en r\u00e9sulter.\n\"Cet acte d'acquisition est \u00e9videmment bas\u00e9 sur la 9 Vic. ch. 37, et le p\u00e9titionnaire invoque la section 17 de cet acte comme contraire \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de ce contrat, sur le principe que cet acte n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 sous le seing du commissaire. Cet acte n'est pas un \u00e9crit sous seing priv\u00e9; il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 en premi\u00e8re instance par-devant notaires, entre Messieurs W. F. Coffin et T. McCord, comme se portant fort du commissaire-en-chef, et promettant de le faire ratifier par acte de mai, 1855, pass\u00e9 \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec par-devant Mtre. Jos. Petitclerc et coll\u00e8gue, notaires, et aussi contresign\u00e9 par Thomas Begley, Secr\u00e9taire du Bureau des Travaux Publics. Le p\u00e9titionnaire pr\u00e9tend que cet acte est nul parce qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 scell\u00e9 du sceau du Commissaire, mais il me semble que le seul objet de cette section 17 de la 9 Vic. ch 37, exigeant le sceau du Commissaire, \u00e9tait pour \u00e9viter toute erreur sur l'interpr\u00e9tation \u00e0 donner \u00e0 aucun \u00e9crit sous seing priv\u00e9 du Commissaire, comme une lettre que l'on pouvait, ou voudrait, interpr\u00e9ter comme un contrat liant le gouvernement.\n\"Indubitablement la l\u00e9gislature ne pouvait avoir en vue de prohiber comme contrat l'acte le plus solennel en la Province de Qu\u00e9bec, savoir celui re\u00e7u et ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 par des officiers publics aussi bien connus que les notaires publics. Il me semble que le fait seul d'ex\u00e9cuter de tels actes par-devant des notaires publics, leur donne un caract\u00e8re d'authenticit\u00e9 beaucoup plus prononc\u00e9 que s'ils \u00e9taient pass\u00e9s sous seing priv\u00e9, quoique rev\u00eatus du sceau du commissaire. Je consid\u00e8re cette section 17 comme suggestion d'un mode de contrat, mais non exclusive de toute autre mani\u00e8re de contracter suivant les lois de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec. De plus, on voit \u00e0 la section 8 de cet acte 9 Vic., ch. 37, que l'emploi des actes pass\u00e9s par-devant des notaires est admis comme valable. Cette section 8 d\u00e8clare que ces contrats notari\u00e9s seront exempt\u00e9s de la formalit\u00e9 de l'enregistrement, admettant \u00e9videmment, la forme du contrat notari\u00e9. Cet acte de vente et ceux de m\u00eame nature que Sa Majest\u00e9 a invoqu\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9fense ont du \u00eatre soumis au procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et \u00eatre approuv\u00e9s par lui, puisque les applications pour leur confirmation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites en son nom pour Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine, et j'avoue que je trouve en ces circonstances une haute autorit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appui de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 des titres en question en cette cause, et notamment de celui du 7 mai, 1855.\n\"De plus, ces titres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9s par le tribunal de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, qui les a confirm\u00e9s, et personne ne s'en est plaint, que plus de vingt ans apr\u00e8s, et cette plainte vient de la part d'un acqu\u00e9reur de droits litigieux. Ces actes me paraissent parfaitement l\u00e9gaux, et il ne me reste sur cette branche de la cause qu'\u00e0 consid\u00e9rer l'effet qu'ils pourraient l\u00e9galement produire vis-\u00e0-vis des auteurs du p\u00e9titionnaire.\nLa L\u00e9gislature par son statut, 9 Vic., ch. 37, a d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 emphatiquement que de tels actes suivis d'un jugement de confirmation par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure \u00e9carterait \u00e0 toujours en faveur de Sa Majest\u00e9 toute r\u00e9clamation hypoth\u00e9caire, tout droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 quelconque, m\u00eame le douaire non-ouvert, laissant aux cr\u00e9anciers, ou propri\u00e9taires du fonds, \u00e0 faire valoir et exercer leurs droits sur le prix de vente d\u00e9pos\u00e9 entre les mains du Protonotaire de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Tout ceci a eu lieu. Cette l\u00e9gislation peut para\u00eetre exorbitante de prime abord, mais elle est sage et conforme aux exigences du service public qui ne doit pas souffrir des d\u00e9lais. Si les auteurs du p\u00e9titionnaire n'ont pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de se pr\u00e9senter pour recevoir leur cr\u00e9ances comme repr\u00e9sentant le douaire coutumier, ils n'ont qu'eux-m\u00eames \u00e0 bl\u00e2mer. Mais \u00e0 ce propos je vois que Mr. Andrew Leamy et son \u00e9pouse, Erexina Wright, les vendeurs, ont re\u00e7u sur la distribution des deniers du prix de vente une somme de \u00a3933 2s. 4d., et je remarque dans le dossier de la cause qu'il se trouve nombre de documents sous forme de transports, ou cessions, (quitclaims) par les h\u00e9ritiers Phil\u00e9mon Wright, \u00e0 Mr. A. Leamy, constatant que Leamy et son \u00e9pouse \u00e9taient aux droits de ces h\u00e9ritiers, ou repr\u00e9sentants, Phil\u00e9mon Wright, ce qui expliquerait probablement l'esprit de lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 avec lequel ils ont fait donation sans garantie au p\u00e9titionnaire de ces pr\u00e9tendus droits ou r\u00e9clamations qui, pour une cause ou une autre \u00e9taient sortis de leurs mains. Je remarque aussi qu'un autre cr\u00e9ancier, John O'Meara, a re\u00e7u \u00a3430 14s. 2d. et que plusieurs des h\u00e9ritiers, ou repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux de feu Phil\u00e9mon Wright, qui \u00e9taient parties opposantes \u00e0 la confirmation du titre de Sa Majest\u00e9, du 7 mai, 1855, ont retir\u00e9 leur opposition. Si les autres int\u00e9ress\u00e9s ne se sont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s pour recevoir leur part du douaire, ils n'ont qu'eux seuls \u00e0 bl\u00e2mer et leurs droits sont \u00e0 jamais perdus, si le jugement de confirmation du titre de Sa Majest\u00e9 et de la distribution des deniers n'est pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 faux, tel que le p\u00e9titionnaire le demande en cette cause.\n\"En abordant cette branche de la cause qui se rapporte \u00e0 l'inscription de faux que le p\u00e9titionnaire a formul\u00e9e contre le jugement du 3 juillet, 1856, disons de suite, que le moyen principal du p\u00e9titionnaire, et en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 le seul qu'il puisse invoquer est celui tir\u00e9 du fait que le projet (draft) ou minute de ce jugement n'est pas paraph\u00e9 par le ou les deux juges qui l'ont prononc\u00e9, car du reste le dossier de la cause est complet, le jugement incrimin\u00e9 est entr\u00e9 au dossier, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e9rement enregistr\u00e9 au bureau d'enregistrement du comt\u00e9 d'Ottawa 14 jours apr\u00e8s sa reddition, et ce dans le livre B, Vol. 6, p. 554, sous No. 416, sous le certificat du r\u00e9gistrateur, lequel certificat n'est pas attaqu\u00e9, et ce n'est que vingt ans apr\u00e8s tout cela, que l'on se r\u00e9veille pour contester l'authenticit\u00e9 de ce jugement. J'ai dit que le r\u00e9gistre de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure constate toute la proc\u00e9dure de la cause et m\u00eame l'entr\u00e9e du jugement, mais il semblerait que cette entr\u00e9e n'aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite que longtemps apr\u00e8s. Je dirai m\u00eame que le r\u00e9gistre a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu avec une n\u00e9gligence bien regrettable, quoique toute la proc\u00e9dure y soit compl\u00e9tement entr\u00e9e depuis le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de l'acte de vente jusqu'au jugement final. Il ne manque donc que la paraphe du juge sur la minute, et ici s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve la question de savoir si l'article 473 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure du Bas-Canada est tellement imp\u00e9ratif que la cour y doive trouver une cause de nullit\u00e9 insurmontable, s'il n'est pas observe \u00e0 la lettre? Je ne le crois pas, \u00e0 moins que l'article le prononce en termes formels. Cet article est, suivant moi, suggestif plut\u00f4t qu'imp\u00e9ratif. Le juge ou le greffier par suite de cette n\u00e9gligence peuvent \u00eatre bl\u00e2m\u00e9s, et m\u00eame condamn\u00e9s \u00e0 des dommages s\u00e9rieux, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par l'un d'avoir paraph\u00e9 la minute, et par l'autre d'avoir entr\u00e9 au r\u00e9gistre un jugement dont le juge n'a pas paraph\u00e9 la minute. Dire que le plaideur souffrira de la n\u00e9gligence d'un officier public au point d'en \u00eatre ruin\u00e9, et ce soit par l'oubli ou n\u00e9gligence, c'est ce que je ne puis admettre, surtout dans un cas comme celui-ci, o\u00f9 il ne manque que cette paraphe et que le dossier est r\u00e9gulier et constat\u00e9 par son enregistrement au bureau du r\u00e9gistrateur du district d'Ottawa. M. Poncet, 1er vol. Trait\u00e9 des Jugements, pages 228, 229, 230 et suivantes, traite cette question en ma\u00eetre, et je suis heureux de le trouver de mon opinion. Sans doute la loi est stricte et elle doit l'\u00eatre, mais son caract\u00e8re principal est celui de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de la justice, et je le demanderai \u00e0 tout esprit impartial, dans un cas comme celui qui nous occupe, pourrait-on l\u00e9galement ruiner un simple individu par suite d'une telle omission. Je dis non avec toute confiance.\n\"Le p\u00e9titionnaire Chevrier a beaucoup insist\u00e9 sur le fait que la minute du jugement (draft of judgment) n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e ou paraph\u00e9e par le ou les juges qui l'ont prononc\u00e9 le 3 juillet, 1856, mais la preuve de cette omission me para\u00eet insuffisante.\n\"En effet ce document (la minute), produit sous le No. 26 des exhibits de Sa Majest\u00e9, n'est pas paraph\u00e9 par le juge, mais le p\u00e9titionnaire aurait d\u00fb noter que ce document No. 26 n'est qu'une copie du projet (draft of judgment) puisqu'elle est ainsi produite et certifi\u00e9e comme telle copie. Le p\u00e9titionnaire aurait d\u00fb faire produire la minute elle-m\u00eame; ce n'est que contre une copie qu'ils s'est inscrit en faux; et pour r\u00e9ussir dans la preuve de son faux il aurait d\u00fb demander \u00e0 la cour d'ordonner aux avocats de Sa Majest\u00e9 de produire la minute m\u00eame. C'est une mesure de toute n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qu'il aurait d\u00fb prendre, et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut son inscription de faux dirig\u00e9e contre la minute doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e. Il aurait pu \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard examiner le greffier de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure du District d'Ottawa, lequel vit encore, et qui aurait pu produire la minute ou jetter sur la mati\u00e8re quelques nouvelles lumi\u00e8res. Sa Majest\u00e9, ni ceux qui la d\u00e9fendent aujourd'hui, se trouvant sur la d\u00e9fensive, n'avaient rien \u00e0 produire, leur position \u00e9tait celle de la d\u00e9fensive. Je consid\u00e9re cette objection comme insurmontable et comme mettant fin \u00e0 l'inscription de faux, quant \u00e0 ce qui concerne la minute, car cette minute n'a pas vu le jour sous cette inscription. La minute n'\u00e9tant pas produite, l'inscription contre elle tombe, et par contre-coup celle contre la copie du jugement entr\u00e9e au registre doit \u00e9prouver le m\u00eame sort, puisqu'en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 la seule chose que l'on p\u00fbt reprocher au jugement consistait en l'absence de la paraphe du juge sur la minute et qui n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire sur la copie du jugement tir\u00e9e du r\u00e9gistre. Cette objection peut para\u00eetre futile; je la consid\u00e8re pour le moins aussi importante que celle de l'omission de la paraphe du juge sur la minute d'un jugement entr\u00e9 au r\u00e9gistre, accompagn\u00e9 de toutes les autres formalit\u00e9s de la reddition d'un jugement, suivi de l'enregistrement de ce jugement et de plus de vingt ans de possession sans trouble, si ce n'est celui que lui cause le p\u00e9titionaire qui ne se pr\u00e9sente ici que comme acqu\u00e9reur de droits litigieux, qualit\u00e9 que les tribunaux ont mission de ne pas accueillir aveugl\u00e9ment. \"Suivant les pr\u00e9tentions du p\u00e9titionnaire, le jugement qu'il attaque n'aurait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9, il serait un faux, mais il ne peut nier que la cause dans laquelle ce jugement est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9 a exist\u00e9 et il existe encore; le greffier actuel le dit, et l'a prouv\u00e9 clairement, or je me demande, quelle serait la cons\u00e9quence d'un jugement que je rendrais aujourd'hui, ou que tout tribunal, en appel par exemple, et que maintiendrait l'inscription de faux contre le jugement de confirmation? Serait-ce de donner gain de cause au p\u00e9titionnaire sur tous les points et de faire condamner Sa Majest\u00e9 \u00e0 l'indemniser? Non, indubitablement, si ce n'est quant aux frais de l'inscription et \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration du faux du jugement. Je ne pourrais condamner Sa Majest\u00e9 \u00e0 remettre les terres r\u00e9clam\u00e9es au p\u00e9titionnaire. La seule cons\u00e9quence serait que la cause serait report\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait avant le jugement du 3 juillet, 1856. Le dossier de cette cause, dans la quelle la demande de ratification a eu lieu au nom de Sa Majest\u00e9, est encore en existence, et son instance n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e par la p\u00e9remption, et si aujourd'hui le jugement \u00e9tait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 faux la cause pourrait \u00eatre continu\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 jugement final sur nouvelle demande, ou application, que Sa Majest\u00e9 ferait d'un plaidoyer depuis darien-continuance, et alors Sa Majest\u00e9 pourrait faire suivre ce plaidoyer d'un jugement dont on aurait soin de ne plus oublier la paraphe sur la minute.\n\"Je crois que je pourrais me dispenser de tout commentaire ult\u00e9rieur, vu que les divers titres de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en cette cause suivis de leur ratification en justice, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait remarquer, assurent \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 un droit incontestable \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ses divers terrains, mais comme les parties en cette cause ont trait\u00e9 la question de prescription, je dois en dire quelques mots.\n\"Je dirai d'abord que la couronne comme tout individu peut prescrire. L'article 2211 du Code Civil Canadien le d\u00e9clare en termes formels, et de plus consacre ce droit comme ancien, en ces termes:\n\"Le Souverain peut user de la prescription. Le moyen qu'\u00e0 le sujet pour l'interrompre est la p\u00e9tition de droit outre les cas o\u00f9 la loi donne un autre rem\u00e8de.\n\"La L\u00e9gislature, en adoptant cet article comme droit ancien, a tranch\u00e9 une question qui a pu \u00eatre douteuse, mais qui se trouve d\u00e9finitivement r\u00e9gl\u00e9e aujourd'hui.\n\"D'abord, quant \u00e0 la prescription de dix ans, il est incontestable que Sa Majest\u00e9 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 de bonne foi d\u00e8s le moment de ses diverses acquisitions dont elle ignorait les vices, si toutefois ces vices exist\u00e8rent, a par l'espace de dix ans \u00e0 compter des diverses dates de ses titres d'acquisition, \u00e0 l'encontre du pr\u00e9tendu douaire coutumier de Sally Olmstead, dont le mari est mort le 28 novembre, 1812, \u00e9poque \u00e0 laquelle le douaire s'est ouvert quant \u00e0 la m\u00e8re et aux enfants, avec cette diff\u00e9rence que la prescription contre la m\u00e8re a couru \u00e0 compter du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son mari, et contre les enfants \u00e0 compter de leur majorit\u00e9, m\u00eame du vivant de leur m\u00e8re, suivant l'article 1449 du Code Civil Canadien. Or tous ces enfants \u00e9taient majeurs depuis plus de dix ans \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque des acquisitions de Sa Majest\u00e9 des terrains en question en cette cause.\n\"S'il existait un vice dans la possession de Sa Majest\u00e9 il ne lui a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 par interpellation judiciaire (ou p\u00e9tition de droits) conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 412 du Code Civil Canadien qui r\u00e8gle cette question comme ancien droit: 'Le possesseur est de bonne foi lorsqu'il poss\u00e8de en vertu d'un t\u00eetre dont il ignore les vices ou l'av\u00e8nement de la cause r\u00e9solutoire qui y met fin. Cette bonne foi ne cesse n\u00e9anmoins que du moment o\u00f9 ces vices ou cette cause lui sont d\u00e9nonc\u00e9s par interpellation judiciaire.' L'Honorable Juge Loranger a admis ce principe dans la cause de Lepage vs. Chartier[1], savoir, que pour prescrire par dix ans contre un douaire et faire les fruits siens il suffit que le tiers acqu\u00e9reur ait \u00e9t\u00e9 de bonne foi au moment de son acquisition, et que la connaissance subs\u00e9quente du vice de son titre ou de celui de son pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur ne peut lui pr\u00e9judicier. Je ne vois rien au dossier de cette cause pour me faire croire un instant \u00e0 la mauvaise foi du Gouvernement de Sa Majest\u00e9, au moins \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de la passation des divers actes d'acquisition que Sa Majest\u00e9 invoque en cette cause. Inutile de remarquer ici que la plaidorie en cette cause de la part de Sa Majest\u00e9 n'\u00e9nonce pas que cette possession de dix ans avec titres ait \u00e9t\u00e9 entre pr\u00e9sents et non-absents, car c'\u00e9tait mati\u00e8re d'exception chez le p\u00e9titionnaire, le principe \u00e9tant que dans ces cas la preuve de l'absence incombe \u00e0 l'excipient. Je crois \u00e9galement que Sa Majest\u00e9 a prouv\u00e9 son plaidoyer de prescription de trente ans. En effet elle poss\u00e8de les terrains en litige en vertu d'acquisition \u00e0 titres singuliers, elle peut invoquer sa possession en vertu de ses titres, ce qui lui donne vingt-six ans de possession, et elle peut y joindre celle d'Andrew Leamy et Erexina Wright, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'environ trois ans, et celle de Madame Sparks elle-m\u00eame. On a pr\u00e9tendu que le t\u00eetre de Madame Sparks \u00e9tait pr\u00e9caire et sa possession infect\u00e9e de ce vice et ne pouvait servir \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 pour compl\u00e9ter, environ deux ans manquant pour accomplir les 30 ans de prescription.\n\"Je suis port\u00e9 \u00e0 croire que le titre de Madame Sparks en est un non-attach\u00e9 de pr\u00e9carit\u00e9, je l'interpr\u00e8te comme un arrangement de famile entre elle et ses enfants, par lequel cette femme, Sally Olmstead, a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son droit \u00e0 un douaire sur une \u00e9tendue de plus de 591 acres sur lesquels elle pourrait r\u00e9clamer 295 acres en usufruit pour s'en tenir \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de 159 acres, plus l'\u00e9tang (pond) dont il est ci-devant question, et qu'elle vend le 29 septembre, 1853, comme \u00e0 elle appartenant, suivant l'acte ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 par-devant R. A. Young et confr\u00e8re, notaires, \u00e0 Aylmer. Le fait que cette vente ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite sans autre garantie que celle de ses faits et promesses, ne milite pas contre les droits de la couronne: elle a us\u00e9 de ces 159 acres de terre comme \u00e0 elle appartenant, et elle pourrait les vendre ainsi apr\u00e8s les avoir poss\u00e9d\u00e9s depuis le partage ou arrangement de famille du 5 mars, 1838, ce qui donnerait \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d'une prescription trentenaire plus six ans.\n\"En supposant pour un instant que le titre de Madame Sparks f\u00fbt pr\u00e9caire, ce que je ne crois pas, les h\u00e9ritiers de Phil\u00e9mon Wright et de Madame Sparks ont effectu\u00e9 en faveur de M. Leamy d\u00e8s 1836 et 1838, des cessions et abandons de tous leurs droits et pr\u00e9tentions aux terrains r\u00e9clam\u00e9s en cette cause, et en ce moment leur cessionnaire en ayant cause, M. Chevrier, est li\u00e9 par les actes de ses auteurs et pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs et surtout par les d\u00e9clarations et d\u00e9sistements (quit-claims) des pr\u00e9tendus douariers repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par M. Chevrier; ces actes de d\u00e9sistement (quit-claims) constituent une r\u00e9nonciation au douaire de leur m\u00e8re.\n\"La r\u00e9daction de ces actes de d\u00e9sistement, r\u00e9nonciations et quit-claims, peut laisser quelque chose \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer, mais ce qu'il y a de bien certain en ces actes c'est l'intention d'abandonner \u00e0 M. Leamy et \u00e0 ses successeurs tous les droits et pr\u00e9tentions qu'ils pouvaient avoir \u00e0 aucun titre sur les terrains en question en cette cause,\n\"Maintenant, le grand nombre de ces enfants, petits-enfants, ou repr\u00e9sentants de Phil\u00e9mon Wright ont-ils prouv\u00e9 leur g\u00e9n\u00e9alogie, ou m\u00eame droits successifs? C'est une question tres-probl\u00e9matique et dans la discussion de laquelle il vaut mieux ne pas entrer, et ce dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de ces enfants. \"Je passe par-dessus nombre de questions d'assez faible int\u00e9r\u00eat, croyant en avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit assez pour motiver le renvoi de la p\u00e9tition; cependant je signalerai une autre seule difficult\u00e9 que le p\u00e9titionnaire aurait \u00e0 surmonter: elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fense, mais que je me consid\u00e8re tenu d'indiquer ici, vu qu'elle est tr\u00e8s-s\u00e9rieuse et que si le jugement que je vais prononcer \u00e9tait port\u00e9 en appel, comme j'ai tout lieu de croire qu'il le sera, l'objection pourrait y \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e et le requ\u00e9rant pris par suprise. Cette difficult\u00e9 vient de ce que le p\u00e9titionnaire n'a pas prouv\u00e9 ou m\u00eame essay\u00e9 de prouver l'enregistrement des droits de succession des descendants dans les immeubles en question. Cette formalit\u00e9 est essentielle et formellement requise par l'article 2098 du Code Civil Canadien qui \u00e9nonce: 'Que la transmission par succession doit \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9e au moyen d'une d\u00e9claration \u00e9noncant le nom de l'h\u00e9ritier, son degr\u00e9 de parent\u00e9 avec le d\u00e9funt, le nom de ce dernier et la date de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, et enfin la d\u00e9signation de l'immeuble, et que jusqu'\u00e0 ce que l'enregistrement du droit de l'acqu\u00e9reur ait lieu, l'enregistrement de toute cession, transport, hypoth\u00e8que en droit par lui consenti affectant l'immeuble est sans effet.'\n\"Ainsi les c\u00e9dants ou donateurs de M.

Chevrier et je le condamne \u00e0 payer les d\u00e9penses encourues par Sa Majest\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9fense en cette cause.\"\nFrom this judgment the suppliant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMr. Fleming for appellants:\nThe defendant demurred to the petition on the ground of insufficiency of the description of the property, and want of notification to the Government of the transfer of the rights of the heirs to the suppliant. These demurrers were all dismissed by Strong, J. This judgment is sound in law. See arts. 116, 119 and 52 C. P. C. L. C., Pothier Proc\u00e9dure Civile[2], Pigeon Proc\u00e9dure Civile[3]; Cameron v. O'Neill[4]; C. C. L. C. art. 1570 and 1571; Code Nap. art. 1689, 1690; Laurent Code Civil[5].\nMoreover, Mr. Justice Strong's judgment has not been appealed against by way of a cross appeal, and it therefore remains in force.\nThe first plea relied on by respondent is that of thirty years' prescription. To complete the time of this prescription, the defendant has to join the possession of Leamy and Mrs. Sparks. Now, the possession of Mrs. Sparks was that of a dowager, douairiere, only, and she could not prescribe against her title, and Leamy having only acquired the usufruct could not prescribe either, and consequently there was no prescription during their occupation of which the Crown might avail itself, and its own possession was too short.\nThe quit claims produced show nothing contradictory of the property being held by Sally Olmstead, as dower. With respect to her share the expression is \"allotted to her use.\" Now, this exactly coincides with the rights of a dowager\u2014which is the use or enjoyment of the property subject to dower.\nHad the quit claims simply said \"allotted to Olmstead,\" there would be nothing contradictary to the right of dower, it would be merely an omission of the mention of the title by which that portion was to be held, and consequently the character of the title must be held to be in accordance with the rights of the person to whom it was allotted; if an heir, then she would hold as heir; if it had been community property, then as commune; if left to her by will, then as legatee; but as no other title than that of dowager is shewn, then the allottment must be considered to have been made to her; according to her only apparent rights, viz.: that of dowager.\nThat it was given to her in any other way is moreover contradicted by her own statement in the deed of the 7th December, 1852, by which she sells to Leamy her right of dower on the property.\nThe next point I will take up has reference to the title which Her Majesty got through the Commissioners of Public Works under 9 Vic., ch. 37.\nThe defendant, by exception, sets up the sale by Leamy and wife to Her Majesty, represented by the Commissioner of Public Works, before Young & Colleague, notaries public, on the 7th of April, 1855, purporting to convey the land in question in this case, along with other pieces, and also a deed of donation of the 6th February, 1865, by which A. Leamy and wife made a donation to the Crown of a certain piece of land forming part of lots Nos. 2 and 3 in the 5th concession of Hull, and two judgments of confirmation of these deeds, one rendered on the 3rd July, 1856, and duly registered in the registry office for the county of Ottawa, and the other on the 14th February, 1866, and also duly registered, and that these judgments, rendered under the provisions of the 9th Vic., ch. 37, sec. 9, forever barred all rights of property in the land mentioned in the deed thereby confirmed.\nFirst the suppliant submits that the title in itself is not in the form required by the statute 9th Vic., ch. 37, sec. 17; to render it valid the deed must be signed by the Commissioner, countersigned by the Secretary, under the seal of the Commissioners, \"and no other deed shall be held to be the act of the Commissioners.\"\nThen also Leamy does not come within the category of persons mentioned in the Act, and thereby authorized to convey property not their own\u2014viz.; tutors, curators, administrators, and others holding a representative character: the Act shows the confirmation could only be applied for with respect to contracts made either with the persons above mentioned, or persons holding as proprietors; whereas Leamy was not one of the class enumerated in the Act, and held only as usufructuary, not as proprietor, and the property was not dealt with as belonging to an unknown proprietor. Moreover, the judgment of confirmation was only authorized by the Act with respect to lands which could have been expropriated, to wit, to such portions of the lands which were included in plans submitted by the Commissioners to the Legislature, and approved of, as the Commissioners might deem necessary for the construction of public works.\nUntil the Legislature had thus authorized the construction of a public work and designated the site of it, the Commissioners were destitute of authority to expropriate, and consequently could not ask for or obtain a valid judgment of confirmation, and there was no evidence, nor even any allegation, that such plan had ever been submitted to, or approved of by the Legislature.\nUpon this point the appellant cited the following authorities:\u2014Abbott on Corporations[6]; Green's Brice ultra vires[7]; Pothier Vente[8]; Guyot, Repertoire de Jur.[9]; Potter's Dwarris on Stats.[10]\nSupposing, however, that the deed was not so absolutely null as to be unsusceptible of ratification, still it is not a title of which Her Majesty can be presumed to have any knowledge.\nHer Majesty is presumed to be cognizant of all acts legally performed by her agents acting within the scope of their authority, and of no others.\nBut in this case, as it has been clearly shown, the deed itself was illegal and a contract ultra vires, and consequently Her Majesty cannot be reputed cognizant of it. See Pothier, Prescription[11].\nHer Majesty's commissioners must therefore be considered as holding possession by virtue of the law which allowed them to take possession without a title, rather than under a title which is null. This proposition is almost self-evident, and hardly needs authorities to support it. See Dunod, Prescription[12].\nThe next proposition which the appellant will submit is that until the Civil Code was passed there was no petition of right in the Province of Quebec by which a subject could interrupt prescription.\n[TASCHEREAU, J.: The Privy Council have declared that the Code has the effect of a declaratory law as to what was the old law.]\nI think I will be able to show that the Court has the right to say what was the law previous to the Code; that is only a matter of opinion. I will admit that theoretically the petition of right has always existed, but there was no machinery in existence; and even up to this day in the Province of Quebec, bills providing for such machinery have always been rejected by the Legislature. Then when you cannot bring an action contra non valentem agere nulla currit prescriptio.\nAs to the prescription of ten years the appellant contends that the Crown, in order to avail itself of this prescription, should have held the property under a just title, in good faith, openly and publicly as proprietor. The good faith required is a belief that the party from whom the property was acquired was the real proprietor of it; the just title is a title which would be a valid transfer, if the person making it was the legal proprietor. In this case, the title set up from the Crown, not being under seal as was required by the Act 37 Vic., chap. 37, sec. 17, which provides that these deeds shall be so executed, and that no others shall be held to be the act of the Commissioners, was null, and consequently could not be the base of prescription. Moreover, the agents of the Crown were aware of the defect in Leamy's title, as is proved in the first place by the letter of Mr. Merrill, Superintendent of Public Works, Ottawa, to Thomas Begley, Secretary of Board of Works, under date of the 16th April, 1853, in which he states Leamy has only a right of dower on part of the property, and gives the names of the heirs of Philemon Wright as proprietors; 2nd, by the deed of 4th April, 1855, from Leamy to Commissioners, in which it is stated that difficulties may arise respecting his title, and security is exacted from him; Thirdly, by the correspondence between the officers of the Department of Public Works here and at Quebec, in which it is repeatedly stated that with respect to that part part of the property which Leamy obtained from Sally Olmstead, he had only a life interest.\nThe third plea of prescription, viz., twenty years, is merely that of ten years applied to absentees\u2014it is open to the same objection as those urged against that of ten years, and it is therefore unnecessary to discuss it.\nThe Crown is not accused of being a trespasser, it is merely contended that the Crown took possession with the consent of Leamy, who had a right to hold or transfer possession during the lifetime of Mrs. Sparks.\nThe Crown subsequently got from Leamy and wife what its agents supposed to be a valid title, during Mrs. Sparks' lifetime. In reality, the Crown holds without a title.\nAs the agents of the Crown were aware that Leamy's title would expire at Mrs. Sparks' death, they knew they could not legally hold the property after that date; the Crown is consequently bound to account for the rents, issues and profits from that date.\nThe fifth exception sets up the deed of 1849 from Nicholas Sparks and wife to the Crown; deeds of 1855 from Leamy and wife to the Crown; alleges that Her Majesty was in possession under these deeds, and that donations to petitioners were made collusively with intent to defraud Her Majesty, of whose titles the parties thereto were well aware. With respect to this plea, I cannot see how the donations could injure Her Majesty, as the petitioner claimed no greater rights than the parties from whom they held, and, consequently, it made no difference to Her Majesty whether these rights were urged by the petitioner or by the heirs.\nThe petitioner expressly denies the execution of the alleged sale by the four heirs of Philemon Wright Jr., in February, 1853, impugning it as a forgery.\nThe document in question was never produced, nor registered when Leamy's title was questioned by the agent of the Crown, and if it had been genuine Leamy would surely have then produced it.\nOne of the subscribing witnesses was dead, and the other, being examined, said he did not know whether he was present at the execution of it or not, or whether it ever was executed by the alleged parties to it. Moreover, two of these parties, Philemon Wright and Sally Wright swore positively that they never signed it; of the other two, one was dead, and the fourth, Mrs. Leamy, could not be affected by it, as she could not contract with Leamy, her husband.\nBy the seventh exception the defendant alleged that the rights transferred to petitioner were litigious, and prayed that the petition should be dismissed.\nThe petitioner contends that the rights are not litigious, that, even supposing they were, the defendant could only ask to be subrogated in the right of the petitioner, paying all cost and charges, and, consequently, the conclusion of this exception was wrong, and moreover, this plea should have been urged in limine litis, and could not be pleaded as a subsidiary plea.\nI will now take up the inscription en faux:\nThe petitioner inscribed en faux against the copy of the alleged judgment of confirmation of title of the 3rd July, 1856, and against the register from which the said judgment was copied, and the pretended draft of judgment, all of which he said were false, no such judgment having ever been rendered.\nOn this issue the parties went to proof, and it was established: that according to the entries in the minute book the case had been inscribed for hearing in law on the 1st July, 1856; that it never was inscribed for hearing on the merits; that no judgment had ever been rendered; that according to the judge's diary, the last proceeding in the Court was the hearing on law, on which the case was taken en delib\u00e9r\u00e9. With respect to the book called a register, it was shown that it was never seen by the prothonotary until four years after his appointment; it was delivered to him by the former prothonotary, who, in the interval, had been entering up judgments.\nThe only draft of judgment to be found in the record was produced by the present prothonotary; and was not paraphed by the judge by whom it purported to be rendered.\nThe initials or paraph of the judge on draft is the only legal evidence of the rendering of the judgment.\nNow, even supposing other evidence could have been adduced to show that a judgment had been rendered in this case, no evidence has been brought by the other side, for the sham register, being a book, made up out of the office of the Prothonotary, by a person having no authority to keep a register, can have no more probative effect than if they had fyled a copy of Scott's Waverly Novels.\nOn the necessity of the signature of the Judge, and its necessity to establish the rendering of a judgment, the following authorities were cited:\u2014Code of Civil Procedure, art. 473 and art. 474; Ordinance 1667, Titre 26, art. 5; Code de Proc\u00e9dure Napol\u00e9on, art. 138; Denizart Vo. Minute[13]; Bonnier Proc\u00e9dure Civile[14]. The ordinance of 1667, title 26, art. 6, abolished the formality of the pronunciation of judgment, but maintained the dictum which was also called the arr\u00eat\u00e9.\nBut in Canada the Courts have not observed the rule with respect to the dictum, and the only record recognized by law and the jurisprudence of the Courts has been for many years the minute or draft paraphed by the Judge and the transcript or copy of that minute entered in the register.\nIt is the duty of a Judge, when a judgment has been rendered, to sign or paraph the draft. The presumption of the law is that the Judge performs his duty; consequently, if the draft is not paraphed, that no judgment has been rendered. To controvert this presumption the strongest evidence would be required. But so far from this being the case, the other original registers of the Court, namely, the \"R\u00f4le de Droit,\" minute-book and diary, all show that not only was no judgment rendered, but that the case was not even inscribed for final hearing.\nNow all these books are recognized registers of the Court (vide Rules of Practice, S. C. No. 50), and, as such, authentic, and entitled to more credit than the register of judgments, as they are originals, whereas the latter is only a transcript. Where, then, is the proof of the rendering of the judgment?\nMr. Laflamme, Q. C., followed on behalf of the appellant:\u2014\nAs to the want of signification, the various French authors show that the objection could only be urged by a person prejudiced by not having been notified, and that in this case the defendant did not even pretend to have suffered, or to be liable to suffer any prejudice thereby.\nMoreover, the formal notice or signification required by the law of the Province of Quebec could not be carried out in this Province; substantially, notice has been given by the submission of the petition, and the documents on which it was based, by Her Majesty's Attorney General, and the sufficiency of that notice has been admitted by the fiat of the Administrator of the Government thereon.\nThe learned counsel referred on this point to Troplong De la Vente[15]; Marcad\u00e9[16]; Duvergier[17].\nThen as to prescription:\nThe title deed relied upon principally by the Crown is that of the 7th May, 1855. We contend that this deed was not at the time of its execution a perfect deed, and therefore cannot be relied on for prescription. By the Act creating this corporation the commissioners are obliged to affix their seals to all documents, writings, &c. We do not say they could not execute a deed before a notary, but that they should comply with the requirements of the 17th sec. of 9th Vic., c. 37, in notarial deeds as well as in other writings. Analogous provisions exist in the law of the Province of Quebec, viz.: Donations, if not executed before notaries, were an absolute nullity and produced no effect whatever. Then, could the Crown prescribe until this petition of right Act was passed. If subjects had the right of interrupting prescription by petition of right, it certainly was an error communis that such a right did not exist in the Colony, and the authorities quoted show that where there is a reasonable obstruction, prescription does not run. Then has the Crown purchased in good faith.\nBona fides, says Pothier, nihil aliud est quam justa opinio qu\u00e6sili domini. Voet expresses the same idea. Bona fides est ill\u0153sa conscientia putantis rem suam esse. We find that there is in these ideas a view comprehending more than the third party whose property is prescribed. The possessor must be conscious of the validity of his title, as to the right and capacity of the one with whom he treats. For without this how could he believe himself proprietor of the thing.\nThese therefore are the conditions which the possessor must combine to enable him to have that undoubted belief which is called good faith. He must first have no knowledge that any one but the person who transfers the thing is proprietor. Secondly.\u2014Be convinced that the one who conveys had the right and capacity to alienate. Thirdly.\u2014Receive it by a contract free of fraud and of any other vice. See Troplong on Prescription[18].\nThere can be no doubt that at the time the Government purchased from Leamy, in 1854, they had doubts as to the validity of his title, and before the deed of the 7th May, 1855, they were officially informed of the rights of the heirs of Philemon Wright Jr.\nThe question therefore is, can the Crown prescribe against a subject on more favourable conditions than a subject can prescribe against a subject? If a subject could not take the property with such knowledge, how can it be said that the officer of the Crown or a Board of Works could do so?\nMr. Robertson, Q. C., for respondent:\u2014\nIt is undoubted, that a Judge, at the hearing on the merits, may revise the decision of a Judge of the same Court, previously given on a d\u00e9fense en droit, and also that on an appeal from a final judgment, the merits of the judgment on such d\u00e9fenses come up for adjudication. The Supreme Court therefore can legally decide on the three d\u00e9fenses fyled generally to the portion of the petition claiming to have plaintiff declared proprietor of all the land now held by Government, on lots 2 and 3; and as to the necessity of signification upon the Government of the deeds of donation and transfer, so far as respects the rents, issues, and profits.\nReference was then made to Pigeau[19]; Merlin Repertoire[20]; C. C. L. C. art, 1571; Charlebois v. Forsyth[21].\nIt is submitted that the Crown can invoke prescription under article 2211 of the Civil Code.\nBefore the Code, it was decided in appeal in Lower Canada that the Crown could invoke the thirty years' prescription against a petitory action brought to recover portion of the lands covered by the fortifications of the city of Quebec: Laporte and The Principal Officers of Her Majesty's Ordnance[22].\nAs to the ten years' prescription it is clearly made out. What the English form of art. 2251, Civil Code, calls a translatory title and the French \"un titre translatif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9,\" and the Contume juste titre, is a title capable and fit on its face to convey title.\nSee Grande Coutume by Ferriere, on art. 113, p. 359, where he says: One of the conditions is that the possession be founded on a juste titre, i. e., that possessor has a cause l\u00e9gitime, capable of transferring the domaine, such as purchase, donation, will, judgment, &c., not a lease, or loan, or precarious title.\nThe titles to the Crown in this case are manifestly translatory, they are deeds of sale, deeds in the usual form, and authentic, and perfect.\nThe possession of the Crown has been for more than ten years, and if its good faith is impugned, the bad faith must be clearly established by the petitioner.\nAs to the plea of confirmation or ratification of title, the statute 9th Vic., c. 37, was in force when the ratifications in question in this cause were obtained.\nIn ordinary cases of ratification, hypotheques alone are purged; but in cases where the Crown obtains or expropriates land for public purposes under the statutes referred to, it is submitted, that rights of mortgage and hypotheques, and rights of property also, are equally purged, and the claim of the owners converted into a claim on the monies deposited in Court.\nUnder this statute the commissioners had the right to deposit the monies in the Court; the compensation-money was to represent the land; and parties claiming rights of property were bound to fyle their oppositions; and it will be seen that oppositions were actually fyled in this cause by some of the parties, donors to the plaintiff, namely, by Pamelia Wright (Mrs. McGoey), Serina Wright (Mrs. Pierce), and Hull Wright.\nThe judgments of the Court at Aylmer, ratifying the titles, evidently went on the ground that not only were hypotheques purged, but claims of property were also purged. The judgment in No. 136, ex parte Her Majesty, for ratification, recites that the parties above named, also Ruggles Wright, were opposants; that the application of Her Majesty was made under the 9 Vic., c. 37; that all the formalities required had been shewn to have been complied with, and the oppositions of Pamelia Wright and others had been discontinued with costs.\nAs to the Inscription en faux, it is submitted that it does not lie against the Register, as stated in the demurrer to certain of the moyens de faux; next, that it is very doubtful, under our jurisprudence, whether a judgment can in any case be attacked by an Inscription en faux; that no faux are proved, the evidence of the witnesses being wholly worthless, and insufficient to set aside either the judgment or Register.\nThe ordinance of 1667, tit. 26, art. 5, in force in Lower Canada, says: The presiding judge shall see that at the close of the sitting, and on the same day, the clerk has written, he shall sign \"le plumitif,\" and paraph each sentence, judgment, or arr\u00eat.\nThe plumitif is defined as being the original and primitive paper on which a summary of the judgments is written, which are rendered in open Court. R\u00e9pertoire de Jurisprudence, vo. \"Plumitif.\"\nThe plumitif is never signed in our practice. The draft of judgment, when drawn by the Prothonotary, and approved, is initialed, or signed by the Judge.\nIn France, the feuilles d'audience, or original drafts of judgments, are kept till the end of the year.\nThe learned counsel referred to Healy v. Corporation of Montreal[23]; art. 1207 and 1220 C. C. L. C.\nIn Carter v. Molson and Mechanics' Bank v. Molson, recently decided in the Superior Court, Montreal, by Dorion, J. (not reported), it was held no inscription en faux lay against a judgment.\nThe learned counsel then argued on the facts of record that it appeared that the division agreed to on the 5 March, 1838, ought to be held as a family arrangement, under which Sally Olmstead obtained a title to the 159 acres, reserved for her dower, and that the evidence adduced did not establish bad faith on the part of the Crown.\nMr. Lacoste, Q. C., followed on behalf of the respondent.\nIt is contended that Her Majesty cannot invoke prescription, because it was practically impossible to exercise the right of petition of right, and that there was common error as to the existence of this right. The case of Laporte v. The Principal Officers of Her Majesty Ordnance[24], clearly shows that the right existed. Then also ignorance of the law is no excuse.\nThe first plea of prescription is that of thirty years. To succeed on that plea I admit Her Majesty is bound to join her possession to that of her auteurs. Now, if the Court hold that Mrs. Sparks had a precarious title, her possession cannot be joined to that of the Crown, but it seems to me that the estate was divided in 1838, among the heirs, not as a partage provisoire, but forever. See art. 2094.\nHowever, the Crown relies also on the plea of 10 years' prescription in good faith with translatory title. As to the deed of 1849, there can be no question of bad faith. The learned counsel then argued that on the evidence adduced the appellant had failed, as the burden was on him to prove that the crown was in bad faith, if bad faith can ever be imputed to the Crown.\nThen, as to the plea under the Statute 9 Vic. c. 37; it is said the deed is not valid, because it was not passed in accordance with the provisions of the act, viz.: Signed and sealed. If that construction is to be put upon the act, how can you explain sec. 5 of the act which expressly recognizes transfers made before notaries and declares such deeds to be valid. Then, that the Crown could purchase from other persons than those specially mentioned in sec. 8, sufficiently appears by the following section, which declares that the money will stand in lieu of the land, and one of the effects of the judgment of ratification is to bar all claims.\nWe find also, that by the deeds of transfer to the petitioner, some of the parties thereto assumed the quality of heirs of Sally Olmstead; if so, as warrantor of her acts, the suppliant could not call in question titles derived from her. More than this, one of these heirs, Mrs. Leamy, was the co-vendor with Leamy to the Government, and she, in any case, had no rights to transfer to the suppliant.\nThe following additional authorities were then referred to by the learned counsel on the question of the inscription en faux. French Code of Proc., art. 214 to 251; Sirey (1865), Code, vo. Faux. Bioche, Dict. de Proc. 1850, vo. Faux, No. 44\u201456, No. 197. Palsgrave v. Ross[25]. The omission to sign a judgment in a Register will not authorize a Court to treat it as non-existant when an authentic copy is produced. 9 Dalloz, Juris du Royaume, p. 616, Note 3.\nMr. Laflamme, Q. C. in reply.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nThe property claimed by the petitioner was granted to Philemon Wright, 3rd May, 1806. On the 25th April, 1808, Philemon Wright conveyed this property to his son Philemon Wright Jr. On the 4th May, 1808, Philemon Wright Jr. married Sarah, alias Sally Olmstead, without any marriage contract.\nPhilemon Wright Jr. died 5th Dec, 1821, intestate, leaving his widow and eight children issue of the said marriage.\nThe real estate in question, having been acquired previous to the marriage, continued, notwithstanding the marriage, the sole and absolute property of Philemon Wright Jr., subject to the customary dower (douaire coutumier) of the wife, which consisted of the usufruct or life enjoyment of one-half of the real estate owned and possessed by the husband at the date of the marriage, the absolute property of which would revert to the children, issue of the marriage, or their representatives, after the death of the widow.\nOn 20th November, 1823, the widow married Nicholas Sparks, and died on the 9th October, 1871.\nAfter the death of P. Wright Jr., his heirs made a division or partage of their father's estate between themselves and the said Sally Olmstead, and caused a plan to be made by one Anthony Swalwell, a surveyor, of the several portions, and on the fifth day of March, 1838, by certain agreements entitled quit claims or transfers, seven in number, all bearing date on the day and year last aforesaid, under their hands and seals, duly made before witnesses, and all duly registered in the Registry Office of the said County of Ottawa, the said several heirs, with the exception of Wellington Wright, ratified the said survey and partage or division made; and the possession of the several lots so previously occupied and enjoyed and the rights of Sally Olmstead, their mother, to certain portions of said lots 2 and 3, in said 5th range of Hull aforesaid, hereinafter mentioned, were also thereby ratified and acknowledged.\nIn and by each and every of said quit claims and transfers, it was declared:\nThat the said Philemon Wright, junior, Hull Wright, Pamelia Wright, Horatio Wright, Erexina Wright, Sally Wright, as surviving heirs of their late father, having mutually agreed to divide the inheritance of their late father, have caused the same to be surveyed by Anthony Swalwell, Deputy Surveyor, who having ascertained the quantity of land in lots nos. 2, 3 and 4 in the 5th Concession of the Township of Hull to be 591 acres, 1 rood 24 perches, including a certain pond of water, the said portions of said land, having been sub-divided, the following portions have been allotted to each, that is to say:\u2014\nTo Philemon Wright\n43 acres 2 roods.\n\" Hull Wright\n43 \" 2 \"\n\" Pamelia Wright\n49 \"\n\" Horatio Wright\n53 \" 1 rood 24 p.\n\" Wellington Wright\n48 \"\n\" Serina Wright\n60 \"\n\" Erexina Wright\n65 \"\n\" Sally Wright\n70 \"\n\" Sally Olmstead, their mother, the pond of water inclusive\n159 \"\nWith all of which the said heirs declared themselves satisfied, and that in order the better to secure to each other a legal title to the said portions of land aforesaid, the said heirs did grant remise and release, and forever quit claim by each of said deeds to each heir severally the lot hereinabove referred too, and shown on said plan of said Swalwell, and describing each portion by metes and bounds, to have and to hold to each heir the said portion so allotted to his or her use and behoof forever, so that the said heirs so conveying said several lots should not, nor should any person claiming from them, have claim or demand any right or title to the said several premises whatever.\nThe plaintiff now claims a certain undivided interest in the 159 acres so set apart for the use of the said Sarah Olmstead, under deeds from the heirs of Philemon Wright Jr., on the ground that the same was set apart to the said Sally Olmstead as and for her dower in her husband's estate, and that the same on her death reverted to the heirs of the said Philemon Wright Jr.\nOf the nine deeds set up in the petition, the first and eighth are set up as being from Philemon Wright as one of the children of Philemon Wright Jr. The third and fourth from Sally or Sarah Wright (Mrs. Boucher). The second and sixth from Erexina Wright, otherwise called Elizabeth Wright, (Mrs. Leamy). The seventh from Pamelia Wright, (Mrs. McGoey). The ninth and last from Philemon Wright, Mary Jane Wright, (Mrs. Allan), Serina Wright, (widow Olmstead), Ellen Wright, (widow Whitney), as the children of Hull Wright. The consideration of some of these deeds is as follows:\nThe present gift inter vivos and conveyance is thus made for and in consideration, firstly, of the friendship which the said donors entertain towards and for the said donee; secondly, of the gratitude they, the said donors, feel for him, said donee, for services rendered and being rendered by the latter to the former.\nIt is claimed on behalf of the Crown, in the first place, that this partage was a family arrangement, that the quantity of land set off to the widow was much less in quantity than half her husband's land, and that it was the intention of the parties that the widow, in taking so much less than she was entitled to, was to have the absolute right and title to the part so allotted to her, and that the same was given to and accepted by her in lieu of her dower, or life interest in the half of the estate; and that the Crown, by deeds from the widow and her husband, and from Leamy and wife, who likewise claim a portion under deeds from the widow and late husband, became vested with the absolute ownership of the land. Failing in this contention, it is claimed that the property was acquired and taken possession of by the Crown, for the use, maintenance and construction of certain public works, under powers conferred by the 9 Vic., c. 37 of the statutes of Canada, and that the same was conveyed to the Crown, and that the title of the crown (as to part if not the whole) was afterwards duly confirmed by a judgment of confirmation, whereby all claims to the lands, to which such confirmation extended, were forever barred; and lastly, that if the conveyances and confirmation were not of themselves sufficient to vest the legal title in the Crown, then that the Crown had acquired a legal title to the property by prescription.\nIf the first proposition could be established there would be an end of the case, but I can find no sufficient evidence to sustain this contention. On the contrary, I think the evidence leads to a conclusion the reverse, though certainly the conduct of the parties would tend to a strong suspicion that such may have been the case. No necessary inference can, I think, be drawn from the quantity of the land set apart to the widow, as being less than half the property which the law gives her, because it would, I think, be unreasonable to suppose that in a block of 590 acres, on rivers such as the Gatineau or Ottawa, every acre would be exactly of the same value, or that it would be possible to divide the lot into nine portions of relatively equal value by giving an exact half in quantity to the widow and eight other portions, each containing exactly the same quantity, to the eight heirs. Thus, we see, in the partage among the heirs of the balance, after deducting the portion set apart to the widow, there is quite as great a discrepancy in the quantities awarded to them respectively. Two get only 43 acres each, while all the rest get many more, ranging in excess from 6 up to 17 acres; therefore, I think the inference may fairly be, that the partage was based on and governed by the value of the respective lots, and not on the quantity of land each share contained, and so, though the widow may not have had allotted to her the use of half her husband's property in extent, she may have had it in value. Then again, we find that while, as among and for the security of the heirs, quitclaims and transfers were made, securing to each heir, by legal documentary title, the absolute interest in the lot appropriated to him or her respectively, no such quit claim or transfer is made to the widow, nor do we find her a party to any such quit claim. If it was deemed necessary that the title of the heirs should be so secured to them, a fortiori the right of the widow, who, as widow, had only an usufructuary interest, still more required, if it was intended that she should be the absolute owner, a solemn relinquishment and conveyance of the rights of the heirs to her in the portion allotted to her.\nIt is true the deed made by the widow and her husband on the 12th September, 1849, whereby they sold, as their sole and absolute property, a portion of this land so allotted to Her Majesty the Queen, which deed I shall have occasion more particularly to refer to on another branch of this case, certainly shows that she, at that time, claimed to be absolute owner of the property and dealt with it as such, but this can in no way be used directly or indirectly to establish the fact that she was such owner, and if it could, it must, on the other hand, be observed that on the 7th December, 1852, dealing with another part of the 159 acres and her interest in it, she deals with it as if she had a right of dower only. It is a somewhat singular circumstance, that in this deed is expressly excepted the portion sold and conveyed to Her Majesty, which portion was most certainly sold and conveyed as the absolute property of the vendors, and this would rather lead to the supposition that, as they had sold to the Crown, so they were selling to Leamy as the absolute proprietors; the language of the deed to Leamy can only be reconciled with this idea, on the supposition that in transferring what had been allotted to her, if absolutely, for and in lieu of dower, she in common parlance continued to call it her dower, and whoever drew the deed did the same, possibly considering that the words of the deed \"the said dower and all other rights whatsoever belonging to the said Sarah Olmstead, and which the latter claims as her right of dower\" would cover all her rights, whether as dower or absolute owner. However this may be, I cannot bring my mind to the conclusion that there is sufficient legal evidence to justify me in saying that there was a binding agreement between the heirs and the widow, whereby the portion allotted to the latter was not simply as and for her dower, but was set apart as her absolute property in lieu of her dower, however much I may suspect such to have been the intention, in view of what has been said and of the fact that the parties have so long slumbered on their rights, if they had any. If this is so, then it follows that the deeds from Sparks and wife to the Crown, and from Sparks and wife to Leamy, could not convey the legal estate in this property.\nA deed of quit claim or transfer to Leamy has also been produced purporting to be signed by Horatio, Elizabeth, Sarah and Philemon, children and heirs of Philemon Wright Jr., dated the 3rd February, 1853, whereby they sold and quit-claimed all their rights, claims and pretensions to the 159 acres allotted to their mother. This instrument is alleged not to be genuine, in fact to be a forgery. On behalf of its authenticity Jas. Goodwin, a witness to this paper, proves his own handwriting, but has no recollection of the transaction. He says; \"Without my own signature being there, I should not have recollected any thing about it.\" He knew Doyle, the other witness, who was a bar keeper to Leamy, who he understood died in the year 1853, or 1854. Jas. Leamy was killed, he says, in the year 1860, or thereabouts. He says: \"I have seen Jas. Doyle write very often, I have not seen him sign his name very often, but he kept Leamy's books when I stopped there, and to the best of my judgment that is his signature.\" And being asked as to his recollection of being asked to be a witness, or to his supposing from his signature being there that he was called as a witness, he says: \"All I can swear to is, that is my signature, but I have no recollection seeing the party sign the document.\"\nRobert Farley cannot swear positively to signature of Doyle after a lapse of 20 years, but gives his opinion and belief as strongly as could be done after so long a lapse of time. He also says the words \"third,\" \"February\" and \"three,\" and the signature \"John Doyle,\" appear to be written by the same party, and also the signature \"H. G. Wright.\"\nJames Clarke produces four receipts, which were written by him and signed in his presence by Philemon Wright, H. G. Wright, and Sarah Wright. He looks at paper U. U., and says: \"I believe the signatures H. G. Wright, P. Wright and Sarah Wright are written by the same persons as those who signed said receipts in my presence.\"\nHere, then, we have one of the subscribing witnesses proved to be dead, but his handwriting very clearly proved by the other subscribing witness produced, who proves his own signature, though he does not recollect the transaction, which, after a lapse of 20 years, is not to be wondered at. This evidence, under the English jurisprudence would prove this document without any evidence of the handwriting of the parties to it, but, in addition to this, we have the fact very clearly established, that the paper must have been in existence at or about the time it bears date, because it is proved that Doyle, the witness, died in 1853 or 1854. In addition to which we have very strong evidence of the handwriting of Horatio, Elizabeth, Sarah and Philemon Wright, not only by a person who had seen them write, but also by the production of and comparison with a genuine document, the signatures to which are unquestionably proved to have been written by these parties respectively.\nIt is true Philemon Wright denies his signature, and produces entries in a memo. to show he was not in Hull at the date of the paper. Sarah Boucher denies her signature, and alleges in support of that statement that she was not on speaking terms with Mr. and Mrs. Leamy, and not until 8th October, 1853.\nOn cross-examination she is asked: \"Can you give any other reason in respect to said signature not being yours, than not speaking to or being on speaking terms with Mr. and Mrs. Leamy?\" She answers \"I do not know, I never seen or spoke to any of the parties.\" This witness also says: \"The signature, 'Sally Wright,' set and subscribed to the exhibits of the defendant at enqu\u00eal\u00e9 numbered R. R. S. S., now shewn, are my signatures. Q. Do you not think there is a resemblance between the signatures Sally Wright and Sarah Wright in these exhibits? A. Yes, there is. Q. Would you sometimes sign Sarah Wright and sometimes Sally Wright? A. Yes.\"\nI think very little of the fact that P. Wright Jr. was in the woods on the date of this paper, or that Sarah Wright was not then on speaking terms, if we are bound to take this evidence as conclusive, because it by no means follows that the paper must, to be genuine, have been signed on the day it bears date. I think it would be a most dangerous thing to allow interested parties by such evidence as this, after a lapse of 20 years, and the death of the other party to an instrument and of one of the witnesses, to destroy a document and reap the benefit of the property purporting to be conveyed away by him by such instrument.\nUnsatisfactory as this evidence is, I think the evidence of the only other two witnesses called is, if possible, more unsatisfactory. Alex. Heney and Chas. Desjardins are called as experts or quasi experts. The evidence of experts under the most favorable circumstances is to be received and acted on with very great caution. It is only necessary to read this evidence, I think, to show that it ought not to have any weight whatever.\nAlexander Heney:\nQ. Look at the exhibit marked \"U.U.\" now shown to you in this cause, and produced by the plaintiff, and say whether or not the words third,\" \"February\" and \"three\" at the end of the said document are in the same hand-writing as the signature John Doyle in your opinion. A. I think the words \"third,\" \"February\" and \"three\" and John Doyle, were by the same pen and the same hand.\nQ. Will you look at the signatures H. G. Wright, on receipts exhibits X and XX, and on exhibit U. U., fyled by defendant, and say whether you think the signatures on the said exhibits X and XX are in the same hand-writing as on the exhibit U. U.? A. I do not think the signature H. G. Wright on the exhibit U. U. is in the same hand-writing as the signatures H. G. Wright on the exhibits X and XX.\nQ. Have you been in the habit of seeing different signatures for a length of time, and state how long? A. I have more particularly for about twenty-four years.\nCross-Examined\u2014My reason for thinking that the words referred to in my examination-in-chief, are in the hand writing of John Doyle, is that the stress of the pen and ink appears to be the same.\nQ. Please state what is your reason upon which you stated in your examination-in-chief that the signature H. G. Wright on the said receipts are not in the same hand-writing as the signature H. G. Wright on the exhibit U. U.? A. The reason is because the signature on the receipt X is not so well written and not so closely connected as the one on the exhibit U. U.\nQ. Did you ever see the said Horatio G. Wright sign his name? A. Never.\nQ. Are you prepared to give an opinion whether or not the signature P. Wright on the exhibit XXX, now shown to you, is or is not in the same hand-writing as the signature P. Wright on the exhibit U. U.? A. No I am not. I never seen any of the parties mentioned in the exhibit U. U. sign their names.\nIn my examination-in-chief, I stated I had been in the habit for about twenty-four years of seeing different signatures, I mean that I saw them in the course of my business as landing waiter and otherwise. I do not mean that I was ever examined as a witness in a dispute regarding signatures.\nCharles Desjardins:\nQ. Are you in the habit of comparing or examining signatures, and for how long had you occasion to do so? A. Yes as insurance agent and telegraph operator for about eight years.\nQ. Will you take communication of defendant's exhibit U. U., and say whether you think the words \"third,\" \"February,\" \"three,\" at the end of the said document are or are not in the same handwriting as the signature John Doyle subscribed thereto as a witness. A. I believe they are.\nQ. What do you think of the signature H. G. Wright on the said exhibit U. U.? A. I think it is in the same hand-writing as the words \"third,\" \"February,\" \"three,\" and the signature John Doyle.\nQ. Will you compare the signature H. G. Wright on defendant's exhibits X and XX with the signature H. G. Wright on said exhibit U. U., and say whether you think they are or are not in the same hand-writing? A. I don't think they are.\nQ. What difference do you see between the signatures on exhibits X and XX and signature on exhibit U. U. A. I don't think it is in the same hand-writing at all.\nCross-Examined\u2014I am not acquainted with any of the signatures on the exhibits to which I have referred, that is the receipts and the exhibits U. U. I have not been examined as an expert in cases of disputed signatures,\nQ. Can you state the differences between the signature of said receipts X and XX, and the said exhibit U. U.? A. The letter \"H\" in the exhibit X and XX differs from the letter \"H\" in the exhibit U. U. and the first limb being longer in the two receipts than in the exhibit U. U. and the strokes in both limbs of the letter \"H\" in exhibit U. U. are heavier and farther apart than in the two receipts, and the turn in the last limb of the letter \"H\" in exhibit U. U. is different. The letter \"G\" in exhibit U. U. differs from the same letter in the two receipts, and the upper loop being heavier and more open in exhibit U. U. than the same letter in the receipts. And the tail of the \"G\" on exhibit U. U. differs from the other on the exhibits XX, being turned down in exhibits U. U., and not turned down in exhibits X and XX. The letter \"W\" in exhibit U. U., is not started the same way, and is more open or straggling, and the finishing limb is turned down, and heavier than the same letter in exhibits X and XX. The rest of the letters in the exhibit U. U. differ materially from the same letters in the said receipts.\nWhen we know how little reliance is to be placed on the testimony of even professional experts, to allow evidence of this kind with reference to the signatures of persons such as these, who, from the signatures, are but rough writers, and who, it is very evident, were not in positions called on to sign their names so often as to give their signatures a set established character, to overthrow solemn sealed instruments in reference to the title to real estate, where the possession of the property has, for upwards of 26 or 27 years, gone in entire consistency with the instrument assailed, and when the parties have remained perfectly quiet, and where their quiescence appears now only to have been disturbed by the plaintiff's procuring deeds of gift and starting this controversy; I say, to overthrow instruments on such evidence and under such circumstances, and where, as we shall see hereafter in another branch of the case, some of these very parties had been parties to and assented to the judgment of confirmation of the Crown's title, would be, in my opinion, to jeopardize and shake to the very foundations the security of property. Therefore, I am not prepared to say this is a forged instrument.\nThere can be no doubt that the proper officers entered upon and took possession of the property for the use of the Public Works of the Province of Canada, as by law they were authorized to do, and it cannot be doubted that the property was purchased from parties in possession, who, in dealing with the Crown, claimed to be the absolute and lawful owners thereof, and it is not disputed that the Crown paid the full value therefor, and has continued in peaceable, continuous, uninterrupted, public and unequivocal possession as proprietors of the property in dispute, a portion from the 12th Sept., 1849, the remainder from 7th May 1855; and that the Crown has exclusively dealt with it as public property and has placed on the premises extensive improvements of a public character, involving a very large expenditure of the public money, and of a character and for a purpose wholly inconsistent with any use to which the same premises would or could have been applied had they continued private property.\nThe notarial deed from Sally Olmstead, or Sparks, and her husband to the Crown, before referred to, is dated 12th September, 1849, whereby Sarah Olmstead and Nicholas Sparks her husband granted, bargained, sold, assigned, transferred, and made over from thenceforth and for ever, with promise of warranty against all gifts, dowers, mortgages, substitution, alienations and other hindrances whatsoever, to Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, Her heirs and successors, represented by the Honorable Etienne Tach\u00e9, Chief Commissioner of Public Works of the Province of Canada, a certain tract of land required for the use of the Gatineau works, and in said deed particularly described, containing 21 acres, 1 rood and 25 perches (of the land now claimed by appellants), which said vendors are lawfully seized thereof by virtue of a good and sufficient title, the aforesaid thereby bargained and sold tract of land being holden by the tenure of free and common socage, free and clear of every charge, burden and incumbrance as the said vendors now thereby declared, excepting such burthens, &c., as might be charged and imposed thereon by the Letters Patent from the Crown, in consideration of \u00a3107 7s. 0d., being the value of the said 21 acres 1 rood and 25 perches, at the rate of \u00a35 cur. per acre, agreed upon by the said vendors and the said commissioners, which said \u00a3107 7s. 0d. was paid previous to the passing of said deed, whereof the said vendors did thereby acknowledge payment and grant discharge, dont quittance g\u00e9n\u00e9rate et finale.\nOn the 24th April, 1854, by deed between Leamy and wife of the one part, and the Honorable J. Chabot and Honorable H. Killaly, Commissioners of Public Works, Bartholomew Conrad Augustus Gugy, acting on behalf of the Commissioners of Public Works, binding himself to cause these presents to be duly ratified by the Commissioners within 15 days after execution, pending which time the Government, who were in possession of the thereinafter mentioned and described property, should not be disturbed or molested by the said Andrew Leamy or his said wife of the other part; after reciting that the Commissioners of Public Works deemed it necessary \"to acquire, for the use, benefit and advantage of the public, possession of certain pieces or parcels of land situated in the Township of Hull, &c., which Leamy and wife claimed to be theirs,\" the deed witnessed that Leamy and wife sold, &c., unto Her Majesty The Queen, her heirs and successors, the land described, being parcel of the property now claimed. The said deed then recited that a tender and notification had been made by the Commissioners of Public Works to Leamy for two of said pieces of land by the notices on the 21st April, then inst., which, not having been accepted, it was necessary to estimate the value thereof, together with the other pieces above described, by experts to be nominated under the provisions of the Acts regulating that subject in force in the Province of Canada. It then proceeds to nominate experts on the part of Her Majesty and on the part of Leamy to assess the value of the land, together with the value of the use and occupation thereof, or of such part thereof as may have been used or occupied by the Government or its agents for the time so occupied, &c.\nIt then recites:\nAnd whereas difficulties or doubts may arise as to the validity of title of the said Andrew Leamy and his said wife with regard to the aforesaid four pieces or parcels of land, and it is necessary that security, caution, shall be given to Her said Majesty the Queen in that respect by him, therefore, to these presents personally came, intervened and was present, James Leamy, also residing in Bytown aforesaid, inn-keeper, who, after having had reading and taken communication of the foregoing premises, did and doth hereby voluntarily become the security, caution, for and on behalf of the said Andrew Leamy and his said wife, and doth hereby bind himself conjointly with the said Andrew Leamy and his said wife to the due performance of all the obligations which the said Andrew Leamy and his said wife have entered into aforesaid, and this in the same manner as if he were the principal or principal oblige to these presents, provided always that should this deed not be ratified, no right of action whatever shall ever be exercised by the said Andrew Leamy and wife, or either of them, against the said Bartholomew Conrad Augustus Gugy, or for the due execution of these presents.\nBy deed, made on the 7th May, 1855, by Andrew Leamy and wife, and Wm. Foster Coffin, and Thomas McCord, for and on behalf of the Honorable The Commissioner of Public Works for the said Province of Canada, se portant forts pour eux, and thereby obliging themselves to cause those presents within fifteen days after the execution thereof to be ratified in due form of law by the said commissioners, of the other part; the parties covenant, that whereas the said commissioners have deemed it necessary to acquire for public purposes certain pieces of land situate in the Township of Hull, &c., which the said Andrew Leamy and wife claim to be theirs, the deed witnessed that said Leamy and wife sold and assigned unto Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, accepting thereof by and through the aforesaid Commissioners of Public Works, all the following pieces, inter alia: Secondly, a strip of land (describing it), save and except, however, out of the said strip two portions of these, represented and colored, one red and the other yellow on the plan No. 2, also annexed to those presents, the said two exempted portions being one of them so much of the said strip as is comprised in that share of the estate of the late P. Wright Jr. alloted by a partage or division thereof, made between his heirs and Czarina Wright, wife of one James Pierce, and the other of them, so much of the said strip as is comprised in that part alloted in the said partage to Sally Olmstead, widow of the late P. Wright Jr.; and the said partage or division being represented and shewn by a sketch or plan thereof made for the said heirs by one Anthony Swalwell, D. P. S.\nBy another deed between the same parties of the same date, under the number 1032, the said Andrew Leamy and his wife sold, transferred and assigned, with promise of warranty against all gifts, debts, dowers, claims, mortgages and other incumbrances whatsoever, to Her Majesty the Queen, accepting thereof by the Commissioners of Public Works, duly represented and acting by the said William Foster Coffin and Thomas McCord, those certain other lots or pieces of land, inter alia: Secondly, a piece or parcel of land, for the most part covered with water, the water covering the same being portions of the south and south-east parts of lots numbers two and three in the fifth concession of the Township of Hull, colored yellow on the plan number one, annexed to the said deed of sale entered into by the said parties, bearing even date with these presents, describing it and forming part of the 159 acres claimed by petitioner. Thirdly, a portion of the west bank of the Gatineau River (describing it): \"Until intersected by the boundary line bet ween the share allotted to Wellington Wright in the partage amongst the heirs of the said Philemon Wright Jr., according to the sketch or plan of the said partage made by Anthony Swalwell, D. P. S., and the share allotted by the said partage and according to the said plan to Sally Olmstead, widow of the late Philemon Wright Jr., as will appear by the first mentioned plan, No. 2. upon which plan the said portion is represented and colored yellow.\" The deed contains a provision that the price agreed on shall be paid into the hands of the prothonotary of the Superior Court, district of Ottawa.\nIn the view I take of the case, it is not necessary to stop to enquire whether the proceedings to expropriate this property were strictly in accordance with the statute or not.\nThe property having been taken possession of by the Crown, and the Crown having obtained these deeds, we find from the records of the Superior Court, district of Ottawa, that the following took place:\n\"In the Superior Court, exparte:\n\"On the application of the Hon. Her Majesty's Attorney General for Lower Canada, for and on behalf of Her Majesty, The Queen, for a judgment of confirmation and Ruggles Wright the elder opposant, and Pamelia Wright, et al., opposants, and John O'Meara opposant en sous ordre (subordinately).\"\nThe Prothonotary certifies he cannot after diligent search find any of the oppositions in the above case.

Ottawa.\nThis was certainly on its face a good and perfect confirmation by a Court of competent jurisdiction of the Crown's title, and, I think, put the Crown, from the moment it was adjudged for the Crown, in good faith, with a title on its face good and authentic.\nThen, what does the Code declare in reference to prescription. Art. 2,206 of the Civil Code declares:\nSubsequent purchasers in good faith, under a translatory title, derived either from a precarious or subordinate possessor, or from any other person, may prescribe by ten years against the proprietor during such subordinate or precarious holding.\nArt. 1,449:\nThe purchaser of an immovable, which is subject to or hypothecated for dower, cannot prescribe against either the wife or children so long as such dower is not open. Prescription runs against children of full age during the lifetime of their mother from the period when the dower opens.\nArt. 2,251:\nHe who acquires a corporeal immovable in good faith, under a translatory title, prescribes the ownership thereof, and liberates himself from the servitudes, charges and hypothecs upon it by an effective possession in virtue of such title during ten years.\nArt. 2,253:\nIt is sufficient that the good faith of subsequent purchasers existed at the time of the purchase, even when their effective possession only commenced later. Knowledge acquired since will not vitiate the title[26].\nArt. 2,193:\nFor the purposes of prescription, the possession of a person must be continuous and uninterrupted, peaceable, public, unequivocal, and as proprietor.\nArt. 2,194:\nA person is always presumed to possess for himself and as proprietor, if it be not proved that his possession was begun for another.\nArt. 2,202:\nGood faith is always presumed; he who alleges bad faith, must prove it. Then as to what will amount to interruption:\nArt. 2,224, after providing that a judicial demand in proper form served, &c., creates civil interruption, provides that:\nNo extra judicial demand, even when made by a notary or bailiff, and accompanied with the titles, or even signed by the parties notified, is an interruption, if there be not an acknowledgment of the right.\nNow with reference to prescription, I cannot assent to the proposition contended for by the appellant, that the Crown could not acquire by prescription before the Code, and that before the establishment of the Exchequer Court of Canada the Crown could not prescribe against the subject.\nArt. 2,211, which declares, as old law, that the Crown may avail itself of prescription, and says the subject may interrupt such prescription by means of a petition of right apart from the cases in which the law gives another remedy, in express terms negatives the proposition thus put forward, and which I am bound to accept as an authoritative exposition of the law.\nWhat, then, is the position of the Crown in reference to this property? It must be admitted the Crown entered lawfully and has held possession continuously and peaceably for 26 or 27 years. Now, assuming that a documentary title has not been shewn, and that the expropriation has not been regular, and that the judgment of confirmation did not do what it professes to do, viz., bar all claims and make the Crown \"the incommutable proprietor\" of the property, is not the Crown in a position to invoke a 10 years' prescription as claimed on its behalf with respect to that portion of the property conveyed by Mrs. Sparks and her husband to the Crown? Wholly apart from the 9 Vic., c. 37, I think the deed from Sally Olmstead and Sparks to Her Majesty, having been duly passed as a deed of sale in authentic form, was a conveyance which, if the grantors had been the owners of the property, would have conveyed the title to Her Majesty, and, therefore, was a translatory title sufficient in law to base a prescription; and without discussing whether bad faith can be attributed to the Crown, it is, to my mind, abundantly clear that as to this deed there is no pretence for saying that there is the slightest evidence of bad faith at the time the deed was executed in September, 1849. There is not a particle of evidence to show that the Crown or any of its officers had any knowledge or intimation that the interest of Mrs. Sparks was precarious or subordinate, or that she and her husband were not what they professed to be, and that they sold as the absolute owners of the property; and it cannot be disputed that, from the date of that deed till the present time\u2014a period of upwards of 30 years\u2014the Crown has been and still is in the continuous and uninterrupted, peaceable, public, unequivocal possession as proprietor. Under such circumstances I am at a loss to understand how it can be successfully contended that the exception claiming a 10 years' prescription has not been made out.\nAs to the deeds from Leamy, they stand in a somewhat different position, because it is claimed to be shewn that by divers letters and documents from the Public Works Department, dated respectively 11th April, 1853, 16th April, 1853, 27th April, 1853, 18th May, 1855, and also a direct intimation from two of the parties interested in the property in these words:\u2014\nHull, April 26, 1855.\nTo the Honorable the Commissioner of Public Works:\nSir,\u2014\nWe desire to state for your information and for the information of the Government, that the proposed sale of land in the township of Hull, by Mr. A. Leamy to the Government, is made without the sanction of the individuals who are mainly interested as proprietors of that land; that we are personally interested in the land, and have an incidental interest towards another portion included in the proposed sale. You will use this information as you deem mete, and should it prove of any benefit to the public service, it will be most gratifying to\nYour most obedient, humble servants,\n(Signed,) Thomas McGoey.\nHull Wright.\nthat the Department and the officers engaged in buying this property for the Crown had knowledge of the defects in Leamy's title, and so subsequently taking a deed from him and his wife as absolute owners placed the Crown in bad faith. It must be borne in mind, that though Mrs. Sparks and husband's deed to Leamy, on its face dealt with and conveyed her interest in the property as simply a right of dower, Leamy's deed to the Crown distinctly stated on its face that he and his wife were the absolute owners, and it must be likewise remembered that he had a quit claim dated 3rd February, 1853, from the heirs of Philemon Wright of all their interest in the lot assigned to the widow, and this may possibly account for the deed from the widow to him dealing only with the question of dower. If this quit claim must be treated as I have already pointed out, I think it must be as a genuine document.\nWhen the deeds were made by Leamy and wife to the Crown, he was actually in the position of absolute owner by force of the widow's deed and the quit claim of the heirs; and if so, the Crown purchasing from him as owner, and receiving a deed of sale in authentic form to convey the interest, without reference to the Public Works Act, surely the Crown cannot now be said by the person claiming under these very heirs to have purchased in bad faith? But it is said the Crown on the face of one of the deeds took security or caution. I think this should have no prejudicial effect; as difficulties had been started, the officers of the Government no doubt felt it their duty to take every precaution, even if it. might be considered excessive caution, to secure the public against any possible difficulty arising. I do not think it is a reasonable presumption that the Crown, or the officers of the Crown, should desire to take a bad title, still less to buy from a person whom they knew to be falsely putting himself forward as owner, and take a deed from him as owner, when they knew, or had reason to believe, the property belonged to others, and this too when they had an Act of Parliament under which the property and an undeniable title could be acquired in defiance of the real owner.\nBut the good faith of the Crown does not rest on this alone. Application is made to the Superior Court for a confirmation of this title from Leamy, and there we find the very parties who signed the so called protest opposing the confirmation, and though the oppositions could not be found, from the defense au fonds en droit filed to the oppositions, we can readily discover what had been alleged by them against the confirmation, viz., \"That they, the opposants, were the proprietors of the property conveyed, and that Leamy and wife were not and had no right to convey the property, and that confirmation of title should not be granted unless upon payment to the said opposants of a portion of the money deposited in Court.\" Instead of making good the oppositions, what do we next find? One of the opposants moving to be permitted to withdraw and discontinue his opposition; and on the 3rd July, 1856, when motion is made on behalf of Her Majesty that a sentence or judgment of the honorable Court be now granted confirming the title of Her Majesty in the cause deposited with the Prothonotary, all the opposants, including McGoey and Hull Wright, consenting by their respective attornies to such judgment.\nBut as the petitioner has attempted to fasten bad faith on the Crown, through the communications which passed between the different officers in respect to the property, there would seem to be no impropriety on a question of this kind in looking at all that passed, and reading all the communications, rather than selecting some and rejecting others. If we do this, the letter written on the 24th July, 1856, after the judgment obtained by the attorney of Record to the Commissioners of Public Works, which is as follows:\u2014\nAylmer, 24th July, 1856.\nTo the Honorable the Commissioners of Public Works, Toronto:\nGentlemen,\u2014\nI beg to enclose herewith the deed of sale of the 7th May, 1855; from Andrew Leamy and his wife to Her Majesty, the ratification thereof by the Honorable Frs. Lemieux under date 19th May, 1855, and an enregistered copy of the judgment of confirmation, which I obtained at the last term of the Superior Court, in this district, and which fully completes for the Government exclusive title to the lands purchased under the above deed, at the same time that it frees them from all incumbrances. I have also effected a purchase from Dr. Church of that portion of his property, which had been assumed by you for the Gatineau works. * * * *\nI have the honor to be,\nGentlemen,\nYour obedient servant,\n(Signed,) T. McCord.\nwould show very conclusively that from that time those representing the Crown believed, and acted on the belief, that by that judgment the exclusive title of the Crown, free from all incumbrances, was fully completed; and from that time the Crown should be held to be in good faith.\nBut, wholly apart from this, after this judgment, thus passed and unappealed from, has remained in the records of the Court unchallenged in any way by any party for any cause whatever for upwards of 23 years, is it not asking too much of this Court to say, that in favor of a party claiming under deeds of gift from these very people, and actually from the widow of Leamy who made the deeds, that the Crown has not acted in good faith, and has not been for ten years, in the words of the article of the Civil Code, in good faith \"in the continuous and uninterrupted, peaceable and public, unequivocal possession\" of the land now claimed as proprietor thereof.\nAfter giving this case much more than ordinary consideration, I have arrived at the conclusion, that under the deed of September, 1849, the Crown purchased by a good translatory title 21 acres, 1 rood and 25 perches of this property, and has since possessed the same as absolute owners, and nothing has since taken place to disturb or interrupt this possession, and that the Crown has a legal title by ten years' prescription.\nAs to the 65 acres acquired under Leamy's deeds, though there may be some doubt as to the right of Mrs. Sparks to sell the legal estate, yet as it was shown Leamy got deeds from the very heirs through whom the petitioner claims, and as the title was confirmed by a judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction, at any rate from the date of the judgment of confirmation, if not from the date of the deeds, the Crown has been in good faith, and therefore acquired a legal title by prescription of 10 years.\nFournier, J.:\u2014\nThe property claimed by the suppliant, the present appellant, is part of lots 2 and 3, containing two hundred acres each, in the 5th range of the township of Hull, originally granted to Philemon Wright, by Letters Patent from the Crown, on the 5th January, 1806.\nOn 25th April, 1808, the said Philemon Wright, by indenture, transferred and ceded the said lots of land, together with some other property, to Philemon Wright Jr., his son.\nPhilemon Wright Jr. married Sarah, alias Sally, Olmstead on the 4th May, 1808, without having previously made a contract of marriage, and the above property, by the sole operation of the law, became subject to the customary dower of Sally Olmstead and the children issue of her marriage with said Philemon Wright. He died about the 4th December, 1821, leaving as his sole heirs and representatives, Philemon Wright, now Philemon Wright, senior; Hull Wright, now deceased; Pamelia Wright, now wife of Thomas McGoey, of the said Township of Hull, yeoman; Horatio Wright, now deceased; Wellington Wright, also deceased; Serina Wright, also deceased; Erexina Wright, now widow of the late Andrew Leamy; and Sarah Wright, now widow of the late Andrew Boucher; to wit, eight children, all issue of his marriage with the said Sarah Olmstead, his wife, who became seized and possessed of his estate, according to the laws of the said Province of Quebec, equally for one undivided eighth each.\nWellington Wright, one of the said heirs, died at Ottawa, about the year 1856, leaving no issue and without having made a will; leaving his surviving sisters and brothers his heirs-at-law.\nHull Wright, also one of the said heirs, died without having made a will, about the 22nd April, 1857, leaving eleven heirs-at-law, nine of whom were the lawful issue of his marriage with Suzan Morehead, to wit: Philemon Wright, Isabella Wright, Samuel Wright, Pamelia Wright, Sarah Wright, Suzanna Wright, Serina Wright, Mary Jane Wright, Helen Wright, and two children issue of his marriage with Mary Sully.\nHoratio Wright, another of Philemon Wright's heirs, died intestate, without issue, and leaving as his heirs-at-law his brothers and sisters.\nErexina Wright also died without issue or will, thus leaving the surviving brothers and sisters the heirs-at-law of Philemon Wright, each for one-fifth jointly with her nieces and nephews for one-fifth as representing Hull Wright their father deceased.\nIn 1862 Suzan Wright, daughter of Hull Wright, died in Ottawa leaving as issue of her marriage with Melvin Whiting, Emma Whiting, the sole heir of her mother's rights in the succession of Philemon Wright Jr.\nSo the only representatives of the said Philemon Wright Jr., above-mentioned and of his three children, deceased, Horatio Wright, Wellington Wright, and Serina Wright, are:\u2014\n1st. Philemon Wright, of the said City of Hull, carpenter.\n2nd. Pamelia Wright, of the said Township of Hull, wife of Thomas McGoey, of the same place, yeoman.\n3rd.

Sarah, alias Sally, Wright, of the Township of Nepean, in the County of Carleton, in the Province of Ontario, widow of the late John Boucher.\n5th. The said children of the said Hull Wright, to wit:\u20141. Philemon Wright, of the said City of Ottawa, saddler; 2. Mary Jane Wright, of the said City of Ottawa, wife of David Allen of the same place, carpenter; 3. Serina Wright, of the said City of Ottawa, widow of the late George Hoisted, in his lifetime of the said Township of Hull, trader; 4. Helen Wright of the said City of Ottawa, widow of Melvin Whiting, in his lifetime of the same place, laborer; 5. Samuel Wright, now absent from the Dominion of Canada; 6. Pamelia Wright, now of Burlington, in the State of Iowa, wife of John Sharp; 7. Isabella Wright, now absent from the Dominion of Canada; 8. Emma Wright, of the City of Chicago, in the State of Illinois, wife of James D. Fanning, of the same place; 9. Alfred Wright, of Cleveland, State of Ohio; 10. Sarah, alias Sally, Wright, represented by her said children, issue of her marriage with the said Richard Olmstead, viz:\u2014 1st. Alexander Olmstead; 2nd. Edith Olmstead. 3rd. Howard Olmstead; 4th, Charles Olmstead; and 11, Suzanna Wright, represented by her daughter, issue of her marriage with Melvin Whiting, viz:\u2014Emma Whiting.\nThe appellant, in virtue of several deeds of donation mentioned in the petition, which were duly executed and registered, became the sole owner of the rights of the said heirs of Philemon Wright in a property, being part of Lots Nos. 2 and 3, in the 5th Range of the Township of Hull, containing 159 acres of land and water, the metes and bounds being given as follows in the said deeds of donation, to wit:\u2014\n\"Commencing at a post planted in the fifth range line on the boundary between lots number one and two, thence in a westerly direction following the said fifth range line a distance of forty chains and six and one half links to a post planted at the intersection of said fifth range line with the centre line dividing lot number three; thence in a northerly direction at nearly right angles to the said fifth range line, following the said centre dividing line of lot number three, a distance of forty chains to a post planted; thence in an easterly direction parallel to the said fifth range line, a distance of thirty-five chains, more or less, to the water edge of the River Gatineau; thence following down stream the water edge of the River Gatineau a distance of five chains, more or less, to a post planted; thence in a southerly direction, parallel to the aforesaid centre dividing line of lot number three, a distance of thirty-five chains, more or less, to the place of beginning.\"\nThis property, by a certain deed of partition and division, (partage), to which reference will be made hereafter, between the heirs of Philemon Wright Jr., on the one part, and Sally Olmstead his widow, of the other part, was set apart for her use and benefit by virtue of her customary dower.\nSally Olmstead was married subsequently to Nicholas Sparks the 20th November, 1826, and died in Ottawa on the 9th October, 1871.\nIt is from this Sally Olmstead, who had but the usufruct of this property, that the government derive their title to that part of the property, which they alleged to have purchased by certain deeds mentioned in their defence.\nThe suppliant claims this property, together with a sum of $200,000 for the rents, issues and profits derived therefrom by the government, since their illegal detention thereof.\nThe crown pleaded to this petition of right: 1st. by demurrer, defense en droit, because the petition fails to describe by a clear and intelligible description the limits and position of the lots in question, as in the possession of Her Majesty; and, also, because the petition is insufficient in law in so far as the petitioner has failed to allege any signification to Her Majesty of the deeds of gift or transfer in virtue of which he claims the said property and said rents, issues and profits, which he estimates to amount to $200,000.\n2nd. By peremptory exception averring that Her Majesty became and was seized and possessed of said premises by various deeds of sale and alleged inter alia:\nThat by deed of sale duly made and passed before Larue, notary public, and witnesses, at Hull, aforesaid, on the 12th day of September, 1849, Sarah Olmstead, or Sally Olmstead, of Bytown, in Upper Canada, wife of Nicholas Sparks, of Bytown, aforesaid, and by her said husband duly authorized, together with her said husband, for divers good and valid considerations in deed mentioned, sold, transferred, conveyed and made over to Her Majesty the tract or parcel of land in said deed described as follows, to wit:\nA certain tract, piece and parcel of land required for the use of the Gatineau Works, and described as follows, to wit: A certain tract, piece or parcel of land commencing at the edge of the Gatineau River, on the south side, on the boundary line between lots number one and two, in the fifth concession of the said township of Hull; thence on the boundary line between lots one and two aforesaid, south, two degrees and fifteen minutes, magnetically, thirty-two chains to the edge of the outlet of the Gatineau Pond; thence westerly along the edge of the outlet of the Pond, and northerly along the edge of the Pond, to a point north, fifty-six and three-quarters degrees west, magnetically, nine chains and seventy links from where the said distance on the said boundary line terminated at the edge of the Gatineau Pond; thence north, thirteen and three-quarters degrees east magnetically, twenty-eight chains to the edge of the Gatineau River; thence along the river edge with the stream to the place of beginning, being south twenty-two degrees magnetically, three chains and fifty-six links, more or less, containing by admeasurement twenty-one acres, one rood, and twenty-five perches.\nThat by a certain other deed, duly made and passed before Young and his colleague, notaries, at Aylmer, aforesaid, on the said 7th day of May, 1855, under the number 1032, the said Andrew Leamy and the said Erexina Wright, his wife, by her husband thereto duly authorized, for divers good and valid considerations in said deed mentioned, sold, transferred and assigned, with promise of warranty against all gifts, debts, dowers, claims, mortgages and other incumbrances whatsoever, to Her Majesty the Queen, accepting thereof by the Commissioners of Public Works, duly represented and acting by the said William Foster Coffin and Thomas McCord, those certain other lots or pieces of land in said last mentioned deed described as follows, to wit:\u2014\nSecondly.\u2014A piece or parcel of land, for the most part covered with water, the water covering the same being portions of the south and south-east parts of lots numbers two and three in the fifth concession of the township of Hull, colored yellow on the plan number one, annexed to the said deed of sale entered into by the said parties, bearing even date with these presents, and executed before us, the said notaries above referred to, described as follows:\nCommencing at the point C of the said plan, on the side line between numbers one and two in the concession aforesaid, about two rods south of the high water line of the creek represented on the said last mentioned plan; thence south westerly to point B, on the line between the fourth and fifth ranges of the said township of Hull; thence westerly along the concession line aforesaid to the point A on the said plan; thence north-westerly and south-easterly, being also about two rods west of the Gatineau Pond to point K on said plan; thence south-westerly to point L at the water edge of Gatineau Pond; thence southwesterly along the margin of the pond to point M on said plan; thence south-easterly through the water of the said pond to point J on the eastern margin of the said pond; thence southerly, southeasterly and north-easterly, following the windings of the said pond to point O on the said line between the lots numbers one and two in the fifth range of the township of Hull aforesaid; thence following the course of the said line, in a southerly direction to point C, the place of beginning, containing by admeasurement sixty-five acres and ten perches, be the same more or less.\n3rd. By peremptory exception, the Crown also relied on a deed of ratification passed before Mr. Petitclerc and colleague, notaries public, the 19th May, 1855, of these two lots of land sold to Her Majesty by the deed above mentioned and bearing date the 7th May, 1855. The Crown also averred that this deed of sale, in conformity with the statute, 9 Vic., c. 37, was deposited with the prothonotary of the Superior Court, in the district of Ottawa, and that it was duly confirmed by judgment of said Court rendered on the 3rd July, 1866, and that by reason thereof, and in virtue of the provisions contained in the statute, all claims to the lands (including dower not yet open) as well as all hypothecs and incumbrances thereon were barred.\n4th. Prescription of 30, 20 and 10 years. There was also the general issue and a supplementary plea claiming value of improvements.\nTo the exception of prescription the petitioner answered, denying the allegations thereof, and more particularly the good faith of the defendant.\nTo the 4th and 5th exceptions the petitioner answered, denying that the parties to these sales had any right of property on the land they sold, and denying the legality of the sales and of the judgment of confirmation.\nTo the 6th exception, the petitioner answered that the pretended renunciation by the heirs in favor of Leamy is a forgery.\nTo the 7th the petitioner replied generally.\nTo the supplementary plea, the petitioner alleged bad faith on the part of defendant. There were also general answers to all the pleas.\nThe two points raised by the demurrer, to wit: the insufficiency of the description of the property claimed and the want of the signification of the transfer of the issues and profits, after argument on the demurrer, were decided by Mr. Justice Strong in favor of the appellant. There has been no appeal from this judgment.\nMr. Justice J. T. Taschereau, who rendered the final judgment in the case, from which the present appeal is brought, having stated, that admitting the suppliant ought to succeed on the merits, he would yet be unable to obtain judgment in consequence of the insufficiency of the description of the property claimed, it becomes necessary for me to deal with this part of the case.\nIt was not by demurrer, but by, an exception to the form, exception \u00e0 la forme, that the Attorney General for Her Majesty should have objected to this alleged irregularity or insufficiency of the description of the property in question. The judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Strong is in accordance with Art. 116 C. C. P. Even Mr. Justice Taschereau admits that this irregularity should have been objected to by an exception to the form (exception \u00e0 la forme), but adds, if he had to give a judgment in favor of the suppliant, he could not state nor indicate where the 159 acres of land and water were situated. Mr. Justice Strong, on the contrary, was of opinion that the situation, the boundaries and the extent of the land claimed, were sufficiently described in order to enable the Court to adjudicate upon the petition. By reading the description given in the petition, it is easily ascertained what property is claimed. If the appellant had proved that the Government were in possession of the whole 159 acres, a better description by metes and bounds could not be given. The difficulty, if any, arises, that having a right to claim but one part of the property, it must be ascertained. This, at first sight, may seem difficult, but is easily done by establishing the number and the proportion of shares of the heirs represented by the appellant in the property in question.\nAs will be hereafter demonstrated, by digesting the titles, the proportion the appellant represents is 47 undivided 55ths, in 88 acres, 1 rood and 29 perches of these 159 acres.\nFor these reasons, I am of opinion that this ground was insufficient, and that the judgment dismissing this part of the defence should be affirmed, and that the final judgment ought to have maintained the same principle.\nThe second ground of demurrer, which relates to the want of signification of the transfer, not having been decided on the merits by Mr. Justice Strong, as he dismissed it because it had been improperly pleaded, had to be decided upon by the final judgment. This has been done by Mr. Justice Taschereau, who decided that the appellant should have signified to Her Majesty the transfer of the rents and profits of the property before filing their petition of right. It is now a well settled rule of law that a transferee of a debt cannot claim it from the debtor until the deed of transfer has been delivered to him. The appellant in this case not having caused this signification to be made, cannot now claim, as representing the heirs of Philemon Wright Jr., the rents and profits due and accrued before he became the owner.\nThis long debated question has been definitely settled since the publication of the Code, and the decisions of the Courts are now in accordance with the law, although it is well known they were not in the province of Quebec when the Custom of Paris was in force.\nFor these reasons, the petition, in so far as it prays for the rents and profits due and accrued before the date of the execution of the deeds of grant to the appellant, must be dismissed. It should be dismssed also because the rents and profits transferred by the heirs Wright did not belong to them, but were, on the contrary, as we shall see hereafter, the property, in her capacity of dowager, of their mother, who died on the 9th October, 1871.\nThe principal question, and, no doubt, the one upon which depends the determination of this appeal, is that which has reference to the validity of the deed by which Her Majesty purchased this property notwithstanding the rights and pretensions of the appellant. I refer to the deed of sale (exhibit of the respondent), dated 17th May, 1855, to the Crown, represented by William F. Coffin and Thomas McCord, Esquires, as attorneys for the Commissioners of Public Works, from Andrew Leamy and Erexina Wright, his wife.\nBefore examining this point it is necessary, I believe, to ascertain if in the absence of any adverse title, the titles relied upon by the appellant are sufficient in law to enable him to recover the property claimed.\nThis property, as I have before stated, was originally sold by letters patent dated 3rd January, 1806, to Philemon Wright. He was, no doubt, the only true and lawful owner of it when on the 25th April, 1808, by deed in due and valid form, he transferred it together with other lots to Philemon Wright Jr., his son. The latter being possessed of this property at the time of his marriage, as before stated, having died intestate, the property fell to his heirs-at-law, who became proprietors immediately after his death, subject to the customary dower of their mother. The pleadings tried to raise some doubts on this part of the case, and the crown relied on the absence and irregularities of some of the registers according to law in the place where the marriages, births and deaths of the family of Philemon Wright Jr. and of his issue took place. Mr. Justice Taschereau, in his judgment, uses the following language:\u2014\nNow, there are a great number of Philemon Wright's children, grandchildren and representatives, have they established their filiation or successive rights? It is very doubtful, and, in the interest of the children, it is better not to discuss it.\nThis objection has not before this Court the importance which was given to it before the Court below. The appellant, knowing of the impossibility of getting those necessary certificates, and of the irregularities in the keeping of the registers, specially alleges the fact in his petition, and claimed the benefit of producing secondary evidence to prove the legal filiation of his auteurs. This proof has been given, and it is so complete that the Crown before this Court on the argument did not rely on any such irregularity. For this reason I will not review the parol and written evidence adduced on this part of the case. I cannot say more than to my mind, it completely establishes the filiation of the heirs of Philemon Wright Jr. These heirs, therefore, had a good and valid title to the property in question, and could validly dispose of it, as they did, to the appellant, unless it can be shewn that at the time they executed the divers deeds of donation in favor of the appellant, mentioned in the petition, they had previously alienated their rights in the said property. The defence has tried to supply this proof, and, in support, have fyled a large number of deeds, the greater part of which have no reference whatever to the property in question. In order to dispel the confusion that exists, it will be necessary to examine the details of certain transactions which took place between the heirs in relation to this property, and also between some of these heirs and strangers to the family.\nThe most important transaction is that which took place by an agreement in writing, dated 5th March, 1838.\nBy this agreement, the heirs of Philemon Wright Jr., after having ascertained by survey made by Anthony Swalwell, Deputy Surveyor, that the quantity of land in lots No. 2, 3 and 4, in the 5th concession of the township of Hull, was 591 acres, 1 rood and 120 perches, including a certain pond of water, the said portions of said land having been sub-divided, allotted the following portions to each, that is to say:\nTo Philemon Wright,\n43 acres, 2 roods.\n\" Hull Wright,\n43 \" 2 \"\n\" Pamelia Wright,\n49 \"\n\" Horatio Wright,\n53 \" 1 \" 24 p.\n\" Wellington Wright,\n48 \"\n\" Serina Wright,\n60 \"\n\" Erexina Wright,\n65 \"\n\" Sally Wright,\n70 \"\nThis division is followed by the following declaration: \"and to Sally Olmstead, our mother, one hundred and fifty-nine acres.\"\nThis portion was reserved to her in lieu of her dower, as it is amply established by the deed of sale she executed in favor of A. Leamy in 1852, and which will be spoken of hereafter. The heirs then and there signed, in favor of each other, certain quit claims or transfers to validate the division and allotment of the land in question. It cannot be said that this agreement or partition gave any right of proprietorship to Sally Olmstead, who did not even sign one single one of these quit claims or transfers. The effect was to limit her dower to the usufruct of these 159 acres, but it gave her no right of proprietorship over the same, which remained the undivided property of the heirs. It is, however, contended that this division, in so far as it affects her, gave her proprietary rights over this portion. Such an interpretation is in direct opposition to the terms made use of in the agreement and cannot be entertained. Moreover, this partition, being signed and executed by the tutors, was an absolute nullity in law.\nNow, having shown the heirs to be proprietors of the portions of land allotted to them, I find that several of them sold, not their share in the 159 acres, but their allotted portions. The first was Wellington Wright, who on the 11th January, 1837, sold to Nicholas Sparks (one of the vendors to Her Majesty,) all his rights, title and interest in the 48 acres which were allotted to him in the said lots 2, 3 and 4. This sale was confirmed by his co-heirs on the 5th March, 1838. On the same day, 11th January, 1837, Horatio Wright, another of the heirs, sold to the same Nicholas Sparks the 53 acres, 1 rood and 24 perches, which were allotted to him by the above partition.\nThe 30th April, 1839, Sally Wright and William Colter, her husband, gave a lease to Andrew Leamy of the 70 acres allotted by the said division to Sally Wright, and on the 1st of May, 1859, executed a release with all rights of property to the same Andrew Leamy.\nThe defence also alleges another deed of sale, dated 23rd May, 1859, before Young, N. P., from P. Church to Her Majesty, of a strip of land forming part of the 60 acres allotted to Serina Wright by the deed of partition and quit claim to her.\nBy referring to all these deeds of sale and quit claims by the said heirs, to wit: Wellington Wright, Horatio Wright, Sally Wright, wife of W. Colter, and Serina Wright, it is clearly established that they only sold the portion of land which had been allotted to each of them by the deed of partition and quit claim of the 5th March, 1838. There is no mention of their rights in the 159 acres, the usufruct of which was enjoyed by their mother, Sally Olmstead, for her dower, and there is not a single expression to be found in these deeds which might be interpreted as evidencing the intention of alienating their rights in the dower.\nThe only document which refers to the dower for the time is Exhibit 14, produced by the Crown, and registered on the 17th April, 1876.\nWith reference to this document, I will here remark that the statement contained in the respondent's factum, which reads as follows: \"And the seven heirs had, by Exhibit 14, transferred their rights to Andrew Leamy in respect to the 159 acres in question,\" is entirely inaccurate. There are only four instead of seven of the heirs, which are named in that document, to wit: H. G. Wright, Elizabeth Wright (Mrs. Leamy), Sarah Wright, and Philemon Wright.\nBy this document, dated the 3rd February, 1853, these four heirs would appear to have transferred, for good and valuable consideration, previously received, all their rights in the above property subjected to the dower as follows: \"All right, title, interest, claim of whatever nature, either as heirs or otherwise, which we or any of us now have, or may hereafter have, to or, upon the following lot of land and premises, to wit: that piece or parcel of land and pond of water heretofore belonging to Philemon Wright Jr., in his lifetime, of Hull aforesaid, and which, at a division or partition of his property between his heirs and his widow, Sarah Olmstead, was set apart to and for the use of the said Sarah Olmstead, as will appear by reference to a diagram drawn by Anthony Swalwell, surveyor, annexed to a transfer made by the said Sarah Olmstead to the said Andrew Leamy.\"\nAt the foot of this document, we find subscribed the names of H. G. Wright, Elizabeth Wright, Sarah Wright and P. Wright, which, the defence alleges, are the true signatures of the parties, and witnessed by James Goodwin and John Doyle.\nThe appellant contends that the document is a forged one.\nOne of the witnesses to the document, James Goodwin, admits his signature, but says: \"I have not the slightest recollection of the names being set to said document, nor the place where it was signed. Without my own signature being there, I should not have recollected anything about it.\" To the following question: \"Have you any recollection of being asked to be a witness to said document by any one, or is it by your signature being there that you supposed you were called a witness?\" He answers: \"All I can swear to is, that is my signature, but I have no recollection seeing the party sign the said document.\"\nFurther on he says: \"I have no recollection of the signing in my presence, I could not swear whether I was present or not when they signed.\"\nIt is proved that the other witness, John Doyle, is dead. Being examined as to the genuineness, of his signature, Goodwin says that, to the best of his judgment, it is his signature. M. Farley, who was examined on this point, says: \"From the long lapse of time that has taken place, I would not undertake to swear that the signature, John Doyle, is his signature, that is to say, to swear positively to it, but my impression is that it is his signature.\"\nThe defence also endeavored to prove by witnesses that there was a resemblance between the signatures of P. Wright, Horatio G. Wright and Sarah Wright, compared with their present writings. Altho' such proof is generally of little value, in this case the evidence in support of their contention is very weak.\nThe witness Clark, who produced some receipts in order to compare the signatures, says that he believes the signatures at the foot of this document, U. U. No. 14, H. Wright, P. Wright and Sarah Wright were written by the parties who signed the receipts he produced; but at the same time declares that once only he saw P. Wright sign in his presence, but never saw him write. He points out a difference between the signature of H. G. Wright on the exhibit U. U. and the receipts signed by him.\nThis evidence, in absence of any proof in rebuttal, would certainly not be sufficient to declare these signatures genuine. Yet, in this case, there are the declarations of two of the parties, who swear that they never signed such a document. Both are interested in the suit, and their evidence, therefore, would not be of much weight were it not corroborated by certain statements of facts which could have been rebutted. The first declares that at the time this document is purported to have been executed and signed, to wit: 3rd February, 1853, he was passing the winter of 1853 at the Upper Gatineau, where he was making lumber in the shanties. He produced his memorandum book containing the following entry: \"February 3, 1853, J. McCondy,, 32.\" This fact, which was not contradicted, proves positively that the document does not contain his genuine signature. As to Sarah Wright, it is proved that for seven years she had not been on speaking terms with Mr. and Mrs. Leamy, and that the first time she spoke to them it was on the occasion of her second marriage. This fact tends to corroborate her denial of her signature. The other alleged parties to this document were not examined, but we find H. E. Wright one year later informing, by an official letter, the Government that he is one of the proprietors of the property Leamy intended to sell. He was dead several years when the evidence on this petition was taken. If he had signed the document U. U. in favor of Leamy, it is not probable that he would have sent this protest. Elizabeth or Erexina Wright is Mrs. Leamy. Admitting even that this is her true signature, there can be no doubt that, as regards her, it is an absolute nullity. She was at the time under the control of her husband, sous puissance de mari, and no contract or deed affecting her immovable property could be executed by her in favor of her husband. The law forbids it. She could, however, authorized by her husband, have sold these rights to a third party, but this she has not done, as can be ascertained by referring to the deeds in which she appears with her husband.\nThere is, however, another ground which is sufficient to render the document in question of no value, supposing it to be genuine, and this covers all the alleged signatures. It is that a document or deed such as that one, purporting to convey real estate, not having been registered, cannot affect the petitioner who has purchased these rights, and has had his divers deeds of donation, &c., registered previously, as I have shown above.\nThen, also, in order that the Crown may set up successfully these quit claims, they must come within the 4th section of ch. 35, Cons. Stats., L. C., \"an Act respecting land held in Free and Common Socage, and the transmission and conveyance thereof.\" Now, according to the laws of England, these quit claims are invalid, because no consideration is mentioned.\nTo summarize, this document is of no value: 1st. because the signatures have not been legally proven; 2nd. inasmuch as it affect Mrs. Leamy's share, it is an absolute nullity; 3rd. if it was really signed by the parties, the purchaser (Leamy) has lost all the rights he acquired in virtue of that document, because he did not have it registered. In the deed dated 7th May, 1855, as well as in the other deeds, it is evident Mrs. Leamy did not sell any property of her own, but simply joined her husband in the sale of certain rights he had purchased from Mrs. Sparks, in order to give the purchaser a release of her dower or other matrimonial rights she might have upon the property sold thereby.\nThe different deeds themselves, which I have separately reviewed, prove conclusively that the heirs of Philemon Wright Jr. have never alienated any share of their proprietary rights in the said 159 acres set apart for the dower of Sarah Olmstead, their motherland a good reason for their not doing so before, no doubt, was because their mother, who had the usufruct of the property, only died on the 9th October, 1871.\nAlthough it has been established that the heirs of Philemon Wright have not alienated their rights in this property, (with the exception, perhaps, of Erexina Wright, Mrs. Leamy, as to two acres,) Her Majesty has, nevertheless, obtained conveyances of a certain portion of this property.\nThe examination of the title deeds of the auteurs of the Crown, which will be made hereafter, in respect to the plea of prescription relied on by the Crown, will show that these conveyances were made by persons who were not proprietors. But first, it is necessary to refer to the all important question raised on this appeal, viz: whether the conveyances of the property in question were made in conformity with the provisions of 9 Vic., c. 37, and whether the confirmation of this second title, which was granted of one of the conveyances on the 3rd July, 1856, by the Superior Court sitting at Aylmer, has the effect of divesting the lawful proprietor of his rights in the property. This statute, passed in amendment of 4 and 5 Vic., c. 38, establishing the Board of Works, makes special provisions in reference to the powers of the, commissioners in entering into agreements for the purchase of property for the public works of the province. The principal sections of the Act, which it is necessary to refer to in the present case, are the following:\nBy sec. 5 it is enacted:\nThat the said commissioners shall have power, by writing under their hands and seals, on behalf of the province, to make and enter into all necessary contracts, agreements, stipulations, bargains and arrangements with all and every person or persons whomsoever, upon, for, or respecting any act, matter or thing whatsoever, relative to the public works of this province * * *.\nSec. 8 says:\nThat it shall be lawful for the said commissioners to authorize their engineers * * * to enter into and upon any and all grounds to whomsoever belonging, and to survey and take levels * * * as they may deem necessary for any, or all, of the purposes and objects under the management and control of the said commissioners, as aforesaid; and the said commissioners, in and for the said purposes, shall, at all times, have power to acquire and take possession of all such lands or real estate, and to take possession of all such streams, waters and water courses, the appropriation of which, for the use, construction and maintenance of such public works as aforesaid, shall, in their judgment be necessary; and that the said commissioners may, for that purpose, contract and agree with all persons, seigniors, bodies corporate, guardians, tutors, curators and trustees whatsoever, not only for and on behalf of themselves, their heirs, successors and assigns, but also for and on behalf of those whom they represent, whether infants (minor children), absentees, lunatics, idiots, femes-covert, or other persons otherwise incapable of contracting, who are, or shall be possessed of or interested in such lands, real property, &c.\nAfter providing for the mode of compensation for such lands, &c., and tenders, in case of parties refusing to agree on compensation, the section goes on to say:\nIf the owner or owners of such land * * * do not reside in the vicinity of such property so required, then notice shall be given in the Official Gazette and in two distinct newspapers, published in, or adjoining, the district in which such property is situate, of the intention of the commissioners to cause possession to be taken of such lands * * * and after thirty days from the publication of the last notice, possession may be taken accordingly; and all land * * * contracted for, purchased, or otherwise acquired by the said commissioners in manner aforesaid, shall be vested in, and become, and be, the property of Her Majesty * * * and the respective conveyances thereof, not being notarial deeds, shall be brought to and recorded and enrolled in the office of the Registrar of this province, but being so enrolled, or being notarial deeds, need not otherwise be made by matter of record, and such conveyances may be accepted by the said commissioners on behalf of the Crown.\nSec. 9 enacts:\nThat in Lower Canada the compensation awarded as aforesaid, or agreed upon by the said commissioners, and any party who might, under this Act, validly convey the lands, or lawfully in possession thereof as proprietor, for any lands which might be lawfully taken under this Act without the consent of such proprietor, shall stand in the stead of such land; and any claim to, or hypothec, or encumbrance upon the said land, or any portion thereof, shall be converted into a claim to or upon the said compensation.\nAfter providing for payment of such compensation, and deposit of an authentic copy of the conveyance or award in the hands of the prothonotary of the then Queen's Bench (now Superior Court), in case the Commissioners shall have reason to think that hypothecs or claims exist, in order to purge the same, the clause further enacts:\nAnd proceedings shall be thereupon had upon application on behalf of the Crown for the confirmation of such title in like manner as in other cases of confirmation of title, except, that in addition to the usual contents of the notice, the prothonotary shall state that such title (that is the conveyance or award), is under this Act, and shall call upon such persons entitled to, or to any part of the land, or representing or being the husband of any parties so entitled, to file their oppositions for their claims to the compensation, or any part thereof, and all such oppositions shall be received and adjudged upon by the Court, and the judgment of confirmation shall forever bar all claims to the lands or any part thereof (including dower not yet open), as well as all hypothecs or encumbrances upon the same; and the Court shall make such order for the distribution, payment or investment of the compensation, and for the securing of the rights of all parties interested as to right and justice, according to the provisions of this Act and to law shall appertain.\nSec. 17 enacts:\nThat the chief commissioner, for the time being, shall be the legal organ of the commissioners, and all writings or documents signed by him and countersigned by the secretary, and sealed with the seal of the chief commissioner, and no others, shall be held to be acts of the said commissioners.\nThough there have been several amendments to this statute, these provisions have not been changed,\u2014they are even now to be found in the statute of the Dominion, 31 Vic., ch. 12, respecting the Public Works.\nSuch were the formalities and provisions by which the commissioners were bound, in order to make a valid contract for the purchase of the property in question. Have these provisions been complied with, in order that Her Majesty may avail herself of the extraordinary and exceptional advantages which are attached to the confirmation of a title obtained under this act?\nThe first instrument invoked by Her Majesty, and set up in the 4th plea or exception, is one passed in authentic form before Larue, notary, and witnesses, at Hull, on the 12th September, 1849. By this deed Sarah Olmstead, authorized by her husband, Nicholas Sparks, sells to Her Majesty, represented, as therein stated, by Hon. Etienne Tach\u00e9, Commissioner of Public Works, the property which is therein described, and which forms part of the land claimed by the appellant, and of which Sarah Olmstead had only the usufruct, as we have before ascertained.\nThe Commissioner of Public Works mentioned as representing Her Majesty, Hon. E. Tach\u00e9, was not a party to this instrument; he did not sign or seal it. It does not state that the contract is entered into in reference to Public Works, pursuant to the Statute 9 Vic., ch. 37. The consideration is declared to have been paid by Horace Merrill, Superintendent of the Slides, \"representing Her Majesty on the part of the Commissioner of Public Works,\" but it is not stated in virtue of what authorization he thus acted, nor did he sign the deed. Moreover, it does not appear by the record that this conveyance has ever been accepted by the commissioner, as provided in the 8th section, \"and such conveyance may be accepted by the commissioner on behalf of the Crown.\" No deed of ratification or confirmation of this title deed was ever obtained by the Crown. Under these circumstances it is apparent that the acquisition of this property was not made in accordance with the provisions of the 9th Vic., ch. 37. 1st. Because it was not purchased from a person who had power, under the statute, to convey; 2nd. Because the commissioner had no authority to delegate his powers under the act for the purpose of acquiring property, the statute only authorizing him to contract; 3rd. Because he was authorized to enter into contracts on behalf of the province only by writing under his hand and seal; 4th. Because he did not subsequently accept the conveyance under his hand and seal, the 17th section enacting that no writing or document shall be held to be the act of the commissioner unless signed and sealed by him, and countersigned by the secretary. Now, this instrument not being executed in conformity with the provisions required by law, is necessarily void and of no value. The commissioner could not purchase property otherwise than as provided by the statute which created the Board of Works and defined the powers of the commissioners. A similar interpretation has been given to the same clause by Sir William Richards, in the case of Wood vs. The Queen.\nIt will also be seen, that many of these defects above stated are to be found in the second title deed relied on by Her Majesty, as to the acquisition of another portion of this property, to wit: in the conveyance by Andrew, Leamy and Erexina Wright, his wife, dated the 7th May, 1855, and bearing the notary's number 1032. The Commissioners of Public Works do not appear as present at the time of the execution of this conveyance. In their stead Messrs. Coffin and McCord, not specifying their authorization, enter into an agreement obliging themselves se portant forts pour eux to have the deed of sale ratified within fifteen days thereof. On the 15th May, 1855, this conveyance was ratified by notarial deed passed at Quebec, before Mtre. Petitclerc and colleague, notaries, by Hon. Francois Lemieux, then Commissioner of Public Works, Thomas Begley, Secretary, but it was not sealed with his seal, as required by the 17th section of the Act.\nBy examining the abstract of titles of Leamy and his wife, the vendors, it is shown that they had acquired from Sarah Olmstead (who had only the dower, douairi\u00e9re,) their rights in the property sold, and that they had, as she had, only a precarious title, and that the statute did not authorize them to sell such property to the Commisioners of Public Works.\nLet us see who really were the parties authorized by the statute to sell to the commissioners? They are enumerated in section 8:\nSeigniors, bodies corporate, guardians, tutors, curators, and trustees whatsoever, not only for and on behalf of themselves, their heirs, successors and assigns, but also for and on behalf of those whom they represent, whether infants (minor children), absentees, lunatics, idiots, femes couvert, or other persons otherwise incapable of contracting, who are or shall be possessed of or interested in such lands, real property, streams, waters and water courses, as aforesaid.\nWe find here a large number of persons whose quality of legal representatives of the proprietors would not have been sufficient in law to enter into a contract of sale, had not the law, in the public interest, authorized them to do so.\nThe question then arises, are there other persons, besides those just enumerated, who can legally convey a property pursuant to the statute? The proprietor and the proprietor only, and the law says so in the most positive and unequivocal terms. In the following section it is there stated: \"any party who might, under this Act, validly convey the lands or is lawfully in possession thereof as proprietor.\" The first part of this sentence refers evidently to those who are named in section 8, and the latter part to the proprietors designated by the following words: \"those who are lawfully in possession as proprietors.\" Only these two classes of persons are authorized to give a title to the commissioners. Thus, a person who has only, say the usufruct, the right of dower, who is a tenant, or a squatter, could not give a valid conveyance, and all contracts entered into with them by the commissioners, affecting the property, would be absolutely null and void, and consequently do not come within the class of such titles as can be validly confirmed under the 9th section.\nIt must be borne in mind that this statute has introduced exceptional legislation, and must therefore, as all laws relating to the expropriation of the property of the subject, be rigorously and strictly construed. We cannot extend its provisions, even if it were in the public interest.\nIn this instance, if it is reasonable to suppose that the commissioners were authorized to purchase from the lawful proprietor, or from those who, (altho' they could not otherwise legally convey,) were authorized in their legal representative quality of proprietor to sell, surely it is impossible to go so far as to contend that this statute has authorized the purchase of A's property from a third party, which would be the case if the Crown had the right to acquire the property from the usufruitiere.\nThe commissioners, in order to avail themselves of the benefit of that statute, must have purchased from some person who was lawfully in possession as proprietor, or who had the representative character of the proprietor such as curator, tutor, &c. Leamy had not any such representative character, and he was not the proprietor.\nNor can the acquisition made from Leamy be justified or validated on the ground that the real owners, proprietors, could not be found, for the statute has made provision for such a case in the 8th section. It provides that it shall be the duty of the commissioners to give notice in the official Gazette, and in two distinct newspapers, of their intention to cause possession to be taken of the necessary land, and after thirty days from the publication of the last notice, the law authorizes them to take possession.\nThe commissioners did not think proper to adopt this mode of acquiring this property, but they purchased from Leamy, whom they knew was not the proprietor, as is clearly established by the writings (which will be hereafter mentioned) of Messrs. Begley, Secretary of the Board of Works; Coffin, Merrill, &c., writings which informed them that the heirs of Philemon Wright Jr., whose names were given, were the lawful proprietors of the land they required. Was it not their duty to purchase from these heirs; and if they did not wish to make a contract with them because Sally Olmstead, in virtue of her dower, or A. Leamy, as her assignee or representative, was still in possession of the property, could they not at least have proceeded against them, as they might and were bound to do against an unknown or absent proprietor, in conformity with the provision contained in section &, to which I have just referred? But, no, instead of doing so, they thought it proper to enter into a contract with a person whom the statute did not authorize to sell.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the two conveyances above cited, in so far as they are said to convey more than usufructuary rights, must be considered void, as being executed contrary to the provisions of the statute and conferring no right on Her Majesty.\nThese two conveyances are also void in consequence of of the non-compliance with an essential formality imposed by the statute, the affixing of the seal of the commissioner. This objection, at first sight, may seem but a technical objection, which should not entail such a grave consequences as the avoidance of a conveyance which would otherwise be valid. The statute provides, it is true, for the acquisition of property by deeds in authentic form, but it does not relieve the commissioner from the obligation of affixing his seal to such deeds; on the contrary, it declares that no other writing or document, than those bearing such seal, shall be held to be the act of the said Commissioner. The provision being \"no other,\" it cannot be denied that non-compliance with such a formality, when it is enacted by statute, will invalidate any document. The authorities cited hereafter establish this point beyond doubt, though the text of the law ought to be sufficient. The Commissioners of Public Works were, by virtue of the 9 Vic., c. 37, constituted a corporation, which could only make a contract or enter into an agreement in the manner prescribed by the Act, to wit: by a writing under section 8, and by affixing the seal of the chief commissioner, as provided in sec. 17, the latter section enacting, as I have before stated, that all writings and documents shall be signed and sealed by the chief commissioner and countersigned by the secretary, and no others (writings or documents) shall be held to be the acts of the commissioners. This formality of affixing the seal of the chief commissioner not having been complied with in either of these two conveyances, they cannot, for this reason also, be held to be the acts of the commissioners, and therefore cannot have any validity or effect under that statute.\nIn Marshall Wood vs. The Queen, a case to which I have before referred, decided by the late Chief Justice Richards in the Exchequer Court, the Crown, by demurrer to a petition of right claiming value of work done for and accepted by the Department of Public Works, averred: that by the express terms of the 7 sec. 31 Vic., c. 12, (D.) any such contract or agreement must have been signed and sealed by the Minister of Public Works, and charged that no such contract was in fact signed and sealed; and it was held that the words in the 7 sect. of the Public Works Act, (which is a re-enactment of sec. 17 of 9 Vic., c. 37, relating to Public Works,) \"no contract shall be binding on the Department unless signed and sealed by the Minister or his Deputy,\" must be considered imperative.\nWe now come to the fifth plea or exception, in which the Crown invokes the judgment of confirmation, dated 3rd July, 1856, pronounced by the Superior Court at Aylmer, confirming the deed of sale by Leamy and his wife above cited, 7th May, 1855, No. 1032. The statute, provides the mode to obtain the ratification of deeds of acquisition made by the commissioners pursuant to the statute, and says proceedings shall be had for confirmation \"of such title in like manner as in other cases of confirmation of title.\" The prothonotary is bound in the notice to be given to the interested parties to state that the demand for confirmation is made in virtue of the statute 9 Vic., c. 37. It also enacts that \"the judgment of confirmation shall for ever bar all claims to the lands or any part thereof (including dower not yet open,) as well as all hypothecs and incumbrances upon the same.\"\nThis disposition of the law is exceptional, and is a derogation to the laws in force, which would only have purged the hypothecs and incumbrances on the real estate, but would not have barred any rights of the lawful proprietor, who would still, notwithstanding the ratification, have been at liberty to claim them. But it can be easily understood that the Government, being desirous of purchasing real estate for the public interest, and in order to build public works, would wish to become the absolute owner, so that they might not be exposed to be ejected. This is what appears to me to have been done by the statute, but at the same time the proprietary rights of the subject have been respected. It was no doubt for the purpose of vesting in the commissioners an absolute title that the statute provided that they should contract with the person lawfully in possession as proprietor, imposing on them the duty of finding the true owner. If they do not purchase from him, it must be from the tutor, curator or other person having the legal quality of representing him, or they must adopt the special mode of proceeding provided for when the proprietor is not known or a non-resident.\nThe declaration that the judgment shall bar all claims to the lands cannot affect the proprietor; it does not say he shall forfeit his rights, if he does not pray to have them recognized by opposition, as the law supposes that these rights have been acquired, and that the proprietor sold all his interest before a judgment for confirmation can be asked for on behalf of the Crown. Therefore, if it is not the proprietor who has made the conveyance as provided for in the statute, then the confirmation cannot bar his rights without contravening the provision which imposes on the commissioners the duty of purchasing from him. The statute itself protects him from such an effect of a judgment of confirmation. In such a case the confirmation does not affect his proprietary rights any more than if the property had not been purchased by the Crown. The forfeiture of all rights of property here mentioned has only reference to the proprietary rights of those persons who did not convey themselves, but who sold by their representatives authorized by the statute, viz.: tutors, curators, &c., or to an unknown proprietor, when the statutory provisions in his favor have been complied with.\nSince the statute imposed on the commissioners the duty of taking a deed from the person lawfully in possession as proprietor, the law cannot have intended to confirm a title deed taken from the proprietor's neighbour. It would be a spoliation which was never intended, and which was not enacted. The confirmation of a title deed under the civil law does not bar the claims of the proprietor[27].\nThen is the title of the Crown, not having been taken in conformity with the statute, a valid title, in virtue of the right of the Crown to purchase independently of the statute? In my opinion, it would have been necessary for the person acting for the Crown to show he has been specially authorized, but then the title of the Crown would not be a title taken under the authority of ch. 37, 9 Vic., and therefore could not bar the claims of proprietors, nor would the ratification of such a title bar the proprietors' claims[28]. It is unnecessary to say more on this point, as the Crown has entirely relied on the statutory title.\nThe title deed being null and void,\u2014first, because it was not obtained from the person lawfully in possession as proprietor; secondly, because it is not in the form required by the statute, viz.: not having affixed to it the seal of the commissioner; thirdly, because it was in fact a purchase with notice of the proprietary rights of third parties\u2014; the confirmation of such a title(not being such a title as provided by the Act), cannot affect, in any way, the rights of the heirs of Philemon Wright Jr.\n\"When a law is passed which is derogatory to the law in force, and has the effect of depriving a subject of his property, a strict compliance with all the provisions of the statute is an absolute necessity. It is a well known rule of law which it is not necessary to support by authority, and which this Court has applied in the case of Nicholls v. Cummings[29]. If there be any need of authority I cannot find any more applicable to this case, or words more appropriate than those made use of in that case by the Hon. Mr. Justice Ritchie, now Chief Justice of this Court. These words, I should also add, have been cited approvingly by Mr. Justice Gwynne in another case before this Court of McKay v. Chrysler[30] They are as follows:\u2014\n\"When a statute derogates from a common law right and divests a party of his property, or imposes a burthen on him, every provision of the statute beneficial to the party must be observed. Therefore, it has been often held that acts which impose a charge or a duty upon the subject must be construed strictly, and I think it is equally clear that no provisions for the benefit or protection of the subject can be ignoredor rejected.\" And again,at p. 427, Mr. Justice Strong says: \"it needs no reference to specific authorities to authorize the proposition, that in all cases of interference with private rights of property in order to sub-serve public interests, the authority conferred by the Sovereign (here the Legislature) must be pursued with the utmost exactitude as regards the compliance with all pre-requisites introduced for the benefit of parties whose rights are to be affected.\"\nI will now take up the pleas of prescription invoked by the Crown. The first is that of thirty years. The first point to be discussed is whether the Crown can plead prescription. It is not important to know what opinion prevailed on this point before the publication of the Civil Code, but I will here state, contrary to the opinion expressed by the learned counsel for the Crown, that there can be found no judicial decision in the Province of Quebec recognizing the right in the Crown to plead prescription. The case of Laporte v. Principal Officers of Artillery[31], does not support this allegation.\nHowever, the Code has since settled the difficulty by enacting under art. 2211: \" The Crown may avail itself of prescription.\"\nBy giving to the Crown the right of availing itself of the plea of prescription, it necessarily follows that the Crown, as between subject and subject, can be allowed to do so only on the ordinary conditions imposed by law on a subject who wants to avail himself of the advantages of prescription. There is no exemption of any of the conditions in favor of the Crown, and these are, for the purposes of the prescription of 30 years, a continuous, and uninterrupted, peaceable, public, unequivocal possession, and as proprietor. All these elements are essential.\nIn the present case this prescription would only be available with respect to the property acquired on the 12th September, 1849, from Sarah Olmstead and Nicholas Sparks, her husband, if the Crown were allowed to join to its possession that of its vendors. From the date of this deed till the date of fiat on the present petition of right, the Crown has only possessed this property 27 years. In order to complete this prescription it would be necessary for it to join Mrs. Sparks' possession, provided the latter, under her title and possession, could prescribe.\nI have before stated that Mrs. Sparks had only the title which her dower gave to the possession of these 159 acres, part of which she sold by deed of the 12th September, 1849. She could not claim that property under any other title. Her possession must be in accordance with her title, which was in virtue of her dower, and this necessarily is a precarious title. The deed of sale to Leamy, dated 7th May, 1852, contains a formal declaration by Mrs. Sally Olmstead, that she had possession of this property in virtue of her dower, and she then only sold such rights as she had in virtue of her dower. The other deed of the 29th Sept., 1853, does not contain this admission. In this deed she sells all her rights in the property. In any event the admission in the first deed is evidence against her, and she could not, unless by proving it was an error, retract a declaration so made in conformity with her title. We must here apply the principle of law thus stated by Dunod: \"Celui qui a un titre est presum\u00e9 poss\u00e9der en vertu de ce titre\u2014ad primordium tituli posterior refertur eventus (1.)\" It is this fundamental principle which prohibits the usufruct and the tenant to secure a title by prescription of the property he holds as such, and that even by lengthy possession. See also Merlin[32]:\nComme chacun est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 poss\u00e9der en vertu d'un titre, on doit dans le doute, expliquer la possession par le titre qui existe et la reduire \u00e0 ces termes; cons\u00e9quemment, si ce titre est infect\u00e9 d'un vice capable d'emp\u00eacher la prescription, c'est-\u00e0-dire s'il est inhabile \u00e0 transf\u00e9rer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, c'est indubitable que la possession m\u00eame la plus longue sera sans effet.\nThe possession of Mrs. Sparks, being derived from a precarious title, in virtue of her dower, was wanting one of the essential conditions, viz.: \"a possession unequivocal, and as proprietor.\" In order that the Government might avail themselves of this possession, they would have had to prove that there has been interversion of her title, that instead of possessing under precarious title, she held, as proprietor, or produce a deed by which Mrs. Sparks acquired the absolute ownership of the immovable property of which she could only claim the usufruct. There is no evidence that she ever possessed this property otherwise than in conformity with her title of douairi\u00e8re, and there has been no deed produced which shows that she acquired the property subjected to the dower.\nFrom the above statement of facts, it is clear that the Crown has not possessed, either in its own name, or by joining with Mrs. Sparks' possession, as proprietor during thirty years, that portion of the 159 acres of land which was acquired by the deed of the 12th September, 1849, and consequently that plea of 30 years prescription cannot be maintained.\nThen can the Crown be said to have acquired a title by 10 years prescription?\nThe plea is as follows:\u2014\n\"That for more than ten years before the fyling of said petition, Her Majesty the Queen and her auteurs, had been in the possession, use and occupation of the land in said petition mentioned, of which the said petitioner prays to be declared proprietor, peaceably, openly, uninterruptedly, in good faith and with good and sufficient title, and Her Majesty thereby became, and was, and is owner and proprietor, and in possesion of said land, and was and is entitled to be maintained in possession thereof; and the said petition of the said Petitioner, by reason of the premises, ought to be dismissed with costs.\"\nAt the date of the execution of these conveyances the 10 years prescription was then governed by art. 13 of the Custom of Paris, which differs from the article in the Civil Code only in as much as the latter has made the term of 10 years applicable to absentees as well as to persons present. The Art first relied on by respondent is Art. 2206 which enacts:\nSubsequent purchasers in good faith, under a translatory title in good faith, derived either from a precarious or subordinate possessor or from any other person, may prescribe by ten years against the proprietor during such subordinate or precarious holding.\nBy giving the term of ten years as new law, the Code virtually asserts that the prescription of ten years did not in the case in question exist under the old law, which, as we have already seen, required thirty years.\nMerlin, when discussing the question of the inter-version of titles, refers to only two decisions, the one of the 16th March, 1692, and the other of the 5th April, 1746, which maintained the plea of prescription of thirty years of a person who had purchased from a precarious possessor. The prescription invoked here, having commenced to run before the promulgation of the Civil Code, must be governed by the former laws, and, therefore, in my opinion, the only available prescription was that of 30 years, and not that of ten years.\nBut then art. 2251 is also relied on and it enacts:\nHe who acquires a corporal immovable in good faith, under a translatory title, prescribes the ownership thereof and liberates himself from the servitudes, charges and impositions upon it by an effective possession in virtue of such title during ten years.\nIt is clear that under either of these articles, if a subject desires to avail himself of this prescription, he must have acquired under a translatory title, and in good faith. The expression juste titre, which is to be found in the Custom of Paris, has the same meaning as translatory title which is made use of in the Code. Another condition, says Pothier[33]: \"Il faut que ce titre soit valable\" Thus we find, as some of the necessary conditions to prescribe, the three following: translatory title, valid title, good faith. Do we find these conditions in the present case? I have above shown by what mode the commissioners had the right of acquiring property.\nNow, can it be said that the conveyance dated 7th May, 1855, by which the Government claim to have acquired another and the larger portion of this property, is on its face a translatory title of property? Is it not rather a sale by Leamy and his wife of whatever rights or claims they had on the real estate of which the Government were in possession for several years without a title. In order to correctly ascertain the true character of this conveyance, it is necessary to give the following important extracts:\nWhereas the said Commissioners of Public Works have deemed it necessary to acquire for public purposes certain pieces or parcels of lands, situate in the aforesaid township of Hull which the said Andrew Leamy, and his said wife claim to be theirs.\nNow, therefore, these presents and we the said notaries witness that the said Andrew Leamy and his said wife, have sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed and made over, and by these presents do sell, assign, transfer, convey and make over, with promise of warranty, against all debts, dowers, mortgages, claims, and demands generally whatsoever, unto Her Majesty, &c., &c., accepting hereof by and through the said Commissioners of Public Works, all and every the pieces and parcels of land and water, hereinafter described as follows: (Follows the description.)\nTo have and to hold the aforesaid sold pieces or parcels of land and water, first, secondly and thirdly described, unto Her said Majesty, &c., &c., from henceforth and forever. (Consideration, $1,404.16.)\nAnd in consideration of the foregoing promises, the said Andrew Leamy and his said wife, have and by these presents do transfer and set over to Her said Majesty &c., all and every right, title, interest, claims or demand which they or either of them now have or ever had in or to the said above described and sold premises hereby fully divesting themselves thereof in favour of Her said Majesty. These extracts clearly prove that the sale was not executed by Leamy and his wife as proprietors. This deed cannot be said to contain one single expression from which it could be inferred that they were proprietors. They seem to have purposely omitted to assume that quality, and also to have prudently abstained from giving any information of their title to the properties they purported to sell or even to refer to it. They only sell their \"claim,\" and \"and all and every right, titles, interests, claims or demands.\" This naturally brings up the question of what consist these \"claims and rights\" conveyed and sold to the Government. In order to get a proper answer to this question it is necessary to refer to Leamy and his wife's title deed. We find, that by deed of 7th December, 1852, which I have before cited, Leamy and his wife acquired the usufructuary interest of Sally Olmstead over this property.\nBut, independently of this, it will be seen that the Government, in their own deed of the 7th May, 1855, (numbered 1032 by the notary), and the references therein to another deed, executed between the same parties, and numbered 1031 by the notary, were duly notified and informed of what rights and interests Leamy and his author Mrs. Sparks possessed, or at least placed in the position of obtaining exact information on the subject.\nIn describing the first lot sold, reference is made in the following words to a plan annexed to the deed No. 1031,\u2014in order to give a more complete description of the lot:\nOn the plan number two, annexed to a certain deed of sale entered into between the said parties bearing even date with these presents and executed before the said notaries, as upon reference to which will more fully and largely appear.\nIn the description of lot No. 3, in the same deed, the rights of the heirs of P. Wright and of their mother, Mrs. Sparks, are thus referred to: Until intersected by the boundary line, between the share allotted to Wellington Wright, in the partage amongst the heirs of the late Philemon Wright Junior, according to the sketch or plan of the said partage, made by Anthony Swalwell, Deputy Provincial Surveyor, and the share allotted by the said partage and according to the said plan to Sally Olmstead, widow of the late Philemon Wright Junior, as will appear by the first mentioned plan, number two.\nThis plan is also annexed to the deed of sale, altho' a reference is specially made to the plan annexed to the deed of sale No. 1031, the only reason no doubt being that this last deed contained complete and full information respecting the division which took place between the heirs of P. Wright.\nThen in the deed No. 1031, we find the following statement, which, as being referred to in the deed No. 1032, must be read as embodied in it. It is to be found in the description of the second lot:\nSo much of the said strip as is comprised in that share of the estate of the late Philemon Wright Junior, allotted by a partage or division thereof, made between his heirs and Rosanna Wright, wife of one James Parie, and the other options, so much of the said strips as is comprised in that part allotted in the partage to Sally Olmstead, widow of the said late Philemon Wright Junior, and the said partage or divisions being represented and shown by a sketch or plan thereof, made for the said heirs by one Anthony Swalwell, Deputy Provincial Surveyor.\nIn this deed it is stated that the arbitrators, to whom certain matters in dispute had been referred by the deed of the 24th April, 1854, to which I will refer later on, having delivered their award, the payment of a sum of \u00a3518. 0. 6 has been made to Leamy for the use and occupation for several years by the Crown of the property in question. This deed as well as the arbitrator's award was to be considered as annulled, \"so far as they may be by these presents in part fulfilled.\"\nA copy of Swalwell's plan, by which the division of the Wright estate was made, is annexed to this deed, as well as to the deed No. 1032. The Grown thus had ample notice, at the time of the purchase, of the precarious rights of the vendor, and at the same time was duly notified of the proprietary rights of the heirs of P. Wright.\nThus we find, in the expressions used in the title deed of the Crown and by the references therein to Leamy's rights, that the Crown evidently purchased nothing more than a precarious title, and, knowing that the sale was of an usufructuary right over certain property, no doubt paid a price estimated at the value of such usufruct.\nNow, in my opinion, the Crown has not a translatory title of this property, because the Crown has only purchased, as I have just stated, Leamy's \"claims\" and nothing more, which consisted in the usufruct purchased from Mrs. Sparks. We may also infer that the reason why Leamy would only sell his \"claims\" was because he knew perfectly what they were. He was but a precarious owner.\nIt has also been said, that before executing a deed to the Government Leamy took from Mrs. Sparks another deed, in which she transfers to him all her rights and interest and omits to say they consisted in nothing more than the usufruct in lieu of her dower. But this conveyance, made without any guarantee, clearly puts Leamy in bad faith, and cannot give him more rights over the property than he had under the previous deed. The interversion of his title, from that of a precarious owner into one of an absolute owner from the same vendor, can only give him the right of prescribing by 30 years, in order to purge the defect in his title. Not being proprietor, he could only give to the Crown a title sufficient to prescribe by 10 years, by declaring in the deed that he was proprietor, and under such circumstances as would have justified the Crown in believing him. The following authority is in point: L'on entend par d\u00e9tenteurs pr\u00e9caires ceux qui poss\u00e9dent en vertu d'une convention, ou d'un titre par lequel ils reconnaissent le droit d'autrui[34].\n* * * * *\nMais pour qu'un acte de vente fait par un d\u00e9tenteur pr\u00e9caire, puisse servir de base \u00e0 une possession utile au profit de l'acqu\u00e9reur il faut que la vente ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite a titre de propri\u00e9taire, et qu'elle ne soit entach\u00e9e ni de dol ni de fraude[35].\nThe plea put forward by the Crown is that the Crown got a just title, juste titre, by the deed of the 7 May, 1855, but how can it be said the Crown purchased the fee simple, when by the deed itself it appears Leamy sold only his \"claims,\" which were those of an usufructuary and precarious owner, as was shown by the reference in the deed to the division made by Swalwell of the property belonging to the estate of P. Wright. To these \"claims\" are reduced the rights of the Crown in this property, viz,: to the usufruct which Leamy had purchased from Mrs. Sparks and which he sold to the Government. It is also in evidence that the Crown has had the use and occupation of this property for a period of seventeen years since the 24 April, 1854, to the death of Mrs. Sparks, 9 Oct., 1871, which put an end to the usufruct. On this last date was opened the right of the heirs to claim possession of the property subjected to the dower. The use and occupation for such a long period was likely a fair value for the price paid, and in fact was all that the Government bought.\nAnother objection to this prescription is that the deed of 5 May, 1855, is not the real title deed of the Crown to this property. When the Crown obtained the conveyance of the 7 May, 1855, they had already been in possession of the property they were buying over one year. By deed, of sale dated 24 April, 1854, (Exhibit 39) Leamy et ux. had already bargained and sold these same lots to the Commissioners of Public Works, Chabot and Killaly, represented by the late Col. Gugy, as well as another lot which was not included in the sale of 1855. By comparing these two deeds carefully, it will be seen that the sale was not only of the same lots, but it is made in exactly the same language. In both deeds Leamy et ux. only sell \"certain pieces or parcels of land which they claim to be theirs\" as well as \"all and every right, title and interest, claim or demand.\" And even in this deed the Government make the following important declaration, \"that they were at that time in possession of the property.\"\nA remarkable feature to be noticed, and one which is important when the Crown relies on the prescription of ten years, is that by this deed the Crown thought proper to take security in order to guard itself against the invalidity of Leamy's title. The provision is thus worded:\nAnd whereas difficulties or doubts may arise as to the validity of title of the said Andrew Leamy, and his said wife with regard to the aforesaid four pieces or parcels of land, and it is necessary that security (caution) shall be given to Her said Majesty the Queen, therefore to these presents, personally came, intervened and was present James Leamy, also residing in Bytown, aforesaid, hotel-keeper, who after having had reading and taken communication of the foregoing premises did, and doth hereby voluntarily become the security (caution) for and on behalf of the said Andrew Leamy and his said wife, and doth hereby bind himself conjointly with the said Andrew Leamy and said wife, to the due performance of all the obligations which the said Andrew Leamy and his said wife have entered into aforesaid, and this in same manner as if he was the principal or principal oblig\u00e9 to these presents.\nThe doubt as to the validity of the vendor's title could not be more forcibly or more precisely stated. Then, can a title taken under such circumstances be a title such as meet the requirements contained in Art. 2251 of our Civil Code in order to prescribe?\nAnother objection is, that the title which the Crown got is not translatory, because there has not been a strict compliance with the provisions of the statute. I have indicated that a contract in order to be valid, valable, must be signed by the commissioner, countersigned by the Secretary of the Public Works, and that the seal of the chief commissioner must be affixed. The statute declares that any writing or document made otherwise shall not be deemed to be the act of the commissioners. Nor can I see anything in the statute which dispenses the Crown from conforming itself to the provisions of the 17th sec., because the writing would be passed before a notary. Other notarial deeds fyled in the case were signed and sealed by the commissioner. The seal is evidence, no doubt, that the party signs in his official capacity, and the fact that the deed is passed before notaries instead of in the presence of witnesses does not authorize me to put two constructions on the 17th sec., viz.: when the writing is made before witnesses, the seal is necessary, but when before notaries, the seal is not necessary. Corporations, when parties to a notarial deed, are obliged to affix their corporate seal, as well as when they sign documents passed simply before witnesses. And as a matter of fact the corporations of Quebec and Montreal have always affixed their seal to notarial deeds. Now the conveyances in question do not contain the seal of the chief commissioner, and for this reason are void. There is no need of citing further authorities on this point. The following are sufficient:\u2014\nWhen the statute under which a corporation acts restricts the action to a particular mode, none of the agents through whom the corporation acts can bind it in any other than the mode prescribed[36].\nWhen a legislative power, from which' a corporation derives its authority to act, prescribes a particular mode in which the act shall be performed, the corporation cannot lawfully perform the act in any other manner. If not done in the manner prescribed, the act is a mere nullity and utterly void[37].\nIt is now, however, fully established that as the corporation will not, so neither will the other side, be bound by any agreement not sealed, if that agreement does not fall within one of the excepted cases[38].\nThis nullity being established, it follows that the Government have not such a valid (valable) title as will allow them to acquire by prescription. This proposition of law seems to me to be incontrovertible, but it may be as well to refer to some authorities on this point.\nPothier says:\nPourqu'un possesseur puisse acqu\u00e9rir par prescription la chose qu'il poss\u00e8de, il faut que le titre d'o\u00f9 la possession proc\u00e8de, soit un titre valable. Si son titre est nul, un titre nul n'\u00e9tant pas un titre, la possession qui en proc\u00e8de est une possession sans titre, qui ne peut op\u00e9rer la prescription[39].\nMerlin:\u2014\nQuand le titre est frapp\u00e9 d'une nulit\u00e9 absolue, point de prescription. La loi r\u00e9siste continuellement \u00e0 l'\u00e9x\u00e9cution qu'il pourrait avoir, elle le r\u00e9duit \u00e0 un pur fait qui ne peut \u00eatre ni confirm\u00e9, ni autoris\u00e9, et qui ne produit aucun droit, aucune action, aucune exception[40].\nThe same doctrine is embodied in our Civil Code which has not altered the law on this point. Article 2254 is thus worded: \"A title which is null by reason of informality cannot serve as a ground for prescription by ten years.\"\nIf we apply the law as laid down in these authorities to the informalities which exist in the two conveyances relied on by the respondent, the irresistible conclusion to be drawn is, in the words of Pothier, that the possession of the Crown is a possession without title, \"possession sans titre qui ne peut op\u00e9rer la prescription.\" The condition of a valid (valable) title is not there. The absence of these two conditions is sufficient to dismiss the pleas of prescription.\nIt may be argued that the judgment of confirmation of the deed of 1855, admitting for the sake of this argument, that the suppliants improbation against this judgment should be dismissed, although not the confirmation of such a title as was authorized by the statute, was at least equal to a translatory title sufficient to serve as a ground for prescription by ten years. First, if the judgment of confirmation is of such a title as was not authorized by the statute, then the parties who applied for it, had no authority to do so, and therefore, it is a nullity. Second, a judgment of confirmation cannot give validity to a deed which is null and void. Third, a judgment per se is not a translatory title.\nOr un jugement n'est rien de tout cela. La chose jug\u00e9e n'est class\u00e9e nulle part parmi les moyens d'acqu\u00e9rir la propri\u00e9t\u00e9; elle n'est que la preuve d'un droit, elle n'est pas la source; elle ne conc\u00e8de pas la propri\u00e9t\u00e9; elle la d\u00e9clare, elle sanctionne un titre pr\u00e9-existant; elle lui assure une force obligatoire; mais ce n'est pas elle qui le cr\u00e9e. Quand on excipe de la prescription avec juste titre et bonne foi, on est oblig\u00e9 de nommer son auteur. Eh bien o\u00f9 trouver cet auteur, quand le possesseur n'invoque que la chose jug\u00e9e[41].\nIt only remains for me now to consider the condition, of good faith. Good faith, according to Pothier, consists:\nDans la juste opinion que le possesseur a que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la chose qu'il poss\u00e8de, lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquise.\nAnd Troplong says:\nC'est la croyance ferme et-intacte qu'on est propri\u00e9taire. Elle n'a lieu qu'avec la conviction que nul autre n'a droit \u00e0 la chose, qu'on en est le ma\u00eetre exclusif, qu'on \u00e0 sur elle une puissance absolue.\nCan the Government, who ordered a preliminary examination of Leamy's titles, be considered, after receiving the information they got through their agent's reports, as having, at the time of the purchase on the 7th May, 1855, that just opinion and firm and intact conviction, cette juste opinion, cette croyance ferme et intacte, that they had become absolute proprietors? Certainly not. On the contrary the Government were informed of all the defects in Leamy's titles, and at the same time of the rights of the heirs of Philemon Wright Jr.\nIn Troplong we find that:\nIl ne suffit pas d'avoir un juste titre soutenu d'une possession de dix et vingt ans. Sans la bonne foi la prescription d\u00e9cennale ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e. C'est elle qui purifie le titre de ses vices, et le r\u00e9habilite aux yeux de la conscience; c'est elle qui appelle sur le possesseur cette faveur et cet int\u00e9r\u00eat qui le font pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer au v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire coupable d'avoir n\u00e9glig\u00e9 l'exercise de son droit. C'est elle enfin qui fait de la prescription d\u00e9cennale un moyen d'acqu\u00e9rir tout aussi pur et tout aussi l\u00e9gitime dans le for int\u00e9rieur, que les contrats et les titres successifs.\nSans la bonne foi exig\u00e9e par l'art. 113 de la Coutume et l'art. 2251 C. C., un titre n'est pas un juste titre suivant la Coutume, ni translatif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 suivant le code. Le titre translatif n'existe pas sans cela, la bonne foi en est la premi\u00e8re condition. Suivant Laurent, au No. 397 de la prescription pour qu'un titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 soit v\u00e9ritablement translatif il faut qu'il ait les qualit\u00e9s suivantes:\nDans l'usucapion de dix \u00e0 vingt ans, la loi ne se contente pas de la croyance du possesseur et de sa pr\u00e9tention, elle veut que cette croyance et cette pr\u00e9tention aient leur fondement dans un titre qui aurait transf\u00e9r\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 au possesseur, si son auteur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire, de sorte que le possesseur doit se croire propri\u00e9taire en vertu de son titre. C'est \u00e0 raison du titre et de la bonne foi que la loi abr\u00e9ge la dur\u00e9e de la prescription[42].\nLaurent says:\nL'art du code d\u00e9roge sous ce rapport au droit ancien, les coutumes exigeaient un juste titre, mais on interpr\u00e9tait cette condition en ce sens que le titre n'\u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que comme un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de bonne foi[43].\nIt is evident that the Crown has not complied with any of the essential requirements necessary to prescribe, when it is stated in the deed of sale that doubts exist as to the validity of the vendor's title, and that it is necessary to take security in order to secure the Crown against the insufficiency or defect in the vendor's title.\nAs to the third condition, it has been shown that Leamy's title was clothed with a defect which prevented him from selling the fee simple, viz: precarious ownership.\nTroplong cites Voet in support of his opinion[44]:\nCelui-l\u00e0 ne doit pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 en \u00e9tat de bonne foi qui doute si son auteur \u00e9tait ou non ma\u00eetre de la chose, et avait ou non le droit de l'ali\u00e9ner, car autre chose est croire autre chose est douter, et le doute n'est qu'un milieu entre la bonne et la mauvaise foi, entre la science et l'ignorance; de m\u00eame que la silence de celui qu'on interroge, n'est, si on l'envisage en lui-m\u00eame, ni une n\u00e9gation, ni une affirmation.\nLa preuve manifeste que celui qui doute ne prescrit pas, ressort de la loi pro emptore.\nThe same principle is enumerated in Rep. Jour. du. P.[45]:\nCelui qui doute si son auteur \u00e9tait on non ma\u00eetre de la chose et avait le droit de l'ali\u00e9ner ne doit pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant de bonne foi, car le doute n'est qu'un milieu entre la bonne et mauvaise foi. Or la bonne foi (n\u00e9cessaire pour prescrire) exige une croyance ferme et positive, une confiance enti\u00e8re dans le droit que l'on poss\u00e8de.\nThese authorities clearly prove that a deed positively stating that doubts exist as to the validity of the vendor's title, such as the present, cannot serve as a ground of prescription. But in this case we find the vendors, not only admitting that there may be some doubts as to the validity of their title, but they do not even declare that they are proprietors, nor do they claim to sell as such. I cannot see how, with such a title, prescription by ten years can be invoked.\nBut it may be contended that it is not on this deed that the Crown has relied to prescribe, but solely on the deed of the 7th May, 1855.\nIt is true the defense, which has set up many titles which have nothing whatever to do with the case, did not specially aver this deed of the 24th April, 1854. But in the general plea of prescription of ten years, the Crown alleges to have been in possession for ten years in good faith and with good and sufficient title. Then the Crown not only has the right to rely on this deed, but was bound to do so. Pothier says[46]:\nCar c'est au possesseur \u00e0 justifier du contrat ou autre acte qu'il pr\u00e9tend \u00eatre le juste titre d'o\u00f9 proc\u00e8de sa possession.\nThen, how can it be said that the deed of the 7th May, 1855 is the title deed of the Crown to these lots of land? We have already seen that it is a sale of the same lots of lands as those already sold by the deed of the 24 April, 1854. Under which of these two deeds did the Crown become proprietor? Could the Crown thus purchase property which had been bought by another deed of sale and of which it had been in possession for several years? It is a canon of law, you cannot purchase what belongs to you, and for this reason the second deed is a nullity as a title to the property already sold; in any case, the second title cannot have added to the Crown's rights over this property. The following authority clearly demonstrates this proposition.\nOn ne peut vendre \u00e0 quelqu'un la chose dont il est d\u00e9j\u00e0 propri\u00e9taire. \"Su\u0153 rei emptio non valet sive sciens, sive ignorans emi.\" L. 16, H d. tet. La raison est que le contrat de vente consiste, suivant la d\u00e9finition que nous en avons donn\u00e9e, dans l'obligation que contracte le vendeur de faire avoir la chose \u00e0 l'acheteur; et par cons\u00e9quent il consiste \u00e0 rendre l'acheteur cr\u00e9ancier de la chose qui lui est vendue; or il est \u00e9vident que cela ne peut avoir lieu par rapport \u00e0 une chose qui appartiendrait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 l'acheteur, car personne ne peut \u00eatre cr\u00e9ancier de sa propre chose; l'acheteur ne peut pas demander qu'on lui fasse avoir une chose qui est d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 lui[47]. This last deed cannot have any legal effect, in so far as it is relied on for the prescription of ten years.\nThis deed might, perhaps, have been available had Leamy in the meantime secured other rights than those he possessed over the properties sold, or if it had been executed to dispel any doubts as to the rights of the vendors as expressed in the first deed. But we find there is nothing of the kind. This second deed is couched in the very same language as the first; by it the vendors only sell their \"claims,\" &c.\nUnder these circumstances, it would have been reasonable to suppose that the Crown, after declaring in the deed of 1854 that there were doubts as to the validity of Leamy's title, and exacting a security, would not have taken a second deed from the same vendors without previously having ascertained that all reasonable doubts no longer existed. But we find on the contrary, that the Crown in the interval, by means of its specially authorized agents, obtained direct and certain information that Leamy's title was in reality defective, as will be shown by the following documents:\n1st. By the conveyance dated 7th December, 1872, Mrs. Sparks only sells to Leamy her right of dower, as follows:\nShe the said Sarah Olmstead, declared to have assigned, transferred and made over, and by these presents, doth sell, assign, transfer and make over from henceforth and forever, with warranty of her own acts only to Mr. Andrew Leamy, of the said Township of Hull, in the said County of Ottawa, in the said District of Ottawa, Lumberer, here present and accepting, all and all manner of dower and right or title of dower whatsoever, either customary or conventional, prefix, which the said Sarah Olmstead, might, or of right ought to have, or claim, in, to and out of that messuage, tenement, parcel or piece of land heretofore belonging to Philemon Wright, junior, her late husband, and which, at the division or partition thereof between her the said Sarah Olmstead and the heirs of the said Philemon Wright, was set apart to and for the use of her the said Sarah Olmstead, for the same reference to a diagram, drawn by Anthony Swalwell, Deputy Provincial Land Surveyor, and hereto annexed, after having been signed by the parties hereto and us Notaries, (excepting however, that certain piece and parcel of land heretofore sold by the said Sarah Olmstead to Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, for the use of the Gatineau Works, by virtue of a Deed of Bargain and Sale, bearing date and passed before A. Larue, one of the undersigned Notaries, in presence of witnesses, under the number two thousand two hundred and thirty-two, on the twelfth day of September, one thousand eight hundred and forty-nine, of which the said Andrew Leamy, hereby declares to have had and taken communication, and is therewith satisfied.\nThis title deed was taken communication of by the Crown's agent, as shown by the report of Mr. Coffin, exhibit 48, and it was in consequence of this report that they thought it necessary to take security in order to be indemnified for any risk which they had in consequence of their doubt on the validity of their title.\nThen we have an extract from report of Mr. Snow, to the Superintendent of Public 'Works, dated 11th April, 1853, fyled as petitioner's exhibit No. 38:\n(No. 19,527.) Hull, April 11th, 1853.\nSir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication, with one from the Honorable the Commissioner of Public Works, in which it appears that my report of the survey of land at the Gatineau is not considered satisfactory or sufficiently explicit, particularly as relates to Wm. Leamy's property.\nTo make the matter as plain as possible, I may add that Mr. Leamy's property is held under only two kinds of tenure, viz.: One part to which he holds a good and sufficient deed, situated on the south side of the line between lots one and two in the 5th Range, east of which it includes both sides of the Range line. The other part to which his title is good merely during the lifetime of Mrs. Nicholas Sparks, it being a transfer of her right of dower. I here subjoin a description of each part to be acquired from Mr. Leamy, and also one of the land to be acquired from Mr. Wright, with a schedule.\nHorace Merrill, Esq.,\nSupt. of Ottawa Works, Bytown.\nThen Mr. Coffin is instructed to consult with Mr McCord, in order to get over the difficulties:\n27th April, 1855.\nSir: I am directed to inform you that His Excellency the Governor General has been pleased to appoint W. H. Coffin, Esq., to proceed to the Ottawa, for the purpose of taking such steps as he may deem necessary for the preservation of the peace and protection of property. Mr. Coffin has been instructed to consult and cooperate with you, so as, if possible, to have arrangements made and bonds entered into, of such a nature as may justify the commissioners in paying the whole of the award to the real proprietors, without any risk or further claim on them. * * * * *\nIn order to facilitate a settlement with Mr. Leamy, all the papers were sent to Mr. McCord Jr., advocate, at Aylmer, and that gentleman yesterday reported fully on them; which reports and other documents are transmitted to you herewith. By it you will perceive that the hesitation on the part of the commissioners, to pay the award to Mr. Leamy, until title was shown by him, is fully justified; as, of the four separate portions of property required, it turns out that to the first, namely, a small piece of land on the east side of the River Gatineau, Mr. Leamy has no title whatever. To the second, being a strip along the west side of the river, he has title to only about half. To the third, and for the most important portion, his title exists only during the life of a woman between 65 and 70 years of age. To the fourth, namely, a strip along the south-west bank of the Creek, and extending to the centre of its waters, as shown on the map, his title is reported good.\nThe result of Mr. Coffin's operations are then given in the following extract from a report he sent to the Provincial Secretary:\nDuring the pendency of these negotiations, however, in the interval between the signing of the first deed of sale and the final award of Mr. Russell, doubts had arisen as to the validity of the titles of Mr. Leamy, to a considerable portion of the property proposed to be conveyed to the Board of Works, and a formal protest was served on the Government on behalf of parties claiming residuary rights in the said property, denying Leamy's right to receive the same, and making the Government responsible in the event that Leamy's titles should ultimately prove to be insufficient.\nThe Board of Works most properly demanded and obtained communication by Mr. Leamy's titles to the lands in question, and submitted the same for examination and opinion to their counsel, Thomas McCord, Esq., of Aylmer, who, after careful and minute enquiry, pronounced that Mr. Leamy could give a valid title to certain portions of the said lands, but that with respect to the remainder, his title to one part was imperfect, and that to the rest he could give no title at all. Not only were the Government informed of the defects in Leamy's title by official communications, but, as the following clearly establishes the fact, they were informed of the names as well as of the rights of the heirs of Philemon Wright Jr.\nBytown, April 16th, 1853.\nSir: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter, dated March 24th, respecting Mr. Snow's report on the land about to be required round the Gatineau Pond and Creek, requesting me to call on Mr. Snow to report more fully on the subject.\nI have obtained his report as requested, and herewith transmit the same to the department.\nMr. Snow's report does not mention the names of the heirs to that portion of the property purchased by Mr. Leamy, of which he only holds a temporary title, the description of this land is marked B in the schedule; if the names of these heirs are required, seven in number, they are as follows: Philemon Wright, Hull Wright, Horatio Wright, Pamelia McGoey, Erexina Leamy, Cyrinne Pierre and Sally Cotter.\nI have the honor to be,\nYour obedient servant,\nThomas A. Bigby, Horace Merrill,\nSecretary Public Works, Quebec. Supt. Ottawa Works.\nAmongst the documents produced, we find also that there was a protest sent by some of the heirs, protesting against the Government's intention to purchase this property from Leamy. The date of the protest is the 26th April, 1855, a few days prior to the sale made by Leamy, on the 7th May, 1855.\nThis document reads as follows:\u2014\n(Copy of No. 25765.)\nHull. April 26th, 1855.\nTo the Honorable the Commissioner of Public Works.\nSir,\u2014\nWe desire to state for your information and for the information of the Government, that the proposed sale of land in the Township of Hull, by Mr. A. Leamy to the Government, is made without the sanction of the individuals who are mainly interested as proprietors of that land. That we are personally interested in the land, and have an incidental interest towards another portion included in the proposed sale. You will use this information as you deem mete, and should it prove of any benefit to the public service, it will be most gratifying to\nYour most obedient humble servants,\n(Signed,) Thomas McGoey.\nHull Wright.\nThese documents are so important that I have deemed it necessary to give at length, all the extracts which have any bearing on this cause. The inevitable result of this enquiry shows that the Government on 7th May, 1855, when they purchased from Leamy, knew for some length of time of the defects in the titles of Leamy, their vendor, and they also knew what rights the heirs of Philemon Wright Jr. claimed in the property they were purchasing. With such evidence, is it possible to believe that the Government had a just opinion and firm and intact belief, une juste opinion ou la croyance ferme et intacte, that they were proprietors and that no others had any rights to the property purchased?\nBut independently of the question whether the Crown has acquired this property in good faith under a translatory title, these documents, in my opinion, conclusively bar the Crown from availing itself of the prescription of ten years,\u2014on the ground that they constitute an acknowledgment by the Crown, whilst in possession of the property claimed, of the rights of the heirs of P. Wright, sufficient to interrupt civilly the prescription if it could have commenced\u2014 1st against the property purchased by the deed of 1849, if that deed was not defective for the reasons I have before given; and 2nd, against the property acquired by the deed of 24th April, 1854, and bought a second time by the deed of 7th May, 1855.\nArt. 2227 C. C. enacts:\nPrescription is interrupted civilly by renouncing the benefit of a period elapsed, and by any acknowledgment which the possessor or the debtor makes of the right of the person against whom the prescription runs.\nArt. 2255 says:\nAfter prescription by ten years has been renounced or interrupted, prescription by thirty years alone can be commenced.\nBearing in mind, that at the time of the execution of these reports and other documents the Government were in possession of the property claimed more than a year, it will be seen that the acknowledgment made in this case is sufficient in law to interrupt this prescription. First, what should be considered an acknowledgment? and, then, by whom need it be made? Troplong, whose opinion on this point is concurred in by all commentators on the Code Napol\u00e9on, thus lays down, the rule commenting on Art. 2248 C. N., which concords with our Art. 2227 C. C.\nEt d'abord la reconnaissance peut-\u00eatre expresse. C'est ce qui a lieu lorsqu'elle r\u00e9sulte des actes mentionn\u00e9s aux arts. 1337, 1338 C.N.\nElle peut \u00e9galement r\u00e9sulter d'une lettre missive. * * * La reconnaissance n'a pas besoin d'\u00eatre accept\u00e9e par le cr\u00e9ancier. Il suffit qu'elle ne soit pas repudi\u00e9e par lui pour qu'elle lui profite, nul n'\u00e9tant cens\u00e9 vouloir perdre et s'appauvrir.\nNow, in these documents we find that the Crown admits that Mrs. Sparks never possessed this property otherwise than in her capacity of usufructuary as dowage (douairi\u00e8re). This was certainly the act of the Crown, for it was made with its consent and knowledge, and by its specially authorized agents.\nI do not think it can be shown that the Crown ever has notice of official acts done in its name otherwise than by reports addressed to the Government, as was done in this case through the Provincial Secretary.\nMoreover, in this case we find that the officer charged with this duty had been authorized to act by Order in Council. To support the proposition that an acknowledgment made by such an officer is in law sufficient to 117\ninterrupt civilly prescription, authorities are not wanting:\nLa reconnaissance est suffisante lorsqu'elle \u00e9mane d'un mandataire sp\u00e9cial[48].\nIt is conclusive, therefore, to my mind, that the Crown cannot avail itself of the prescription of ten years, and that if prescription commenced to run at all, it was civilly interrupted; consequently the Crown could only prescribe by thirty years from the date of the first purchase of this property.\nBefore concluding it may be well to refer also to the argument founded on the fact that some of the opposants (two, I believe,) after having opposed the confirmation of the title of the Crown, subsequently discontinued their oppositions with costs.\nIt is true that the judgment of confirmation mentions the fact that these oppositions were \"discontinued with costs.\" But first if no answer could be given, it would be necessary to decide the important questions raised by the appellants by the improbation of this judgment, before any advantage could be gained. But how can we presume they have admitted they had no proprietary rights over the property for which a judgment of confirmation was asked? If in such cases it were permitted to surmise, we could as easily presume that the opposants, after having taken communication of the Crown's title and ascertained that the Crown had purchased, as it is evident by the title itself, only the usufruct of an immovable, withdrew their oppositions, because the title asked to be confirmed was not such a title as could affect their rights, not being taken from a person in possession as proprietor, and because the title deed itself acknowledged their rights.\nMoreover, the argument of the Crown is based on a mere supposition, for the oppositions have not been produced, and it is impossible to say on what grounds they were made. The maxim of law \"de non apparentibus et non existentibus eadem est lex\" is here very applicable to the non-production of these oppositions.\nAfter carefully examining the titles and weighing the evidence in the cause, I have come to the conclusion that the appellant has established: 1st. That the heirs of Philemon Wright Jr. have never alienated their rights in the 159 acres of land and water, which were set apart for the use and enjoyment of Sarah Olmstead, their mother, as dowager.\n2nd. That the Government, by the title of the 12th September, 1849, obtained possession of 21 acres, 1 rood, and 25 perches; that by the conveyance of the 7th May, 1855, the Government, being a purchaser with notice, obtained a precarious title to 65 acres and 2 perches, of which they were in possession without a title for several years, making a total of 86 acres, 1 rood, and 27 perches out of the 159 acres of land and water belonging to the heirs of Philemon Wright Jr., and that the balance of these 159 acres is in the hands of certain persons who are not parties to this suit.\n3rd. That the appellant represents the following heirs: of Philemon Wright Jr., and that the respective share of the heirs he represents in the said 86 acres 1 rood, and 27 perches, is as follows:\nPhilemon Wright\n1\/5 = 55\/275\nErexina Wright, wife of T. Leamy\n1\/5 = 55\/275\nSally Wright, wife of Boucher\n1\/5 = 55\/275\nPamelia Wright, wife of A. McGoey\n1\/5 = 55\/275\nP. Wright, Serina Wright and Helen Wright, children of Hull Wright\n3\/11 of 1\/5 = 15\/275\nmaking his proprietary interest amount to 235 undivided 275ths, or 47\/55 undivided, in the said 86 acres 1 rood and 27 perches, now in the possession of the Government.\n4th. That both conveyances to the Government are null and void, because they were not made in conformity with the provisions of 9 Vic., ch. 37.\n5th. That the judgment of confirmation which is alleged to have been granted of the conveyance of the 7th May, 1855, (the appellants having fyled against this judgment an improbation, which in my view of the case it is unnecessary to determine) not being the confirmation of such a title as was authorized by the statute, cannot affect the rights of the proprietor of the land thereby conveyed.\n6th. That the quit claims alleged to have been signed by some of the heirs are null, and that the discontinuance of oppositions which have not been produced to the confirmation of a title cannot affect the proprietary rights of such opposants.\n7th. That the titles of the Crown, being null by reason of informality, cannot serve as a ground for prescription.\n8th. That the acknowledgment in writing by a special mandatory of the Crown, (while the Government were in possession of the property claimed), of the existence of the heirs of P. Wright, and of their rights, was sufficient to interrupt civilly the prescription of 10 years.\n9th. That the Crown has not in law a title to the property claimed sufficient to prescribe the ownership thereof by 10 year's possession under Arts. 2206 and 2251.\nI am, therefore, of opinion, that the petition, in so far as it prays for the rents and profits due and accrued before the date of the execution of the deeds of grant to the appellant, must be dismissed, and that the appellant should be declared proprietor of the following undivided indivis share in the said 86 acres, 1 rood and 29 perches now in the possession of the Crown, being a portion of the 159 acres belonging to the estate of P. Wright Jr. and which was subject to the customary dower of Sally Olmstead, to wit: 47\/55ths., and that he is also entitled to an account of the rents, issues and profits of the said property from the date of his acquisition of the same.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThe legal questions involved in the consideration of this case are so numerous, and, at the same time, so intricate and important, that no little application, research and consideration were required to arrive at proper conclusions in regard to them.\nFor some time after the argument I was, in regard to one or two of the controlling points, inclined to sustain the judgment of my late learned brother Taschereau. I have since bestowed much thought and research upon all the questions involved, and I shall now proceed to state the result at which I have arrived.\nThe property in question in this suit was formerly owned by one Philemon Wright Junior. On his death, intestate, it became the property of his children, subject to the dower, or usufruct, of his widow Sarah, formerly Sarah Olmstead, subsequently Mrs. N. Sparks. Sometime after the death of Philemon Wright his real estate, with the exception of a part set out for his widow, was divided amongst his children, and deeds confirming the division passed between them. The widow did not release her dower to any of the lots, and therefore held it until her death. She might have disregarded this division and made a claim to dower in the whole of the lands, for all that appears in the case, unless her deed to Leamy in 1852 would have estopped her; nor did she release her right of dower to any of them. The part so set out for the widow includes that now in dispute. There is no conveyance from any of the heirs to her, and, she having died in 1871, several of the heirs conveyed their interest in that part of the property so held by her to the appellant.\nIt is contended that she derived a full title to the property she held, but I can see nothing in the case to justify that conclusion. She could acquire no such right as the widow of Wright, and whether she occupied during her life more or less than her legal share of the property could, in my view, make no difference. If more, she occupied any overplus by sufferance\"; if less, it was by her own act, and the fact could not turn her right to the usufruct into a superior title. Besides, she and those claiming under her are, in my opinion, estopped by her conveyance, which expressly limits her right to that of a life estate.\nIt is by a title derived from her that this action is defended, and if, for some of the reasons assigned, that title is sufficient to bar the legal right of the heirs, our judgment must be for the appellant. There was an attempt made at the trial to prove title out of some of the heirs, but there was not proof, in my opinion, of the execution of the deeds produced for that purpose.\nI am of opinion for the reasons given by my brother Fournier, that the description of the property in the petition was sufficient; and also, that the appellant cannot claim for rents and profits accrued previous to the transfer to him of the property.\nSeveral conveyances were given in evidence on the part of the Crown from heirs of Philemon Wright to Leamy; but, as they were only of the lands divided between the heirs and not of any part of that set apart for the widow and, therefore, no part of the land in dispute, I cannot see how they can, in any way, affect the issues before us. What the heirs, or Leamy, did with those other lots, cannot in any way affect the title of land not in any way referred to in the deeds in question. As the Crown did not purchase from the owners of the property, has it acquired a title independent of them and in opposition to their legal rights?\nThe question is not as to the abstract right of the Crown to purchase and obtain title from the legal owner, but whether, having purchased from other than the legal owners, and, by retaining possession for ten years, the latter are ousted of their title. If such a result has been reached in this case, it must be by virtue of the Civil Code and by statute. The statute by which the claim is principally supported is 9 Vic., ch. 37.\nReferring to Commissioners of Public Works, the 5th section provides that they shall have power, by instrument under their hands and seals, on behalf of the province, to make and enter into all necessary contracts, &c., relative to the public works of the province.\nSection 8 provides that\nSaid Commissioners, in and for the said purposes, shall, at all times, have power to acquire and take possession of all such lands or real estate, and to take possession of all such streams, waters, and water-courses, the appropriation of which for the use, construction and maintenance of such public works aforesaid as shall, in their judgment, be necessary.\nPower is also given to the Commissioners to contract for the purchase from all persons, seigniors, bodies corporate, guardians, tutors, curators or trustees, lands and real estate. This provision only extends to a purchase from owners, or their representatives. It does not authorize the purchase from A of B's land. After this provision there is another necessary one for such objects, as follows:\nIf the owner or owners of such lands, &c., do not reside in the vicinity of such property so required, then notice shall be given in the Official Gazette and in two distinct newspapers published in or adjoining the district in which such property is situate, of the intention of the Commissioners to cause possession to be taken of such lands, &c.\nAfter thirty days from such notice possession was authorized to be taken, and the land to become vested in Her Majesty. Provision is also made for paying the amount of a valuation under the Act into Court.\nSec. 9 provides that in Lower Canada the compensation awarded as aforesaid, or agreed upon by the Commissioners, and any party who might, under that Act, validly convey the lands, or lawfully in possession thereof as proprietor for any lands taken under the Act without the consent of such proprietor, shall stand in stead of such land, and any claim to a hypothec or incumbrance shall be converted into a claim to or upon the compensation. Provision is then made for proceedings of confirmation in either of the two cases mentioned\u2014that is, where the purchase and conveyance is from the owner or his representatives, as stated in the clause; and second, in the case of expropriation, without any such purchase. It is, in my opinion, only in one or other of those cases that there is provided any power of confirmation. The lands in question were not taken under the provisions for expropriation; and if the widow of Philemon Wright could not give a title, then the provision by which the power of confirmation is given is inapplicable. The terms of the provision are plain as I read them. 1st. Where the conveyance is from the owner the confirmation is intended and provided to purge the lands from all hypothecs or other legal or equitable liens; and, 2nd, where the title cannot be procured from one capable of making it according to the terms of the Act, the amount of the award is paid into Court for the parties entitled to it, to receive it in payment of the land which, in either case, becomes, by the confirmation, vested in the Crown. To apply the provision for confirmation to the case of a purchase from A of B's land, would, in my matured opinion, be doing what the Legislature did not mean and statute has not provided. There are other strong grounds mentioned by my learned brother Fournier which, in my opinion, are legitimate against the validity and efficacy of the confirmation in question. When private rights are invaded by a statute the mode and means provided by the statute must be strictly pursued, and the statute itself strictly construed; and, unless the provision be clearly and plainly applicable, no title can be acquired under it. I am fully of the opinion that the provisions for acquiring a title under the statute in question are inapplicable to the circumstances of this case, and, therefore, that the judgment of confirmation therein was ultra vires and void.\nThe only other defence that I think necessary to consider, concurring as I do generally in the judgment of my learned brother Fournier, is that of prescription by thirty or ten years, as claimed by the defence.\nThe claim of prescription of thirty years is not shown to rest on a proper foundation.\nThe possession of Mrs. Sparks must be characterized by her title, and as her possession was only of the usufruct during her life, and her title therefore precarious, and not as a proprietor, one essential element of the right of prescription was wanting. The possession of the Crown was under thirty years, and it therefore cannot defend by prescribing for any period before the conveyances.\nThe defence under a prescription of ten years is still open for consideration.\nBy article 2211 of the Civil Code, \"the Crown may avail itself of prescription.\"\nAvailing itself of that right, and setting up a defence under it, subjects, in my opinion, the Crown to the same rules and principles as a subject would be. Article 2206 of the Code provides that:\nSubsequent purchasers in good faith, under a translatory title derived either from a precarious or subordinate possessor, or from any other person, may prescribe by ten years against the proprietor during such subordinate or precarious holding.\nIt is contended that the question of bad faith cannot be raised against the Crown, and should not therefore be considered, no matter the extent of bad faith shown on the part of the commissioners, or others acting for the Crown in the purchase of the land. That the King can do no wrong is a maxim well understood, and universally applied, and therefore bad faith cannot be imputed to the Sovereign. The ordinary maxim respondeat superior has no application to the Crown; for the Sovereign cannot, in contemplation of law, command a wrongful act to be done; and it is equally well established, that the Crown cannot be prejudiced by any laches or acts of omission of any of its officers. The doctrine is applicable this far, but here it ends. Where, however, a wrongful act is done, although directly by the Sovereign, as in the improper issue of patents, redress is given, on the principle or theory that the Crown was misinformed in the premises. No bad faith or wrongful act is imputed. When a patent is issued interfering with the rights of a previous patentee, the Crown is not, theoretically, charged with a breach of faith towards the first patentee, although a wrong was done to him for which he has a remedy. Independently of the principles upon which the maxim is founded, it would be bad faith in the Sovereign, and contrary to its own previous grant to both parties, to grant to one what it had no right to, and, by doing so, interfere with the previously acquired rights of the other. Still, those principles do not prevent justice being done to one or both of the parties. In every suit brought in the Exchequer Court against the Crown, the claim is founded on a wrong; but not on one imputed to the Sovereign; and redress is given, if the suppliant is entitled to it. He is not answered by the maxim that the Sovereign can do no wrong. Neither can I think that maxim furnishes an answer in this case. At page 60 of Broom's Legal Maxims, under the heading of the maxim just referred to, we find doctrines and principles applicable to the point under consideration. He says:\nWith respect to injuries to the rights of property, these can scarcely be committed by the Crown, except through the medium of its agents and by misinformation or inadvertency, and the law has furnished the subject with a decent and respectful mode of terminating the invasion of his rights by informing the King of the true state of the matter in dispute, being by petition of right; and as it presumes that to know of any injury and redress it are inseparable in the Royal breast, then issues as of course, in the King's own name, his order to his judges to do justice to the party aggrieved.\nThe record teems with evidence that the Government, through its departmental and other officers, were, all along, aware of the precarious title they were getting from Leamy and Mrs. Sparks, as shown in the judgment of my learned brother, before alluded to; and of the attempts, from time to time made, to remedy the defects in it. As before asserted, if the Crown seeks the remedy of a statute or code, the whole, and not part of it, is invoked, and the Crown cannot ask to have any part of it eliminated. If the Crown adopts the acts of its subordinates, such as the purchase in this case, it must do so under the circumstances as they exist, and there is no principle that I am aware of that would give the Crown in this respect a higher or different position, than could be claimed by a subject. The ingredient of bad faith, although not necessarily communicated, is transmitted to the Crown with the conveyances; and independently of other important considerations is sufficient, in my opinion, to prevent the application of the prescription by ten years.\nIt is, however, desirable to consider the ingredient of bad faith, in connection with the principles involved in the maxim that the King can do no wrong. If the law, as laid down in the extract from Broom, \"presumes that to know of any injury and to redress it are inseparable in the Royal breast,\" and that the order from the Sovereign is \"to do justice to the party aggrieved,\" it is important to consider whether it would comport with that order that any defence should be pleaded in direct violation of it. When the Sovereign orders that justice be done, it must, I think, mean the same justice that would be done between subjects, and by the same legal and equitable principles. I do not contend that the plea of prescription, if applied in its integrity, would necessarily amount to such a violation; but to apply the prescription, without one of its essential constituents and conditions, would I think do so. It would be in direct opposition, not only to the principle involved in the Code, but, in my humble opinion, to the principles which are involved in the maxim that the King can do no wrong, and, at the same time, derogatory to the assumed high moral and dignified position of the Sovereign. The servants of the Crown by bad faith acquire for the Crown a translatory title from one man of the property of another. The fact is brought to the notice of the Sovereign, who orders that justice be done; but the counsel of the Crown would desire to frustrate the equitable desire of the Sovereign by invoking part of an article of the Code and excluding the qualifying provision of it, by which that very question of bad faith would be withdrawn from consideration. This, in my opinion, would be giving to the counsel the right to oppose the Sovereign will, and prevent that justice being done which the Sovereign intended and ordered. I will not speculate as to the propriety of the Sovereign, in view of the high toned and elevated position he is assumed to occupy in regard to the redressing of wrongs done to an individual, pleading prescription, as it is not necessary in this case to do so; but, that the Crown should retain the title and possession of land belonging to others, obtained in bad faith by its servants in the way contended for here, would, I think, be contrary to every well founded principle of law, equity or honor. The Legislature, by the provision requiring good faith, has decreed that, without such, prescription of ten years between subjects shall be insufficient. No subject could therefore hold land, the title to which had been acquired contrary to such good faith. The title of every one is held good unless some one can prescribe for thirty years, or as a recipient of a translatory title in good faith for ten years. In this case there is no evidence of either the thirty years or of the good faith. The defence rests upon shewing good faith. It is a condition of the article and upon which the prescription by ten years depends. It is not for the suppliant to show bad faith. It is not necessary to impute it, but for the defence to establish good faith, which, I think, has not been done. One of three things, I think, must be assumed: first, that the Sovereign was not informed of the purchase before the presentation of the petition; second, that if informed the bad faith was not communicated; or third, that the bad faith was communicated. There is no evidence as to the first, nor is there anything to show any adoption by the Sovereign of the purchase. If the bad faith was not communicated, the Sovereign was deceived as to a fraud perpetrated, which, being subsequently informed of, the Sovereign wishes corrected. If it was communicated the prescription should not run. As to the true position of the Sovereign in this respect we have no evidence; but, taking the second alternative, which is the important one, and that a fraud was practiced on the Sovereign by suppressing the fact of the bad faith, the only honorable, consistent and justifiable course for the Sovereign to take, on discovering it, would be, as has been done here, to require the fact to be inquired into and ascertained, and justice done. The Sovereign is the fountain of honor and dignity, and the law assumes, as before stated, that \"to know of any injury and to redress it are inseparable.\" The order that justice be done cannot surely be alleged to be honestly or honorably carried out by taking a course to prevent it. The Sovereign must be presumed to intend what she orders; and what would be justice between subjects must be equally between her and one of her subjects; and what is meant by the order. If a man of high honor and principle ascertains that, by means of the bad faith of his servant, he is placed in a position to claim another man's property, I need not suggest what would be reasonably expected to be done by him. The Sovereign would not only be assumed on personal considerations to decline holding the property of one of its subjects, but, on the principles before referred to, must be held bound to have justice done; and not by eliminating one part of an article of the Code seek to prevent it. I am not dealing with any assumed merely sentimental question of high honorable principle in the breast of the Sovereign, but with constitutional doctrines underlying rights and liberties necessary for the government of the empire and the administration of justice, and requiring to be strictly maintained. The honorable and dignified position of the Sovereign in dealing with her subjects is too important to be frittered away; and it is as much the duty of Courts to uphold it as to administer the law in any other respect. I think, therefore, to give effect to the position as contended for would be placing the Sovereign in a position antagonistic to the important constitutional principles to which I have thought it necessary to refer. There is still another objection to the applicability of the alleged prescription of ten years independently of the question of bad faith.\nThe Civil Code by article 2227 provides that:\nPrescription is interrupted civilly by any acknowledgment which the possessor or debtor makes of the right of the person against whom the prescription runs.\nArticle 2225 provides that:\nAfter prescription by ten years has been renounced or interrupted, prescription by thirty years alone can be commenced.\nThe evidence in this case shews that the Government, by its active agents and officers, prior to 1855, purchased the property, a part of which is claimed by this petition, and received a deed of sale made by A. Leamy and wife to Her Majesty, dated the 24th of April, 1854. That deed contains the statement that the Government was then in possession of the land thus: \"And the Government who are now in possession of the hereinafter mentioned property.\" Letters and reports dated in April and May, 1855 \u2014a year after the Government acknowledges to have been in possession\u2014show that the Crown agents and officers had not only notice of the precarious title under the previous deed, but clearly, expressly and unequivocally acknowledged the proprietary rights of the parties against whom is invoked the prescription of ten years.\nIt seems to me that under such circumstances the prescription, if any, under previous titles would cease to run and be interrupted.\nArticle 2227 of the Code provides that:\nPrescription is interrupted civilly by renouncing the benefit of a period elapsed, and by any acknowledgment which the possessor or the debtor makes of the right of the person against whom the prescription runs.\nTroplong commenting on article 2248 of the Code Napoleon\u2014which corresponds with the article last cited\u2014says: And first of all the acknowledgment can be made in express terms. The acknowledgment need not be accepted by the creditor. It can also be made by letter. It is sufficient for the creditor not to repudiate it in order that he may avail himself of it, nobody being supposed to give up any right, &c.\nThis Court is asked to say, under the circumstances in this case, that the prescription has not been interrupted and gives a right to defend this action.\nThe Sovereign, by her agents or officers, was in possession for a year before the acknowledgments were made; and the knowledge and dealings of an agent whose act in respect to other parties is adopted by his principal must be considered the knowledge and dealings of the principal.\nIn the words of Article 2227 the prescription was civilly interrupted by the acknowledgment while in possession of the proprietary rights of the persons against whom the prescription is invoked. Having once acknowledged this right\u2014with the full knowledge of the title\u2014the prescription was interrupted and therefore according to Article 2255:\nAfter prescription by ten years has been interrupted, prescription by thirty years alone can be commenced.\nIt cannot be contended that by taking another deed from the same vendors subsequent to the acknowledgment the defect was cured, and the peculiar provisions of Article 2255 are to be rendered inoperative. On the contrary, in my opinion, it strengthens the opposite contention. After the acknowledgments of title in the authors of the suppliant, no further conveyances from the same vendors could remedy the defect in the title, as, nemo sibi causam possessionis mutare posse, or, as put by a French writer,\u2014\"toute qualit\u00e9 imprim\u00e9e \u00e0 un titre doit subsister ind\u00e9finiment.\"\nIt may be claimed that after the ratification by the Superior Court, supposing that to have been intra vires as relating to the title of the heirs, the holding was in good faith, and that it was a holding animo domini from that time. I don't think it should be so concluded. The knowledge of the title of the heirs existed before, at, and after the alleged ratification; but if the ratification divested that title we need not consider the question of prescription. If it did not from any cause do so, it cannot be taken as anything more than a further attempt unsuccessfully made, a void proceeding against the title of the heirs, and being inoperative cannot cure the bad faith previously existing. It must I think, be regarded only as another ineffectual struggle to deprive them of their rights in the property without removing the element of bad faith.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and judgment given for the appellant, to the extent stated in the judgment of my learned brother Fournier, with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J., concurred in affirming the judgment of the Exchequer Court.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThe petition alleges, and it may be admitted to be true, that Philemon Wright, the younger, on or about the 4th day of May, 1808, being then seised in fee of Lots Nos. 2 and 3 in the 5th range of the Township of Hull, was married to Sarah Olmstead without any marriage contract, and that, being still seised of the same estate and other lands, he died intestate, leaving issue of that marriage, and his widow Sarah, him surviving.\nThe petitioner has produced in evidence a deed dated the 20th of November, 1822, appointing the said Sarah Olmstead tutrix of the children of the marriage, whose names and ages are therein respectively stated to be as follows:\u20141st. Philemon Wright, stated to be aged 14 years; 2nd. Hull Wright, aged 12 years; 3rd. Pamelia Wright, aged 10 years; 4th. Horatio Gates Wright, aged 8 years; 5th. Wellington Wright, aged 6 years; 6th. Erexina Wright, aged 4 years; 7th. Serina Wright, aged 2 years; and 8th, Sally Wright, aged 10 months.\nNow, it is apparent that at some time before the year 1838, and during the minority of several of the children, an arrangement (which may well be believed to have been a family arrangement for the partition of the whole heritable estate whereof Philemon Wright Jr. died seised in the above lands among his eight children and his widow, the latter to take in fee a smaller portion of the estate than she would have been entitled to for her estate in dower), was verbally agreed upon, and that notwithstanding the minority of several of the children it was acted upon as if it had been perfect and effectual in law, for we find that on the 11th of January, 1837, Wellington Wright, who was then most probably himself a minor, and while his three younger sisters certainly were, conveyed the share allotted to him upon the partition to Nicholas Sparks, to whom Sarah Olmstead had been married in 1826, and on the same 11th January, 1837, Horatio Gates Wright, by a like deed, conveyed also to Mr. Sparks the share allotted to Horatio, by the same agreement for partition.\nIn these deeds Wellington Wright and Horatio G. Wright respectively describe the piece of land by each conveyed to Sparks as: \"That part of the farm belonging to my late father, apportioned to me, as will appear on the diagram drawn by Anthony Swallwell, Deputy Provincial Surveyor, which piece of land is butted and bounded as follows\"\u2014&c., &c.; and the deeds contained covenants executed by each grantor respectively for further assurances to be executed by all and every other person or persons whomsoever having any claim, estate, right, title or interest in or to the piece of land thereby granted, &c., or any part thereof.\nThen we find that by several deeds executed upon the 5th day of March, 1838, all in like form, the heirs of Philemon Wright, deceased, reciting the partition which had been agreed upon, purported to secure to each other the allotment assigned to each. The deed to Erexina, then the wife of Andrew Leamy, is as follows:\nKnow all men by these presents that we Philemon Wright Jr., Hull Wright, Pamelia Wright, wife of Thomas McGoey, Esq.; Horatio Wright, Serina Wright, wife of James Pearce; Erexina Wright, wife of Andrew Leamy; Sally Wright, surviving heirs of the late Philemon Wright Jr., of the Township of Hull, in the District of Montreal, in the Province of Lower Canada, having mutually agreed to divide the inheritance left us by our late father, we have caused the same to be surveyed by Anthony Swallwell, Deputy Surveyor for the Province of Lower Canada, who having ascertained the quantity of land in Lots numbers 2, 3 and 4, in the 5th concession of the said Township of Hull, being the property of our late father, hath computed the same to be 591 acres 1 rood and 24 perches, including a certain pond of water, the said portion of land having been sub-divided, the following portions have been allotted to each, that is to say:\nTo Philemon Wright,\n43 acres 2 roods.\nTo Hull Wright,\n43 \" 2 \"\nTo Pamelia Wright,\n49 \"\nTo Horatio Wright,\n53 \" 1 \" 24 perches.\nTo Wellington Wright,\n48 \"\nTo Serina Wright,\n60 \"\nTo Erexina Wright,\n65 \"\nTo Sally Wright,\n70 \"\nTo Sally Olmstead, our mother,\n159 \" the said pond of water\ninclusive, with all which we are content.\nAnd in order the better to secure to each other a legal title to the said portions of land aforesaid, we the said Philemon Wright, Hull Wright, Pamelia Wright, Horatio Wright, Serina Wright, and Sally Wright by these presents do grant, remise, release, and forever quit claim unto the said Erexina Wright, her heirs and assigns all our right, title, interest and estate to the 65 acres of land, (described by metes and bounds), to have and to hold the above released premises to her, the said Erexina Wright, her heirs and assigns to her and their use and behoof forever, so that neither we the said Philemon Wright, Hull Wright, Pamelia Wright, Horatio Wright, Serina Wright and Sally Wright, nor our heirs, nor any other person or persons claiming by, from or under us or them, or in the name, right or stead of us or them, shall or will by any ways or means have, claim or demand any right or title to the above released premises or to any part or parcel thereof.\nThis instrument is signed by all the parties named therein except Wellington Wright, who was then dead, and Serina Wright and her husband James Pearce, who, though living, were not parties executing it; although not executing this deed, Serina appears to have executed all the other deeds. Now, with reference to the recital in these deeds of the allotments which had previously been made, and which must have been made in the lifetime of Wellington Wright and during the minority of three at least of the children, if not also during the minority of Wellington, it is to be observed that the allotment stated to have been made to Sally Olmstead, the mother, is stated in precisely the same language as the allotments to all the others. The whole of the estate whereof the father died seised is stated to have been divided into nine parcels, and a parcel is allotted to each of nine persons, one of whom is Sally Olmstead, the mother. That one of the nine persons to whom the respective allotments are made is to take a different estate from the others is not stated; the contrary seems to be implied, for the agreement recited is not an agreement to divide presently among the heirs the residue of the estate whereof the father died seised, after deducting the one-half to which the mother was entitled as customary dower, and the reversion in such half (abiding the event of her death to come into possession of the latter half), nor is it an agreement to divide presently among the heirs the one-half, and to leave the other half to be divided at the death of the mother; the agreement is to divide presently the whole inheritance left by the father, and for that purpose to divide it into nine parcels and to allot a parcel to each of nine persons alike, one of such being the mother. It is not suggested, on the deed, nor yet by any evidence given in the cause, that the 159 acres allotted to the mother were so allotted as having a peculiar value equal to the value of half of the whole estate, nor that she had consented to take the 159 acres in life use as her customary dower, nor that the part of the 159 acres, which consisted of a pond of 71 acres, had any value. Nor is it likely that at that early period before the improvements subsequently made that it had. However, there is no suggestion that the 159 acres were to be enjoyed by the mother for her life only, or that they were a fair and reasonable equivalent for her customary dower in the 295 acres, the half of the estate, nor that the allotment was made upon that foundation, or with that view, or that the mother had agreed to any such arrangement, and in the absence of any suggestions or evidence of the above nature the recital in the deeds is more consistent with an agreement for partition having been made, as it might have been, if the parties were willing to concur in it, that the whole property should be divided into nine allotments, one to be given to each of the nine persons named, of whom the mother was one, to be enjoyed presently, in severalty in fee; and that this was the intention obtains confirmation, as appears to me, from the frame of a deed of the same date executed in favor of Nicholas Sparks, confirming to him Wellington Wright's portion conveyed to him by this deed of January, 1837. This deed is as follows:\nKnow all men by these presents that we Philemon Wright, Hull Wright, Pamelia Wright, wife of Thomas McGoey, Esq., Horatio Wright, Serina Wright, wife of James Pierce, Erexina Wright, wife of Andrew Leamy, and Sally Wright, surviving heirs of the late Philemon Wright Jr., of the Township of Hull, &c., have mutually released and quitted claim to each other the several portions of our late father's estate allotted to us by deed bearing even date with these presents; and, whereas, our late brother Wellington Wright did by deed, bearing date the eleventh day of January, in the year of Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven, for a certain consideration therein mentioned, relinquish his claim to the certain portion of our father's property allotted to him, in favor of Nicholas Sparks, Esq., of Bytown, and whereas it appears to us to be just and reasonable that the said Nicholas Sparks should be confirmed in his title to the said portion of our late brother. Therefore, &c., &c., &c.\nThis deed appears to have been executed only by Hull Wright, Serina Wright, Pamelia Wright, and Sally Wright, although prepared for execution by all parties. It speaks however, as it appears tonne, of the allotments made to each as the certain portion of each in their father's property, an expression precisely applicable, assuming the whole estate to have been divided and Sarah Olmstead to have taken one allotment equally with the others. Then, by deeds of lease and release, bearing date respectively the 30th of April and 1st May, 1839, Sally Wright and her husband, William Colter, bargained, sold and released to Andrew Leamy, his heirs and assigns forever, the piece of land, describing it by metes and bounds, which by the deeds of March, 1838, is said to have been allotted to Sally Wright.\nWe find next, that by a deed bearing date the 12th September, 1849, Sarah Olmstead, claiming this property as her own absolute property, by notarial deed executed by her and her husband, Nicholas Sparks, granted, bargained, sold, assigned, transferred and made over, with promise of warranty against all gifts, dowers, debts, mortgages, substitutions, alienations and other hindrances whatsoever, to Her Majesty Queen Victoria, Her heirs and successors, represented herein by the Honorable Etinne Pascal Tach\u00e9, Chief Commissioner of Public Works of the Province of Canada, a certain piece of land, &c. &c., describing it\u2014\"The aforesaid hereby bargained and sold piece of land and premises being holden by the tenure of free and common socage, free and clear of every charge, burden and incumbrance,\" &c., &c.\nNow, the piece of land hereby conveyed was part of the above allotment made to Sarah Olmstead, and this deed is only consistent with the fact that up to the time of its execution, in September, 1849, she was under the impression and belief that she was seised in fee simple of the portion allotted to her.\nIn the year 1852, Andrew Leamy plainly entertained the design of increasing his estate in these and the adjoining lots, for he purchased from one Nancy Louisa Wright, by a notarial deed, dated the 6th December, 1852, a part of lot No 2, in the 4th concession, and of lot No. 1, in the 5th concession, and a part of lot No. 28 in the long range of the Township of Templeton, on the east side of the Gatineau River, adjoining those lots whereof Philemon Wright Jr., had died seised, and by another notarial deed, dated the 7th December, 1852, he purchased from Mr. Sparks, who, jointly with his wife, Sarah Olmstead, conveyed to Leamy the respective pieces purchased by Sparks from Wellington and Horatio G. Wright, free and clear of every charge, burden, &c., excepting such as are imposed by the Letters Patent from the Crown, comprehending the said pieces of land.\nIt would seem, that about this time the Commissioners of Public Works were making surveys, and contemplating acquiring more land in the locality for improvements about to be made in the Gatineau works, and it is not unlikely that those contemplated improvements may have operated in some measure in inducing Leamy to extend his estate by purchase. The knowledge that the Commissioners of Public Works would investigate the title of any lands they might be about to purchase, may have induced him to have been more particular in having the title of Sparks to the land he was about to purchase from him looked into, than he would otherwise have been. Up to this time there does not appear to have been any doubt whatever raised, by any of the parties interested in the Philemon Wright estate, as to the right of Sarah Olmstead, then Mrs. Sparks, selling as absolute proprietor, the piece of land which, claiming to be such, she had sold to the Commissioners of Public Works in 1849. It seems that when Leamy was contemplating purchasing the lands in which Sparks was interested by purchase from Horatio and Wellington Wright, he also contemplated purchasing from Mrs. Sparks the residue of the 159 acres, including the pond allotted to her, after deducting the 21 acres 1 rood and 25 perches sold by her to the Commissioners of Public Works in 1849, and it is not improbable that Leamy's better knowledge, arising perhaps from his residing in the neighborhood, of the quantity and situation of the lands which the Commissioners were having inspected, and surveyed, and would require, induced him to make those purchases, and it is altogether likely that upon the negotiation of the purchase from Sparks, he had his title investigated and also that of Mrs. Sparks to the residue of the 159 acres allotted to her, which he contemplated purchasing also. It was probably at this time discovered that, however much the parties may have intended, and Mrs. Sparks, formerly Sarah Olmstead, may have believed that she held the 159 acres allotted to her in fee, as the children held their shares, and in lieu of her claims to dower in the half of her deceased husband's estate, yet that no deed may have been executed to her, as had been to the children in March, 1838, or if executed, that it was defective by reason of some of the children having been infants, and she may have then for the first time been awakened to the discovery that a title, which she may have considered to be, and which all her children may have considered and intended to be, perfect, was in truth imperfect, for the want of a deed executed by parties competent in law to bind themselves and their heirs, evidencing what may have been well known in the family to have been the intention of the whole family.\nThe petitioner relies upon a notarial deed executed upon this same 7th December, 1852, by Mrs. Sparks to Leamy, for the purpose of showing that, as he contends, the fact is Leamy knew that Mrs. Sparks had only a usufructuary interest for life as her dower, in the 159 acres. By this deed she, describing herself as Sarah Olmstead, declared that she sold, assigned, transferred and made over from thenceforth and forever, with warranty of her own acts only, to Mr. Andrew Leamy, all and all manner of dower and right or title of dower whatever, either customary or conventional, prefix, which she might, or of right, ought to have a claim into and out of that messuage tenement parcel or piece of land heretofore belonging to Philemon Wright Jr., her late husband, and which, at the division or partition thereof between her the said Sarah Olmstead and the heirs of the said Philemon Wright, was set apart to and for the use of her the said Sarah Olmstead, excepting, however, that piece sold by the said Sarah Olmstead to Her Majesty for the use of the Gatineau Works by deed (1032), dated 12th September, 1849, to have and to hold unto the said Andrew Leamy, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, the said dowers and all other rights whatsoever belonging to the said Sarah Olmstead, and which the latter claims as her right of dower of, into and upon the said messuages, tenements, parcel or piece of land referred to in said diagram, and called Sally Olmstead, with the exception of the piece sold to Her Majesty, and the said Sarah Olmstead thereby substituted and subrogated the said Andrew Leamy, his heirs &c., &c., in and to all and singular her rights of actions for and in respect of said dowers, to be claimed in the said messuage tenement, parcel or piece of land referred to in said diagram and marked Sally Olmstead, excepting, however, what is before excepted.\nIt is quite consistent with this deed, notwithstanding its frame, that both Sarah Olmstead and Leamy may have well known that the intention of the family was that the former should enjoy the 159 acres in fee in lieu of her dower in her husband's estate, and that Leamy may have been advised that, whatever might be their belief or knowledge upon that point, if the fee had not been in law secured to her by a deed executed for that purpose by persons competent to bind themselves, it would be of no use to him, if he comtemplated selling to the Government, to take a deed in fee from Sarah Olmstead as from an absolute proprietor, if he could produce no deed showing such a title in her, and that under the circumstances his best plan would be to take a deed describing the title as it would be in the absence of a deed conveying the land to her in fee, and that, as he knew what the intention of the family had been, of which family he was a member by marriage at the time of the execution of the deeds of 1838, having been married to Erexina Wright, in 1835, he might run the risk of having the title made perfect by the family, so as to enable him to give a good title to the Commissioners of Public Works. It may be said that all this is mere suggestion; but after the death of the parties to this transaction, and 27 years after it took place, a suggestion of motives explanatory of conduct, which, from matters which do sufficiently appear, would seem to be very natural and highly probable, may well be put forward and relied upon in answer to suggestions of bad faith, for which purpose this deed is relied upon by the petitioner, and for the purpose also of adding weight and support to the bona fides of other instruments subsequently executed which the Crown relies upon, and which are assailed by the petitioner as false.\nIt seems that at this time the Commissioners of Public Works, through their counsel, were taking the ordinary precautions usual in such cases of enquiring into the title to the lands they contemplated acquiring, and it seems reasonable to conclude from the letters and reports which passed between the Superintendent of Works and the Secretary of the Commissioners that, in so far as affected the title to so much of the land then contemplated being acquired, which formed part of the 159 acres alloted to Sarah Olmstead, the only title shown up to and in the month of April, 1853, was the title, whatsoever that might be, which appeared upon the transfers of Horatio G. Wright and of Wellington Wright's interests, sold and conveyed to Sparks by the deeds of January 7th, 1837; upon the releases of the 5th March, 1838; upon the deed of lease and release of 1839, executed by Sally Wright and her husband to Leamy; upon the deed executed by Sparks in December, 1852, conveying to Leamy the shares of Horatio G. and Wellington Wright; and upon the deed of the same month of December executed by Mrs. Sparks, formerly Sarah Olmstead, and her husband to Leamy. It may be admitted that the deed of release of 3rd February, 1853, had not as yet been communicated to any person acting in the investigation of the title upon the part of the Commissioners. That deed purports to bear date the 3rd of February, 1853, and to have been executed by Horatio G. Wright, Elizabeth Wright, Sarah Wright and Philemon Wright in the presence of James Goodwin and John Doyle\u2014and to sell, transfer and make over unto Andrew Leamy, his heirs and assigns all right, title, interest and claim of whatever nature either as heirs or otherwise, which they or any of them then had or might thereafter have in, to or upon that piece of land and pond of water heretofore belonging to Philemon Wright Jr., in his lifetime, of Hull, and which at a division of his property between his heirs and his widow, Sarah Olmstead, was set apart to and for the use of the said Sarah Olmstead, as will appear by reference to a diagram drawn by Anthony Swallwell, surveyor, annexed to a transfer made by the said Sarah Olmstead to the said Andrew Leamy, executed before A. Larue on the 7th December, 1852, and part of which is now used for the purposes of the Gatineau boom.\nNow, this deed is so framed as to be consistent with the fact that the 159 acres were intended by all parties to have been enjoyed in fee by Sarah Olmstead as her share on the partition, although that intention may not have been effectually executed in law. Nothing turns upon the fact of the signature of Elizabeth Wright (Mrs. Leamy) to this deed being void, for the title of the Crown, in so far as Mrs. Leamy's interest is concerned, requires not this deed to support it; for she is a party to the conveyances under the statute under which the Crown claims.\nBut the petitioner asserts that this deed is a forgery in so far as the signatures of Sarah and Philemon Wright are concerned. These two persons were called by the petitioner and severally denied the signatures of their respective names to be in their hand writing. Sally Wright, however, having been shown the deeds of lease and release of 1839, admitted that she had signed them, and upon being asked to compare those signatures with the signature of the name of Sarah Wright to the deed of February, 1853, she admitted that they resembled each other, and that she sometimes signed her name as Sarah and sometimes as Sally. Philemon Wright, upon being asked whether he had any reason for saying that the signature of \"P. Wright\" to the deed was not in his hand writing, said that he had\u2014namely, that he was not in Hull, but was a long way off in the bush upon the 3rd February, 1853, the day of the date of the instrument, and much evidence was entered into in support of this his allegation, but, as it seems to me, very little weight is to be attributed to this evidence, for it may be quite true that upon the 3rd February, 1853, he was absent, as he says, in the bush, and yet the deed may be a perfectly good and honest deed; indeed, it may be so even though it should not have been executed by Philemon Wright until after the expiration of some months after the time at which it bears date. Where a deed is prepared for execution by different persons who may be living at places remote from each other, and for that reason is executed by the several parties at different times, it is usual to date the deed of the day that it is executed by the one who first signs it, and those who sign subsequently adopt the deed as of the date so given to it. A cautious and precise witness would in such cases insert above his signature as a witness, for refreshment of his own memory, the time and place where each party executed the instrument, but an omission to do so would not avoid the deed, Now, it may be that this deed was signed by all but Philemon (whose name is set last to it) upon the 3rd of February, 1853, and that Philemon's signature was subsequently obtained upon his return from the bush. In that case the deed would be perfectly good and valid, although what he said as to his absence in the bush on the day the deed bears date may be true. Doyle, who was one of the subscribing witnesses to the deed, died early in 1854, and his signature is proved. Another subscribing witness, who swore to its execution for registry in August, 1876, was called and proves his own signature. He says that he made the affidavit for registry upon the faith of seeing his signature as a subscribing witness, but that he has no recollection at this distance of time of the fact of being present at the execution of it. This is precisely the evidence which might be expected from him after the lapse of 23 years. He gave evidence that the name of the other subscribing witness, John Doyle, was in the handwriting of a person of that name whom he knew at that time living in Ottawa, as bar-keeper to one James Leamy. He had no recollection of the fact of seeing any party sign the deed, and he said that without his own signature he would not have recollected anything about it. Being asked on cross examination by the petitioner's counsel, whether it was not possible that the names of the parties to the document were not signed in his presence, he replied that he could not say it was not possible. He was then asked if he meant to say that he was positive that he was present and saw the parties to the document sign their names thereto, to which he replied \"certainly not, I have no recollection at all.\" The following question was then put\u2014\"Then you cannot say that you were present when the document was signed?\u2014to which he replied\u2014\"I cannot say that I was present when they signed.\" Upon re-examination, the following question was put to him:\u2014\"With reference to your last answer, do you mean to say that you recollect you were not present as a witness?\"\u2014to which he replied\u2014\"I say I have no recollection of the signing in my presence, I could not swear whether I was present or not when they signed.\" To my mind, what this witness intended to convey by all this was just what he had stated in his examination in chief, namely, that he had no actual recollection at all of the matter; that he could not swear to anything about it from recollection, but that there was his signature, upon the faith of which he made the affidavit for registration; and that there was, to witness's knowledge and belief, Doyle's name in Doyle's handwriting as a subscribing witness also. Unless the deed was executed by some persons representing themselves to be the parties respectively signing it, both this witness and Doyle must have been parties to a forgery. Now, it is impossible to read the witness's evidence as intending to convey that he could falsely have set his name as subscribing witness to the execution of a deed which he had never seen executed, and, if this be not what he intended, then his evidence is just what might have been expected from an honest witness after 23 years, who had no recollection of the fact of execution, but who saw his own signature and that of another person whom he knew set as subscribing witnesses to the execution, and who, upon the faith of such subscription, had, in 1876, made oath to the execution for registration.\nThere are many reasons which may be urged, and there is also other evidence which may be relied upon, in my judgment, in support of the genuine character of the deed. Firstly, The recitals in the deeds of March, 1838, afford evidence to my mind, that the intention of all the parties to the partition of Philemon Wright's estate recited in those deeds was that the whole of his estate should be divided into nine parts, of which his widow should take one part in satisfaction of and in lieu of her dower, and that it was with this intent that the 159 acres, of which 71 acres were pond, were allotted to her. Secondly, Then as to Horatio and Wellington Wright, the deeds executed by them respectively to Sparks are fairly, as it seems to me, open to the construction that they were selling the whole of their respective interests in their father's estate. Thirdly, When Sarah Olmstead, in 1849, sold the 21 acres 1 rood and 25 perches to the Government, there can be no doubt that she regarded herself as being, and claimed to be, the owner in fee of the 159 acres allotted to her. Fourthly. That she had so sold this piece, claiming to be seised in fee, must have been known, we may fairly assume, to her children, and yet none of them, so far as appears, made any objection to her having so done, or disputed her right to do so. Fifthly, Leamy may have been advised to take the deed of December, 1852, in the frame in which it was, because of Sarah Olmstead being unable to produce a deed transferring the fee of the 159 acres to her, although as one of the family he may have known that the intention of all parties was that she should take the fee, and he may have relied upon getting the family to confirm his title in pursuance of, and with a view to giving effect to, such original intention, so as to enable him to deal with the Commissioners. In this view the frame of that deed cannot be appealed to, to his prejudice. Sixthly, Under these circumstances and in this view, the execution of the deed of the 3rd of February, 1853, would have been a proper act to be performed by the respective parties to that deed, and would have been but the fulfilment and discharge of a moral obligation resting upon those parties to give legal effect, so far as they could, to what had been agreed between the parties to the partition, and acted upon as if it had been legally effectuated. Seventhly, Under these circumstances, it would be reasonable that the deed should be executed without any consideration therefor being paid by Leamy. None appears or is pretended to have been paid by him; it merely states that it is executed for good and valid considerations previously paid. Eighthly, The withdrawal of all opposition by Hull Wright, Pamelia Wright and Serina Wright to the confirmation of the deed of May, 1855, subsequently executed by Leamy to the Government, also affords strong evidence in confirmation of the position that Sarah Olmstead was intended to have an estate in fee in the 159 acres, and that it was for this reason that the opposition was withdrawn; and Ninthly, The execution of the several deeds under which the petitioner claims, for the consideration of which evidence has been given, is quite consistent with the parties who executed those deeds believing that they had no beneficial interest to transfer, and is, to my mind, wholly inconsistent with their believing themselves to have any beneficial interest.\nBut, besides all these considerations, there is the evidence of one Clark, who having taken receipts from Horatio, Serina and Philemon Wright, which he produced, testified to his belief that the instrument dated the 3rd February, 1853, was signed by those persons; an opportunity of the comparison of the signatures of those persons with undoubted documents signed by them respectively has been also afforded us, which, I confess, instead of creating a doubt in my mind, confirms me in the belief that the signatures to the deed of February, 1853, are genuine.\nIt was argued, that if the deed was genuine it would have been brought forward by Leamy at once upon its execution. But who is to say? Certainly no one does say that it was not exhibited to Mr. McCord, the counsel taking the title upon behalf of the Commissioners. Its having been produced to Mr. McCord, we may conclude with certainty, would have had no effect whatever upon him, so as to have diverted his mind for an instant from taking the steps which he seems to have resolved to take, namely, to take a deed, under the Act of Parliament, executed by Leamy, as the best and most perfect title which in his judgment could be obtained, and the only one that he would recommend; and to procure a confirmation of it. Upon the whole, therefore, the evidence in favor of the genuineness of the deed appears to me to be immeasurably stronger than that offered against it. The fact of this deed not having been registered until after the registration of the deeds under which the petitioner claims, is, in my judgment, of no importance, for the title by the conveyance under which the Crown claims from Leamy and wife, which is made a good title by statute, and which deed was registered at the time of its execution, intervened[49]. Moreover, at the time of the Code coming into force, the Crown was in open and public possession of the land as owner, and so within the exception enacted by article 2088 of the Code.\nThen, by notarial deed dated the 27th September, 1853, Sarah Olmstead sold, ceded, transferred and made over, with warranty of her own acts and deeds, to Andrew Leamy, all the right, claim, title and interest, demand and property of the said Sarah Olmstead, of, in, to and upon that piece or parcel of land situate, &c., &c., and described on the plan drawn by Anthony Swallwell, surveyor, and which is of record in the office of A. Larue, one of the undersigned notaries, together with the pond of water included in the said piece or parcel of land, excepting, and the said Sarah Olmstead doth except and reserve out of said piece or parcel of land and pond of water, all that certain piece containing 21 acres 1 rood and 25 perches, sold to the Government by deed bearing date the 12th September, 1849. This deed is expressed to be made in consideration of \u00a3100 acknowledged to have been paid to her by Leamy previous to the 7th December, 1852, upon which day the said Sarah Olmstead declares that she delivered unto the said Andrew Leamy seisin and possession of the said piece or parcel of land so transferred and described as aforesaid.\nWith respect to this deed it may be observed that, if it was never intended that Sarah Olmstead should be the owner in fee of the piece allotted to her, in lieu of her dower in her deceased husband's estate, and if it was only allotted to her to enjoy the usufruct for life as her dower, there would have been no sense whatever in her executing this deed after having, in December, 1852, sold all her interest in the land, if her usufruct by way of dower was all the interest she was supposed to have; but if the deed of December, 1852, was executed under the circunstances and for the purpose which I have above suggested when dealing with that deed as the probable motive for its being executed in the frame in which it was prepared, then, if Leamy had afterwards procured the release of February, 1853, to be executed by the parties thereto, which, if executed by them, is fairly open to the construction that it was so executed in recognition and confirmation of the previous intention entertained at the time of the partition, that Sarah Olmstead should hold her allotment in fee, it was not unnatural or improbable that Leamy should have been advised to take a deed from Sarah Olmstead, conveying to him her estate in the land, whatever it might be, not describing it as dower, in support of Leamy's title to the whole lot in fee as against McGoey and Hull Wright and Serina Wright, in case they should persist in withholding their recognition of Sarah Olmstead's claim to the fee in accordance with the intention entertained at the partition. The execution of this deed affords to my mind strong evidence of the bona fides of the contention that such was the intention entertained by the parties to the partition at the time it was made.\nI pass over the deed of March, 1854, executed by Leamy and wife, because by deeds subsequently executed by them, in May, 1855, that deed was vacated. It appears that subsequently to March, 1854, the Commissioners contemplated acquiring more land than was mentioned in that deed, and not being able to agree with Leamy as to the price, it was by mutual agreement referred to Mr. A. J. Russell to set a price upon the several parcels. This Russell did, and the prices so set by him were adopted by Leamy, who thereupon agreed to accept those prices for the lands. Accordingly, two deeds were prepared, bearing date the 7th of May. 1855, and executed by Leamy and wife: by one of those deeds they conveyed to the Crown the 18 acres and 26 perches acquired by Leamy by the deed of December, 1852, from Nancy Louisa Wright; a strip of land, parcel of the allotment of Wellington Wright, conveyed by him to Sparks in January, 1837, and sold by Sparks to Leamy by deed of December, 1852, and a small strip forming part of the allotment of Erexina Wright, Leamy's wife. By the other deed Leamy and wife conveyed the following parcels of the said lots 2 and 3, in the 5th concession of Hull, namely: 1st, a strip of land on the east side of the Gatineau River; 2nd, 65 acres and 10 perches, parcel of the 159 acres allotted to Sarah Olmstead; and 3rd, a part of lot No. 2, particularly described in the deed. Of the lands comprised in this deed it is only with the 65 acres and 10 perches, as I understand it, that we have to deal. The price, however, representing all the lands comprised in this deed, as agreed upon between Leamy and the Commissioners in pursuance of the award of Russell, was paid into the hands of the Prothonotary of the Court of Queen's Bench for the district in which the lands lay, in pursuance of the provisions of 9th Vic., ch. 37, sec. 9, for the advisers of the Commissioners seemed to have determined to rest upon a title acquired under that Act.\nNow the 8th sec. of the Act had enabled the Commissioners to contract and agree as to the price of the lands they might require, with all persons possessed of or interested in such lands. And by the 9th section it was enacted that\u2014In Lower Canada the compensation agreed upon by the Commissioners and any party lawfully in possession as proprietor of any lands which might be lawfully taken under the Act, without the consent of the proprietor, should stand in the stead of such land, and that any claim to, as well as any hypothec, or incumbrance upon the said land, or any portion thereof, should be converted into a claim to or upon the compensation, and that if the Commissioners should have reason to believe that any such claims, &c., &c., exist upon the land, &c., &c., &c., or if for any other reason the Commissioners should deem it to be advisable, it should be lawful for them to pay the money into the Court, together with an authentic copy of the conveyance, and that proceedings should be thereupon had for confirmation of such title, in like manner as in other cases of confirmation of title, except that in addition to the usual contents of the notice, the Prothonotary should state that such conveyance was under the Act, and should call upon all persons entitled to, or to any part of the land, or representing or being the husband of any parties so entitled, to file their opposition for their claims to the compensation, or any part thereof, and all such oppositions should be received and adjudged upon by the Court, and the adjudgment of confirmation should forever bar all claims to the land, or any part thereof, including dower not yet open, &c., &c., &c., and the Court should make such order for the distribution, payment or investment of the compensation, and for securing the rights of all parties interested, as to right and justice, according to the provisions of this Act and to law should appertain, &c.\nFrom this Act it appears that the Legislature contemplated the Commissioners agreeing with a person in possession animo domini as to the price to be paid for the fee simple title to the land of which he was in possession, although he might turn out not to be seised of the whole of such estate. The Act, as it appears to me, authorizes the Commissioners to agree as to the amount of compensation which is to stand instead of the land with a person in possession animo domini, that is, as a proprietor, although it might turn out that the title under which he claimed was imperfect, or that he was not sole proprietor, but that others were entitled to undivided interests in the land with him.\nThe provisions of the 9th section and of the last clause of the 8th section seem to me to have been framed for the precise purpose of meeting such a case and of vesting in Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, all land contracted for in manner aforesaid, and the object appears to have been to protect the Crown, when contracting with a person in possession as a proprietor, against the claims of all other persons to the land, or to anything but the compensation so agreed upon, in case any others should prove to be entitled to the land, or to some part thereof.\nThe Legislature has, by these two sections taken together, in effect declared, that a contract made with the commissioners by a person in possession as proprietor shall convert the claims of all persons interested in the land from claims to the land into claims for the compensation agreed to be paid for the land.\nNow, that Leamy, when this deed of the 7th of May, 1855, was executed, was in possession as a proprietor, and that he believed himself to be, and that he claimed to be, absolute proprietor of the 159 acres allotted to Mrs. Olmstead, I do not think we can reasonably doubt; from the view which I take, as already expressed, it will be seen that, in my opinion, he had just and sufficient grounds for entertaining such belief, but, however this may be, there can be no doubt, I think, that he was in possession as proprietor, animo domini, and that he was a person competent, within the provisions of the Act, to agree with the Commissioners upon the price to be paid for the whole land, and so to convert the claims of all persons, if any others should prove to be interested in the land with him, into claims upon the compensation so agreed upon.;\nThe deed having been executed under the 8th section, we find that proceedings were taken under the 9th sec. to obtain confirmation of that deed. These proceedings, as it appears to me, were not enacted so much for the purpose of making the title of the Crown to the land contracted for with Leamy by the Commissioners more perfect than it always was in virtue of the contract with Leamy, and the conveyance executed by him, which by force and effect of the 8th section in connection with the 9th had, as I think, in the existing circumstances converted the claims of all persons \"to the land or any portion thereof\" into a claim upon the said compensation, as they were inserted for the protection of the Crown against claims to the compensation.\nBut assuming the proceeding to confirmation to be a step necessary to complete the bar of all claims to the land, this step was taken, and upon being taken, Hull Wright and Pamelia Wright, the wife of Thomas McGoey, which Hull Wright and Thomas McGoey had, by letter of April 26, 1855, notified the Commissioners of Public Works that they were personally interested in the land, and Serina Wright, filed oppositions in the proper court in that behalf. The Act declares that such oppositions being made shall be received and adjudged upon by the Court, and such proceedings were thereupon had that these oppositions were withdrawn upon application of the opposants to the Court, which therefore adjudicated upon the oppositions by dismissing them. Now, when these parties, in conformity with a notice informing them that the deed sought to be confirmed was a conveyance executed by Leamy and wife for the purpose of giving a title under the Act, and calling upon all persons entitled to any part of the land to file their oppositions for their claims to the compensation or to any part thereof, do file such oppositions and afterwards withdraw them, they must be considered as abandoning all claims. And after so withdrawing their claims such opposants cannot, in my opinion, be permitted, nor can any person claming through or under them be permitted, afterwards to impugn the title obtained by the Crown by reason of any imperfection, irregularity or defect, if any such should occur in the proceedings taken towards confirmation of the title subsequently to the withdrawal of such oppositions, and therefore it is not, in my opinion, competent for these parties, or for the petitioner as claiming through them, to attack the judgment of confirmation as he has done by the inscription en faux for an alleged omission to paraph the judgment. What injury could it work to the parties who had withdrawn their claims, if subsequently some irregularity or defect should occur? Plainly they would not be prejudiced by any such defect, and therefore, as it seems to me, upon no principle should they be allowed to make such an objection. I am of opinion, however, that the evidence which they offered in support of the inscription en faux was defective and insufficient, for the reasons given by the learned Judge of the Court of Exchequer in his judgment in that Court.\nIt is said, moreover, that the oppositions which were filed in Court were improperly withdrawn by the attornies of the opposants without their consent. In reply to this, it may be observed that this is an assertion of which no proof was offered, and if it were true, as asserted, that could not affect the title of the Crown to the land, for if the attornies of the opposants improperly withdrew the oppositions filed, without the consent of their clients, the utmost relief in such a state of things which the clients could obtain would be, to be reinstated in their oppositions, and that they should be permitted to reassert their claims against the compensation, which by the statute was made to stand in the place of the land. The improper and unauthorized withdrawal of the oppositions filed by the attornies, if such a thing did take place, would not revest the interest, if any, which the clients may have formerly had in the lands in them so as to enable them to convey such interests to the petitioner. It seems, therefore, to me, to be unnecessary to enter upon the point as to the transfers under which the petitioner claims being transfers of droits litigieux.\nA point was urged to the effect that the deed executed by Leamy and wife, purporting to convey the land in question, was imperfect, by reason of its not having been executed under the hand and seal of the Commissioner of Public Works, as well as by Leamy and his wife, and that by reason of such imperfection the deed was not such a one as could have been confirmed under the Act. I do not understand this objection to be rested upon any provision of the Civil Code applicable equally to all cases of deeds of sale of lands, but that the objection is relied upon as applicable only to the cases of deeds of sale under the Act 9th Vic., ch. 37, and that it is wholly founded upon the 17th section of that Act, which enacts:\nThat the Chief Commissioner for the time being shall be the legal organ of the Commissioners, and all writings and documents signed by him and countersigned by the Secretary, and sealed with the seal of the Chief Commissioner, and no others, shall be held to be the acts of the Commissioners.\nThe observations I have already made, as to an objection taken in respect of any irregularity in the proceedings to obtain confirmation occuring subsequently to the withdrawal by the opposants of their oppositions filed, would apply equally to this objection, if there were anything in it.\nAfter notice given upon behalf of Her Majesty that she claims under the deed as a deed accepted by her under the Act, and after the purchase money agreed upon by the Commissioners had been paid into Court for the benefit of all having any claims to any part of the land, and after the opposants had come in and filed their oppositions in answer to a notice calling upon them to file their oppositions for claims upon the compensation so paid into Court, neither the opposants themselves, nor any person claiming under them, can, as it appears to me, be heard to say that the deed is defective for want of execution by the Chief Commissioner. The 17th section, however, has no reference to the case of a deed conveying lands to Her Majesty. The 8th and 9 th sections relate to such deeds, and these sections declare that the lands purchased or acquired by the Commissioners shall be vested in Her Majesty, and that the conveyances may be accepted by the Commissioners upon behalf of the Crown, but this acceptance may be signified as it might be by any other purchaser, viz.: by payment of purchase money, the manual acceptance of the instrument and entry under it upon the lands. No better signification of the acceptance of the conveyance could be given than the lodging a copy of it together with the purchase money in Court, as the Act directs, for the purpose of obtaining confirmation of it, and the entry upon and continuous possession of the land under the conveyance.\nThe 17th section relates to those executory contracts which, to be binding upon the Crown, must be executed as directed in that section, and has no reference to a deed transferring title to Her Majesty. A deed executed by persons having authority to agree with the Commissioners upon the price to be paid for the whole fee, as provided in the Act, vests the whole estate in the Crown, barring forever the claims of all persons whomsoever upon the land, whether such deed should be signed by the Chief Commissioner or not, and converts their claims into claims for the compensation.\nUpon the whole, I am of opinion, that the title of the Crown to the lands in question is unimpeachable; in my opinion, the intention of the parties to the partition of Philemon Wright the younger's estate appears to have been that Sarah Olmstead should enjoy in fee the 88 acres of land with the 71 acres of pond in satisfaction of her claim for dower, and she entered upon the land and exercised acts of ownership upon it upon the faith of such being the intention, and although legal effect may not have been given to that intention by a deed properly executed by the parties interested and competent to give a valid title, or, if executed, may have been lost, still, when she conveyed to the Crown the lands comprised in the deed of 1849, she was in possession as proprietor, claiming to be entitled as such, as I think we must reasonably infer, in virtue of a family arrangement, which she then in good faith believed to be acknowledged and regarded as good by all parties interested; and if the Commissioner of Public Works in good faith contracted with her, believing her to be in possession as proprietor, and agreed with her in good faith as to the price to be paid for the land, and in pursuance of such agreement took a conveyance from her and entered upon the land under such conveyance, and applied it to the public purpose for which it was acquired, the claims of all persons, if any others should prove to be entitled to the land, would, in my opinion, be converted under the provisions of the statute from claims to the land into claims to the compensation so agreed upon.\nBut, assuming confirmation of that deed to have been a step necessary to make the title of the Crown to the land perfect under the statute (a step which does not appear to have been taken with reference to this deed), still the possession acquired by the Crown under that deed, executed and accepted in good faith and in the belief that it conveyed a good title, would make a basis for prescription to operate upon; and there is not a particle of evidence warranting the slightest imputation of bad faith to the parties acting for the Crown in taking title under that deed. Her Majesty's title, therefore, to the land coveyed by the deed of 1849 cannot, after twenty-seven years undisputed, uninterrupted possession under that title, be called in question.\nIt was contended that until the Code Her Majesty could not acquire title by prescription, but the article 2211 which declares that the Crown may avail itself of prescription is given as old law, and whatever may in truth have been the law of France upon that subject, we are concluded by the above article, which we must construe as declaring what was the law in Lower Canada before the adoption of the Civil Code, and this article must be read as declaring the right of the Crown by prescription to have accrued in the like cases and under the like circumstances as title by prescription would have accrued to the subject, that is to say, as appears by the 1st vol. of the Commissioners' Report upon prescription[50], by prescription during ten years against a proprietor present, and twenty years against an absentee.\nThe article 2251, which makes new law, providing for the future only, cannot alter or abridge in any respect the effect of the declaratory article 2211 as to what was the old law. Under article 2251, for prescriptions begun since the Code, ten years will be sufficient against absentees, where formerly twenty years would have been required, but the old law prevails (unaffected by this or any provision in the Code pointing to the future) where the prescription began to run before the Code. This is specially provided by article 2270. It is clear, therefore, that prescription in favor of the Crown could begin before the Code, and could mature into a perfect title, where, in like circumstances, it would have done so in favor of a subject.\nAs to the residue of the land comprised in the deed of the 7th May, 1855, I have already expressed my opinion to be that, for the reasons already given by me, the title of the Crown is perfect under the provisions of the statute, but Her Majesty's title to this portion also is good by prescription. It is apparent, from the whole evidence, as it strikes my mind, taken even in connection with those notices of claim given in 1853, and in April, 1855, which the petitioner's counsel so much relied upon for the purpose of establishing bad faith, that the persons acting as advisers of the Commissioners were particular in taking care that there should exist no just ground for imputing to them any want of the most perfect good faith in the taking the title which should be accepted. It appears that an experienced counsel was employed to secure a good title, and he seems to have resolved to take title only under the provisions of the statute. Under his advice, a deed was taken from a party in possession of the land claiming to be absolute proprietor, but undoubtedly interested therein to a large amount, if not to the extent of the whole estate. Having taken what I can see no reason to doubt counsel believed to be a good deed under the statute, he must have communicated to the Commissioners of Public Works, the proper officers representing the Crown, the facts of the execution of the deed, and of its having been taken under the statute, for we find that upon the 23rd of June, 1855, the Commissioners caused to be deposited the purchase-money, \u00a31,404 16s. 2d., together with the deed of the 7th May, 1855, in the proper Court in that behalf, under the, provisions of the statute. Now, from this date, at least, we must hold that the Commissioners of Public Works, representing the Crown, had notice from their counsel that the deed of the 7th May was perfected, and that it was taken under the statute. This, then, is the period at which the test is to be applied to determine whether the Commissioners had any reason to doubt the goodness of the title which they accepted by thus paying the purchase-money into Court, to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of this statute in that behalf. The petitioner's counsel relied upon a passage in Pothier[51].\nLa bonne foi requise pour la prescription, \u00e9tant la juste opinion que la possesseur a, que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la chose qu'il poss\u00e8de lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquise, c'est une cons\u00e9quence que lorsque mon procureur a acquis pour moi un h\u00e9ritage avant que j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de l'acquisition, je ne puis n\u00e9anmoins commencer le temps pour la prescription jusqu'\u00e0 ce que j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de l'acquisition; car se ne puis avoir l'opinion que je suis propri\u00e9taire d'un h\u00e9ritage avant que de savoir qu'on en a fait pour moi l'acquisition.\nAnd they asked: Is there anything, then, to establish that Her Majesty has since the execution of the deed become cognizant of it?\nIf by this question is meant whether there is any evidence that Her Majesty has personally become cognizant of the deed, I answer, no. Nor, in my opinion, is it necessary that there should be. If the law required that Her Majesty should personally be made cognizant of the execution of a deed so procured to be executed, vesting land in her, so likewise to establish the want of that juste titre, whereon to base prescription, it would be necessary to show that Her Majesty personally did not entertain that firm and undoubted belief that she ha become proprietor, which alone, as was so strongly urged by the petitioner's counsel, constitutes bonne foi, and as Her Majesty, as we know, personally knows nothing whatever about these transactions, the effect would be that the Crown could never stand for title upon prescription by ten years undisputed possession under a juste titre. But under this Act the Commissioners for Public Works must be held to represent Her Majesty. They are the persons who are authorized to contract for, purchase and acquire the lands, which, when so purchased and acquired, the Act declares, shall be vested in Her Majesty, and to put a rational construction upon the Act we must hold that the knowledge acquired by the Commissioners of the fact of the execution of the deed (of which fact we must conclude they were informed, when, upon the 23rd of June, 1855, in acceptance of the title so acquired, they paid the consideration-money into Court to be dealt with under the statute), is sufficient, within the meaning of the passage extracted from Pothier, to base prescription upon, and as there does not appear to me to be a tittle of evidence to cast a doubt upon the bonne foi of the Commissioners at that time, construing bonne foi as the petitioner's counsel contend it should be construed, namely, the entertaining a \"firm and undoubted belief\" in the goodness of the title so acquired, prescription by ten years possession under this title would make the title of the crown good, if there was no other forest upon. It appears to be rather inconsistent for the petitioner's counsel to contend that this knowledge of the Commissioners as to the execution of the deed which led to the payment of the consideration money into Court under the provisions of the statute could not be relied upon as a base of prescription from that date, when they insisted so strongly upon the knowledge acquired by the Commissioners by notice to them in 1853, and in April, 1855 for the purpose of establishing the absence of good faith in May, 1855. But it is said that ten year's prescription is insufficient, by reason of the absence, as is alleged, of Serina and Sally Wright and of the children of Hull Wright.\nIn answer to this objection, it is to be observed: 1st. That there is no replication in answer to the plea asserting title in the Crown by ten years' prescription, which asserts the absence of any of the parties to be affected by such prescription; the only answer to that plea is one denying it, and according to every principle of pleading prevailing under every system of jurisprudence, if there be no pleading raising an issue upon the subject, evidence of the absence of any of the parties which would be affected by prescription is inadmissible. But 2nd. As to Hull Wright, the evidence shows that he was not absent, for he was present when he entered his claim under the statute upon the proceedings being taken in Court for confirmation of the deed, and he continued to be present until his death, in April, 1857, and there was no interruption of the prescription so begun during the currency of the ten years upon behalf of any one claiming through or under him. So also as to Serina; she was also present when she entered her claim in Court upon the proceedings taken for confirmation of the deed, nor is there any evidence of her having been absent at any time until after the expiration of the ten years from the opening of the prescription in 1855, and as to Sally Wright, there is no evidence of her having been absent when the ten years' prescription began to run in 1855, nor of any interruption of such prescription upon her part. But 3rd. The absence of Sally Wright, if established, is, in my judgment, immaterial, for the reason, that in my opinion, it sufficiently appears that she executed the quit claim deed of February, 1853, and, moreover, twenty years had elapsed before the institution of proceedings by the petition of right in this case, so that upon the whole, as it appears to me, the title of the Crown to all the land in litigation is unimpeachable and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\n[1] 11 I.

That the legislation in question, prescribing conditions incidental to insurance contracts passed in Ontario relating to property situate in Ontario, was not a regulation of Trade and Commerce within the meaning of these words in sub-sec. 2, sec. 91, B.N.A. Act.\n3. That an insurer in Ontario, who has not complied with the law in question and has not printed on his policy or contract of insurance the statutory conditions in the manner indicated in the statute, cannot set up against the insured his own conditions or the statutory conditions, the insured alone, in such a case, is entitled to avail himself of any statutory condition.\n[Taschereau and Gwynne, J.J., dissenting]\nPer Taschereau and Gwynne, J.J.:\u2014That the power to legislate upon the subject-matter of insurance is vested exclusively in the Dominion parliament by virtue of its power to pass laws for the regulation of Trade and Commerce under the 91st sec. of the B.N.A. Act\nAPPEALS from judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which maintained three actions brought by the respondents upon policies of insurance against the appellants.\nIn the case of Parsons v. The Citizens\u2019 Insurance Company, the action was brought upon a policy of insurance, dated the 4th of May, 1877, issued by the defendants, who are a corporation incorporated by Act of the Dominion of Canada, insuring a building of the plaintiff in the town of Orangeville, Ontario, in the sum of $2,500. The building was destroyed by fire on the 3rd of August, 1877. The action was tried by Patterson, J.A., with a jury at the Guelph Assizes in the spring of 1878. The jury answered certain questions put to them by the judge (not material to the appeal), who thereupon entered a verdict for the plaintiff for $2,575. It Was proved that at the time of the issuing of the policy by the defendants, the plaintiff had another policy for $1,000 on the building in the Western Assurance Company, which was not disclosed to the defendants. This it was submitted was a clear breach of the Company\u2019s conditions printed on the policy, and also of the eighth condition of the \u201cFire Insurance Policy Act,\u201d Revised Statutes of Ontario, ch. 162. The company\u2019s conditions were printed on the policy, but not in coloured ink as directed by that Act, nor were the statutory conditions printed on the policy. The judge reserved all questions of law for the court in banc. A rule was taken out to enter a non-suit pursuant to leave reserved or for a new trial, which was afterwards discharged. The defendants then appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The defendants were incorporated by the late province of Canada, 19 and 20 Vic., ch. 124, (1856), and by 27 and 28 Vic., ch. 98 (1864) their powers were enlarged, and by Dominion statute 39 Vic., ch. 55 (1876), these Acts were amended and their name changed to its present name.\nThe policy of insurance on plaintiffs building, occupied as a general hardware store, was issued to the plaintiff after the passing of the provincial Act of Ontario, 39 Vic., ch. 24, and did not contain the conditions made necessary by that statute. The Court of Queen\u2019s Bench held in accordance with a previous decision of that court, in Ulrich v. The National Insurance Company[1], \u201cthat insurance companies incorporated by the Dominion of Canada are, as regards insurance effected by them in the province of Ontario, bound by the provincial statute, subject to all the consequences of non-compliance with its provisions;\u201d and also in accordance with another previous decision of that court, in Frey v. The Mutual Fire Insurance Co. of the County of Wellington[2]: \u201cThat a policy of insurance issued after the passing of the Act, but not in compliance with its provisions, is to be deemed as against the assurer as a policy without conditions.\u201d From this decision, the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe reasons of appeal were to the following effect:\n1. That the Policy sued upon is not to be deemed, as against the assured or otherwise, to be a policy without any conditions; that it was clearly not the intention of either party, plaintiff or defendants, to enter into an absolute unconditional contract of Insurance; that the said policy must be treated either as subject to the conditions therein endorsed, or as subject to the statutory conditions, in which case defendants were entitled to succeed upon the issue joined upon the pleas alleging that respondent had effected other or prior insurances on the same property, without having notified the company of such insurance, and having had the same endorsed on the policy, or otherwise acknowledged by the company. The defendants refer to Ulrich v. The National Insurance Company[3]; Frey v. The Mutual Fire Insurance Company of the County of Wellington[4].\n2. That the Revised Statutes of Ontario, ch. 162, \u201cAn Act to secure uniform conditions in Policies of Fire insurance,\u201d is ultra vires of the legislative assembly of the province of Ontario, so far as regards the defendants, a company incorporated by the parliament of the Dominion of Canada, and that it is inoperative therefore to affect the said policy or the conditions thereon endorsed.\nThe principal reasons against the appeal were:\n\u201c1. The plaintiff contends that the defendants, having wholly omitted the statutory conditions from their said policy, and having adopted a variation thereof, or a new condition instead thereof, without complying with the requirement of the Fire Insurance Policy Act, cannot set up the statutory conditions which they have not printed in their policy, or the variations or new conditions not in accordance with the Act. The condition relied upon is therefore not legal or binding on the plaintiff.\n\u201c2. The plaintiff submits that the Revised Statute of Ontario, ch. 162, is not ultra vires of the legislature of the province of Ontario as regards the defendants.\u201d\nThe Court of Appeal held the plaintiff\u2019s contention well founded and dismissed the appeal with costs. Spragge, C., in delivering judgment said: \u201cI incline to agree, contrary, I confess, to my first impression, that the policy in this case must be regarded as a policy without any express condition.\u201d\nIn Parsons v. The Queen Insurance Company:\nThis action was brought upon an interim receipt alleged to have been issued by an agent of the defendants, on the 3rd August, 1877, insuring against loss by fire to the extent of $2,000, a general stock of hardware paints, oils, varnishes, window glass, stoves, tinware, castings, hollow ware, plated and fancy goods, lamps, lamp glasses, and general house furnishing goods. The interim receipt was as follows:\u2014\n\u201cFire Department. Interim Protection Note.\nQUEEN FIRE AND LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY,\nChief Office, Canada Head Office,\nQueen Insurance 191 St. James St., Montreal.\nBuildings, Liverpool, The Queen Insurance Co.,\nNo. 33. Orangeville Agency, 3rd Aug., 1877.\n\u201cMr. William Parsons, having this day proposed to effect on insurance against fire, subject to all the usual terms and conditions of this Company, for $2,000, on the following property, in the town of Orangeville, for twelve months, namely: on general stock of hardware, paints, oils, varnishes, window glass, stoves, tinware, castings, hollow-ware, plated fancy goods, lamps, lamp glasses and general house-furnishing goods, and having also paid the sum of forty dollars as the premium on the same, it is hereby held assured under these conditions until the policy is delivered, or notice given that the proposal is declined by the Company, when this interim note will be thereby cancelled and of no effect.\n\u201c(Signed), A.M. KIRKLAND,\n\u201cAgent to the Company.\n\u201cN.B.\u2014The deposit will be returned, less the pro- portion for the period, on application to the agent signing this note, in the event of the proposal being declined by the company. If accepted, a policy will be prepared and delivered within thirty days. If a holder does not receive a policy during the specified time he should apply to the head office in Montreal.\u201d\nThe case was tried at the Spring Assizes, 1878, at Guelphy before Macdonald, Judge of the County Court of the County of Wellington, sitting at the request of Mr. Justice Patterson.\nThe only question submitted by His Honor to the jury was whether there were more than 25 lbs. of gunpowder on the premises containing the property assured at the time of the fire.\nThe jury found in favour of the plaintiff; and a verdict was thereupon entered for $2,070, the learned Judge holding the defendants\u2019 conditions not to be part of the contract.\nIn Easter term, 41 Victoria, a rule nisi was granted by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, calling upon the plaintiff to shew cause why the verdict should not be set aside, and anew trial granted, for mis-direction of the learned judge, there being further insurances on the property insured; a greater quantity of gunpowder was contained in the premises containing the insured goods than permitted by, and contrary to, the terms of the defendants\u2019 contract with the plaintiff; and the proof of loss required by the contract was not filed in due time, and which said mis-direction, was in telling the jury there was no question for them except the quantity of gunpowder on the premises.\nThe Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, not being able to discover any ground either upon the law or evidence for setting aside the verdict, discharged the rule. Defendants appealed from this judgment to the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe reasons of appeal raising the points in this case different from those in Parsons v. The Citizens\u2019 Insurance Company were:\n\u201c4. The Ontario Revised Statute, ch. 162, does not apply to this contract, because this action is brought upon an interim receipt, and no policy of insurance had been entered into or was in force between the appellants and the respondent. The conditions to be taken as part of the contract are the appellants\u2019 ordinary conditions; and it being admitted by the respondent that he had more than 10 pounds of gunpowder on the premises containing the subject insured, at the time of the fire, the appellants are entitled to succeed on the 8th plea, and a verdict should have been entered in their favor thereon.\n\u201c5. The Ontario Act cannot affect the contract of an English Company doing business under an Imperial Charter, as is the case of the present appellants[5].\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, with costs.\nIn the case of Johnston v. The Western Assurance Company, the action was also brought upon a policy of insurance against fire. The only point raised on this appeal different from those raised in Parsons v. The Citizens\u2019 Insurance Company was that the Act 39 Vic., ch. 24, Ont., was ultra vires, because it was not within the power of the provincial legislature to legislate regarding\u2019 an Insurance Company incorporated before Confederation by a charter granted to it by the parliament of the old province of Canada, and since amended by the Dominion parliament.\nIn the case of Parsons v. The Citizens\u2019 Insurance Company, Mr. Robinson, Q.C., and Mr. Bethune were heard for appellants, and Mr. Dalton McCarthy, Q.C., for respondent.\nIn the case of Parsons v. The Queen Insurance Company, Mr. Robinson, Q.C., (and Mr. J.T. Small with him) appeared on behalf of the appellants, and Mr. Dalton McCarthy, Q.C., on behalf of the respondent.\nIn the case of Johnston v. The Western Assurance Co., Mr. Bethune was heard for appellants, Mr. Mowat, Q.C., Attorney General of Ontario, was heard on the question of the jurisdiction of the provincial legislature, and Mr. Dalton McCarthy, Q.C., for respondent.\nThe arguments of Counsel and the authorities relied upon were as follows:\u2014\nFor appellants:\nThe Ontario legislature had no power to deal with the general law of insurance; the power to pass such enactments was within the legislative authority of the Dominion parliament, under sec. 91, sub-sec. 3, B.N.A. Act, \u201cThe regulation of trade and commerce.\u201d\nInsurance is a trade or business which may be and is in some of its branches carried on by individuals, and such persons are deemed to be traders in consequence of their following such trade or business. The hundreds of millions of insurances now effected, the usage of insurance which obtains, and the importance, or rather necessity of insurance to the conduct of other branches of trade, business and commerce, (in which insurance is now treated as part of the cost of merchandise, besides being a means of credit) all bring it within the definition of trade or commerce; and it has been so declared and recognized by the parliament of Canada, in the numerous private acts authorizing companies to carry on the trade or business, in the public acts controlling the business and providing for its being conducted under license, and in the Insolvent Act of 1875, which provides that it shall apply amongst others to * * * trading companies * * * \u201cexcept incorporated insurance companies,\u201d and in the Act of 1878, applying to insurance companies the provisions of the Insolvent Act.\nThe British North America Act expressly reserves for the Dominion exclusively certain matters, and all matters, in fact, not especially named and assigned by section 92 to the province: L\u2019Union St. Jacques v. Belisle[6]; Dow v. Clarke[7]; Attorney General v. Queen\u2019s Insurance Company[8]; Hansard[9].\nThe Dominion, powers are exclusive, from their nature, without any express prohibition of the exercise of the same powers by the provincial legislatures.\nThe words \u201cproperty and civil rights\u201d used in the ninety-second section British North America Act when granting their respective powers to the provincial legislatures, are evidently used in that Act with a much more restricted meaning than in the provincial Act 32 Geo. III., Con. Stat. U.C., ch, 9; for the British North America Act divides into numerous sub-divisions the powers, which were held to pass under these, words in the Act of 32 & Geo. III. See Anderson v. Todd[10],\nUpon the view taken in the court below of the powers of the legislature, of Ontario, it would be competent for that legislature to enact regulations, in effect, prohibitory of their business, as lawfully authorized by the Canadian parliament, a consideration fatal to that view.\nThe decision in Paul v. Virginia[11], so much relied on by the Court of Appeal, is not an authority here, and the appellants submit that the reasoning is not applicable to this case. The relative positions of the parliament of the Dominion of Canada and the legislatures of the various provinces are so entirely different from those of Congress and the legislature of the several States that no analogy can safely be drawn from a decision of the United States courts. The powers vested in Congress to \u201cregulate commerce with foreign and among the several States\u201d is a very different thing from the general powers to legislate with respect to \u201ctrade and commerce,\u201d which words are used without limitation or restriction in the British North America Act, thus giving to the parliament of the Dominion exclusive jurisdiction over all matters of trade and commerce, domestic as well as foreign, not only among the provinces, but in them. The difference alluded to is plainly shewn by the language of the Supreme Court, at p. 183: \u201cSuch contracts are not interstate transactions, though the parties may be domiciled in different states.\u201d * * * \u201cThey do not constitute a part of the commerce between States any more than a contract for the purchase and sale of goods in Virginia by a citizen in New York, whilst in Virginia, would constitute a portion of such commerce\u201d See also Severn v. The Queen[12].\nThe counsel for appellants in the case of Parsons v. The Queen Insurance Company contended further, that the Ontario statute was ultra vires of the legislature with respect to an English Company doing business under an Imperial charter, as is the case of the present appellants. Imp. Stat. 7 & 8 Vic., ch. 110 (Chitty\u2019s Stat. vol. I, 649), and \u201cThe Company\u2019s Act,\u201d 1862 (Chitty\u2019s Stat. vol. I, 725.) The British North America Act was not intended to abrogate or diminish the powers already granted to English corporations doing business in Canada, under Imperial Acts. Smiles v. Belford[13]; Rutledge v. Low[14]. That the statute did not apply to a case in which a policy had not been actually delivered. The directions contained therein, with respect to printing, show that it never was intended to apply to the contract entered into by an interim receipt, such as is known to the public and insurers. The ordinary statutory conditions printed on such a document would be practically illegible from the smallness of the type necessarily employed. And, moreover, the language of the statute is explicit, the word \u201cpolicy\u201d alone being employed. As regards the temporary insurance by means of an interim receipt, the parties are at liberty to make such conditions as they may choose. McQueen v. Ph\u0153nix Mutual Insurance Company[15].\nIn any event the appellants are entitled to the benefit of the conditions against further insurance, whether their own conditions or the statutory makes no difference, as both are practically the same, Geraldi v. The Provincial Insurance Company[16].\nIn the case of Parsons v. The Citizens\u2019 Insurance Company of Canada, the counsel relied also on the fact that appellants company were incorporated by the late province of Canada and authorized to make contracts of insurance throughout the late province of Canada, and also on the fact that the respondent had effected a further insurance, which was contrary to the statutory conditions as well as to the appellants\u2019 ordinary conditions.\nIn the case of Johnston v. The Western Assurance. Company, it was also contended that the appellants, having been incorporated by the parliament of the old province of Canada, and their charter having since been varied and amended by the Dominion parliament\u2014the Company in fact being a creature of the parliament of Canada\u2014the legislature of the province of Ontario cannot curtail or limit or put any restriction on the power of the. Company to do business in any province of Canada. It never was intended, under the British North America Act, that the provincial legislature should alter, vary or restrict corporate powers already possessed by companies doing business at the time of the passing of the Act.\nFor respondents:\nThe first question involves the constitutionality of the Act of Ontario, 39 Vic., ch. 24, respecting uniform conditions on policies of Insurance. This Act is constitutional and within the powers of the Ontario legislature: B.N.A. Act, sections 91, and 92, sub-secs. 11, 13 and 16; Billington v. Provincial Insurance Company[17]; Dear v. The Western Insurance Company[18]; Ulrich v. The National Insurance Company[19]; Parsons v. Citizens\u2019 Insurance Company[20]; Frey v. The Mutual Fire Insurance Company of the County of Wellington[21]; Parsons v. The Queen\u2019s Insurance Company[22].\nThe making of a policy of Insurance is not a transaction of commerce within sec. 91 (sub\u2011sec. 2) of the B:N.A. Act, but is a contract of indemnity. Paul v. Virginia[23]; Nathan v. Louisiana[24]. The matter in question here comes within sub-secs. 11, 13 and 16, or one of them, of sec. 92 B.N.A. Act. Sub-sec. 2 of sec. 91, giving power to the parliament of Canada to regulate trade and commerce, refers to general legislation applicable to the Dominion, and does not withdraw from the provinces the right to legislate respecting private property and contracts within the province.\nContracts of insurance are matters relating to property and civil rights within sec. 92 (sub-sec. 13), B.N.A. Act, and are matters of a merely local or private nature in the province within sub-sec. 16, sec. 92.\nThese contracts are peculiarly local in their nature, inasmuch as they relate exclusively to the protection and security of property within the province. They are as clearly within the power of the local legislature as the many other classes of contracts admittedly within such power, and in respect of which the legislature of Ontario has always legislated without question as to its power to do so; such as the forms and solemnities of the instruments of title and conveyance of property; statutes requiring certain promises to be in writing; statutes of limitations by which titles and contracts are extinguished; statutes relating to married women and their dealings with such property; these and all other statutes of a similar character, are binding upon all persons and corporations, both foreign and domestic, contracting in Ontario.\nSo far as relates to the interpretation of the B.N.A. Act, that Act must be interpreted in the light of the established principles of public law. By that law, as held both in England and America, contracts are local matters; as to their nature, validity and obligation, they are governed by the law of the place where made and where they are to be executed. They are treated as matters of domestic legislation. See Story on Con. of U.S.[25]; 2 Kent\u2019s Com.[26]; Robinson and Bland[27]; Wlieaton Int. Law[28]; Wesllake Private Int. Law[29]\nThe appellants are a private corporation. It is merely a company of private persona with corporate powers; the business is carried on solely for the private benefit and profit of the individuals composing it; it has no connection with government; it is not an instrument of Government created for its own purposes, such as national banks in the U.S.\nThere is no analogy here to the case of a province taking national property, or salaries paid by government, or other acts, the effect of which might impede or hamper the operations of Government. See Story on Con. of U.S.[30]\nThere is no express provision in any of the statutes relating to the appellants company exempting them from the jurisdiction of Ontario to regulate insurance contracts and prescribe their forms and conditions, and such exemption cannot be implied: Pomeroy Con. Law 380; and the above principle applies even in the U.S., the constitution of which contains a provision that \u201cno State shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts,\u201d to which no similar enactment is found in the B.N.A. Act. The provincial legislatures are not in any accurate sense subordinate to the parliament of Canada: Each body is independent and supreme within the limits of its own jurisdiction: so that even if contracts are considered a kind of commerce, they are still governed by sec. 92, the powers in which should be read as exceptions to those conferred upon parliament by sec. 91, B.N.A. Act. Severn v. The Queen[31]; Re Slavin and Orillia[32]; Reg. v. Boardman[33]; Reg. v. Longee[34]; L\u2019Union St. Jacques de Montreal v. Belisle[35].\nIf the local legislature has jurisdiction respecting the subject-matter of insurance contracts at all, it has the most full and ample jurisdiction\u2014plenum imperium\u2014it has sovereign power within its own limits. This principle requires that the legislature of a province has power to prescribe or limit the conditions of insurance contracts made within the province, respecting property situate within its limits, whether such contracts are made by citizens of the province or provincial corporations, or by foreigners or foreign corporations. The provincial legislature has power to incorporate insurance companies; these are bound by local laws, but the argument of the appellants would enable the foreign corporation to claim immunity from provincial laws while enjoying the protection of these laws; to be \u201ca law unto itself,\u201d while reaping the benefit of local business; thus, giving it a position more favourable than its local rival: a most curious and startling anomaly, and, it is submitted, contrary to all principle and authority.\nThe fact that certain powers have been assumed by parliament hitherto prove little, for the provinces have not power to disallow these Acts, and can only look to the courts for defence against the encroachments of the Federal power, whereas Acts passed by the local legislatures might be disallowed by the Dominion parliament. As to the contention of the appellants that the Ontario Act in question does not extend to them, there is nothing in the Act shewing or implying that the appellants are exempt from its provisions; and the authorities quoted above, and the reasons already given, shew that the Act extends to all policies of insurance made within the province, respecting property within the province.\nNext, as to the construction of the statute in question\u201439 Vic., ch. 24, Ont. The object of the Act was to protect the insured, not to benefit the insurer. The stand point of the legislature was this: the ends of justice were often defeated, and the insured defrauded by the multitude of conditions, many of them obscure and unfair. The intention was to confine the insurers to fair and reasonable conditions by placing them under legislative or judicial control; and this object was to be attained as follows: As to certain specified conditions the legislature decided a priori that they are fair and reasonable and authorize the insurer to use them if he choses, these are called the statutory conditions, and he is directed to print them on the policy; further or different conditions may be used, provided they are printed in the manner directed, and provided they are fair and reasonable in the opinion of the proper tribunal upon the trial of any case. So far the object is to limit the insurer to fair conditions, but not to ordain that these conditions are to be part of every insurance contract. But still further in pursuance of the object of the Act to protect the insured, who, in many cases, would know nothing of the statute, the insurer is required to print the conditions on the policy if he desires the benefit of them, and to prevent him benefiting by his own omission it is ordained that, as to him, these conditions shall apply, whether printed or not. Notwithstanding the words of section 1 as to printing the conditions, the appellants contend that they may print them on the policy or omit them at their option, and that the effect is the same in either case: it is submitted such a construction is untenable, and that the true construction is that the conditions are not binding on the insured unless printed in compliance with the Act.\nAs to the construction of sec. 2: The legislature is there dealing with variations, it there assumes that the statutory conditions are printed as directed, because otherwise there could be no variation; then the statutory conditions being on the policy, and the variations not being made in the manner directed, it is provided that, as against the insurer, the variations are void and the policy subject to the statutory conditions only. By the above construction of the Act, both sections are made to harmonize and to effectuate the legislative intent, and this construction has been adopted by the various courts in Ontario. Ulrich v. The National Insurance Company[36]; Dear v. The Western[37]; Parsons v. The Citizens Insurance Company[38]; Parsons v. The Queen\u2019s Insurance Company[39]; Frey v. The Wellington Mutual[40].\nThe question as to the constitutionality of the Ontario statute 39 Vic., ch. 24, having been raised in each case, the following judgments were delivered applicable to the three appeals.\nRitchie, C.J.:\nThere never, probably, was an Act, the validity of which was questioned, that came before a Court so strongly supported by judicial and legislative authority as this Act. It was legislation suggested as necessary by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Ontario, in the case of Smith v. Commercial Union Insurance Co.[41]\nThe legislature of Ontario, adopting the suggestion, passed, 38 Vic., ch. 65, authorizing the issue of a commission to three or more persons holding judicial office in the province, and by section 2, enacted in these words, that:\nA commission is to be issued by the Lieutenant-Governor, addressed to three or more persons holding judicial office in this province, for the purpose of determining what conditions of a fire insurance policy are just and reasonable conditions, and the commissioners may take evidence, and are to hear such parties interested as they shall think necessary; and a copy of the conditions settled, approved of and signed by the Commissioners, or a majority of them, shall be\nPresent: Ritchie, C.J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, J.J. deposited in the office of the Provincial Secretary; and in case, after the Lieutenant\u2011Governor, by proclamation published in the Ontario Gazette, assent to the said conditions, any policy is entered into or renewed, containing or including any conditions other than or different from the conditions so previously approved of and deposited; and if the said conditions, so not contained or included, is held by the Court or Judge before whom a question relating thereto is tried, not to be just and reasonable, such conditions shall be null and void.\nThis Act was not disallowed, and a commission by the Government of Ontario was duly issued in accordance therewith to learned judges, who reported what they deemed just and reasonable conditions, whereupon the Ontario legislature passed the 39 Vic., ch. 24: \u201cAn Act to secure uniform conditions in Policies of Fire Insurance,\u201d which is the Act now questioned, and which, after reciting that under the provisions of the Act, 38 Vic., ch. 65., the Lieutenant\u2011Governor issued a commission to consider and report what conditions are just and reasonable conditions to be inserted in fire insurance policies, on real or personal property in this province (Ontario), and, after reciting that a majority of the Commission had settled and approved of the conditions set forth in the schedule of the Act, and that it was advisable that the same should be expressly adopted by the legislature as the statutory conditions to be contained in the policies of fire insurance entered into, or in force in this province, the first sections enact:\u2014\nThe conditions set forth in the schedule to this Act shall, as against the insurers, be deemed to be part of every policy of fire insurance hereinafter entered into or renewed, or otherwise in force in Ontario, with respect to any property therein, and shall be printed on every policy with the heading \u201cStatutory Conditions;\u201d and if a company (or other insurer) desire to vary the said conditions, or to omit any of them, or to add new conditions, there shall be added, in conspicuous type, and in ink of different color, words to the following effect: \u201cVariations in conditions.\u201d\nThis policy is issued on the above statutory conditions, with the following variations and conditions:\u2014These variations (or as the case may be) are, by virtue of the Ontario statute in that behalf, in force so far as, by the Court or Judge before whom a question is tried relating thereto, they shall be held to be just and reasonable to be exacted by the Company.\n2. Unless the same is distinctly indicated and set forth in the manner or to the effect aforesaid, no such variation, addition or omission shall be legal and binding on the insured, and no question shall be considered as to whether any such variation, addition or omission is, under the circumstances, just and reasonable, and, on the contrary, the policy shall, as against the insurers, be subject to the statutory conditions only, unless variations, additions or omissions, are distinctly indicated and set forth in the manner or to the effect aforesaid.\nThis Act was never disallowed, but has since its passage been acted on; and the Ontario reports show that questions as to its construction have been before the Courts of Ontario, without its validity having been impugned by either Bench or Bar, and, when the point was raised, its validity was affirmed by the unanimous opinion of the Court, to whom the question was first submitted; it was so held and acquiesced in in two cases unappealed from, and, when again raised in the present cases, the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench unanimously reaffirmed its former decision, and, on appeal, the Appeal Court of Ontario unanimously affirmed that decision. But this is not all; we have the Dominion parliament recognizing, by expressed statutory terms, the right of the local legislature to incorporate insurance companies and deal with insurance matter.\nSo far back as the 31 Vic., ch. 48 (1868), when the intention of the parliament of Great Britain, in enacting the British North America Act, must have been fresh in the minds of the leading men who first sat in the Dominion parliament, and who had taken the most prominent part in discussing and agreeing on the terms of Confederation and the provisions of the British North America Act, and who, we historically know, watched its passage through the parliament of Great Britain, we find the Dominion parliament in that year (1868) passing \u201cAn Act respecting Insurance Companies,\u201d and in that Act, by section 4, thus clearly affirming the right of the local legislature to incorporate insurance companies, after fixing the amount to be deposited by Life, Fire, Inland Marine, Guarantee or Accident Insurance Companies, certain companies are excepted in these words:\u2014\nExcept only in the case of companies incorporated before the passing of this Act by Act of the parliament of Canada, or of the legislature of any of the late provinces of Canada, or Lower Canada or Upper Canada, or of Nova Scotia or New Brunswick, or which may have been or may hereafter be incorporated by the parliament of Canada, or by the legislature of any province of the Dominion, and carrying on the business of Life or Fire Insurance.\nAnd, as if to place this beyond all doubt, and to show that companies, which might be so incorporated by the local legislature, were local incorporations and its business should be confined within the province incorporating them, we find it enacted in section 25:\u2014\nThat the provisions of this Act as to deposit and issue of license shall not apply to any insurance company incorporated by any Act of the legislature of the late province of Canada, or incorporated, or to be incorporated, under any Act of any one of the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, or New Brunswick, so long as it shall not carry on business in the Dominion beyond the limits of that province by the legislature or government of which it was incorporated, but it shall be lawful for any such company to avail itself of the provisions of this Act.\nCould words or provisions in recognition and affirmance of the powers of the local legislatures be stronger? And in 38 Vic., ch. 20 (1875), \u201cAn Act to amend and consolidate the several Acts respecting insurance, in so far as regards Fire and Inland Marine business,\u201d we find, by section 2, a distinct recognition of companies incorporated under any Act of the legislature of any province of the Dominion of Canada:\nSection 2.\u2014This Act shall apply only to companies heretofore incorporated by any Act of the legislature of the late province of Canada, or by any Act of the legislature of any of the provinces of Canada, and which, upon the day of the passing of this Act, were also licensed, under Act of the parliament of Canada, to transact business of insurance in Canada, and also to any Company heretofore or which may hereafter be incorporated by Act of parliament of Canada, and to any foreign insurance company as hereinbefore defined; and it shall not be lawful for the Minister of Finance to license any other company than those in this section above mentioned; and no other company than those above mentioned, shall do any business of fire or inland marine insurance throughout the Dominion of Canada; but nothing herein contained shall prevent any insurance company incorporated by, or under, any Act of the legislature of the late province of Canada, or of any province of the Dominion of Canada, from carrying on any business of insurance within the limits of the late province of Canada or of such Province only, according to the powers granted to such insurance company within such limits as aforesaid, without such license as hereinafter mentioned.\nBut the Dominion statutory recognition of the rights of the local legislation, strong as it is, does not rest here. As late as 1877, by the 40 Vic., ch. 42, \u201cAn Act to amend and consolidate certain Acts respecting insurance,\u201d we find it thus enacted by section 28:\nThis Act shall not apply to any company within the exclusive legislative control of any one of the provinces of Canada unless such company so desires, and it shall be lawful for any such company to avail itself of the provisions of this Act, and if it do so avail itself such company shall have the power of transacting its business of insurance throughout Canada.\nSo again, in the year 1878, the Dominion parliament distinctly recognized the incorporation by the Ontario legislature of the Ontario Mutual Life Assurance Company, incorporated and carrying on business in the province of Ontario, under the Act, ch. 17 of the statutes of said province, passed in the 32 Vic., and incorporated the said company to enable it to carry on business of life assurance on the mutual principle, and doing all things appertaining thereto or connected therewith, as well in the said province of Ontario as in the other provinces of the Dominion.\nWe find, then, legislation In the direction carried out by this Act recommended in a solemn judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench of Ontario; we find the matter referred to a commission of judges who reported to the Government of Ontario the conditions and provisions which, in their opinion, should be enacted by the legislature of that province, and form, as against the insured, the statutory conditions of a policy of insurance in force in Ontario with respect to any property therein, and the means necessary to be adopted by the insured if he desire to omit or vary any of such conditions. Here, then, we have the legislature of Ontario assuming the right to deal with insurance companies and insurance business, their legislative action not disallowed. We find this particular Act in several cases acted upon by the bar and bench of Ontario without its validity being questioned by either, and when at last questioned, we find its validity sustained by all courts and judges of original jurisdiction who have been called on to adjudicate on this point, and, finally, by the unanimous opinion of the Court of Appeal; and last, but not least, we have the express legislation of the parliament of Canada, expressly recognizing that the local legislatures have power to deal with matters of insurance.\nI do not put forward these considerations as conclusive of the questions in this Court of Appeal, because, if we were clearly of opinion that under the B.N.A. Act the legislature of Ontario had not the power to pass the law, we would be bound to say so and to overrule the decisions of the courts below and disregard the legislation of the Dominion parliament, for, if not within the B.N.A. Act, neither the affirmance of the power by the local legislature nor the legislative recognition of it by the Dominion parliament could confer it. Still I am individually well pleased that I am enabled satisfactorily to arrive at a conclusion which relieves me from the necessity of overriding the Acts and decisions of so many learned Judges, and the legislative actions of the legislature of Ontario and the repeated statutory declarations of the parliament of Canada.\nBut this does not relieve me from the duty of showing immediately to the parties interested, and through them to the parliament of Canada and the legislatures of the provinces, by what process of reasoning I have arrived at that conclusion.\nIs, then, such legislation as this with respect to the contract of insurance beyond the power of local legislation? I think at the outset I may affirm with confidence that the B.N.A. Act recognizes in the Dominion constitution and in the provincial constitutions a legislative sovereignty, if that is a proper expression to use, as independent and as exclusive in the one as in the other over the matters respectively confided to them, and the power of each must be equally respected by the other, or ultra vires legislation will necessarily be the result.\nIt is contended that the local legislature not only cannot incorporate a local insurance company, but cannot pass any Act in reference to insurance, inasmuch as it is contended such legislation belongs exclusively to the Dominion parliament, under the power given that parliament to legislate in relation to \u201cthe regulation of trade and commerce.\u201d\nAs to the incorporation of insurance companies, this point is not directly, though it is perhaps indirectly, involved in the questions raised in these cases. It may be remarked that, in the enumeration of the powers of parliament, the only express reference to the power of incorporation is under No. 15, \u201cIncorporation of Banks,\u201d though it cannot be doubted that, under its general power of legislation, it has the power to incorporate companies with Dominion objects.\nBut it is said that insurance companies are trading or commercial companies, and therefore within the terms \u201ctrade and commerce;\u201d but we have matters connected with trade and commerce, such as navigation and shipping, banking incorporations, weights and measures, and insolvency, \u201cand such classes of subjects as are expressly excepted in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by the Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces,\u201d and these and the other enumerated \u201cclasses of subjects shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature, comprised in the enumeration of the classes of the subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\u201d\nThis shows inferentially that there may be matters of a local and private nature with which the local legislatures may deal, and which, but for the exclusive power conferred on the local legislatures, might be comprised under some of the general heads set forth in section 91, as belonging to the Dominion parliament. This is made very apparent in respect to navigation and shipping.\nBy section 91 the exclusive legislative authority of the parliament of Canada is declared to extend to all matters coming within the classes of subjects next thereinafter enumerated, of which \u201cnavigation and shipping\u201d is one. When we turn to the enumeration of the exclusive powers of the provincial legislatures, we find \u201clocal works and undertakings, other than such as are of the following classes: (a) Lines of steamers and other ships, railways, canals, telegraphs and other works and undertakings\u201d connecting the province with any other or others of the provinces, or extending beyond the limits of the province, (b) Lines of steamships between the provinces and any British or foreign country, (c) Such works, as although wholly situate within the province, are, before or after their execution, declared by the parliament of Canada to be for the general advantage of Canada, or for the advantage of two or more of the provinces\u201d\u2014and then follows the incorporation of companies with provincial objects.\nHere, then, are matters immediately connected with navigation and shipping, trade and commerce.\nIf the power to legislate on navigation and shipping and trade and commerce, vested in the Dominion parliament, necessarily excluded from local legislatures all legislation in connection with the same matters, and that nothing in relation thereto could be held to come under local works and undertakings, or property or civil rights, or generally all matters of a merely local or private nature in the province, or the incorporation of companies with provincial objects, what possible necessity could there be for inserting the exception \u201cother than such as are of the following classes as above\u201d (a, b, c). On the contrary, does not this exception show beyond all doubt, by irresistible inference, that there are matters connected with navigation and shipping, and with trade and commerce, that the local legislatures may deal with, and not encroach on the general powers belonging to the Dominion parliament for the regulation of trade and commerce, and navigation and shipping, as well as railways, canals and telegraphs? Can it be successfully contended that this is not a clear intimation that the local legislatures were to have, and have, power to legislate in reference to lines of steamers and other ships, railways, canals, and other works and undertakings wholly within the province, subject, no doubt, to the general powers of parliament over shipping and trade and commerce, and the Dominion laws enacted tinder such powers, as, for instance, the 31st Vic., ch. 65 (1868), \u201cAn Act respecting the inspection of steamboats,: and for the greater safety of passengers by them,\u201d or the Act 36 Vic., ch. 128, \u201cAn Act relating to shipping?\u201d With reference to insurance companies, and the business of insurance in general, it is contended that insurance companies are trading companies, and therefore the business they transact is purely matter of trade and commerce, and therefore local legislatures cannot in any way legislate either in reference to insurance companies or insurance business.\nAs to such a company being a trading company, Jessel, M.R., in the case of in re Griffith[42], did not seem to think the question so abundantly clear as is supposed; he says:\u2014\nI come now to the next point, which is, what is this company? Is it a trading or other public company? * * *\nSo that we have it that it must be a public company, whether it is a trading or other company; therefore it seems immaterial to consider whether a particular company is or is not a trading company, and I am glad of it, because, though I think an insurance company might be called a trading company, many people might take the opposite view of the word \u201ctrade.\u201d I take the larger view, and think it would be called a trading company, but it is immaterial. If it is a public company at all, and not a trading company, it comes under the term \u201cother public company[43].\u201d\nBut in the view I take of this case, I am willing to assume that insurance companies may be considered trading companies, and yet that it by no means follows that the legislation complained of is beyond the powers of the local legislatures.\nWith reference to section 91, and the classes of subjects therein enumerated, Lord Selborne, in L\u2019Union St. Jacques de Montreal and Belisle[44], says:\nTheir Lordships observe that the scheme of enumeration in that section is to mention various categories of general subjects which may be dealt with by legislation. There is no indication in any in stance of anything being contemplated, except what may properly be described as general legislation.\nIt may be difficult to draw the exact line between the powers of the Dominion parliament to regulate trade and commerce and the powers of the local legislatures over \u201clocal works and undertakings,\u201d \u201cproperty and civil rights in the province,\u201d and \u201cgenerally all matters of a merely local or private nature in the province.\u201d\nNo one can dispute the general power of parliament to legislate as to \u201ctrade and commerce\u201d and that where, over matters with which local legislatures have power to deal, local legislation conflicts with an Act passed by the Dominion parliament in the exercise of any of the general powers confided to it, the legislation of the local must yield to the supremacy of the Dominion parliament; in other words, that the provincial legislation in such a case must be subject to such regulations, for instance, as to trade and commerce of a commercial character, as the Dominion parliament may prescribe. I adhere to what I said in Valin v. Langlois[45], that the property and civil rights referred to, were not all property and all civil rights, but that the terms \u201cproperty and civil rights\u201d must necessarily be read in a restricted and limited sense, because many matters involving property and civil rights are expressly reserved to the Dominion parliament, and that the power of the local legislatures was to be subject to the general and special legislative powers of the Dominion parliament, and to what I, there added; \u201cBut while the legislative rights of the local legislatures are in this sense subordinate to the right of the Dominion parliament, I think such latter right must be exercised, so far as may be, consistently with the right of the local legislatures; and, therefore, the Dominion parliament would only have the right to interfere with property and civil rights in so far as such interference may be necessary for the purpose of legislating generally and effectually in relation to matters confided to the parliament of Canada.\u201d\nI think the power of the Dominion parliament to regulate trade and commerce ought not to be held to be necessarily inconsistent with those of the local legislatures to regulate property and civil rights in respect to all matters of a merely local and private nature, such as matters connected with the enjoyment and preservation of property in the province, or matters of contract between parties in relation to their property or dealings, although the exercise by the local legislatures of such powers may be said remotely to affect matters connected with trade and commerce, unless, indeed, the laws of the provincial legislatures should conflict with those of the Dominion parliament passed for the general regulation of trade and commerce. I do not think the local legislatures are to be deprived of all power to deal with property and civil rights, because parliament, in the plenary exercise of its power to regulate trade and commerce, may possibly pass laws inconsistent with the exercise by the local legislatures of their powers\u2014the exercise of the powers of the local legislatures being in such a case subject to such regulations as the Dominion may lawfully prescribe.\nThe Act now under consideration is not, in my opinion, a regulation of trade and commerce; it deals with the contract of fire insurance, as between the insurer and the insured. That contract is simply a contract of indemnity against loss or damage by fire, whereby one party, in consideration of an immediate fixed payment, undertakes to pay or make good to the other any loss or damage by fire, which may happen during a fixed period to specified property, not exceeding the sum named as the limit of insurance. In Dalby v. The India & London Life Insurance Co.[46], Parke, B., delivering the judgment of the court, says:\nThe contract commonly called \u201clife insurance,\u201d when properly considered, is a mere contract to pay a certain sum of money upon the death of a person, in consideration of the due payment of a certain annuity for his life, the amount of the annuity being calculated, in the first instance, according to the probable duration of the life, and when once fixed is constant and invariable. This species of insurance in no way resembles a contract of indemnity.\nHow this, as between the parties to the contract, can be called a matter of trade and commerce, I must confess my inability to comprehend; but the process of reasoning, as I understand it, by which we are asked to say that fire insurance is a matter of trade and commerce, would make life assurance equally so.\nIn this same case, Parke, B., says:\u2014\nPolicies of assurance against fire and against marine risks are both properly contracts of indemnity, the insurer engaging to make good, within certain limited amounts, the losses sustained by the assured in their buildings, ships and effects. Policies on maritime risks were afterwards used improperly, and made mere wagers on the happening of those perils. This practice was limited by the 19 Geo. 2 ch. 37, and put an end to in all except a few cases. But at common law, before this statute with respect to maritime risks, and the 14 Geo. 3 ch. 48, as to insurance on lives, it is perfectly clear that all contracts for wager policies, and wagers which were not contrary to the policy of the law, were legal contracts, and so it is stated by the Court in the case of Causens v. Nantes[47], to have been solemnly determined in Lucena v. Craufurd[48], without even a difference of opinion among all the Judges. To the like effect was the decision of the Court of Error in Ireland, before all the Judges except three, in the British Insurance Co. v. Magee[49], that the insurance was legal at common law[50].\nI do not understand that by the Act now assailed any supreme sovereign legislative power to regulate and control the business of insurance in Ontario is claimed, As I read the Act, it deals only with this contract of indemnity; it does not profess to deal with trade or commerce, or to make any regulation in reference thereto. In my opinion, this Act has no reference to trade and commerce in the sense in which these words are used in the British North America Act. It is simply an exercise of the power of the local legislature for the protection of property in Ontario, and the civil rights of the proprietors thereof in connection therewith, by securing a reasonable and just contract in favor of parties insuring property, real or personal, in Ontario, and deals therefore only with a matter of a local and private nature. The scope and object of the Act is to secure to parties insuring a just and reasonable contract, to prevent the exaction of unjust and unreasonable conditions, and to protect parties from being imposed upon by the insertion of conditions and stipulations in such a way as not to be brought to the immediate notice of the insured, or capable of being easily Understood, or by the insertion of conditions calculated practically in many cases to deprive the parties paying the premiums of indemnity, though justly entitled to it, and, if the statutory conditions are omitted or varied, to compel the terms of the contract to be so plainly and prominently put on the contract that the attention of the assured may be called to them, and so that he may not be misled, judicial experience having proved that the rights of the insured, and legitimate indemnity in return for the money paid demanded that the insured should be thus protected.\nAs the case of Smith v. Commercial Union Insurance Company[51] proves that the judicial tribunals found that legislative protection was required in Ontario against unreasonable and unjust conditions imposed on the assured by the assurers; should experience show that over-insurance was of frequent occurrence, and led to fraudulent burning, whereby not only fraud was encouraged, but the neighbouring properties of innocent parties, wholly unconnected with the insurance, were jeopardized, can it be said that it would be ultra vires for the legislature of a province, with a view to stop such practises, to enact that in every case of over insurance, whether intentional or unintentional, the policy should be void, or to make any other provisions in reference to the contract of insurance as to value as would, in the opinion of the local legislature, prevent frauds and protect property? Could such legislation be held to be ultra vires, as being an interference with trade and commerce, because it dealt with the subject of insurance? Or for preventing frauds and perjuries, would it be ultra vires for the local legislature to enact that, as to all contracts of insurance entered into in Ontario, no insurance on any building or property in Ontario should be binding, or valid in law or equity, unless in writing? Or, take the first section of the 38 Vic., ch. 45, can it be that the local legislature cannot make provision to provide against a failure of justice and right by enacting, as the first section of that Act did, that:\nWhere, by reason of necessity, accident or mistake, the conditions of any contract of fire insurance on property in this province as to the proof to be given to the Insurance Company after the occurrence of a fire have not been strictly complied with; or where, after a statement or proof of loss has been given in good faith by or on behalf of the insured in pursuance of any proviso or condition of such contract, the Company, through its agent or otherwise, objects to the loss upon other grounds than imperfect compliance with such conditions, or does not, within a reasonable time after receiving such statement or proof, notify the insured in writing that such statement or proof is objected to, and what are the particulars in which the same is alleged to be defective, and so from time to time or where, from any other reason, the Court or Judge before whom a question relating to such insurance is tried or inquired into, considers it inequitable that the insurance should be deemed void or forfeited by reason of imperfect compliance with such conditions; no objection to the sufficiency of such statement or proof, or amended or supplemented statement or proof (as the case may be) shall, in any of such cases, be allowed as a discharge of the liability of the Company on such contract of insurance whenever entered into; but this section shall not apply where the fire has taken place before the passing of this Act.\nHow can this be said to be an interference with the general regulation of trade and commerce? Yet it deals as effectually with the matter or contract of insurance in these particulars as this Act does in reference to the matters with which it deals. If the legislative power of the provincial legislatures is to be restricted and limited, as it is claimed it should be, and the doctrine contended for in this case, as I understand it, is carried to its legitimate logical conclusion, the idea of the power of the local legislature to deal with the local works and undertakings, property and civil rights, and matters of a merely local and private nature in the province is, I humbly think, to a very great extent, illusory.\nI scarcely know how one could better illustrate the exercise of the power of the local legislatures to legislate with reference to property and civil rights, and matters of a merely local and private nature, than by a local Act of incorporation, whereby a right to hold or deal with real or personal property in a province is granted, and whereby the civil right to contract and sue and to be sued as an individual in reference thereto is also granted. If a legislature possesses this power, as a necessary sequence, it must have the right to limit and control the manner in which the property may be so dealt with, and as to the contracts in reference thereto, the terms and conditions on which they may be entered into, whether they may be verbal, or shall be in writ- ing, whether they shall contain conditions for the pro tection or security of one or other or both the parties, or that they may be free to deal as may be agreed on by the contracting parties without limit or restriction.\nInasmuch, then, as this Act relates to property in Ontario, and the subject-matter dealt with is therefore local, and as the contract between the parties is of a strictly private nature, and as the matters thus dealt with are therefore, in the words of the British North America Act, \u201cof a merely local and private nature in the province,\u201d and as contracts are matters of civil rights and breaches thereof are civil wrongs, and as the property and civil rights in the province only are dealt with by the Act, and as \u201cproperty and civil rights in the provinces\u201d are in the enumeration of the \u201cexclusive powers of provincial legislatures,\u201d I am of opinion that the legislature of Ontario, in dealing with these matters in the Act in question, did not exceed their legislative powers.\nI am happy to say I can foresee, and I fear, no evil effects whatever, as has been suggested, as likely to result to the Dominion from this view of the case. On the contrary, I believe that while this decision \u201crecognizes and sustains the legislative control of the Dominion parliament over all matters confided to its legislative jurisdiction, it, at the same time, preserves to the local legislatures those rights and powers conferred on them by the B.N.A. Act, and which a contrary decision would, in my opinion, in effect, substantially, or, to a very large extent, sweep away.\nI carefully and advisedly abstain from expressing any opinion as to the validity or invalidity of any Act of the Dominion of Canada, or of the province of Ontario, save only as to the Act now immediately under consideration. It will be time enough to discuss and decide on the validity of other statutes, whether Do- minion or provincial, when properly brought before us for judicial decision. To do so now, or to express any opinion as to the effect of this decision on other legislation not before us, and without argument or judicial investigation and consideration, would be, in my opinion, extra\u2011judicial.\nAs to the construction which my brother Gwynne has put on section 3rd of the Act, in the case of Giraldi and Provincial Insurance Company[52], though the arguments used by him in that case, and the judgment he is about to deliver, which he has kindly afforded me the opportunity of reading, and which I have most attentively considered, are very cogent and plausible, yet I have been unable to arrive at the same conclusion that he has. I think the history and phraseology of the Act shows it was passed for the protection and benefit of the insured, and \u201cas against the insurer,\u201d that the insured may insure without conditions if he pleases, except those conditions which the law implies, but that in such a case, as against the insurer, the insured may claim the benefit of these conditions. But if the insurer wishes to avail himself of the statute and the statutory conditions, he must pursue the course pointed out by the statute; he cannot, in my opinion, disregard the requirements of the statute, and at the same time claim its benefits; and if he desires other conditions than the statutory conditions, he can only have them by varying the statutory conditions, or add to them in the manner pointed out by the statute. I can add nothing to what C.J. Moss and Judge Burton have said in their judgments on this point.\nIt is urged that the provisions of this statute do not apply to an insurance by what is called an interim receipt. When that contains an agreement to insure, it is, in my opinion, a policy within the meaning of the Act. A policy of insurance is a written instrument containing the contract. Whether it be contained in what is usually called an interim receipt, or a more formal document, it is equally the instrument containing the contract, and so the statutory definition of the term policy, in 33 and 34 Vic., ch. 97 Imp., is:\u2014\u201dEvery writing whereby any contract of insurance is made, or agreed to be made, is evidence.\u201d\nAs at present advised, I think the interim receipt should be treated as the policy. It would be an entire evasion of the statute if companies could insure by a document not in the usual form of a policy, and by calling it by another name impose their own conditions and escape from the provisions of the statute for the protection of the insured, but it is not necessary to discuss or finally decide this point, as in this case of Parsons v. The Queen Insurance Company, both the court of first instance and the Court of Appeal treated the case in the way most favorable for the defendants, and they have nothing to complain of.\nAs to the contention that the statute of Ontario can only apply to local companies and not to foreign companies, or companies incorporated by the Dominion of Canada, in my opinion any company, whether foreign, or incorporated by the Dominion legislature to carry on the business of fire insurance in any part of the Dominion of Canada, must do so subject always to the laws of the province in which the business is done, in the same way that a merchant carries on his trade or commerce within a province; but because he is a merchant or trader he is not exempt from an obligation to obey the laws of the province in which he carries on his business, if he enters into a contract within the province, and the law of the province prescribes the form of the contract under its power to legislate as to property and civil rights; neither corporations nor traders can set themselves above that law and contract as they please independent of it. Suppose no statute of frauds was in force in a province, and the legislature enacted that no agreement for the sale of goods over $20 should be valid unless the contract of sale was evidenced by a writing signed by the parties, or in fact enacted a statute of frauds similar to the statute of Charles; or with reference to the statute of limitations, passed an Act limiting the validity of the contract as well as the remedy, or altered the existing limitations, and reduced or extended the time limited for bringing an action, could a corporation, merchants or traders, successfully claim to be exempt from the operation of such law on the ground that they interfered with trade and commerce, or that they were foreign corporations or foreigners engaged in trade, and therefore bound by no local laws?\nIf an insurance company is a trader, and the business it carries on is commercial, why should the local legislature, having legislative power over property and civil rights, and matters of a private and local character, not be enabled to say to such a company: \u201cIf you do business in the province of Ontario, and insure property situate here, we have legislative control over property and over the civil rights in the province, and will, under such power, for the protection of that property and the rights of the insured, define the conditions on which you shall deal with such property,\u201d it being possibly wholly unconnected with trade and commerce, as a private dwelling or farming establishment, and the person insured having possibly no connection with trade or commerce?\nHow can it be said that such property and such civil rights or contract shall be outside of all local legislation, and so outside of all local legislative protection? If the business of insurance is connected with trade and commerce, the legislation we are now considering does not attempt to prohibit the carrying on of the business of insurance, but having the property and the civil rights of the people of the province confided to them this legislation, in relation thereto, is simply the protection of such property and of such rights. In Palleson v. Mills[53], Lord Lyndhurst says:\u2014\nAnd here another question arises\u2014supposing the Act does not extend to Scotland, still it is said to be a bar to this action, because it is founded on a policy by an English company. The company is certainly an English one, but it is to be considered where the original contract was made. The policy was executed in London, but the action is not on the policy, but on the agreement; the original contract is made in Scotland, and if I, residing in England, send down my agent to Scotland, and he makes contracts for me there, it is the same as if I myself went there and made them.\nIn Copin v. Adamson[54], Kelly, C.B., cites the marginal note in Bank of Australasia v Harding[55], which he adopts as a correct proposition of law:\nThe members resident in England, of a company formed for the purpose of carrying on business in a place out of England, are bound, in respect of the transactions of that company, by the law of the country in which the business is carried on.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that this Act applies to all insurance companies that insure property in the Province of Ontario, whether local, dominion or foreign.\nSTRONG, J., who was present at the argument in the cases of The Queen Insurance Company v. Parsons, and Citizens\u2019 Insurance Company v. Parsons, did not deliver a formal judgment, but authorized the Chief Justice to state that he entirely agreed with the majority of the court in their conclusions, both as to the constitutionality of the Ontario statute, ch. 162 R.S., Ont., and the Construction to be put Upon the provisions of that statute. FOURNIER, J.:\nLa principale question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider est celle de la constitutional de l\u2019acte d\u2019Ontario, 39 Vict., ch. 24, maintenant le ch. 162 des statuts revises, pour assurer l\u2019uniformit\u00e9 des conditions de police d\u2019assurance. La constitutionalit\u00e9 est mise en question sur le principe que le pouvoir de l\u00e9gislater au sujet des assurances appartient au parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, comme cons\u00e9quence de son pouvoir exclusif de r\u00e9glementer le traffic et le commerce.\nAfin de s\u2019assurer s\u2019il y a conflit de pouvoirs, la premi\u00e8re chose \u00e0 faire est sans doute d\u2019examiner la nature de la loi dont il s\u2019agit. Comme l\u2019indique son titre, elle a pour but d\u2019assurer des conditions uniformes dans les polices d\u2019assurance contre le feu.\nLa 2me section d\u00e9clare que l\u2019ex\u00e9cution imparfaite des conditions de l\u2019assurance, quant \u00e0 la preuve de l\u2019incendie ne sera pas une raison suffisante pour annuler le contrat: 1o. lorsque par raison de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, erreur ou accident, ces conditions n\u2019ont pu \u00eatre remplies; 2o. lorsque apr\u00e8s que cette preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie conform\u00e9ment aux conditions du contrat, la compagnie fait objection pour d\u2019autres motifs que le d\u00e9faut d\u2019accomplissement de ces conditions; 3o. lorsqu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u cette preuve elle ne donne pas, dans un temps raisonnable, avis par \u00e9crit \u00e0 l\u2019assur\u00e9, des raisons pour lesquelles elle consid\u00e8re cette preuve d\u00e9fectueuse; 4o. lorsque la cour ou le juge, pour aucune autre raison, consid\u00e8re qu\u2019il serait injuste de d\u00e9clarer l\u2019assurance nulle pour cause d\u2019ex\u00e9cution imparfaite de ces conditions.\nLa 3me d\u00e9clare que les conditions mentionn\u00e9es dans la c\u00e9dule feront, contre l\u2019assureur (as against the insurer), partie de toute police d\u2019assurance contre le feu sur des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s situ\u00e9es dans la province d\u2019Ontario. Ces con- ditions doivent de plus \u00eatre imprim\u00e9es sur la police d\u2019assurance avec le titre \u201cStatutory conditions.\u201d\nLa 4me section indique la mani\u00e8re de modifier les conditions et le mode \u00e0 suivre pour leur impression.\nLa 5me section d\u00e9clare qu\u2019aucune variation de ces conditions ne sera obligatoire pour l\u2019assur\u00e9, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la sec. 4; dans le cas contraire la police demeure, quant aux assureurs (as against insurers) soumise aux conditions impos\u00e9es par le statut.\nPar la sec. 6, il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que si d\u2019autres conditions que celles voulues par le statut sont ins\u00e9r\u00e9es dans une police\u2014et que le juge ou la cour d\u00e9cide qu\u2019elles ne sont ni justes ni raisonnables\u2014elles sont dans ce cas d\u00e9clar\u00e9es nulles et sans effet,\nLa 7me donne un appel des causes jug\u00e9es en vertu de cet acte.\nCe pr\u00e9cis de la loi fait voir qu\u2019elle se borne \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles au sujet de la preuve \u00e0 faire dans certains cas, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9clarer quelles seront, dans la province d\u2019Ontario, les conditions obligatoires de tout contrat d\u2019assurance. Ces dispositions, enti\u00e8rement de droit civil, ne comportent aucune prohibition du commerce de l\u2019assureur, ni la nullit\u00e9 des polices qu\u2019il \u00e9met. Les conditions impos\u00e9es sont justes et raisonnables, et en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 fort peu diff\u00e9rentes de celles adopt\u00e9es par la plupart des compagnies.\nEn quoi cette l\u00e9gislation trouve-t-elle au pouvoir de r\u00e9glementer le commerce et le trafic? Le sujet auquel elle s\u2019applique, le contrat d\u2019assurance, n\u2019appartient-il pas au droit civil et ne fait-il pas partie de la juridiction attribu\u00e9e aux provinces par le paragraphe 13 de la section 92 de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord au sujet de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et des droits civils?\nSans doute que le contrat d\u2019assurance est d\u2019un usage immense dans le commerce, aussi bien que par les non commer\u00e7ants. Mais l\u2019objet auquel s\u2019applique un contrat n\u2019en change pas la nature; quel que soit son objet le contrat d\u2019assurance n\u2019est toujours qu\u2019un contrat d\u2019indemnit\u00e9, qui tient de la nature du cautionnement, et comme tel il appartient au droit civil. Le commerce ne fait-il pas aussi constamment usage des contrats de vente, d\u2019\u00e9change, de louage, etc.? S\u2019en suit-il pour cela que la l\u00e9gislation \u00e0 leur sujet doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme faisant partie de la r\u00e9glementation du commerce? S\u2019il en \u00e9tait ainsi, si tout ce que peut atteindre le commerce devait, pour cette raison, faire partie du pouvoir exclusif du parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, la plupart des pouvoirs des provinces se trouveraient ainsi an\u00e9antis, car le commerce dans son acception la plus \u00e9tendue touche \u00e0 tout,\u2014c\u2019est, dit une d\u00e9finition de ce mot par un auteur fran\u00e7ais, \u201ccet \u00e9change de produits et de services. C\u2019est en derni\u00e8re analyse le fonds m\u00eame de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\u201d\nIl est clair que dans notre acte constitutionnel\u2014le mot ne peut avoir une signification aussi \u00e9tendue.\nPour d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e du paragraphe 2 de la sec. 91, on ne doit pas le consid\u00e9rer isol\u00e9ment; il faut au contraire le comparer avec l\u2019ensemble des dispositions de l\u2019acte constitutionnel, afin d\u2019arriver \u00e0 une conclusion qui soit conforme \u00e0 son esprit, et de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 donner effet \u00e0 toutes ses dispositions. Le but du l\u00e9gislateur en divisant les pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs par les sec. 91 et 92 entre le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et les provinces \u00e9tait, autant que compatible avec le nouvel ordre de choses, de conserver \u00e0 ces derniers, leur autonomie, sous le rapport des droits civils particuliers \u00e0 chacune d\u2019elles. On arriverait cependant \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat tout diff\u00e9rent, si l\u2019on donnait au paragraphe 2 la signification \u00e9tendue que pout comporter son sens litt\u00e9ral. Mais il est \u00e9vident que ce ne serait pas l\u2019interpr\u00e9ter correctement, puisque les paragraphes suivants de la m\u00eame section lui donnent un sens limit\u00e9. En effet si c\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019in- tention de donner \u00e0 ces expressions \u201cr\u00e9glementaires du trafic et du commerce\u201d une signification absolue; pourquoi la loi aurait-elle \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 certains sujets de l\u00e9gislation qui sont certainement compris dans le pou voir de r\u00e9glementer le commerce, comme e.g. la navi gation et les b\u00e2timents ou navires, les banques, les lettres de change et les billets promissoires, la faillite et la banqueroute\u2014tous sujets qui sans cette enumeration sp\u00e9ciale se trouveraient compris dans le pouvoir de r\u00e9glementer le commerce. Il me semble que l\u2019on doit conclure de l\u00e0 que si les expressions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de ces paragraphes ne comprennent pas d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019acte lui-m\u00eame tout ce qui fait certainement partie du commerce, elles doivent encore moins comprendre ce qui ne s\u2019y rapporte qu\u2019indirectement.\nDans la cause de Severn vs. La Reine[56] je me suis appuy\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9finition donn\u00e9e par le c\u00e9l\u00e8bre juge en chef Marshall des mots regulations of commerce dans la constitution des Etats-Unis. Elle est ainsi: \u201cIt is the power to regulate, that is the power to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed. This power, like all others vested in congress, is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no \u201climitations other than are prescribed by the constitu tion. Je crois encore \u00e0 l\u2019exactitude de cette d\u00e9finition. Pourvu qu\u2019on la prenne en entier, elle peut s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 la question sous consid\u00e9ration et nous aider \u00e0 en trouver la solution. Il faut surtout ne pas perdre de vue les derniers mots and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed by the constitution.\u201d Cette restriction nous indique que c\u2019est dans la constitution seulement que doit se trouver la limite du pouvoir de r\u00e9glementer le commerce. Apr\u00e8s avoir donn\u00e9 ce pouvoir au parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, paragraphe 2, section 91, elle donne aux provinces la juridiction sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, les droits civils et les affaires purement locales, etc., etc. Ces pouvoirs particuliers, exclusivement attribu\u00e9s aux provinces ne peuvent pas, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les termes m\u00eames de l\u2019acte constitutionnel, \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme pouvant tomber sous le pouvoir de r\u00e9glementer le commerce. R\u00e9glementation du commerce et du trafic doit n\u00e9cessairement signifier autre chose que l\u00e9gislation sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et les droits civils, puisqu\u2019ils sont des attributs exclusifs de chaque gouvernement. Dans l\u2019exercice de sa juridiction, le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a sans doute le pouvoir de toucher incidemment \u00e0 des mati\u00e8res qui sont de la juridiction des provinces,\u2014mais ce pouvoir ne s\u2019\u00e9tend pas au-del\u00e0 de ce qui est raisonnable et n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 une l\u00e9gislation pour les fins du commerce seulement. Le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ne pourrait donc sous ce pr\u00e9texte de commerce contr\u00f4ler enti\u00e8rement un sujet qui est de la juridiction des provinces. Sa l\u00e9gislation comme r\u00e9glementation du commerce doit \u00eatre compl\u00e8te, sans cependant an\u00e9antir la juridiction des provinces sur cette partie du sujet qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e par cette l\u00e9gislation. S\u2019il n\u2019en \u00e9tait ainsi, chaque fois que le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, en exer\u00e7ant son pouvoir au sujet de commerce, toucherait \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et aux droits civils, il en r\u00e9sulterait que toute l\u00e9gislation sur ce sujet lui serait attribu\u00e9e et que le pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif des provinces sur ces m\u00eames sujets cesserait d\u2019exister. La d\u00e9cision du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de l\u2019Union St. Jacques et Bellisle[57], a adopt\u00e9 un principe dont l\u2019application \u00e0 cette cause nous permet de concilier l\u2019exercice des pouvoirs respectifs du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provincial. S\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas ainsi, qu\u2019arriverait-il, par exemple, au sujet de la l\u00e9gislation sur le mariage? Le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a juridiction sur le mariage et le divorce; la juridiction provinciale est limit\u00e9e \u00e0 la solennisation du mariage; ce dernier pouvoir est limit\u00e9 aux formalit\u00e9s ext\u00e9rieures du contrat de mariage. Mais les expressions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales \u201cle mariage et le divorce\u201d interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es litt\u00e9ralement sont susceptibles d\u2019une signification tr\u00e8s \u00e9tendue. Le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral pourrait-il dans ce cas, sur le motif que la l\u00e9gislation sur le mariage lui appartient, \u00e9tendre sa juridiction jusqu\u2019\u00e0 en r\u00e9gler les conditions civiles, comme le douaire, la communaut\u00e9 de biens\u2014et par l\u00e0 exclure la juridiction des provinces sur cette partie du droit civil? N\u2019est-il pas \u00e9vident qu\u2019il devait, au contraire, borner strictement sa l\u00e9gislation aux conditions de capacit\u00e9 et d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de contracter mariage, ainsi qu\u2019aux causes d\u2019emp\u00eachements et autres conditions qui sont de la nature de ce contrat, sans intervenir avec les droits civils qui en r\u00e9sultent. Ces expressions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales du parag. 26, sec. 91 \u201cLe mariage et le divorce\u201d nous offre un autre exemple de l\u2019emploi dans l\u2019acte constitutionnel d\u2019expressions qui doivent cependant avoir un sens limit\u00e9 par d\u2019autres dispositions du m\u00eame acte. N\u2019en devrait-il pas \u00eatre de m\u00eame de l\u2019exercice du pouvoir de r\u00e9glementer le commerce?\nAfin de concilier l\u2019exercice de ses pouvoirs je conclus que dans un cas comme celui dont il s\u2019agit, la juridiction provinciale ne se trouve limit\u00e9e par l\u2019exercice de celle du pouvoir f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, qu\u2019en ce qui est de la comp\u00e9tence de ce dernier,\u2014et que la province peut encore exercer son pouvoir sur cette partie du sujet de sa juridiction dans tout ce qui ne se trouverait pas en conflit direct avec la l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur un sujet de sa comp\u00e9tence,\u2014cette interpr\u00e9tation me semble conforme \u00e0 l\u2019autorit\u00e9 suivante:\u2014\nA grant of power to regulate, necessarily excludes the action of all others who would perform the same operation on the same thing[58].\nExiste-il une l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur le m\u00eame sujet; same operation on the same thing? Il est bien vrai que le parlement duc Canada a pass\u00e9 plusieurs lois concernant les compagnies d\u2019assurances avant et depuis celle dont il s\u2019agit.\nSans vouloir entrer dans l\u2019examen particulier de cette l\u00e9gislation, sur laquelle je ne suis pas maintenant appel\u00e9 \u00e0 me prononcer, je crois cependant devoir faire allusion \u00e0 quelques-unes de ses principales dispositions, afin de faire voir qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de conflit entre les lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et la loi d\u2019Ontario.\nLa 40e Vict, chap. 42, qui a amend\u00e9, consolid\u00e9 et r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 les lois ant\u00e9rieures dont la premi\u00e8re est la 31e Vict., ch. 48, adopt\u00e9es par le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral au sujet des assurances a \u00e9tabli des dispositions dont le but \u00e9vident est de prot\u00e9ger le public contre des pertes qui pourraient \u00eatre inflig\u00e9es par des compagnies irresponsables. Les compagnies auxquelles cet acte s\u2019applique sont d\u2019abord oblig\u00e9es de prendre une licence sans laquelle elles ne peuvent transiger aucune affaire, il leur faut ensuite faire un d\u00e9p\u00f4t entre les mains du ministre des finances de $100,000 pour la s\u00fbret\u00e9 des porteurs de polices d\u2019assurances. Elles doivent aussi produire dans le d\u00e9partement des finances, ainsi qu\u2019aux greffes des Cours Sup\u00e9rieures, dans la juridiction desquelles elles transigent des affaires, une copie de leur acte d\u2019incorporation, aussi, une procuration de la compagnie, en la forme prescrite, a son principal g\u00e9rant ou agent en Canada, avec d\u00e9claration que l\u2019a signification de tous brefs ou proc\u00e9dures contre elle pourra \u00eatre faite au bureau de cet agent. Elles doivent fournir des statistiques compl\u00e8tes et d\u00e9taill\u00e9es sur leurs affaires, indiquer tout changement survenu dans l\u2019agence principale, donner avis de l\u2019obtention de la licence et aussi de la cessation des affaires. Des dispositions sp\u00e9ciales sont adopt\u00e9es pour la liquidation des affaires dans le cas d\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9. Enfin, elles sont soumises \u00e0 l\u2019inspection et surveillance d\u2019un inspecteur qui est rev\u00eatu de pouvoirs \u00e9tendus pour faire ex\u00e9cuter toutes les dispositions de cet acte.\nCes dispositions, comme on le voit, ont pour but, non pas de r\u00e9gler le contrat d\u2019assurance, mais uniquement de soumettre l\u2019assureur dans l\u2019exercice de son commerce comme tel \u00e0 l\u2019observation de r\u00e8glements \u00e9tablis pour la protection du public. Ces lois n\u2019imposent aucunes conditions comme devant faire partie obligatoirement du contrat.\nAinsi la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne touche nullement \u00e0 la nature du contrat d\u2019assurance, ni aux conditions qui devront en faire partie dont s\u2019occupe exclusivement la loi d\u2019Ontario; les deux l\u00e9gislations d\u00e9coulant de deux sources diff\u00e9rentes de pouvoir, la premi\u00e8re du pouvoir de r\u00e8gle menter le commerce, et la seconde de celui de l\u00e9gislater sur les droits civils et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ne peuvent\u2011elles pas subsister toutes deux, si leurs dispositions ne sont ni contradictoires ni incompatibles? Je dois avouer que je ne trouve aucun conflit entre ces lois et que je ne vois aucun obstacle \u00e0 leur ex\u00e9cution. Cette mani\u00e8re de voir est support\u00e9e par l\u2019autorit\u00e9 suivante:\n\u2026So if a State, in passing laws on subjects acknowledged to be within its control, and with a view to those subjects, shall adopt a measure of the same character with one which Congress may adopt, it does not derive its authority from the particular power which has been granted, but from others which remain with the State, and may be executed by the same means. All experience shows that the same measures, or measures scarcely distinguishable from each other, may flow from distinct powers; but this does not prove that the powers themselves are identical, Although the means used in their execution may sometimes approach each other so nearly as to be confounded, there are other situations in which they are sufficiently distinct to establish their individuality.[59]\nBien qu\u2019il soit possible de concilier ainsi l\u2019existence de ces deux l\u00e9gislations, n\u2019est-il pas \u00e9vident cependant que la loi d\u2019Ontario, portant exclusivement sur la preuve et la nature des conditions des contrats d\u2019assurance faits dans cette province, cette loi est intra vires? En effet l\u2019\u00e9mission d\u2019une police d\u2019assurance n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement une transaction commerciale. Elle ne l\u2019est certainement* pas de la part de l\u2019assur\u00e9, bien que d\u2019apr\u00e8s le code civil, elle le soit de la part de l\u2019assureur. Pardessus s\u2019exprime ainsi \u00e0 ce sujet:\nElles (les conventions d\u2019assurances) ne sont par leur nature des actes de commerce au moins de la part de ceux qui se font assurer. Mais comme presque toujours de la part de ceux qui assurent, elles sont de v\u00e9ritables sp\u00e9culations, c\u2019est sous ce point de vue que nous les consid\u00e9rons comme actes de commerce, et que nous avons cru d\u00e9voir en faire conna\u00eetre les principes.\nDans le droit anglais, il en est de m\u00eame; l\u2019assurance est une transaction commerciale, bien que le contrat d\u2019assurance dont il fait un usage constant soit du droit civil.\nL\u2019acte constitutionnel ne dit nulle part que le droit commercial est de la juridiction de la Puissance. Il semble au contraire en lui en attribuant sp\u00e9cialement une certaine partie, comme la navigation, les banques, les lettres de change et les billets promissoires, la faillite, avoir laiss\u00e9 le surplus \u00e0 la juridiction des provinces comme faisant partie des droits civils.\nA ce point de vue la loi d\u2019Ontario aurait sa source dans le pouvoir des provinces de l\u00e9gislater sur les droits civils. C\u2019est d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce principe que la cause de Paul vs. Virginia a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e[60]. Une loi de l\u2019Etat de Virginie avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les compagnies d\u2019assurance non incorpor\u00e9es en vertu des lois de cet \u00e9tat n\u2019auraient pas le pouvoir de faire des affaires dans les limites de l\u2019Etat, \u00e0 moins d\u2019avoir obtenu une licence \u00e0 cet effet, et d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une certaine somme pour la garantie des droits des assur\u00e9s. Le demandeur pr\u00e9tendait que cette loi \u00e9tait inconstitutionnelle parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait contraire au pouvoir du Congr\u00e8s de r\u00e9glementer le commerce. Le juge Field en pronon\u00e7ant le jugement de la cour s\u2019exprime ainsi:\nIssuing a policy of insurance is not a transaction of commerce., The policies are simple contracts of indemnity against loss by fire, entered into between the Corporation and the assured, for a consideration paid by the latter\u00bb\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s cette autorit\u00e9, c\u2019est donc comme appartenant au droit civil que la l\u00e9gislature d\u2019Ontario avait droit d\u2019adopter la loi en question. Mais il y a un autre argu-ment que je consid\u00e8re comme tr\u00e8s important dans le cas actuel, c\u2019est comme on le verra ci-apr\u00e8s la recon-naissance par le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral du droit des provinces de l\u00e9gislater \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nBien que le paragraphe 11 de la section 92 donne aux provinces les pouvoirs d\u2019incorporer des compagnies pour des objets provinciaux, on a cependant dout\u00e9 que les termes soient suffisants pour comprendre le pouvoir d\u2019incorporer des compagnies d\u2019assurances. Il me semble clair toutefois que les termes de ce paiagraphe sont assez \u00e9tendus pour comprendre les compagnies d\u2019assurances. Si l\u2019on objecte que l\u2019objet d\u2019une compagnie d\u2019assurance n\u2019est pas provincial, en ce sens qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas pour objet un int\u00e9r\u00eat concernant toute la province, c\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. un int\u00e9r\u00eat public, je r\u00e9pondrai que l\u2019objet de la compagnie \u00e9tant de faire des affaires dans toute la province c\u2019est ce que les termes \u2018objets provinciaux\u2019 signifient, s\u2019ils ont une signification quelconque. Ils n\u2019en auraient certainement aucune, si on les interpr\u00e9taient comme ne donnant que les pouvoirs d\u2019incorporer des compagnies ayant un int\u00e9r\u00eat public provincial, une telle interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 dire que le gouvernement peut d\u00e9l\u00e9guer et faire remplir ses fonctions par des corporations, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas le droit d\u2019incorporer aucune compagnie pour des fins de commerce, d\u2019industrie, etc. Il a sans doute ce pouvoir, pourvu que les compagnies ainsi cr\u00e9\u00e9es bornent leurs op\u00e9rations aux limites de la province. Si elles veulent aller au-del\u00e0, elles tombent alors sous la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 laquelle elles doivent se conformer et qui contient des dispositions sp\u00e9ciales pour ce cas.\nCe pouvoir d\u2019incorporer des compagnies d\u2019assurances exerc\u00e9 par la l\u00e9gislature d\u2019Ontario a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu par la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale comme appartenant aux l\u00e9gislatures provinciales.\nLa sec. 28 de 40 Vict, ch. 42, s\u2019exprime ainsi \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard:\nThis Act shall not apply to any company within the exclusive legislative control of anyone of the provinces of Canada, unless such company so desires; and it shall be lawful for any such company to avail itself of the provisions of this Act, and if it do so avail itself, such company shall then have the power of transacting its business of insurance throughout Canada.\nLa premi\u00e8re section de cet acte applique les lois de faillite aux compagnies d\u2019assurances incorpor\u00e9es par le parlement du Canada, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 celles incorpor\u00e9es avant ou apr\u00e8s la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration, par la l\u00e9gislature d\u2019aucune province constituant actuellement le Canada.\nOn trouve encore dans la sec. 30 du m\u00eame acte une autre reconnaissance du pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif des provinces au sujet des assurances. Des doutes s\u2019\u00e9tant \u00e9lev\u00e9s au sujet de certaines dispositions de l\u2019acte d\u2019Ontario concernant les assurances mutuelles, cette section de l\u2019acte f\u00e9d\u00e9ral d\u00e9clare que telles dispositions seulement qui peuvent \u00eatre dans les limites de la juridiction du parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral sont r\u00e9voqu\u00e9es. Il y a dans cette section, non\u2011seulement la reconnaissance formelle des pouvoirs de la province, mais il y a de plus la d\u00e9claration si importante que l\u2019acte n\u2019est r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 que dans sa partie seulement o\u00f9 il y a conflit de pouvoirs. C\u2019est une admission formelle que le sujet, en ce qui concerne son c\u00f4t\u00e9 commercial, est de la comp\u00e9tence du parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, tandis que pour ce qui concerne le droit civil, comme la nature et les conditions du contrat d\u2019assurance, il reste sous le contr\u00f4le de la l\u00e9gislation provinciale. C\u2019est aussi en m\u00eame temps une confirmation de l\u2019opinion exprim\u00e9e plus haut sur les restrictions que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et le gouvernement provincial doivent s\u2019imposer dans l\u2019exercice de leurs pouvoirs respectifs afin de ne pas en d\u00e9passer les limites.\nIl est vrai que l\u2019exercice d\u2019un pouvoir ne saurait \u00eatre dans la plupart des cas une raison suffisante pour \u00e9tablir son existence l\u00e9gale. Mais dans un cas comme celui dont il s\u2019agit, o\u00f9 il y a de fortes raisons pour qu\u2019il soit exerc\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re limit\u00e9e comme il l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 par la 40e Vict., ch. 42, en reconnaissant le droit des provinces qui para\u00eet \u00e9galement bien fond\u00e9, on doit en conclure que l\u2019accord des deux l\u00e9gislations pour se tenir dans leurs limites respectives, est une grande pr\u00e9somption qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont exerc\u00e9 que les pouvoirs leur appartenant. Les plus importants d\u00e9partements publics, comme la justice, les finances, ont adopt\u00e9 depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es cette mani\u00e8re de voir en faisant ex\u00e9cuter les dispositions des diverses lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales au sujet des assurances. Cette interpr\u00e9tation ne saurait sans doute pr\u00e9valoir contre une interpr\u00e9tation judiciaire, mais en l\u2019absence de celle-ci, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation administrative ne peut manquer d\u2019avoir une grande importance. Story la met au second rang et en parle en ces termes:\u2014\nAnd, after all, the most unexceptional source of collateral interpretation is from the practical exposition of the Government itself in its various departments upon particular questions discussed, and settled upon their own single merits. Those approach the nearest in their own nature to judicial expositions; and have the same general recommendation, that belongs to the latter[61].\nCette interpr\u00e9tation administrative a eu lieu depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es\u2014les droits de licences ont \u00e9t\u00e9 per\u00e7us, les statistiques exig\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies, sans qu\u2019il se soit \u00e9lev\u00e9 aucune pr\u00e9tention au contraire, de la part des provinces; de m\u00eame que le pouvoir exerc\u00e9 par la loi d\u2019Ontario n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en contestation par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral qui aurait pu d\u00e9savouer cette loi s\u2019il l\u2019e\u00fbt consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ultra vires. Lorsque les deux gouvernements sont d\u2019accord sur ce sujet, et qu\u2019ils font dispara\u00eetre par des lois les doutes qui pouvaient exister, n\u2019y aurait-il pas t\u00e9m\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u00e0 substituer une autre interpr\u00e9tation que la leur. S\u2019il y a doute sur la question il me semble r\u00e9gl\u00e9 par l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative et les tribunaux n\u2019ont qu\u2019\u00e0 s\u2019y conformer.\nAinsi, \u00e0 part des raisons que j\u2019ai donn\u00e9es plus haut au soutien de la loi d\u2019Ontario, il y a donc encore \u00e0 son appui l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation administrative et l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative. Si je ne parle pas de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation judiciaire des cours d\u2019Ontario, c\u2019est parce qu\u2019elle est mise en question par le pr\u00e9sent appel, mais elle n\u2019en a pas moins la plus haute valeur par l\u2019unanimit\u00e9 d\u2019opinions des honorables juges qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 se prononcer sur cette question, support\u00e9e comme elle Test par la d\u00e9cision de la Cour Supr\u00eame des Etats-Unis dans la cause ci-dessus cit\u00e9e de Paul vs. Virginia.\nInd\u00e9pendemment de la question de constitutionalit\u00e9, l\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tend aussi qu\u2019\u00e9tant une compagnie incorpor\u00e9e par le parlement d\u2019Angleterre elle se trouve par cela m\u00eame soustraite \u00e0 l\u2019op\u00e9ration de la loi en question.\nQuelle que soit l\u2019origine des corporations, soit qu\u2019elles doivent leur existence au parlement de la Puissance, aux l\u00e9gislatures provinciales, ou \u00e0 un pouvoir \u00e9tranger, elles n\u2019en sont pas moins, dans un cas comme dans l\u2019autre, soumises pour l\u2019exercice de leurs franchises aux conditions que peut leur imposer la loi du pays dans lequel elles les exercent. Ces corporations ne sont en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 que des associations commerciales ne diff\u00e9rant principalement des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s commerciales ordinaires que par la limite apport\u00e9e \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 de ceux qui les composent. La loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale cit\u00e9e plus haute, sec. 1r\u00e9, les met au m\u00eame rang que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de particuliers faisant des affaires d\u2019assurances. Elles ne peuvent pas plus que les autres soci\u00e9t\u00e9s se pr\u00e9tendre exemptes de se conformer aux lois. Nos grandes maisons de commerce, qui ont des comptoirs dans presque toutes les provinces de la Puissance et dans un grand nombre de pays \u00e9trangers, ont-elles jamais pr\u00e9tendu faire fl\u00e9chir les lois des divers pays o\u00f9 elles font leur commerce, devant les conditions qu\u2019elles ont pu faire au si\u00e8ge principal de leurs affaires. Quelque inconv\u00e9nient qui puisse en r\u00e9sulter, ne sont-elles pas oblig\u00e9es dans tous leurs contrats, de se conformer aux lois de chaque pays o\u00f9 elles font des affaires. Il serait sans doute plus simple et plus commode pour les compagnies d\u2019assurance d\u2019avoir le pouvoir souverain de fixer elles-m\u00eames leurs conditions et de les imposer dans tous les pays o\u00f9 elles pourraient \u00e9tablir des bureaux. Mais ne serait-ce pas les mettre au-dessus de la loi? Loin de leur reconna\u00eetre un pareil privil\u00e8ge, les autorit\u00e9s et de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions judiciaires sont d\u2019accord sur le principe contraire. Cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi d\u00e9cid\u00e9e dans la cause d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9e de Paul vs. Virginia, o\u00f9 le juge Field s\u2019exprime ainsi \u00e0 ce sujet:\nThe recognition of its existence (Corporation) even by the other. States, and the enforcement of its contracts made therein, depend greatly upon the comity of those States, a comity which is never extended when the existence of the Corporation or the exercise of its powers is prejudicial to their interests, or repugnant to their policy. They may exclude the foreign corporations entirely, they may restrict its business to particular localities, or they may exact such security for the performance of its contracts with their citizens as in their judgment will best promote the public interests.\nIl est \u00e0 peine n\u00e9cessaire de citer des autorit\u00e9s \u00e0 ce sujet, car il s\u2019agit de l\u2019application d\u2019une r\u00e8gle r\u00e9glementaire, locus regit actum. Je citerai cependant la suivante parce qu\u2019elle contient l\u2019opinion de l\u2019auteur du \u201cTrait\u00e9 du droit de la nature et des gens: \u201cLorsque la police est applicable \u00e0 des navires arm\u00e9s et \u00e9quip\u00e9s en France quoique \u00e9trangers, les dispositions de la loi fran\u00e7aise doivent \u00eatre suivies.

[TRANSLATED]\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nThe principal question to be decided in this case is whether the Ontario Act, 39 Vic., ch. 24,now ch. 162 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, \u201cAn Act to secure uniform conditions in policies of fire insurance,\u201d is ultra vires of the Ontario legislature. Its constitutionality is questioned on the ground that the power of legislating in reference to the subject matter of insurance belongs to the federal parliament, as the necessary sequence of its exclusive power to regulate trade and commerce.\nIn order to ascertain whether there is a conflict of powers, the first step, no doubt, is to examine the character of the law in question. As may be seen from its title, the object of the Act is to secure uniform conditions in policies of fire insurance. The second section enacts that if the conditions of the contract of insurance have not been strictly complied with, it shall not be a sufficient reason to annul the contract, first, where by reason of necessity, accident or mistake, the conditions have not been complied with; secondly, where, after proof of loss has been given in accordance with the conditions of the contract, the company objects to the loss upon other grounds than for imperfect compliance with such conditions; thirdly, where, after having received this proof, the company does not notify, in writing to the assured, within a reasonable time, the reason for which the company considers the proof defective; fourthly, when the court or judge for any other reason considers it inequitable that the insurance should be deemed void by reason of imperfect compliance with such conditions. The third section declares that the conditions set forth in the schedule to the Act shall, as against the insurers, be deemed to be part of every policy of fire insurance, with respect to any property situate in the province of Ontario. These conditions must also be printed on the policy of insurance, with the heading \u201cStatutory Conditions.\u201d The fourth section indicates the manner in which the conditions maybe varied or omitted, or new conditions added, by being printed in a particular way. The fifth section declares that the variations shall not be binding on the assured unless they have been made in conformity with the fourth section. If the contrary is done, the policy shall, as against the assurers, be subject to the statutory conditions only. By the sixth section, it is declared that if any other conditions than the statutory conditions are inserted in the policy, and that the judge of the court declares that they are not just and reasonable, that such conditions shall be null and void. The seventh section allows an appeal from any decision given under the Act.\nThis synopsis of the law shows that it was not intended to do more than to establish the proof to be given in certain cases, and to declare what shall be in the province of Ontario the conditions upon which all contracts of insurance should be subjected to in accordance with the law. These provisions, entirely relating to civil law, do not, in any way, prohibit the commerce of the assurers, neither do they declare that the policies which they insure are null and void. They are just and reasonable conditions, and, in fact, are almost similar to the conditions adopted by the majority of insurance companies. How then can it be said that this legislation in any wise refers to the power of regulating trade and commerce? The subject matter to which it is applicable is the contract of insurance, and does not that belong to the civil law, and does it not come under the jurisdiction; assigned to the provin- ces by paragraph nineteen of section 92 of the British North America Act, \u201cProperty and Civil Rights\u201d?\nNo doubt the contract of insurance is extensively availed of in commerce as well as by non\u2011traders, but the object of a contract does not change its character; whatever may be its object, the contract of insurance is nevertheless a contract of indemnity, which is similar to a contract of guarantee, and, as such, belongs to the civil law. In commerce, contracts of sale, of exchange and bail are constantly employed and executed. Does it follow that any legislation in reference thereto must be considered as being a regulation of commerce? If this be so, if everything which has reference to commerce could for this reason come under the exclusive control of the Federal power, the greater portion of the powers of the provinces would thus become of no avail, for commerce in its most comprehensive meaning extends to everything. It is, as defined by a French author, \u201cCet \u00e9change de produits et de service. C\u2019est en derni\u00e8re analyse le fonds m\u00eame de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\u201d\nIt is evident that this word cannot have in our constitutional Act such an extensive meaning.\nIn order to determine the meaning of these words in the second paragraph of section 91, they should not be read alone, but, on the contrary, they should be taken in connection with the whole of the provisions of the Constitutional Act, in order to arrive at a conclusion conformable to the spirit of the Act and to give effect to all its provisions. The object of the law-giver, in dividing the legislative powers between the Federal power and the provincial legislatures, was, as far as it was possible in the new order of things, to conserve to the latter their autonomy in so far as the civil law peculiar to each province was concerned. We would, however, arrive at a very different conclusion if we held that the words in paragraph two had the comprehensive meaning that they have literally. But it is evident that it would not be interpreting them correctly, as in the following paragraph of the same section their meaning is limited. If it had been the intention to give to this expression, \u201cRegulation of trade and commerce,\u201d such an absolute meaning, why should certain subjects of legislation which certainly come under the power of regulating trade and commerce have been enumerated in the statute, such as navigation, ships and steamers, banks, bills of exchange, promissory notes, insolvency and bankruptcy; all subjects which, without this special enumeration, would be comprised within the power of regulating trade and commerce. The proper conclusion to draw, it seems to me, is that if the general expression in this paragraph did not comprise, according to the Act itself, all that certainly forms part of commerce, it certainly should not comprise a subject-matter which is only indirectly connected with commerce.\nIn the case of Severn v. The Queen,[63] I relied on the definition given by Marshall, C.J., of the words, \u201cRegulation of Commerce,\u201d (which are in the Constitution of the United States,) as follows: \u201cThat is the power to regulate, that is to prescribe, the rule by which commerce is to be governed. This power, like all others vested in Congress, is complete in itself; may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than those which are prescribed by the constitution.\u201d I still adhere to the correctness of this definition. If we take it in its entirety, it is applicable to the question now under consideration, and will help us to solve it. We must, above all, not lose sight of the last words, \u201cand acknowledges no limitations other than those which are prescribed by the constitution.\u201d This restriction indicates that it is in the constitution alone that the limitations of the power to regulate com- merce will be found. After giving this power to the Federal parliament by paragraph 2, section 91, the statute gives to the provinces legislative control over property, civil rights, and matters of a merely local and private nature. This special power, exclusively assigned to the provinces, cannot by the terms of the constitution itself be considered as coming under the power of regulating commerce. The regulation of trade and commerce must necessarily mean something else \u2018than legislation on property and civil rights, subjects which belong exclusively to the local legislature. In exercising its power, the Federal parliament, no doubt, has the right to incidentally entertain these matters which are under the jurisdiction of the provinces, but this power cannot extend any further than to what is just and reasonable and necessary in order to legislate for commercial purposes only. The Federal parliament could not, therefore, under the pretence of legislating on commerce, entirely control a subject matter which comes under the jurisdiction of the provinces. Any legislation having reference to the regulation of commerce must be complete, but it need not necessarily destroy the jurisdiction of the provinces over that part of the subject matter which is not affected by such legislation.\nIf this was not the case, whenever the federal power, in exercise of its authority over commerce, should legislate in such a manner as to indirectly affect property and civil rights, it would follow that all legislation over the subject matter would belong exclusively to the Federal parliament, and the legislative power of the provinces over the same matter would cease to exist. The decision of the Privy Council, in the caseof L\u2019Union St. Jacques v. Belisle[64] has enunciated a principle which, applied: to this case, enables us to reconcile the exercise of their respective powers by the Federal parliament and provincial legislatures. If this construction is not the proper one, what would be the consequence of legislation on the subject of marriage? The Federal Government has jurisdiction over marriage and divorce; the jurisdiction of the provinces is limited to the solemnization of marriage, which means the formalities required previous to marriage. Now the general expression, \u201cmarriage and divorce,\u201d literally interpreted, is susceptible of a very extensive meaning. Could the Federal parliament, in such a case, on the ground that the legislation over marriage is assigned to it, extend its jurisdiction so as to regulate the civil conditions of the contract, such as dower, community of goods, and thus exclude the jurisdiction of the provinces over that portion of the civil law? On the contrary, is it not evident that the Federal parliament should confine its legislation strictly to the conditions which have reference to the capacity or incapacity of contracting marriage, and to reasons for prohibition, and to other conditions relating to the character of that contract, without interfering with the civil rights appertaining thereto. This general expression, in paragraph 26, section 91, \u201cMarriage and Divorce,\u201d gives us another example of the use made in the Constitutional Act of expressions, which must have a limited meaning by the other provisions of the same Act. Cannot the same process of reasoning apply in construing the power of regulating trade and commerce?\nIn order to reconcile the exercise of these powers, I have arrived at the conclusion, in a case such as the one now under consideration, that the provincial jurisdiction is only limited by the exercise by the Federal parliament of its power, in so far as the latter is competent to exercise it, and that the province can still exercise its power over that portion of the subject-matter over which it has jurisdiction, provided the provincial legislation does not directly conflict with the federal legislation. This interpretation seems to be supported by the following authority: \u201cA grant of power to regulate necessarily excludes the action of all others who would perform the same operation on the same thing\u201d[65]. The question, therefore, is, is there any federal legislation on the same subject, same operation on the same thing? It is quite true that the parliament of Canada has passed several statutes relating to insurance companies, prior and subsequent to the law now under consideration, Without wishing to enter into a minute examination of this legislation, upon which I am not at present called upon to decide, I will, however, refer to some of its principal provisions, in order to show that there is no conflict between the federal laws and the statute passed by the legislature of Ontario. The statute 40 Vic., ch. 42, which amends, consolidates and repeals the previous legislation (the first Act being 31 Vic., ch. 48) passed by the Federal parliament, in reference to the subject-matter of insurance, enacts several provisions, the object of which is clearly to protect the public against any loss which might result from companies being irresponsible. The companies to which this legislation applies are first obliged to take out a license, without which they cannot transact any business; they must afterwards deposit in the hands of the Minister of Finance the sum of $100,000 as security for the holders of their policies of insurance. They must also file in the Department of Finance, and also in the offices of the Superior Courts having jurisdiction where they transact business, a copy of their charter of incorporation, as well as a power of attorney, in the form prescribed on the part of the company, to its principal manager, with a declaration that the service of any writ or proceeding against the company can be made at the office of such agent or manager. They must as well furnish complete and detailed statistics of their business, and notify any change with respect to their head office, give notice that they have obtained a license, and also notify when they cease to do business. Special provisions are enacted, with a view of winding up such companies in case of their insolvency. Lastly, they are subject to the inspection and supervision of an inspector, who is given sufficient authority for the carrying out of the provisions of the Act.\nThese provisions it is clear, have nothing whatever to do with respect to the contract of insurance, but are only for the purpose of subjecting the insurer in the exercise of his trade as such, to certain regulations established for the protection of the public. This legislation does not impose any conditions which necessarily form part of the contract.\nWe find, therefore, that the federal legislation does not in anywise affect the nature of the contract of insurance, nor the conditions forming part of such contract, and that the legislation of Ontario, now under consideration, deals exclusively with that subject,\u2014both legislations deriving their respective powers from different sources, the first from the power of regulating trade and commerce, and the other from their power of legislating over civil rights and property. Why, if the provisions of these laws are neither conflicting nor antagonistic to one another, can we not hold that both are constitutional? I must confess that I see between them no conflict, and I see no obstacle to their being carried into operation. This view of the case is supported by the following authority[66]: So, if a State, in passing laws on subjects acknowledged to be within its control, and with a view to those subjects, shall adopt a measure of the same character, with one which Congress may adopt, it does not derive its authority from the particular power which has been granted, but from the other which remains with the State, and may be executed by the same means. All experience shows that the same measures, or measures scarcely distinguishable from each other, may flow from distinct powers; but this does not prove that the powers themselves are identical. Although the means used in their execution may sometimes approach each other so nearly as to be confounded, there are other situations in which they are sufficiently distinct to establish their individuality.\nAlthough it is possible to thus reconcile these legislations, is it not evident, however, that the Act passed by the legislature of Ontario, relating exclusively to the proof to be made in case of loss, and to the nature of the conditions of contracts of insurance effected in the province of Ontario, is intra vires? for the issuing of a policy of insurance is not necessarily a commercial transaction; it is certainly not one on the part of the assured, although, by the Civil Code of the province of Quebec, it is a commercial transaction on the part of the assurer. Pardessus, Droit Commercial, says:\nElles (les conventions d\u2019assurance) ne sont pas par leur nature des actes de commerce de la part de ceux qui se font assurer. Mais comme presque toujours de la part de ceux qui assurent, elles sont de v\u00e9ritables sp\u00e9culations., c\u2019est sous ce point de vue que nous les consid\u00e9rons comme actes de commerce et que nous avons cru devoir en faire conna\u00eetre les principes.\nIt is the same in England; insurance is a commercial transaction, although the contract of insurance itself forms part of the civil law. In our constitutional Act I cannot find anywhere that commercial law is under the jurisdiction of the Dominion; it seems to me, on the contrary, that the Act, by assigning specifically to the Dominion legislative control over a part of the commercial law, such as any law on navigation, banking, bills of exchange, promissory notes and insolvency, has left the residue to the jurisdiction of the several provinces as coining under the head \u201ccivil law.\u201d In this view of the case, the Act now under consideration would derive its authority from the power of the provinces to legislate on civil rights. It is on this principle that the case of Paul v. Virginia[67] was decided. A law passed by the State of Virginia enacted that insurance companies, not having been incorporated under the laws of the state, could not transact any business within the limits of the state without previously taking out a license and depositing a certain sum as security for the rights of the assured. The plaintiff contended that the law was unconstitutional, because it was contrary to the power of Congress to regulate trade and commerce. Mr. Justice Field, who delivered the judgment of the court, makes use of the following language:\u2014\nIssuing a policy of insurance is not a transaction of commerce. The policies are simply contracts of indemnity against loss by fire, entered into between the corporation and the assured for a consideration paid by the latter.\nAccording to this decision, the legislature of Ontario had power to pass the law in question as being a part of civil law.\nBut there is also another argument which I consider conclusive; it is, as will be seen hereafter, the recognition by the Federal parliament of the right of the local legislatures to legislate on this subject. Although, by paragraph 11 of section 92, power is given to the provinces to incorporate companies for provincial objects, it has, however, been contended that these words are not sufficient to comprise the power to incorporate insurance companies. It seems to me, however, that the terms are sufficiently comprehensive to include insurance companies. If it is objected that the object of an insurance company is not provincial in the sense that its object has not an interest for the whole province, that is to say, a public interest, I answer by saying that the object is to transact business throughout the province. This must be the interpretation to be given to these words, if they are to have any signification whatever. They certainly would have no meaning whatever, if they were interpreted as giving the power only of incorporating companies having a public provincial interest. Such an interpretation would be equivalent to saying that the Government could delegate its functions to corporations, and have them exercised by them, and that they have no power to incorporate companies for the purpose of commerce, industry, trade, &c., &c. They certainly have., in my opinion, that power, provided the companies thus incorporated limit their operations within the limits of such province. If they desire to go outside of the province, they come under the provisions of the federal law, to which they must conform, and which contains special provisions for such event. This power of incorporating companies, exercised by the legislature of Ontario, has been recognized by federal legislation, as belonging to provincial legislatures. Sec. 28 of 40 Vic., c. 42, enacts:\u2014\nThis Act shall not apply to any company within the exclusive control of any one of the provinces of Canada, unless such company so desires, and it shall be lawful for any such company to avail itself of the provisions of this Act, and if it do so avail itself, such company shall have the power of transacting its business of insurance throughout Canada.\nThe first section of this Act makes the laws respecting insolvency applicable to insurance companies incorporated by the parliament of Canada, as well as to those incorporated prior to and after Confederation, by the legislature of any province now constituting Canada. We also find in the 30th section of the same Act another recognition of the power of the provinces to legislate on the subject of insurance. Doubts having been raised as to the validity of a certain Ontario statute relating to mutual insurance companies, this section of the Federal Act declares that only such provisions as are within the jurisdiction of the Federal parliament are repealed. In this section there is not only the formal recognition of this power in the province, but there is also this important declaration, that the Act repeals only that part of its provisions involving a conflict of power. It is a formal admission that this subject-matter, when treated in its commercial aspect, is within the control of the Federal parliament, whilst, when regarded as relating to civil rights, such as involve the form and nature of the conditions of insurance, it remains under the control of the provincial legislature. This also confirms the opinion above stated, as to the restrictions which the Federal and provincial governments must impose upon themselves in the exercise of their respective powers, in order to keep within the limits of their jurisdiction. It is true that the exercise of a power would not be a sufficient reason, in many cases, for declaring that it legally exists, but in a case such as the one now under consideration, where there are cogent reasons for exercising this power in a limited manner, as it has been by 40 Vic., ch. 42, recognizing the power of the provinces, which seems equally well founded, we may fairly presume that the accord of both legislatures to keep themselves within the limit of their respective powers, was for the purpose of exercising such powers as properly belonged to them respectively. The most important public departments, such as the Department of Justice, and the Department of Finance, have for some years past adopted this view of the law, by seeing that the requirements of the several federal laws relating to insurance were strictly complied with. Such; an interpretation could not prevail, no doubt, against a judicial decision, but, in the absence of the latter, the interpretation given by the departments must have great weight Story thus speaks of the value of the same[68]:\nAnd, after all, the most unexceptional source of collateral interpretation is from the practical exposition of the Government itself, and its various departments, upon particular questions discussed and settled upon their own single merits. These approach the nearest in their own nature to judicial exposition, and have the same general recommendation that belongs to the latter.\nThis departmental interpretation has been acted upon for several years; the license fees have been collected, statistics have been furnished without any contention on the part of the provinces, and the power exercised in virtue of the law of Ontario was not contested by the Federal Government, who had the authority to disallow the Act had they considered it ultra vires. When both Governments are in accord, and in order to dispel any doubts specially legislate, would it not be unwise to substitute another interpretation than theirs? If there is any doubt on the matter, it seems to me to have been settled by legislative interpretation, and all the tribunals have to do is to conform themselves thereto. Thus, besides the reasons I have given above in favor of the law of Ontario, there is also in its favor administrative interpretation and legislative interpretation. If I do not add judicial exposition of the Ontario Courts, it is because their decisions are being appealed from; but it is, nevertheless, of the greatest weight, as it has been the unanimous opinion of all the judges who have been called upon to pronounce upon this question. In addition to this we have this decision supported by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Paul v. Virginia. Besides the question raised as to the constitutionality of the Act, the company (appellant) contends that, because it has been incorporated by the parliament of Great Britain, it is not subject to the provisions of the Act now under consideration. Whatever may be the origin of the corporation, whether they owe their existence to the parliament of the Dominion or to the provincial legislatures, or to a foreign power, they are nevertheless in the one case as the other, subject, in order to exercise their franchise, to the conditions which may be imposed upon them by the laws of the country where they desire to exercise such franchise. These corporations are in reality only commercial associations, which only differ from ordinary commercial partnerships as to the limited liability of the members thereof. The federal statute which I have cited, by the first section, treats them as ordinary associations of individuals transacting insurance business. These corporations cannot, any more than other associations, set themselves above the law, to which they are obliged to conform. Our large commercial houses, which have branch houses in the different provinces of the Dominion as well as in foreign countries, have never for a moment pretended that they could set themselves above the laws of the provinces or countries in which they carry on business, and claim that they should be subject only to the laws in force at their principal place of business. Whatever, may be the inconvenience, are they not obliged in all their contracts to conform themselves to the laws of the country where they carry on business? It would, no doubt, be much simpler and more advantageous for insurance companies, to have the power of determining themselves their conditions and to impose them in all countries where they would open offices. Would this not be putting them above the law? Far from recognizing that they have such privileges, numerous authorities and judicial decisions agree to the contrary. This point has already been decided in the case of Paul v. Virginia, already cited, in which Mr. Justice Field says:\nA recognition of its existence (corporation) even by the other States, and the enforcement of its contracts made therein, depend greatly on the comity of those States, a comity which is never extended when the existence of the corporation or the exercise of its power is prejudicial to their intent or repugnant to their interest. They may exclude this foreign corporation, they may restrict its \u2018 business to particular localities, or they may exact security for the performance of its contracts with their citizens, as in their judgment will best promote the public interest.\nIt is hardly necessary to cite authorities on this point, as it is only the application of the elementary rule \u201clocus regit actum\u201d I will cite, however, the following, as it contains the opinion of the author of the \u201cTrait\u00e9 du droit de la nature et des gens\u201d:\nLorsque la police est applicable \u00e0 des navires arm\u00e9s et equip\u00e9s en France quoique \u00e9trangers les disposition de la loi fran\u00e7aise doivent \u00eatre suivies. La cour de Cassation a eu occasion d\u2019examiner cette question et l\u2019a r\u00e9solue dans ce sens. Merlin qui rapporte cet arr\u00eat l\u2019approuve.\n\u201cSur cette question,\u201d disait Mr. Daniels, organe du minist\u00e8re public, \u201crien n\u2019est plus constant que le principe invoqu\u00e9 par les demandeurs et d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 par Puffendorf: Quiconque passe un contrat dans les terres d\u2019un souverain, se soumet au loi du pays et devient en quelque mani\u00e8re, sujet passager de cet \u00e9tat[69].\u201d\nThe company (appellant) also contends that their conditions being in substance similar to the statutory conditions, they may avail themselves of the statutory conditions, and yet not comply with the requirements imposed by the statute; that is to say, in my opinion, because they have evaded the law, they should have the same right as though they had complied with it. It seems to me clear that when a company does not have the statutory conditions printed, as prescribed by sec. 4, the third section provides that they may form part of the policy \u201cas against the insurers,\u201d leaving it optional to the insured to take advantage of them or not, the insurance then being subject to such conditions as result from the law bearing on the subject of contract of insurance. I do not presume here to discuss this point, as it has been so often before the Courts of Ontario, and as the large majority of the judges have given their opinion in favor of this construction of the Act. It is sufficient for me to say that I entirely concur with the opinion expressed by the learned C.J. Moss on this point, in the cases now before us.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that these appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nSeveral important questions were raised and argued in this case, not the least of which was that as to the constitutionality of the Act of Ontario, which provides for conditions in policies for fire insurance such as that which is now contested by the appellants. I have considered that subject, and have arrived at the conclusion that the Act is intra vires. It is contended that, inasmuch \u201cas the regulation of trade and commerce,\u201d by the 91st section of the British North America Act, is specifically given to the parliament of Canada, there is no power in a local legislature to regulate by enactment the rights of insurers and those they insure against loss or damage by fire. It is also contended that, if it be not so, the local legislature might, by the imposition of conditions and restrictions, frustrate the object of a company chartered, or incorporated by, or under, an Imperial Act, as is the case with the appellant\u2019s company, or by or under an Act of the parliament of Canada. The contention may or may not be well founded, but local legislation has not yet reached that point, and besides, the settlement either way cannot, I think, affect the main question. If it ever does, it will be time enough to deal with that position when it arises. If the power to regulate the matters in question be with the local legislature, it is not easy to find the authority to question, control, or limit the exercise of it.\nWe must construe the words of sec. 91, which I have quoted, by the whole Act, and the several important objects in view, and be governed by what is intended by it. The regulation of trade and commerce is a very comprehensive, but, at the same time, a very indefinite and vague term, and, if construed in its comprehensive meaning, would include a great variety of subjects which we find specifically added in the list of subjects given to the parliament of Canada, such, for example, as \u201cbeacons, buoys, lighthouses,\u2019\u2019 \u201cnavigation and shipping,\u201d \u201cQuarantine and establishment of marine hospitals,\u201d \u201cCurrency and coinage,\u201d \u201cBanking, incorporation of banks, and the issue of paper money,\u201d \u201cBills of exchange and promissory notes,\u201d \u201cInterest,\u201d \u201cLegal tender,\u201d \u201cBankruptcy and insolvency,\u201d and others. From this it may be fairly assumed the term was used in some generic, but, at the same time, qualified sense, and not intended to apply to the regulation of trade and commerce in regard to all subjects that may be found to contribute to the one or the other. The operations of manufacturers, the hiring of their operatives, the providing and erection of machinery, procuring the raw materials used by them, with the necessary contracts and agreements and expenditure of labor employed, and the interests of all parties engaged, from the owner of the soil through all the train of persons engaged in producing and supplying lumber, iron or other materials for manufacturing purposes, may all be said to be intimately connected with trade and commerce, and be included in the gen- eral term used, and if they were not shown by the whole Act and its objects to be excepted, we might possibly conclude them to have been intentionally included. The matters just referred to all tend to contribute to and create trade and commerce; but a Fire Insurance Company may operate, as they do in some cases, only in respect of agricultural buildings, which but very remotely have any effect on the trade and commerce of the country. If organized for local operation, we find, by number eleven of the list of subjects given to the local legislatures, the charters are to be granted by them. \u201cThe incorporation of companies with provincial objects\u201d are the words used. But apart from these considerations, \u201cProperty and civil rights in the province\u201d being within the power of the local legislatures, we must determine the extent to which, if any, the power to deal with them is necessarily restrained, and what limitation of them the British parliament intended to provide in reference to the exercise of it, by giving to parliament \u201cThe regulation of trade and commerce.\u201d\nAs I have before said, we must construe the whole Act together, and so as to give effect, if possible, to every part of it, and reconcile and ascertain what seeming contradictions the British Act contains.\nFrom the pecular distribution of the legislative powers, and the mode adopted, it was a difficult undertaking to legislate so as to prevent difficulties arising, but they are to be properly resolved only by keeping prominently in view the leading objects intended to be provided for. Looking only at number 26 in the list contained in section 91, and finding the words \u201cMarriage and Divorce,\u201d we would at once conclude that those words included everything with respect to those subjects; but in number 12 of section 92 we find \u201cThe solemnization of Marriage in the province\u201d is expressly given to the local legislatures. No doubt can be entertained that, considering both provisions, notwithstanding any other provision of the Act, the intention was to give the power to regulate the solemnization of marriage to the local legislatures. I admit that the two cases are not exactly alike, but still it shows no one part of the Act should be alone looked at.\nThe incorporation of fire insurance companies with provincial objects being given to the local legislatures, they can, as to them, prescribe conditions and terms for the conduct of the business, and regulate the rights of the companies and those dealing with them. With the power to deal with the whole subject of property, real and personal, and civil rights, and the right to prescribe and regulate as just stated, in respect of the incorporation of companies with provincial objects, it would be unreasonable to conclude they were intended to have no power to apply the same, or similar conditions, to the dealings of other companies chartered outside. It would be, I think, improper to conclude that the Imperial Parliament, in the use of the words \u201cthe regulation of trade and commerce,\u201d in the peculiar connection in which we find them, could have intended them to apply, not only to the regulation of trade and commerce, as generally understood, but to all trading and commercial contracts, so as to limit the operation of the provision giving specifically the subject of property and civil rights to the local legislatures.\nIf once decided that contracts for fire insurance are necessarily beyond the powers of the local legislatures, where can a line be drawn to save to them the power to legislate touching the wages and contracts connected with manufactories, mercantile transactions, or others, or in respect to liens on personal estate, in the shape of stocks of goods, or to mercantile shops or warehouses.\nThe words of a statute, unless the context shows otherwise, or they have a technical meaning, are to be construed according to their well understood and accustomed meaning. \u201cTrade\u201d means the act or business of exchanging commodities by barter, or the business of\u2019 buying and selling for money\u2014commerce\u2014traffic\u2014barter; it means the giving of one article for another for money or money\u2019s worth. \u201cCommerce\u201d is only another term for the same thing. Neither of the terms includes the rules of law by which parties engaged in trade or commerce are bound to each other, but when their regulation is given to a legislative body, it must be assumed the intention was that control in some respects was to be exercised, but to what extent, we must judge in this case by taking the whole Act into consideration. I have no doubt that the Dominion parliament has power to enact general regulations in regard to trade and commerce, but not to interfere with the powers of the local legislatures in the matter of local contracts, amongst which is properly included policies of insurance against loss by fire on property in the same province.\n\u201cTo regulate\u201d trade may remotely affect some of the conditions and terms under which articles are produced, but not necessarily so; and the regulation of it may consist only in rules governing the disposition of sale of goods, or may include conditions under which goods are manufactured, by which they become liable to duty. The term or expression \u201cRegulation of trade and commerce\u201d cannot, under the Imperial Act, be construed to extend to and include contracts for the erection, purchase, or renting of warehouses, manufactories, or shops used for trading or commercial purposes.\nIn some of the cases I have put, trade and commerce would be regulated. In the others they might be affected, but only incidentally, by the laws regulating contracts; nor is it, I think, at all necessary under the Act, that they should be construed to regulate contracts. This view is in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, in Paul v. Virginia[70], cited in this case by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, and which, in the absence of English authorities, I feel at liberty to adopt.\nI was of the majority of this Court who decided against the constitutionality of the Act of Ontario under which the case of Severn and The Queen came before us; but that case was essentially different from this, as will appear by a comparison of my reasons in the two cases.\nHaving disposed of the first, and, in several respects, the most important point, I will briefly consider what conditions attached to the insurance by the terms of the interim receipt, upon which the action in this case was brought.\nThe legislature having enacted that all policies should be subject to certain prescribed conditions, which were required to be printed on them (except where variations were appended in the manner prescribed), a question is raised how such legislation affects insurances created by the usual interim receipts, which provide that the conditions of the particular company, which differ from the statutory ones, shall be applicable. The legislature has virtually said that unless the prescribed conditions are printed as directed on the policy, there shall be, in fact, none in the interest or for the benefit of the company; but, although not so printed, they may be invoked by and for the insured, and \u201cshall, as against the insurers, be deemed to be part of every policy of fire insurance.\u201d\nThe statute thus plainly negatives the right of the insurers to invoke the conditions unless printed on the policy as it requires. \u201cWhether in the case of an insurance by an interim receipt referring to conditions different from the statutory ones, by which the insurers are shown to ignore the enactment altogether, they can set up any condition at variance with the statutory ones, or invoke the latter, is a question that, in my view of the meaning of the statutes, should be resolved against them.\nThey are not justified in inserting in a policy any condition at variance with the statutory ones, and any such, for that reason, could not be a defence, and, being in that position, they cannot invoke the latter, for they are only to be deemed to be part of the policy, as against them, and not in their favor. If, therefore, that is the result, it has arisen because they have ignored the statutory provisions which they were bound by, and in departing from which they must be held to have, by their own act, become amenable to the consequences.\nI entirely concur in the observations made by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, in the second paragraph of his judgment in this case, and think it is the duty of courts to enforce obedience to the laws, and not to give the benefit of a provision to parties who, by their overt and deliberate acts, have violated it. After the enactment, companies should have changed their interim receipts, and made the reference in them to the statutory conditions, or to them with the variations and additions, as they might desire; but to make reference to conditions in opposition to the statute, is what they were clearly not justified in doing.\nThe amendment in the declaration as to the allegation of the time for making the claim was virtually made by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench and sanctioned by the Court of Appeal, so that the declaration may be considered in that respect as in conformity with the statut- ory condition; and the proof was given as therein provided.\nOn a careful examination of the evidence I have arrived at this conclusion:\u2014\nAlthough the statutory conditions could not be invoked by the appellants, the first of them\u2014providing for the avoiding of the policy in case of misrepresentation or omissions to communicate circumstances material to be known to the company\u2014is supplied by the law otherwise, and is applicable to the question of other existing insurances not notified. The pleas alleging the other insurances in the \u201cCanada Farmer\u2019s Insurance Company\u201d and the \u201cCanada Fire and Marine Insurance Company\u201d are not proved, for it is clearly shown that the policies of those two companies were on goods different from those covered by the interim receipt herein.\nAlthough in the view I take of the law, it is not necessary for me to refer to the matter of the gunpowder, I may say that I agree with the ruling that the verdict of the jury should settle the point as to the quantity of it. It was the only one in regard to which there was conflicting evidence and which became necessary to be found by the jury. I think the evidence abundantly warranted that finding, and that under it the appellant is shown not to have a greater quantity than he was justified in having by the statutory condition relating thereto, if it were applicable. I am of the opinion there is nothing in any of the other pleas which requires special notice. I think the respondent is entitled to recover the amount claimed, and that the judgments appealed from should be confirmed and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nSince this judgment was prepared in December last, I heard very attentively the argument of other cases on the constitutionality of two Acts\u2014one of the Dominion parliament, the other of the Act under consideration in this case; but have heard nothing to induce me to change my views, but, on the contrary, much to sustain them.\nSince judgments were delivered in the Queen v. the City of Fredericton, I lighted upon a judgment of the Privy Council, which sustains the views I therein enunciated as well as those in my present judgment.\nIn Ingram v. Drinkwater[71], it was held, as by the head note, that although the words of the statute\u2014\nWere large enough to include a rent charge in lieu of tithes, they would not necessarily do so if it appeared from the general wording of the Act that it was not intended to apply to incorporeal rights.\nThe doctrine, as laid down by the Court, is thus stated:\u2014\nIt is clear that, under the 6th section of the Act of 1860, the rate can only be laid on property legally liable to be included in the valuation under the 2nd section, and the only words in that section, or throughout the Act, which the respondent relies upon to make the amount paid to the vicar rateable, are the words \u201creal estate,\u201d which, doubtless, are large enough to comprehend it, if intended to do so, but which have not necessarily that effect unless so intended; and looking to the collocation of those words in the different sections, as well as to the whole frame and general wording of the Act, their Lordships are of opinion that the rating powers were not intended to include or apply to the amounts payable to the appellant, and others similarly circumstanced.\nCitizens\u2019 Insurance Co. v. Parsons.\nThis is an action on a policy of insurance made after the passing of the Act of the legislature of Ontario, 39 Vic., ch. 24, and the policy did not contain the conditions as required by that Act.\nThe same questions are raised here as in the case of the Queen Insurance Company v. Parsons, decided this term: first, as to the constitutionality of the Act, and, secondly, as to the consequence of a company ignoring, the Act, and inserting conditions different from those prescribed by it. I have given, in my judgment in that case, my views on both subjects, and, in accordance with those views, I have now only to say that, in my opinion, the Act in question was not ultra vires, and that, as the appellants inserted conditions in the policy contrary to its provisions, they cannot set them up as any answer to the respondent\u2019s action.\nThe insertion of the conditions in the manner and substance adopted being virtually prohibited by the statute, no effect can be given to them in favor of the insurers. They cannot invoke the aid or benefit of the statutory conditions, because they did not obey the statute by inserting them. They undertook to make a contract in terms forbidden by the statute, and must take the consequences of a refusal of the Courts to ratify their attempt to evade the statutory provisions. Such conditions being prohibited, neither party is bound by them. Had it not been so, the respondent could have bound himself by any conditions agreed upon. But the legislature having, for, I have no doubt, wise objects, interposed and provided the only means of escape from the statutory conditions, which is by the insertion of them in full, and appending, in a prescribed manner, Variations or additions, the conditions otherwise made are void in every respect. The legal course not having been pursued, we can substitute nothing in its stead. Such is the result, so far as I am able to determine and declare it. In so declaring it, I must not be understood as declaring that the policy is threfore free of all conditions, for the general principles applicable to all contracts still remain. My decision and remarks are only intended to apply to peculiar conditions, added to the ordinary implied ones, by insurance companies in their policies.\nThe appellants contend that, as their company was incorporated by the Dominion parliament, they cannot be reached or affected by a local Act. That contention has been well answered in the judgments appealed from. If, as I have considered, the local legislature had the right to regulate fire insurance contracts, in common with others, it matters little where the mere corporate existence is created. By the comity of nations and countries, companies chartered in one country are acknowledged in others, but, at the same time, foreign companies must carry on their affairs and business, and be guided and governed by the local laws of all countries in which such affairs and business are carried on.\nThe issues tendered by the only pleas brought to our notice become, for the reasons given, immaterial, and are therefore no answer to the action of the respondent. Those pleas are founded, according to my views, on illegal conditions in the policy, and the breach of them cannot, therefore, be alleged as a ground of defence.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed, and the previous judgments affirmed, with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI do not concur in the judgment of the Court in these cases, and I proceed to state the grounds upon which I dissent.\nThe Citizens\u2019 Insurance Company of Canada, known in the first instance under an Act of the late province of Canada (19 and 20 Vic., ch. 124, 1856), as the Canada Marine Insurance Company, later under 27 and 28 Vic., ch. 98, 1864, as the Citizens\u2019 Insurance and Investment Company, and now, under its present name, by an Act of the Dominion parliament, 39 Vic.,ch. 55, (1876) has obtained from the Federal authority, by this last statute, the right to make and effect contracts of insurance upon such conditions, and under such modifications and restrictions, as might be bargained or agreed upon by and between the company and the persons contracting with them for such insurances. By chapter 162 of its revised statutes, the Ontario legislature has virtually revoked this power which this company held from the federal authority, and repealed the enactment of the Dominion Act under which the said company held this power, for a law repugnant to another, as entirely repeals that other as if express terms of repeal were used. It has said to this company: \u201cThe Federal authority has given you the right to make such contracts as you pleased, but we revoke that grant, we repeal pro tanto the Dominion statute under which you hold it, and hereafter you shall not contract except under the conditions we impose upon you.\u201d\nHad the Ontario legislature, under the British North America Act, the power to do so? or, to put the question in another shape: Had the Dominion parliament the right to pass the 39 Vic., ch. 55, under which the company (appellant) claims the right to issue its policies under such conditions as they please? For it must be admitted that, under the British North America Act, there can be no concurrent jurisdiction in the matter between the Federal and the local legislative authorities, and that if the Dominion parliament had the power to so authorize the said company to issue its policies under such conditions as it pleased, and to enact the said 39 Vic., ch. 55, the local legislature had not the power to revoke this authorization or to repeal the said Act. It would be a strange state of things indeed if the local legislatures could repeal an Act passed by the Dominion parliament. They cannot do it either expressly or impliedly. They cannot by their legislation render nugatory the enactments of the Federal legislative power on subjects left under the control of the said Federal legislative power by the British North America Act.\nAre these statutes, the Federal Act creating the company (appellant) and the Ontario Act imposing conditions on its policies of insurance, regulations of trade and commerce? If they are, it follows that the Federal Act is constitutional and the Ontario Act unconstitutional. I am of opinion that both of these statutes are regulations on commercial corporations and commercial operations, and the words \u201cregulation of trade and commerce\u201d in sec. 91 of the British North America Act, mean \u201call regulations on all the branches of trade and commerce.\u201d Indeed, a contrary interpretation would be against the very letter of the Act. We cannot, it seems to me, find restrictions and limitations where the words used by the law-giver are so clear and general. That companies doing the business of insurance are commercial companies, and that their operations are of a commercial nature, admits of no doubt in my opinion. In one of the provinces (Quebec) a special article of its civil code (2,470) distinctly says so, and in that same province, so far back as 1835, long before the civil code, the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, in Montreal, composed of Valli\u00e8re, Rolland and Day, J.J, in a case of Smith v Irvine[72], held that the insuring against fire by an insurance company is a commercial transaction.\nSo it is held to be in France:\nCette enterprise, supposant l\u2019existence d\u2019un \u00e9tablissement et de bureaux ouverts a quiconque voudra se faite assurer, et un ensemble d\u2019op\u00e9rations faites clans l\u2019espoir des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices qui doivent en r\u00e9sulter pr\u00e9sente tous les caract\u00e8res d\u2019une sp\u00e9culation et. constitute une v\u00e9ritable enterprise commerciale.\nLes Compagnies d\u2019assurance \u00e0 prime font \u00e9videmment des actes de commerce en souscrivant des polices d\u2019assurance, puisqu\u2019elles font profession de vendre la garantie \u00e0 laquelle elles s\u2019obligent, et qu\u2019elles ne contractent qu\u2019en vue de profit qu\u2019elles esp\u00e8rent retirer de leurs operations[73].\n*** L\u2019assurance \u00e0 prime contre l\u2019incendie \u00e9tant de la m\u00eame nature que l\u2019assurance maritime est r\u00e9put\u00e9e acte de commerce. Dalloz avait d\u2019abord \u00e9mis un sentiment contraire qu\u2019apr\u00e8s nouvel examen il a cru devoir abandonner[74].\nIn Prussia, Belgium, Portugal, Spain, Holland and Wurtemburg, whose codes I have been able to refer to, the contract of insurance against fire is also held to be a commercial contract. Why should it be considered otherwise in England, the emporium of trade and commerce, where the amount of business done by these fire companies is so large? Not a single authority has been cited at the Bar tending to show that there they are not considered as commercial companies, or that their operations are not considered as commercial operations, and I have not been able to find any. On the contrary, if I open Roman\u2019s Cyclop\u0153dia of Commerce, or Mac Gregor\u2019s Commercial Statistics, or McCulloch\u2019s Commercial Dictionary, I find these companies and their contracts treated of as falling under the commercial operations and the commercial law of England. In Stephen\u2019s Commentaries[75], an insurer is spoken of as a party \u201ccarrying on\u201d a general trade or \u201cbusiness of insurance.\u201d\nIn Levis\u2019 Manual of Mercantile Law[76], Joint Stock Companies are said to be under the Commercial Law of England, and at paragraph 230, of the same book, I find a chapter on these insurance companies as falling within the Mercantile Law. So in Smith\u2019s Mercantile Law, and in Chitty\u2019s Commercial and General Lawyer. And Lord Mansfield, in Carter v. Bohem[77], says that \u201cInsurance is a contract upon speculation.\u201d I also remark that this case was tried before a special jury merchants, yet it was not a case of maritime insurance.\nI really cannot see on what grounds, under the English Law, a Fire Insurance Company can be said to be a non-commercial corporation. It is commercial, it seems to me, for the same reasons that make it so in France and the rest of Europe, that is to say, because it is a company doing the business of speculation on risks and hazards, because it trades on its contracts of indemnity, because it does the business of selling that indemnity. It is as commercial as the contract of maritime insurance, the character of which admits of no doubt[78], and in which, as in the contract of fire insurance, there is nothing but a contract of indemnity[79]. And is not maritime insurance a commercial contract, whether it is a pleasure yacht, a man\u2011of\u2011war, a ship engaged in a scientific expedition, or a merchant vessel that is insured? Then if so, how can it be contended that fire insurance is a commercial contract only when it is made on goods and merchandize, and not commercial when made, say, on a building? As in maritime insurance, it is not from the nature of the thing insured that the transaction derives its character, but from the fact that the insurer does the business, speculation or trade of insurance; so, for, instance, with the contract of sale, which is not commercial of its essence, but becomes commercial, not from the nature of the article sold, but because the seller does a business of selling that article. What is trade? Trade is an occupation, employment or business carried on for gain or profit. Now, do these Fire Insurance Companies carry on a business for gain or profit? To ask the question is to answer it. They are trading corporations, and trading corporations are commercial corporations[80]. In the United States, as in England, this seems uncontroverted. In Angell & Ames on Corporations, insurance companies are classified among commercial corporations. In Parson\u2019s Mercantile Law and Bryant & Stralton\u2019s Commercial Law, fire insurance is treated of as forming part of the commercial law. In the Civil Code of Louisiana, the contract of insurance was entirely left out, to form part of the Code of Commerce, which it was then intended to promulgate.\nBut great stress is laid by the respondent on the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Paul v. Virginia[81], where Field, J., said that issuing a policy of insurance is not a transaction of commerce. Well, I may first remark that this case is not binding on this Court; then, a reference to the report shows that this is simply an obiter dictum of Mr. Justice Field, and that the gist of the decision in that case is merely, that insurance business done by a New York Company, in the State of Virginia, does not fall within the meaning of the clause of the constitution, which declares that Congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States. Mr. Justice Field himself, in Pensacola Telegraph Co. v. Western Telegraph Co.[82], explained what he said in Paul v. Virginia as follows:\u2014\nIn other words, the Court held that the power of Congress to regulate commerce was not affected by the fact that such commerce was carried on by corporations) but that a contract of insurance made by a corporation of one State upon property in another State was not a transaction of inter-state commerce. It would have been outside of the case for the Court to have expressed an opinion as to the power of Congress to authorize a foreign corporation to do business in a State upon the assumption that issuing a policy of insurance was a commercial transaction. So that this case of Paul v. Virginia, it seems to me, has no application whatever here. The relative positions of the parliament of the Dominion of Canada, and the legislatures of the various provinces, are so entirely different from those of Congress and the legislatures of the several States, that all decisions from the United States Supreme Court, though certainly always entitled to great consideration, must be referred to here with great caution. There the right to regulate commerce in the State is given to the State, not to the Federal power. Here, as said by Mr. Justice Strong, in Severn v. The Queen[83]: \u201cThat the regulation of trade and commerce in the provinces, domestic and internal, as well as foreign and external, is by the British North America Act conferred upon the parliament of the Dominion, calls for no demonstration, for the language of the Act is explicit.\u2019\u2019 I might also remark that, whilst in the United States constitution, the word \u201ccommerce\u201d only is used; ours has the words \u201ctrade and commerce\u201d Some law dictionaries give the word \u201ctrade\u201d as meaning \u201cinternal commerce,\u201d whilst the word commerce would refer to foreign intercourse. But this appears to be a fanciful distinction, not recognized either in common parlance or in legal language. In either one or the other, the expressions: \u201cthe trade with the West Indies, with the United States * * * the foreign trade,\u201d &c., are of every day use, and therefore, in the interpretation of the Imperial Act, we cannot hold, it seems to me, that the word \u201ctrade\u201d has been added to the word \u201ccommerce\u201d simply to mean \u201cinternal commerce.\u201d Leaving it out of the Act, the internal commerce of the Dominion would remain as it is\u2014under the control of the federal power. Every word of the Act must have its due force and appropriate meaning, and the Imperial parliament, which, no doubt, whilst creates) ing a federal union among its North American possessions, had before its eyes the constitution of the United States, must have intended by adding this word \u201ctrade\u201d to the word \u201ccommerce\u201d to give to our federal authority supreme power, not only over the commerce, internal as well as external, but also over the trade of the whole Dominion, internal as well as external. Of course we are not called upon to give a general definition of this word \u201ctrade\u201d as used in the Act. In the interpretation of the constitution, general definitions are to be avoided. In this case, all that is; necessary to determine is, whether the word embraces insurance; companies and their contracts, and, in my opinion, it does.\nTo revert to the case of Paul v. Virginia, the obiter dictum of Mr. Justice Field, \u201cthat issuing a policy of insurance is not a transaction of commerce,\u201d seems tome nothing but a truism. In the same sense, as I have remarked before, it may be said that making a contract of sale is not a transaction of commerce. It is the fact of a person or corporation, making a business of selling and buying, or of issuing policies insurance, which gives to the contract of sale, or the contract of insurance, and the seller or insurer, a commercial character. It is in accordance with this principle that the Civil Code of Lower Canada, art. 2,470 to which I have already referred, says that fire insurances, are not by their nature commercial, but that they are so when made for a premium by persons carrying on the business of insurers.\nSo it is with the telegraphing business; for example, sending a message by telegraph is not a transaction of commerce, yet, telegraph companies inter-States, and the right to regulate them, are held in the United States to be under the federal power as a part of commerce, and this, though a very large proportion, of the telegraphic mes- sages have nothing to do with commerce at all[84]. With us, on the same principle, telegraph business would also be exclusively under federal control, if the British North America Act did not expressly vest in the local legislatures, the control over local and provincial lines as long as the Federal parliament does not declare them to be for the general advantage of Canada.\nAgainst the decision of Paul v. Virginia, in the United Stales, a decision in our own Courts can be cited. I refer to Attorney General v. The Queen Insurance Co.[85], in which Mr. Justice Torrance in the Superior Court at Montreal, and the five judges of the Court of Appeal, unanimously held, that a license tax on policies of insurance was a regulation of trade and commerce, and, as such, under the British North America Act, ultra vires of the provincial legislatures. This decision seems to me in point. The case was carried to the Privy Council, and the judgment of the Quebec Courts was confirmed without hearing the respondents. However, the Privy Council disposed of it without deciding whether the provincial License Act on insurance policies was a matter falling within the words \u201cregulation of trade and commerce\u201d of the British North America Act. It may, nevertheless, be remarked, that their Lordships in their judgment, after saying that the price of a license to a trader is usually ascertained by the amount of his trade, add, referring to the license imposed by the Quebec legislature on insurance policies, \u201cthis is not a payment depending in that sense on the amount of trade previously done by the trader,\u201d calling insurance business a \u201ctrade\u201d and insurance companies \u201ctraders.\u201d The report of this case in the Jurist is very incomplete. I have referred to the case containing the note of all the Judges in the Quebec Courts at length, as filed before the Privy Council. The judgment of the Privy Council is to be found in L.R. 3 App. Cases 1090.\nI will now refer to the statutes in which the legislative authority of the Dominion has exercised its jurisdiction over Insurance companies, or expressed, in its legislation, an opinion on the questions here raised, remarking, at first, that where the commencement of a practice was almost coeval with the constitution, there is great reason to suppose that it was in conformity to the sentiments of those by whom the true intent of the constitution was best known: Houston vs. Moore[86]; Ogden vs. Saunders[87]; Martin vs. Hunter[88].\nSince Confederation, in many instances our statutes have expressly or impliedly recognized insurance companies as trading companies. In the Insolvency Act of 1875 (38 Vic., ch. 16, sec. 1,) it is enacted that the Act applies to traders and to trading companies, except Insurance Companies. Now, it is an admitted rule of interpretation that the exception of a particular thing from general words, proves, that in the opinion of the law-giver, the thing excepted would be within the general words, had the exception not been made. So that the opinion of the Federal parliament must have been, when making the said exception in the said statute, that insurance companies are trading corporations. I see, moreover, that in 32 and 33 Vic., ch. 12, sec. 3; 32 and 33 Vic., ch. 13, sec. 3: and 40 Vic., ch. 43, sec. 3, the Dominion parliament has enacted that these statutes should apply to any purposes or objects to which the legislative authority of the parliament of Canada extends, except insurance. That is saying clearly that the legislative authority of the said parliament extends to insurance. Indeed, the Dominion parliament has given no uncertain sound on the question. Within the very first year of the Confederation (31 Vic., ch. 93,) it exercised the power of legislation on the subject, and it has done so ever since, in no less than twenty-five statutes passed thereon at various periods, as follows:\u2014\n1868, 3t Vic., ch. 93.\n1869, 32 & 33 Vic., ch. 67, 70.\n1870, 33 Vic., ch. 58.\n1871, 34 \u201d \u201d 53, 55, 56.\n1872, 35 \u201d \u201d 98, 99, 102, 104, 105.\n1873, 36 \u201d \u201d 99.\n1874, 37 \u201d \u201d 49, 86, 89, 94, 95.\n1875, 38 \u201d \u201d 81, 83, 84.\n1876, 39 \u201d \u201d 53, 54 & 55.\n1879, 42 \u201d \u201d 66.\nTo these may be added the six license acts on Insurance Companies:\u201431 Vic., ch. 48; 34 Vic., ch. 9; 87 Vic., ch. 48; 38 Vic., ch. 20; 38 Vic., ch. 21; 40 Vic., ch. 42, in which the Dominion parliament has also exercised the right to legislate on insurance and insurance companies, and to enact regulations on their trade and business, making at least (not including those of the last session) thirty-one statutes of the Federal parliament (and I have no doubt I have not counted them all), which, if the respondent\u2019s contention should prevail, would fall to the ground as unconstitutional.\nThe consequence of the nullity of these statutes must be, amongst a great many others, that all the amendments made by the Dominion parliament to the charters of the insurance companies existing before confederation, all the charters granted to insurance companies by the said parliament, are null and void; that all their policies of insurance are so many pieces of blank paper; that their shareholders are relieved from all liability whatsoever for the unpaid portions of their shares; that all actions pending, in which any of these companies are parties, must fall to the ground. And, as to the license acts, if they are illegal, of course these companies are not obliged to submit to them; they are, moreover, not only free from the operation of these acts for the future, but the Dominion Government is obliged to refund to them all that they have paid into the treasury under the said acts, and to remit the many hundred thousands of dollars which they have deposited with the Government. Indeed, it is impossible to foresee the grave and stupendous consequence of the nullity of the Dominion legislation on these companies, and the complications which would necessarily arise therefrom.\nIn fact, the Citizens\u2019 Insurance Company itself, the appellant in this case, does not exist if the Federal parliament has not the power of legislating on insurance companies and creating them.\nAnd if the Federal parliament had not the power to create the company (appellant) to give it existence, the judgment itself that the respondent has obtained, is against a non-existing body, and, as such, must fall to the ground. He, in fact, then, has never been insured; he is the bearer of a mere shadow of a policy.\nThe respondent is thus driven to admit that the Federal parliament has the right to create and incorporate insurance companies. But then, if parliament has this right, it can only be because these companies fall under the federal control in virtue of the words \u201cregulation of trade and commerce,\u201d in s. 91 of the British North America Act. \u201cThe power to incorporate or create a corporation is not a distinct; sovereign power or end of government, but only the means of carrying its other powers into effect,\u201d per Marshall, C.J., in McCulloch v. Maryland[89]; and upon this principle, it is to be presumed the framers of the British North America Act have not deemed it necessary to grant in express terms to the Federal parliament the power to incorporate railroad, shipping, telegraph or any other companies for the Dominion. Yet it cannot be questioned that it has such power. In the enumeration of the powers of the provincial legislatures, it has been deemed necessary, it is true, to include in express terms the incorporation of companies for provincial objects, but that was undoubtedly because the power of creating a corporation appertains to sovereignty, and as such would not impliedly vest in the provincial legislatures, which clearly, by the Act, have none but the powers expressly given to them, whilst the Federal parliament has all the other powers. And if the Federal parliament has the power to create insurance companies, it has the power to regulate them, that is to say to prescribe the rules under which they can carry on their trade, by which their trade is to be governed. The respondent contends, that, assuming these companies can be created by the Federal parliament, their contracts, their policies fall under provincial control, and that the provincial legislatures alone have the power to regulate these contracts and these policies. But are not these contracts, these policies, the trade and commerce of these companies? and is it not the regulation of trade and commerce itself that the British North America Act vests, in express terms, in the federal authority? Is this not contending against the very words of the Act, that the federal authority can create or incorporate traders, but that it cannot regulate their trade? If such was the case, the provincial legislatures would have a power totally incompatible with the supremacy which the 91st section of the British North America Act gives in such clear terms, to the Federal parliament, over all the matters left under its control. Either the Federal parliament has no control at all over insurance companies, or it has it supreme, entire and exclusive. If it has it, it has necessarily the power to regulate them and to impose upon their contracts all the conditions or restrictions it may think advisable; it has the power, for instance, to enact a statute imposing upon the companies it has created the very conditions contained in the Ontario Fire Insurance Policy Act. And, if it has that power, the Ontario legislature has not got it. A contrary interpretation would be giving to one Government the power to create, and to the other the power to destroy; and to use the words of Marshall, C.J. (loc cit.), \u201cA power to create implies a power to preserve; a power to destroy, if wielded by a different hand, is hostile to and incompatible with this power, to create and preserve, and where this repugnancy exists, that authority which is supreme must control, not yield to that over which it is supreme.\u201d\nI really fail to apprehend upon what ground the respondent, and the Ontario courts with him, whilst admitting the power of the Federal parliament to incorporate insurance companies, can sustain the contention that the contract of insurance itself falls under provincial control, simply because it is a contract or a personal contract governed by the local laws, and falling within the words \u201ccivil rights,\u201d of the 92nd section of the British North America Act. Certainly a personal contract is governed by the local laws; no one denies this; but the question to be determined here is, which is the local law, the law in Ontario on the subject? Is it the Dominion or the provincial law? The respondent would seem to treat the Dominion laws as foreign laws. He forgets that before the laws enacted by the federal authority within the scope of its powers, the provincial lines disappear; that for these laws we have a quasi legislative union; that these laws are the local laws of the whole Dominion, of each and every province thereof; that the Dominion, as to such laws, is but one country, having but one legislative power, so that a contract made under these laws in Ontario, or any one of the provinces, is to be considered, territorially or with respect to locality, as a contract in the Dominion, and, as such, governed by the Dominion laws, and not as a contract locally in the province, governed by the provincial laws. This is why the contracts to convey passengers and goods on the railways under Dominion control, for instance, the contract made by the sender of a message with a telegraph company, the contracts of a sale of bank stocks, are all and every one of them when made anywhere in the Dominion, regulated by the federal authority. And the power of the federal authority to so regulate them has never been doubted; yet are they not all local transactions and personal contracts? Undoubtedly so; but these railway companies; these telegraph companies, these banking companies, being under the federal control, their contracts are necessarily under the same control, absolutely and exclusively. It would be impossible for them to carry on their business, if each province could impose upon them and their contracts different conditions and restrictions. A Dominion charter would be absolutely useless to them if the constitution granted to each province the right to regulate their business. For the same reasons, the Federal parliament, for instance, in the general railway Act of 1879, section 9, has enacted, as it had done in 1868, by the repealed railway Act, that tenants in tail or for life, grev\u00e9s de substitutions, guardians, curators, executors, and all trustees whatsoever, may contract and sell their lands to the company. This is certainly an enactment on property and civil rights, yet I have never heard it doubted, during the twelve years that it has been on the statute book, that it is perfectly constitutional. Indeed, without it, the enactments of the Federal parliament might be in some instances entirely defeated and set at nought. In the United Stales the federal power has in the same manner exercised its jurisdiction over civil rights and contracts. It having been settled, for instance, by judicial construction, that navigation was under federal control, Congress has enacted laws regulating the form and nature of the contract of hiring the ships\u2019 crews[90]. It has altered the obligations imposed by the common law on the contracts made by ship\u2011owners as common carriers, and though the validity of this enactment has never been directly decided upon by the Supreme Court, it has been brought before that tribunal in such a way that their silence was equivalent to a positive and formal judgment in favor of its validity, as demonstrated in Pomeroy\u2019s Constitutional Law[91].\nThis court has, in various cases, held that the Federal parliament, on the matters left under its control by section 91 of the British North America Act, must have a free and unfettered exercise of its powers, notwithstanding that, by doing so, some of the powers left under provincial control by section 92 of the Act, might be interfered with. And this doctrine has been approved of by the Privy Council as directly as possible in the case of Cushing v. Dupuy, decided a few weeks ago, April 15th, 1880[92]. In that case it was con tended by the appellant that the provisions of the Dominion Insolvency Act were ultra vires, because they interfered with property and civil rights, as well as with the procedure in civil matters, all of which are assigned exclusively to the provincial legislatures by the British North America Act But that contention was disapproved of by their lordships in the following terms:\u2014\u201cThe answer to these objections is obvious. It would be impossible to advance a step in the construction of a scheme for the administration of insolvent estates, without interfering with and modifying some of the ordinary rights of property and other civil rights, nor without providing some mode of special procedure for the vesting, realization and distribution of the estate and the settlement of the liabilities of the insolvent. Procedure must necessarily form an essential part of any law dealing with insolvency. It is, therefore, to be presumed; indeed, it is a necessary implication, that the Imperial statute, in assigning to the Dominion parliament the subjects of bankruptcy and insolvency, intended to confer on it legislative power to interfere with property, civil rights and procedure within the provinces, so far as a general law relating to those subjects might affect them.\u201d (That is to say, I take it, so far as a general law relating to bankruptcy and insolvency might affect property and civil rights or procedure.) And their lordships held that consequently the Dominion parliament had, in bankruptcy and insolvency, rightly exercised the power to revoke, alter or amend a certain article of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure.\nIn the course of his very able argument before us, in one of these cases in favor of the constitutionality of this Fire Insurance Policy Act, the learned Attorney\u2011General for Ontario enunciated the proposition that the federal authority may have the power to incorporate insurance companies, but that, if it has it, it is only in virtue of its general power under section 91 of the British North America Act, to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, and that this power must be limited to the creation of these companies, and does not extend to the regulation of their business and contracts over which the provincial authority alone, as he contends, has jurisdiction as matters falling within the words \u201cproperty and civil rights\u201d of the 92nd section. I have already said why, in my opinion, the powers to create and regulate cannot be in such a manner divided. I will only here add, that this proposition of the learned Attorney\u2011General seems to me entirely opposed to the very words of the section 91, in which it is enacted in very clear terms that this general power of the federal authority to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Dominion, cannot be exercised in relation to any of the matters coming within the class of subjects exclusively assigned by the Act to the provincial authority. Now, the statutes creating and incorporating insurance companies, and enabling them, as bodies corporate, to make contracts of insurance, are clearly in relation to the subject of insurance, so that, if the Federal parliament has the right to incorporate these companies, as it seems to me clear it has, and as the respondent and the Ontario Courts are forced to admit, insurance cannot be deemed to come within the classes of subjects put under provincial control by the words \u201cproperty and civil rights,\u201d of the 92nd section of the British North America Act. The Federal parliament cannot extend its own jurisdiction by a territorial extension of its laws, and legislate on subjects constitutionally provincial, by enacting them for the whole Dominion, as a provincial legislature cannot extend its jurisdiction over matters constitutionally federal, by a territorial limitation of its laws, and legislate on matters left to the federal power, by enacting them for the province only, as for instance, incorporate a bank for the province. The British North America Act is not susceptible of a different construction without eliminating from section 91 thereof the controlling enactment that the general power of the central parliament to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the whole Dominion, does not extend to the subjects left to the provincial legislative power, and that, notwithstanding anything in the Act, the authority of the central parliament over the matters enumerated, as left under its control, is exclusive, as also without eliminating from section 92 of the Act, the enactment that the provincial legislatures have exclusive power over the matters therein enumerated. And this cannot be done. It would be declaring that neither one or the other has exclusive powers, whilst it is clearly intended by the Act that the powers of both should be exclusive. And upon this principle, I presume, for the reasons are not given at length, and it was before I came to this Court, a bill to incorporate the Christian Brothers as a Dominion body, which was referred to the judges of this Court by the Senate in 1876, was reported by them to be unconstitutional, and ultra vires of the Federal parliament[93]. This bill purported to incorporate a company of teachers for the Dominion, and consequently as such, infringed on the powers of the provincial legislatures, in which is vested by section 93 of the British North America Act, the exclusive control over education; and the learned judges, by declaring it unconstitutional, recognized the principle that for a matter constitutionally provincial, the Federal parliament has not the power to incorporate a company for the Dominion. And that this is so, seems to me clear; but then it is as clear upon the same principle that the Federal parliament could not incorporate insurance companies, nor legislate in any manner whatsoever on their trade and business, if in- surance was a matter constitutionally provincial, that is to say, left under provincial control by the British North America Act\nI say then to the respondent: \u201cIf legislation on insurance is left to the provincial legislatures by the British North America Act, the Federal parliament had not the power to create the Citizens\u2019 Insurance Company, and then you were never insured. If, on the contrary, the power of legislation over insurance is \u2018left to the federal authority, then this power is supreme and exclusive: the federal authority alone can regulate this trade in all its details, and the Ontario statute, which purports to do so, is ultra vires and unconstitutional. In either case, the judgment rendered in your favor in the Courts below must be reversed and the appeal allowed. (It is admitted that, if the Ontario statute is ultra vires, the appeal is to be allowed.)\nHowever, I feel it my duty not to avoid deciding the main question raised in this case, and I hold for the reasons hereinbefore given, that the Federal parliament has the right to incorporate insurance companies and to regulate them and their trade and business: that this right is exclusive, and that consequently the Ontario Legislature has exceeded its powers in enacting the Fire Insurance Policy Act. It cannot be, according to both the letter and the spirit of the British North America Act, that one Government could have the right to incorporate these companies, and another Government the right to regulate them and their trade and business. It cannot be that the provincial legislatures could thus have it in their power to retard and impede, burden and impair, obstruct, and even defeat the enactments of the federal authority.\nThe laws promulgated for the Dominion by the Federal parliament under the provisions of the Imperial Act, must have their fall sway from the Atlantic to the Pacific, unrestrained by any other legislative body, free from provincial control, without hindrance from provincial legislation. On the application of this rule rest entirely for our country the safe-guards against clashing legislation; against concurrent jurisdiction; against interfering powers; against the repugnancy between the right in one government to pull down what there is an acknowledged right in another to build up; against the incompatibility of the right in one government to destroy what it is the right in another to preserve[94]. The Court of Appeal of Ontario goes so far as to say that an insurance company, created and authorized by the Dominion of Canada to do business throughout the whole Dominion, can be excluded from making contracts in the Province of Ontario by the provincial legislature; and there is no doubt that it is so, if the provincial legislatures have, as held by the Ontario Courts, the power to regulate the insurance trade. But this, in my opinion, demonstrates conclusively that the provincial legislatures have not, and cannot have such a power of regulation.\nIf the Ontario legislature can exclude an insurance company from the province of Ontario, it must be conceded that all the other provincial legislatures have the same right in their respective provinces. So that, according to this theory, if all the provincial legislatures should exercise this right, a company created and authorized by the Federal parliament to do business all through the Dominion, could not then do business anywhere in the Dominion.\nBut, may I ask here again, what would then be the use of a Dominion charted? Clearly none whatever. Has the Imperial parliament granted to the federal authority a power so entirely useless and unsusceptible of any prac- tical effect? The Constitutional Act does not, as I read it, bear an interpretation inevitably leading to such anomalous consequences; the powers of the federal authority cannot, to such an extent, be dependent upon the consent and goodwill of the provincial authorities.\nIt is of the very essence of supremacy to remove all obstacles to its action within its own sphere, and so to modify every power vested in subordinate governments so as to exempt its own operations from their influence, \u2018 and it cannot be that the framers of our constitution, who determined to give to the central power of this Dominion the supremacy and strength which, in the hour of trial, were found to be so much wanting in the federal power of the United States, have thus given to a province, or to all the provinces uniting in a common legislation, the power to annihilate, either directly or indirectly, the corporation which the central power is authorized by the Act to create; that they have thus rendered inevitable in this Dominion, that conflict of powers under which a federation must always, sooner or later, crumble and break down.\nIn re The Western Insurance Company, appellant, and Johnston, respondent, the appeal must also, in my opinion, be allowed, for the reasons I have given in the Citizens\u2019 v. Parsons.\nThe Western exists in virtue of an Act of the late province of Canada; but if insurance is a trade, the Acts on the subject passed before Confederation can now be repealed, altered or amended, by the Federal parliament only, under section 129 of the British North America Act.\nIn the Queen Insurance Company v. Parsons also, the appeal must, in my opinion, be allowed. The Company appellant, in this case, being a foreign Company, is on a slightly different footing than the Citizens\u2019 and the Western. Yet, if upon the grounds I have stated, insurance companies and their trade and business fall under the regulations and control of the Federal parliament, there are no reasons why foreign insurance companies should be held to be under provincial control.\nIt is admitted (and my remarks here apply as well to the other two companies, which are also under license of the Federal Government) that this company, the Queen Insurance Company, has obtained from the Federal Government a license, that is to say, a permit to do business all through the Dominion, under 38 Vic., ch. 20, and 40 Vic., ch. 42 Now a license is a regulation, or rather, it is a permit to carry on a trade under certain regulations enacted by the licenser[95].\nThese regulations the federal authority has made. To obtain its license, this company had to deposit $50,000 with the Receiver General of the Dominion[96]; it had to file with the Dominion Government certain documents, and perform certain formalities enumerated in sections 10 and following ones of the said Act. Any business done before this deposit was made and these formalities fulfilled, would have brought on the person doing such business a penalty of $1,000 or an imprisonment for six months.\nThis company, moreover, is taxed by the Federal Government, sec. 23, sub-sec. 5. All these enactments are regulations on its trade and business. Having complied with them all, it could reasonably expect to have acquired some right, some privileges. \u201cBut that is not so,\u201d say the respondent and the Ontario courts to the appellant, \u201cor, at the most, if it is so, it is only as long as the provincial legislatures will suffer the permits and enactments of the Dominion authority. And when they please, instead of doing your business all through the Dominion of Canada, as the federal authority has given you the right to do, you will be excluded from Canada altogether, either in express terms or indirectly, by these legislatures imposing upon you under their power to regulate your contracts, such onerous conditions that you will be forced to withdraw.\u201d Such is, according to the respondent, the relative position of the federal power towards the provincial power, under the British North America Act. I venture to think that our constitution is not the solemn mockery that this interpretation, if it prevails, would make it to be. Insurance business is a trade, and to the federal authority belongs the \u201cexclusive\u201d power of regulation of that trade \u201cin each and every province\u201d in the Dominion, and this is so, (enacts section 91 of the Constitutional Act), notwithstanding that this power might interfere with the rights conceded to the provincial legislatures by section 92. This power to regulate excludes necessarily the action of all others that would perform the same operation on the same thing, and to the Federal parliament alone must belong the right to impose upon the company appellant and its policies, the conditions arid restrictions which this Ontario Fire Insurance Policy Act purports to impose, or any conditions or restrictions whatsoever.\nThese companies cannot be controlled and governed by as many different regulations as there are provinces in the Dominion. It is by the comity of the Dominion that they are admitted here, and under the Dominion laws and power that they remain. One of the great benefits of confederation would be lost it the rules on trade arid commerce were not uniform all through the Dominion; if the provincial legislatures had, as contended by the respondent, the power to tamper with the grants arid privileges conferred by the federal authority on the trading and commercial bodies authorized to do business in this country. I have not lost sight of certain enactments of the Federal parliament, in which it seems to be admitted that the provincial legislatures have the right to incorporate insurance companies. But the Federal parliament cannot amend the British North America Act, nor give, either expressly or impliedly, to the local legislatures, a power which the Imperial Act does not give them. This is clear, and has always been held in this court to be the law. I have also not failed, as it was my duty to do, to give due consideration to the fact that the respondent appears to have in his favor the weight and authority of the opinions of the learned judges of the province of Ontario, though I may here remark that the judges of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, in one of these cases, Western Assurance Co. v. Johnston, distinctly stated that they did not express their individual opinions on this constitutional question, but yielded to the judgments already given.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nUpon the point as to the construction of the Act, assuming it to be not ultra vires of the provincial legislature, I retain the opinion expressed by me in Geraldi v. The Provincial Insurance Company[97], that the true construction6 of the Act is that the statutory conditions set out in the schedule to the Act, whether omitted altogether, with or without others being substituted in their place, or whether some be omitted and others retained and new ones added, shall alone be regarded as being part of the policy, unless the conditions and variations, whether of omission, substitution or addition, shall be printed on the policy in the manner prescribed by the Act, the object being, that, to secure uniformity no departure from the statutory conditions shall be recognized, unless the variations shall be endorsed in the manner prescribed in the Act.\nThe words of the statute are, to my mind, free from ambiguity, namely: \u201cThe conditions set forth in the schedule to this Act shall, as against the insurers, be deemed to be part of every policy of fire insurance hereafter entered into, or renewed, or otherwise in force in Ontario, with respect to any property therein.\u201d\nThe words \u201cshall be deemed,\u201d &c., &c., here used, plainly point to the case of the conditions not being stated to be part of the policy, in which case there would be no necessity for saying they \u201cshall be deemed to be,\u201d &c., &c. Then, the next branch of the sentence is purely directory, and not a condition precedent to the prior branch of the sentence acquiring force; it is coupled to the prior branch by the copulative \u201cand,\u201d \u201cand shall be printed on every such policy with the heading Statutory Conditions;\u2019\u201d the sentence still continues copulatively, \u201cand if a company or other insurer desire to vary the said conditions, or to omit any of them, or to add new conditions, there shall be added, in conspicuous type and ink of different color, words to the following effect:\u201d Variations from conditions,\u201d &c., &c., &c.\nThese statutory conditions, it is to be observed, are framed for the express purpose of protecting the insurers. Out of twenty-one conditions in the original Act, there is but one which can be said to be framed for the purpose of protecting the insured against the insurers, namely, the 20th.\nThese conditions, as the Act recites, were framed by a Judicial Commission appointed by the Government of the province of Ontario, for the express purpose of framing such conditions as would be just and reasonable to be inserted in all fire policies on real or personal property in the province, and, being so framed, the Act further recites that \u201cit is advisable that these conditions should be expressly adopted by the legislature as the Statutory Conditions to be contained in policies of insurance against fire entered into and in force in the province.\u201d The very term here used, \u201cthe statutory conditions, &c., &c., seems to show the intent to be that they shall operate by force of the statute to be part of a contract without the necessity of their being embodied in the contract, for, if embodied in the contract, they become conditions acquiring force from the contract and agreement of the parties, and not from the statute. The contract of fire insurance being one requiring the utmost good faith upon the part of the insured, and these conditions being adopted as being just and reasonable and for the express purpose of protecting insurers, and securing to them that good faith which ought to exist in every contract of insurance, the above recital seems to amount to a legislative declaration, that the presence of these conditions is necessary in order to make contracts of fire insurance to be just and reasonable.\nTo effect the purpose, namely, that these conditions, so necessary to making contracts of insurance reasonable, shall be part of every contract of fire insurance and no others, unless, as prescribed in the Act, the Act is passed. It would be singular, indeed, if we should find an Act, which has been passed for the purpose of making all contracts of insurance just and reasonable contracts, to be so framed and expressed in its enacting clauses as to force from a court of justice the construction, that unless these conditions are endorsed on the policy in a particular form and under a particular heading, and although conditions of a like import are agreed upon between the parties, and are endorsed upon the policy as part of the contract, nevertheless the contract, stripped of the element essential to make it just and rea- sonable, shall be held to be free from all conditions, and may, as such, be enforced by the party who has violated the conditions to which he agreed, as if the opposite party had subscribed a contract without conditions, so compelling a defendant to pay a sum of money, contrary to the express agreement of both parties to the contract, against all reason and justice.\nTo hold that an insurer shall not be entitled to avail himself of a condition endorsed upon the policy, and agreed to by the other contracting party as an essential element in the contract, and which, in substance, is identical with one of the statutory conditions, or to call in aid the statutory conditions to the like effect, unless the statutory conditions, in the precise words, form and heading given in the statute, are endorsed upon the policy, seems to me to be a mockery of justice. To enact that a contract, in order to be valid and binding and capable of being enforced in a court of justice, must be in a prescribed form, is an exercise of legislative authority with which we are familiar; but an enactment that a contract (to which the parties themselves have expressly agreed) shall not operate according to the terms of their agreement, but shall operate in violation of those express terms, in the interest of the party who alone has violated them, so as to enable him to recover from the other party a sum of money under circumstances in the event of the occuring of which it was an express term of his contract that he should have no claim whatever, or, in other words, although he could not recover under the terms of the contract, which he produces as the one he made, he may, in defiance of such, terms, recover as under a totally different contracts which, as, a matter of fact, never was made, is such an unprecedented and wanton assertion of arbitrary power, and is so contrary to all our ideas of justice and of the principles which should govern legislative bodies in- their interference with contracts, that the language used by the legislature, upon which such a construction is sought to be put, should be expressed in such unmistakeable, clear and unequivocal terms as to leave open no possible way of escape to the court of justice, which should be called upon to put such a construction upon it.\nThe courts below have held that the construction which appears to me to be the true one cannot be so, and that the other construction above suggested is\u2014not because the language of the Act clearly expresses in terms such to be the intent of the legislature, but because in the judgment of those courts, no force can otherwise be given to the words \u201cas against the insurers,\u201d but, as it seems to me, the courts below, in putting the construction which they do upon these words, have overlooked the fact that, in order to do so, they have altered the whole frame of the sentence in which they occur, so as to express the very opposite of what the sentence does literally express.\nThe sentence is\u2014\u201cthe conditions set forth in the schedule to this Act shall, as against the insurers, be deemed to be part of every policy of insurance,\u201d &c., &c., &c. The Act does not say that as against the insurers the single condition numbered twenty, which is the only one so framed as to operate to the prejudice of the insurers, shall be deemed to be part of every policy, &c., and that the others, (twenty in number) which are framed for the purpose of operating in their favour, shall not be, but that (at whatever may be the time and place contemplated by the Act when, as is therein directed, the adjudication shall take place, namely, that the conditions shall be deemed to be part of every policy, &c., &c.), all the conditions alike shall be deemed, that is to say, adjudicated, to be part of every policy, &c. Now, when can, this time and place be, unless upon the occasion of an action being brought in Court by the insured against the insurers? Then alone can adjudication take place, and such adjudication is to be, that the conditions set forth in the schedule, that is to say, all the conditions, &c., shall be deemed to be part of every policy, &c.; but the construction put by the Courts below upon this language is that \u201cthe conditions set forth in the schedule to this Act shall, as against the insurers, be deemed to be no part of any policy of insurance hereinafter entered into, or renewed, or otherwise in force in Ontario with respect to any property therein, unless the same shall all be printed on such policy, under the heading Statutory Conditions and in default of their being so printed, though the assured accepted the policy upon an express contract that it should be held by him subject to certain conditions to be fulfilled by him, he shall, notwithstanding that he has violated all those conditions, be absolved therefrom, and also from the conditions which, because of their being just and reasonable, the Act recites that it was deemed advisable to make them, by legislative authority, part of every policy, and shall recover as upon a contract known to have been never entered into, namely, a contract free from all conditions, except the occurring of loss by fire.\u201d\nIt was suggested, in argument before us, that the intention of the legislature was to impose this consequence as a punishment upon insurance companies in case they should issue policies with conditions, albeit in substance, identical with the statutory conditions, in any other form or mode of expression than that mentioned in the schedule to the Act, and, by this infliction of punishment, to compel the companies to adopt the prescribed form. We are not warranted, in my opinion, in attributing to a legislative body a purpose so fatile and so vindictive. The construction that the statutory conditions, unless there shall be variations agreed upon, shall be deemed to be part of every policy, &c., secures, in the most effectual manner possible, the recited object of the legislature in passing the Act equally as if the conditions should be endorsed under the heading \u201cStatutory Conditions,\u201d and as such construction would render disobedience innocuous and practically immaterial, the offence would be, in effect, removed, and, with it, all occasion for the punishment removed also.\nBut, it is said, if the conditions are to be deemed to be part of every policy, although, in fact, not endorsed, they, from their nature, cannot operate as against the insurer. Grant that they cannot, in the sense in which the Courts below have construed the Act, and it may be difficult to understand how conditions, whose express object and purpose is to protect the insurers against certain acts and defaults of the insured, and for that purpose are pronounced by the Act to be just and reasonable to be adopted as part of every contract of fire insurance, should be used to the prejudice of the persons for whose protection they are introduced; but, to my mind, all this only shews that the intent of the legislature in using the words was not that which is imputed to it by the Courts, for the Act expressly says that it is against the insurers that the conditions shall be deemed to be, that is, adjudged, to be part of every policy, &c., and a difficulty, if there be any, in giving effect to those words would never justify the construction put upon them by the Courts below, which, in my judgment, is not only forced, unnecessary and contrary to the spirit of the Act, but contrary to its letter also, and one to support which a total remodelling of the sentence is necessary, while a sufficiently reasonable sense can be put upon the words by the construction which appears to me to be the true one, a construction which in the most effectual manner attains the object which the preamble of the Act declares the Legislature had in view in passing the Act, namely, that of securing that these just and reasonable conditions, so necessary to the existence of every just contract of insurance, shall be adjudged to be part of every policy of fire insurance, and to be the sole conditions affecting every policy, unless variations therefrom shall be printed on the policy in the precise manner pointed out in the Act; such a construction relieves the courts from the position of doing a plain injustice which the other construction causes. To prevent the adoption of the construction put upon the Act by the Courts below, it is sufficient, in my opinion, to say that there is not an expression in the Act which indicates, in the remotest degree, the intention of the legislature to have been to commit the injustice of enabling an insured person, while violating the express conditions to which he had agreed to subject himself, to recover against the insurers as upon a contract which was never entered into. I am unable to bring my mind to concur in the adoption of a construction which declares that a man who contracts that he shall have no right to recover in case of loss, if he shall keep upon the insured premises any nitro\u2011glycerine or more than 10 lbs. of gunpowder, may nevertheless (unless that contract be put into a particular form) recover for his loss, notwithstanding that he has kept one hundred weight of each upon the insured premises, and that these explosive materials caused the fire which occasioned his loss.\nBy reference to the case as reported[98], it appears, although it does not appear in the very imperfectly printed case in appeal brought before us, that the defendants, in their 5th and 6th pleas, set up, in bar of the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, the violation by the plaintiff of certain conditions endorsed upon the policy of like import with some of the \u201cStatutory Conditions,\u201d but which were not printed in the form mentioned in the schedule to the Act. They also, in their 7th plea, pleaded the violation by the plaintiff of one of the statutory conditions, namely, further insurance without notice. The plaintiff himself proved a clear violation, although, perhaps, a negligent violation of that condition, the effect of which was to cause the property to be over insured. The court rejected all those pleas, holding the policy containing conditions to which the plaintiff had assented, to be not only absolved from those conditions, but also from the statutory conditions, and the contract to be free from all conditions. Under these circumstances, it appears to me to be impossible to sustain a verdict rendered in favour of the plaintiff, and that a new trial must needs be granted, if it were not that it is clear the plaintiff has violated the statutory conditions set out in the 7th plea, and as no verdict in his favour could upon that plea be sustained, but would have to be set aside ex debiio justiti\u0153, a new trial would be unnecessary, and a non-suit should be entered.\nThe Queen Insurance Company v. Parsons.\nUpon the question as to the construction of the contract involved in the interim receipt sued upon, assuming the Fire Insurance Policy Act of 1876 not to be ultra vires of the provincial legislature, I am of opinion that the Act does not affect an insurance made through the medium of an interim receipt pending an application for a policy. The difference between an interim receipt and a completed policy is well known, and must be deemed to have been so to the legislature, and when they framed an Act having express reference to a policy, and to that only, we must conclude that they did so designedly, and did not intend to include under that term an interim receipt. We have no right to extend the Act beyond what it has clearly expressed; moreover, it is impossible to construe the Act as applying to interim receipts, since by so doing we should utterly destroy the most essential characteristic and property of such a receipt, namely, the property of being liable to immediate cancellation upon the company declining to hold the risk and to issue a policy, which the 18th statutory condition, if those conditions applied, would no longer permit to be done; and the effect would be that a condition which, when applied to a perfected policy, is introduced there for the protection of and in the interest of the insurers, would operate to their injury when applied to an interim receipt.\nAlthough an action may now, under the Administration of Justice Act, be brought at law upon an interim receipt, whereas formerly it only could be brought in equity, still the principle upon which the action was sustained remains the same, namely, that the contract involved in such a receipt was one which a Court of Equity would enforce the specific performance of, by decreeing the issue of a policy in accordance with the terms of the agreement contained in the interim receipt, and it was argued in the court below that since the passing of the Fire Insurance Policy Act, a Court of Equity would not decree a policy to issue in pursuance of this receipt other than one which should be subject to the statutory conditions only, and that, therefore, such a policy must be taken to be the one referred to in the receipt under the expression, \u201csubject to all the usual terms and conditions of this Company;\u201d but, as the Act authorises variations to be made in the statutory conditions, provided only that they shall be just and reasonable, even though it might be that, up to the time of the issuing of the interim receipt, the defendants had not had policies printed with the conditions endorsed in the form pointed out in the schedule to the Act, no court proceeding upon principles of equity could prevent the defendants from adopting, albeit at the eleventh hour, those conditions, with such variations, as should be reasonable, before they should issue a policy in pursuance of the receipt. To a bill in equity framed upon this receipt, the defendants could, as it seems to me, effectually resist a claim made by the plaintiff to have one subject to the statutory conditions only, without variations; the most favorable decree they could upon any principle of justice be entitled to, would be, as it appears to me, subject to the statutory conditions with such variations, being reasonable, as the defendants should desire to insert of like import with those which their former form of policy contained and put into the shape indicated in the statute; no Court of Equity could deprive them of the right given them by the \u2018statute of making reasonable variations in the statutory conditions, and compel them to issue a policy with the statutory conditions alone without such variations. The case would have to be regarded, as it appears to me, precisely as if the receipt had been given the day after the passing of the Act, and before the defendants could have adopted a new form of policy in compliance with the terms of the Act, in which case, it seems to be clear beyond all doubt, that no Court of Equity could compel the defendants to issue a policy subject to the statutory conditions only, unless they happened to be identical with the conditions upon the form of policy theretofore in use by the defendants.\nIf then the statute does not, as I am of opinion that it does not, import the statutory conditions into interim receipts, then these receipts must be construed as they would have been if the Fire Policy Act had not passed, and the defendants can neither at law nor in equity be held liable upon any other terms than those they agreed to, that is, to insure the plaintiff subject to the con- ditions contained in the policies which have been and are in use by them, and the plaintiff is in this position, that he cannot sue upon the receipt unless he is willing to regard the policy agreed to be issued tinder it as one containing the conditions which have ordinarily been in use with the defendants, or, which seems to me to be much the same thing, a policy with the statutory conditions, with such variations as would be effected by such of the conditions upon the policies which have been in ordinary use with the defendants, as would be good and valid under the statute if endorsed as variations in the form prescribed in the statute. The former is what the plaintiff did, for, to pleas setting up in bar the violation by the plaintiff of some of the conditions endorsed on the form of policy ordinarily in use by the defendants, he joined issue in fact, which issues, when brought down for trial, except such only as could have been raised treating the statutory conditions as the only ones to which the insurance was subject, the Court refused to entertain.\nThe defendants, by the policies in ordinary use with them, guarded themselves from all liability for loss in case the insured should keep more than 10 lbs. of gunpowder upon the premises insured. I do not think it could be held that this would not be a reasonable variation from the statutory condition which allows 25 lbs., if endorsed upon a policy in the manner prescribed in the Act. The Court allowed an enquiry as to whether the insured kept more than the 25 lbs., but would allow none as to whether he kept more than 10 lbs., and in short the case was tried as if a policy had been in fact executed by the defendants subject to the statutory conditions only, without any variations. In this, as it appears to me, for the reasons above given, the Court erred, and there should therefore be a new trial ordered, and the appeal should be allowed with cost\u00bb. But it is contended that the Act under consideration is ultra vires of the provincial legislature of Ontario, which passed it, as interfering with the regulation of a branch of trade and commerce\u2014control over which is \u2018 by the 2nd item of sec. 91 of B.N.A. Act, vested exclusively in the Dominion parliament.\nThe question thus raised is, undoubtedly, one of a very grave character, for, as became developed in the argument of the several cases now before us, wherein the point is raised, one of which, namely, the Western Assurance Co. v. Johnston, was argued by the Attorney\u2011General, who is also the Premier of the province of Ontario, in support of the constitutionality of the Act, the question before us is not one merely affecting the particular Act in question, but our judgment in this case, although the Dominion parliament is not represented, and has not been heard in the matter, will logically affect some thirty acts of the Dominion parliament, whose constitutionality has not heretofore been questioned, and which must be ultra vires of the parliament, if the Act now before us be intra vires of the provincial legislature, and, on the contrary, if this Act be ultra vires of the provincial legislature, a number of Acts passed by the legislature of the province of Ontario must be equally so. It is clear that the subject-matter of the Act in question is not one over which jurisdiction is by the B N.A. Act given concurrently to the provincial legislatures and to the parliament. If it were, no doubt the Act would be valid \u201cas long and so far only as it is not repugnant to any Act of the parliament of Canada.\u201d The subject not being one over which concurrent jurisdiction is given to the provincial legislatures and to the parliament, must be placed exclusively either under the one or the other. The question, therefore, is determinable by the rule which I adopted in the City of Frederictoh v. The Queen[99], as appearing to me to furnish an unerring guide in determining whether any given subject of legislation is within the jursidiction of the provincial legislatures, or of the parliament, namely: \u201cAll subjects of whatever nature, not exclusively assigned to the local legislatures, are placed under the supreme control of the Dominion parliament, and no matter is exclusively assigned to the local legislatures unless it be within one of the subjects expressly enumerated in sec. 92, and at the same time does not involve any interference with any of the subjects enumerated in sec. 91.\u201d\nThe contention in support of the claim that the Act is within the jurisdiction of the local legislature, is that the subject matter of the Act comes within item 13 of sec. 92 of the B.N.A. Act, namely, \u201cProperty and Civil Eights in the province.\u201d\nI have already in the City of Fredericton v. The Queen expressed my opinion that the plain meaning of the closing sentence of sec. 91 is that (notwithstanding anything in the Act), any matter coming within any of the subjects enumerated in the 91st section, shall not be deemed to come within the class of subjects enumerated in the 92nd section, however much they may appear to do so. Jurisdiction, therefore, over \u201cProperty and Civil Rights in the province\u201d is not vested absolutely, but only qualifiedly, in the local legislatures.\nIn so far as jurisdiction over \u201cProperty and Civil Rights,\u201d in every province may be deemed necessary for the perfect exercise of the exclusive jurisdiction given to the Dominion parliament over the several subjects enumerated in sec. 91, it is vested in the parliament, and what is vested in the local legislatures by item 13 of sec. 92, is only jurisdiction over so much of property and civil rights as may remain, after deducting so much of jurisdiction over those subjects as may be deemed necessary for securing to the parliament exclusive control over every one of the subjects enumerated in sec. 91, the residuum, in fact, not so absorbed by the jurisdiction conferred on the parliament.\nThe only question, therefore, before us substantially is: Are or are not joint stock companies, which are incorporated for the purpose of carrying on the business of Fire Insurance, Traders? and is the business which they carry on a trade?\nIf this question must be answered in the affirmative, the Act under consideration must be ultra vires of the provincial legislature, as much as was the Act which in Severn v. The Queen[100] was pronounced so to be, and as the Act under the consideration in the city of Fredericton v. The Queen would have been if passed by a local legislature; indeed, it seems to me to be difficult to conceive what greater assertion of jurisdiction to regulate trade and commerce there could be, than is involved in the assumption and exercise of the right to prescribe by Act of the legislature in what manner only, by what form of contract only, by what persons only, and subject to what conditions only, particular trades, or a particular trade, may be carried on, and to prohibit their being carried on otherwise than is prescribed by the Act. If this may be done in one trade, obviously it may be done in every trade, and so all trades must be subject to the will of the legislature having jurisdiction so to legislate as to whether it shall be carried on at all or not. As to the Act under consideration, if it be open to the construction put upon it by the courts below, it seems to me to be impossible to conceive any stronger instance of the assertion of supreme sovereign legislative power to regulate and control the trade of fire insurance and of fire insurance companies, if the business of those com- panies be a trade. Now, among all the items enumerated in sec. 92, it is observable that not one of them in terms indicates the slightest intention of conferring upon the local legislatures the power to interfere in any matter relating to trade or commerce, or in any matter which in any manner affects any commercial business of any kind, unless it be item No. 10, whereby the local legislatures are empowered exclusively to make laws in relation to \u201clocal Works and undertakings\u201d subject to this qualification, namely, \u201cother than such as are of the following classes:\u201d\n\u201c1. Lines of steam or other ships, railways, cabals, telegraphs, and other works and undertakings connecting the provinces, or extending beyond the limits of the province;\n\u201c2. Lines of steamships between the province and any British or foreign country; and,\n\u201c3. Such works as, although wholly situate within the province, are, before or after their execution, declared by the parliament of Canada to be for the general advantage of Canada, or for the advantage of two or more of the provinces.\u201d\nAll these excepted subjects are, by item 29 of sec 91, placed under the exclusive legislative authority of the parliament of Canada, and so, by the closing paragraph of section 91, are, in effect, pronounced not to be local or provincial works or undertakings,\u2014works and under takings within each province other than those excepted, are all, therefore, which can come within the description of \u201clocal works and undertakings\u201d comprehended in item 10.\nIt is to be observed also that when power to incorporate companies is given, no mention is made of trading companies. The power is expressly limited by item No. 11, sec. 92, to \u201cthe incorporation of companies with provincial objects.\u201d None of the learned counsel who contended for the validity of the statute under consideration, ventured to define the term \u201cprovincial objects;\u201d they rather preferred to submit at large, that the item intended to conter power to incorporate companies for all purposes of trade, and, in fact, all purposes whether of trade or otherwise, provided only the corporate powers should be expressly prescribed by the Act to be exercised within the province.\nIt is, perhaps, easier to say what the term does not comprehend than to define it precisely. I venture to \u2018 suggest, however, that such local works and undertakings as are by item 10 placed under the local legislatures may properly be termed local or provincial objects. So may the subjects enumerated in item No. 7, viz.: \u201cThe establishment, maintenance and management of hospitals, asylums, charities and eleemosynary institutions in and for the province, other than marine hospitals;\u201d and so likewise the item specified in sec. 93, namely, \u201cEducation;\u201d and beyond these I cannot say that I see any other; but when we regard the whole scope and object of the B.N.A Act and bear in mind that the scheme of constitutional government, which it was designed to create, was to vest in the Dominion parliament, consisting of Her Majesty (herself the supreme executive authority) as one member, and a Senate and House of Commons as the other members of the legislative body, the supreme sovereign jurisdiction to legislate upon all. subjects whatsoever, excepting only certain specific matters particularly enumerated, purely of a local, domestic and private nature, which were assigned to the provinces; and, when we find that for greater certainty (to expel doubt as it were) the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of parliament is declared to extend to all patters coming within the regulation of trade and commerce, words which (in perfect character with the general supreme jurisdiction, intended to be conferred upon the parliament, excepting only the particularly excepted subjects,) are comprehensive enough to include and must be construed to include every trade and everything relating to every trade, and to all branches of commerce and to the persons by whom, and to the manner in which the same, in every branch thereof, may be carried on: we can, I think, with great confidence, assert that no jurisdiction to incorporate any Trading Company or to restrain or control any Trading Company in the way it should carry on its trade, is given to the local legislatures, unless it be in respect of companies for the construction, maintenance and management of such works, as by item No. 10 are placed under the control of the local legislatures under the designation \u201clocal works and undertakings,\u201d. From the frame of item No. 11, it is plain that what was intended by annexing the qualification \u201cwith provincial objects,\u201d was not the power of incorporating companies for all purposes, but a limited power, for inasmuch as, wholly irrespective of these words, the local legislatures could give no powers beyond their province, to companies incorporated by them, these words, \u201cwith provincial objects\u201d were superfluous, and have no sense unless they be read as words of limitation, having a restrictive operation; it would have been sufficient to have said simply, \u201cthe incorporation of companies;\u201d but \u201cfor greater certainty,\u201d a principle which pervades the Act, I have no doubt these words \u201cwith provincial objects\u201d were introduced to confine the power to those purposes which are specially placed under the control of the local legislatures in express terms\u2014so as to leave nothing to be implied or inferred. My brother Taschereau has, however, so forcibly dealt with this subject, that I shall discuss it no further, but shall proceed to the enquiry: \u201cAre or are not joint stock companies which are incorporated for the purpose of carry- ing on the business of fire insurance, traders? and is the business so carried on by them a trade?\u201d\nIt was admitted as beyond all question that the business of marine insurance is a trade, and that all companies carrying on that business are traders, and are in all matters subjected to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion parliament; but marine insurance policies invariably contain, and from the time of their first introduction did contain, provision for indemnity against loss by fire; and all text books upon the subject of insurance are careful to impress the doctrine that Fire insurance is but the offspring of marine insurance, that nothing was more natural, or more reasonably to have been expected, than the conversion of the security which had long afforded protection against injury to ships, occasioned by fire, to the purpose of yielding protection to property on land; that it was the calamitous fire in London in 1667, which hastened the application of this provision in marine policies to the protection of property by land; and that, as Magens says, there were few merchants in London in 1755 who were not insured, as well for their protection, as for the greater credit, both at home and abroad, which they enjoyed in their commercial transactions, from its being known that the great capitals lying in their houses and warehouses are thus secured from the flames; that the utility, both in a public and a private point of view, as an incentive to industry and enterprise, and the promotion and advancement of trade, is as great in contracts of fire insurance as in those of marine insurance, and indeed greater, by so much as the amount secured by contracts of insurance against fire largely exceeds that secured by those against marine risks; that contracts of fire insurance are governed by the same general principles as marine policies, and that the solution of any question that may arise upon an insurance against fire, will be found by a careful application of the doctrine of marine insurance; and that the law most reasonably presumed originally that persons who entered into contracts respecting fire insurance were acquainted with, and had in their contemplation, the custom of merchants and legal rules affecting marine insurance, and intended that those new contracts should be construed and controlled by the same means. No reason therefore exists for regarding the business of marine insurance to be a trade and a branch of commerce, and that of fire insurance not to be. The only difference in fact between them is; that policies against fire are almost invariably effected by companies formed for the express purpose of carrying on the business, so forming mercantile partnerships, having within themselves the desirable requisites of security, wealth and numbers, which afford them the means of defraying heavy losses, while marine insurance risks are usually taken by individuals.\nThat the Imperial Parliament had no doubt as to fire insurance companies being traders, and their business a trade, appears from the Joint Stock Companies Act, 7 and 8 Vic., ch. 110, and the Companies Act of 1862, by the former of which every assurance company or association, whether for the purpose of insurance on lives, or against any contingency involving the duration of life, or against the risk of loss or damage by fire, or by storm, or by other casualty, or against the risk of loss or damage to ships at sea, or on voyage, or to their cargoes, or for granting or purchasing annuities on lives, are all alike brought under the Act, and are obliged to be registered under the Board of Trade; and by the latter of which all were alike obliged to furnish half-yearly to the Board of Trade a full statement of the liabilities and assets, of the companies, and by which also the commercial privilege of limited liability was extended to them. Neither do the members of the Mercantile Law Commission appointed in 1853, nor the legal and mercantile gentlemen to whom questions were submitted by that commission, appear to have had any doubt upon the point.\nThat commission was appointed to enquire and report how far the mercantile km in the different parts of the United Kingdom might be advantageously assimilated, and also whether any and what alterations and amendments should be made in the law of partnership, as regards the question of limited and unlimited responsibility of partners. The commissioners, in their first report, reported against any alterations being made in the mercantile law, which the majority approved of as it stood. Mr. Baron Bramwell, who was a commissioner, and in the minority, expressed his opinion, which accompanied the report, in favor of a change, wherein, among other things, he says:\nNo doubt we are not called upon to consider the general law of partnership, but it is important to refer to its condition, to ascertain how far the proposed change would be a change\u2014how far a novelty to the public, and what present mischief it might prevent.\nNow the law does at this present moment permit partnerships with limited liability; many insurance companies, though unchartered, are carried on on that principle, and I conceive all other trades Or businesses theoretically may be so conducted.\nMr. Slater, who was also on the commission and in the minority, in an opinion of his, which also accompanied the report, says:\nUnder certain restrictions and regulations, joint stock companies for banking, not being banks of issues, insurance companies and companies of a decided public character, possessing a large subscribed capital, might be permitted to conduct their business upon a principle of limited liability, because their establishment would be advantageous to the trading and commercial interests of the country.\nAmong the questions submitted by the commission to leading legal and mercantile gentlemen, throughout the United Kingdom and the United States of America, was the following:\u2014 Would you make the limited responsibility of partners applicable to private or ordinary partnerships, as well as to joint stock companies? Would not this unduly interfere with the free competition of industry on the part of individual traders or small partnerships with unlimited liability? Would you apply it to partnerships for banking or insurance?\nTo this question Mr. James Andrew Anderson, then late manager of the Union Bank of Scotland, answered:\nBanking and insurance companies are those of all others which, in my opinion, ought to enjoy no exemption from unlimited responsibility, not only on account of the magnitude, but of the multitude, of their dealings; there are now fewer branches of business, which seems less to require the stimulus of limited liability than banking and insurance.\nMr. James Stewart, barrister-at-law, answered:\nI apprehend that a limited liability is already applied to partnerships for insurance, as in the policies of all the companies, with which I am acquainted, the claim of the assured is limited to the capital stock of the company.\nMr. William Valentine, President of, and selected by, the Chamber of Commerce, Belfast, answered:\nI would make limited responsibility applicable to private partnerships, as well as to public companies generally; but, as banking and insurance partnerships have dealings with the general public in districts remote from the localities in which they are established, and it being difficult to obtain correct information in such remote districts as to the extent of the capital and conditions of their liabilities, I would continue the unlimited responsibilities of such companies.\nMr. Donald McLaren, merchant, selected by the Chamber of Commerce, Leith, to answer the questions, answered:\nAs regards insurance companies, I believe that many of the companies in this country, by a special clause in their policies, limit their liability to the capital stock of the company, and in the city of Hamburg there are a great number of companies who have for a long period carried on extensive business, both in marine and also in fire insurance, the liability of each shareholder being limited to the amount of his subscription, and the system has been found most satisfactory to the shareholders as well as the public.\nMr. John Slagg, merchant, selected by the Chamber of Commerce, Manchester, answered as follows: I do not think there should be any change in the present law, (that is the mercantile law), unless it be that all existing companies, such as \u201crailway and insurance companies\u201d should be brought into the same position as other \u201cmercantile firms.\u201d\nAnd, finally, the author of the \u201cWealth of Nations,\u201d one hundred years ago, in his world accepted work, in book 5, ch. 1, under the title \u201cof the public works and institutions which are necessary for facilitating particular branches of commerce,\u201d says:\nThe only trades which it seems possible for a joint stock company to carry on successfully without any exclusive privilege, are those of which all the operations are capable of being reduced to what is called a routine, or to such a uniformity or method as admits of little or no variation. Of this kind are:\u20141st. The banking trade; 2nd. The trade of insurance from fire, and from sea risk, and capture in the time of war; 3rd. The making and maintaining a navigable cut or canal; and 4th. The similar trade of bringing water for the supply of a great city.\nThe value, of the risk, either from fire or from loss by sea or capture, though it cannot perhaps be calculated very exactly, admits, however, of such gross estimation, as renders it in some degree reducable to strict rule and method; the trade of insurance, therefore, may be carried on by a joint stock company without any exclusive privilege.\nWhen we regard the magnitude of the business of fire insurance, in which alone, in 1860, a sum exceeding one thousand one hundred and thirteen millions of pounds sterling was at risk in Great Britain, the annual premiums in respect of which amounted to nearly six millions sterling, a sum five times as great as that derived from marine insurance risks; and when we observe by the report of the Superintendent of Insurance appointed by the authority of the Dominion parliament, that there were in 1869:\u2014\n5 Canadian Fire Insurance Companies, having at risk in the Dominion of Canada...................................................................................\n$59,340,916.00\nAnd 12 British Companies, having at risk...............................................\n115,222,003.00 And 2 American Companies, having at risk............................................\n$13,796,890.00\nAmounting in all to......................................................................................\n$188,359,809.00\nWhich, in 1877, had increased to 13 Canadian Companies, having at risk..............................................................................................................\n$217,745,048.00\n12 British Companies, having at risk........................................................\n184,304,318.00\nAmerican Companies, \u201d \u201d...........................................................\n18,293,315.00\nAmounting in all to......................................................................................\n$420,342,681.00\nAnd when we consider that, but for the business of fire insurance, the trade and commerce of the world could never have attained the magnitude and success and exalted position which they have attained, we may well say, in my judgment, that the trade of fire insurance is, par excellence, the trade of trades, without which all other trades would have dwindled and decayed.\nAgainst the position supported by the above vast concurrence of opinion, with the reason of the thing, we have been referred to some observations reported to have been made by Mr. Justice Field, in the Supreme Court of the United Slates, in Paul v. Virginia[101]; but Mr. Justice Field himself explains, in the Fensacola Telegraph Co. v. Western Telegraph Co.[102], that all that was decided or intended to be decided in Paul v. Virginia was:\u2014\nThat the power of Congress to regulate commerce was not affected by the fact that such commerce was carried on by corporations, but that a contract of insurance, made by a corporation of one state upon property in another state, was not a transaction of inier\u2011state commerce.\nThe parliament of Old Canada, which comprised the territory now constituting the Provinces of Quebec and Ontario, when applying to the Imperial parliament for the passage of the B.N.A. Act, was not ignorant that by the Civil Code of Lower Canada, which was enacted into law by an Act of the parliament of Old Canada, the contract of fire insurance, when made for a premium by persons carrying on the business of insurers, is a commercial contract. It was therefore upon the same basis as marine insurance, which, by the same article of the Code, 2,470, is declared to be always a commercial contract, and this is given not as new, but as old law. Now, it is impossible to conceive that the B.N.A Act contemplated dealing with the same subject as a branch of trade and commerce in one province of the Dominion, and in another as not\u2014in one as subject to the Dominion parliament, in another to the local legislature. I have shewn that in England fire insurance has always been regarded to be a trade equally as marine insurance, and to have emanated from the latter, and to be governed by the same principles and the same mercantile law as governed marine insurance. There can, therefore, in my judgment, be no doubt that in the contemplation of the B.N.A. Act, all insurance, whether of lives, or of real or personal property, and whether against risk by fire on land or on sea, or by storm on land or sea, or by any other casualty, must be equally regarded as branches of trade and commerce, and must all alike be under the jurisdiction of the Dominion parliament. There can, I think, be no doubt that the object of the B.N.A. Act, in placing \u201call matters coming within\u201d the term \u201cregulation of trade and commerce\u201d under the exclusive control of the Dominion parliament, Was to secure a perfect uniformity in all the provinces of the Dominion, as to all matters whatsoever affecting all trades, as an essential condition to the prosperous carrying on of trade, and to prevent all possible interference or intermeddling with any trade, which diverse local views entertained in the different provinces of the Dominion might be disposed to attempt, if the subject was placed under local jurisdiction, whether by prescribing a particular form of contract and prohibiting any other being used, or by prescribing a particular mode of execution of the contract, or by assuming to dictate in any other manner as to the manner in which, or the terms subject to which trading companies or other persons engaged in any particular trade, should be permitted to carry on such trade. The inconvenience which would attend the carrying on fire insurance business may well be conceived to be highly injurious to the interests of persons engaged in that trade, if they should be restrained from entering into contracts in the terms in which persons desirous of having their property insured may be willing to contract with them, and should be compelled to give up business, unless they should adopt a particular form of contract, executed in a particular manner, and subject to particular conditions, totally different in each province; and if they should be subjected to different penalties, forfeitures and consequences, in each, if the forms prescribed in each should not be followed; so, likewise, how inconvenient it would be if companies empowered, as many are, to carry on marine as well as fire insurance, should, as to one contract, be subject to the Dominion parliament, and, as to the other, to a local legislature. Now, that the Act under consideration, which assumes to prohibit all fire insurance companies, whether composed of foreigners or of British subjects and whether incorporated by foreign states, or by the Imperial Parliament, from carrying on their trade in the manner authorized by their respective charters of incorporation, and from entering into such contracts as persons willing to deal with them may agree upon, or from entering into any contract in the way of their trade, subject to any other conditions, or in any other form than prescribed by the statute, and that in default of adopting the prescribed form, the parties contracting with them, although violating all the conditions upon which alone the companies entered into the contracts, shall recover against the companies, notwithstanding that, in the contracts in fact entered into, they had consented that, in the event which had happened, the companies should incur no liability\u2014that such an Act is one which assumes to regulate and control, and in a very marked manner, to interfere with the trade of fire insurance, does not, in my judgment, admit of a doubt. Such an Act may safely, with greater propriety, be said to regulate the trade of lire insurance, and so to relate to a matter coming within the term \u201cregulation of trade and commerce,\u201d than the 4th and 17th sections of the Statute of Frauds, That the 17th section of that statute effects a regulation of trade and commerce, will not, I presume, be doubted; and the Imperial Parliament has furnished us with proof that, in the estimation of that power, to which the B.N.A. Act owes its existence, the 4th section does the same, for by the 19th and 20th Vic., ch. 97, intituled \u201cAn Act to amend the laws of England and Ireland affecting trade and commerce;\u201d after reciting that\u2014\nWhereas inconvenience is felt by persons engaged in trade by reason of the laws of England and Ireland being, in some particulars, different from those of Scotland in matters of common occurrence in the course of such trade, and with a view to remedy such inconvenience, it is expedient to amend the laws of England and Ireland as hereinafter mentioned j\nIt was enacted among other things:\u2014\nSec. 3. That no special promise to be made by any person after the passing of this Act to answer to the debt, default or miscarriage of another person, being in writing and signed by the person to be charged therewith, or some other person by him thereunto lawfully authorized, shall be deemed invalid to support an action, suit or other proceeding to charge the person by whom such promise shall have been made, by reason only that the consideration for such promise does not appear in writing or by necessary inference from a written document; and by the 16th section, the title given to the Act in citing it is: \u201cThe Mercantile Law Amendment Act of 1856.\u201d\nNow, if this amendment of the 4th section of the Statute of Frauds so affects trade and commerce as to find its proper place in a \u201cMercantile Law Amendment Act,\u201d can there be a doubt that the Ontario Fire Insurance Act of 1876, assuming, as it does, to prescribe the only manner in which, and the terms upon which the trade of fire insurance may be carried on in Ontario, is an Act which assumes to introduce a new regulation of trade and commerce into the mercantile law of Ontario, and so usurps the jurisdiction of the Dominion parliament, in which, for the purpose of preserving uniformity in matters of trade throughout all the provinces of the Dominion, the exclusive power to enact all laws in any manner affecting trade and commerce, is vested.\nThe mischief of this legislation lies deeper than appears upon the surface. The germ of that mischief appears in the judgments of some of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal in Ontario, and was more fully developed in the argument of the Attorney-General of Ontario, in his argument before us in Johnston v. Western Assurance Co.; the logical result of which, if well-founded, would be, in my judgment, to undermine the fabric which the B.N.A. Act designed to erect.\nIn the Citizens\u2019 Assurance Company, appellants, v. Parsons, respondent, one of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal in Ontario makes use of the following language: \u201cThe Parliament of the Dominion has no power to authorize a Company;\u201d that is, a Fire Insurance Company of its creation, \u201cto make contracts in Ontario, except such as the legislature of that province may choose to sanction;\u201d they, that is the legislature of the province, \u201cmay, if they think proper, exclude such corporation from entering into contracts of Insurance here altogether, or they may exact any security which they may deem reasonable for the performance of its contracts.\u201d\n\u201cThe artificial being created by the charter is authorized to make such contracts as come within its designated purposes; but the legislature granting the charter can give no privileges to be exercised within any of the provinces, except with their assent and recognition, and it follows, as a matter course, that these may be granted upon such terms and conditions as the provinces think fit to impose.\n\u201cWithin these respective limits, each legislature is supreme and free from any control by the other. The Dominion parliament has no more authority to regulate contracts of this nature,\u201d that is to say, contracts of Fire Insurance, \u201cwithin any of the provinces, than has the legislature of the province to attempt to regulate promissory notes or bills of exchange. The terms upon which insurance business is to be carried on within the province is a matter coming exclusively within the powers of the local legislatures, and any legislation on the subject by the Dominion would be ultra vires. The local legislature has the exclusive discretion as to the conditions under which it,\u201d that is, the business of insurance, \u201cshall be carried on within the confines of this province.\u201d\nIf this be law, it must be admitted that the imputation charged against the Dominion parliament\u2014that they have encroached upon the jurisdiction of the local legislatures\u2014is well founded; in fact, it may be admitted that in every session of the parliament\u2019s existence it has passed Acts which, if the above be law, would have to be pronounced to be ultra vires, to the extent of invalidating from 30 to 40 Acts. If the local legislature had jurisdiction to pass the Act under consideration, it is obvious that it has the like jurisdiction over all other trades, so that what is asserted on behalf of the local legislatures is the exclusive right to legislate in such a manner as to regulate and control all trades, and to exclude, \u201cif they think proper\u201d all persons and corporations, as to well foreign as domestic, from carrying on their respective trades within the province of Ontario. Now I freely admit that the local legislatures have the right so to legislate, if they have the power to pass the Act under consideration, but I add that they have only the \u2022 like power in each case; that they have no more power or jurisdiction to pass the one species of Act than the other; that they have no more power or jurisdiction to pass an Act to regulate or control the terms under which a trade may be carried on, than they have to prohibit it altogether from being carried on within the limits of the province. The former power is indeed but the exercise of, and is comprehended in, the latter, for an Act to control and regulate a trade is, in effect, to prohibit the carrying on of the trade at all, otherwise than upon and subject to the prescribed regulations; but the right to exclude, for example, foreign traders, be they corporations or individuals, from carrying on their trade in a country, can only be asserted in virtue of, and as incident to, Supreme National Sovereignty. An Act of exclusion, equally with an Act to control and regulate the manner in which a trade shall be carried on, can only be vindicated upon the principles governing what is called the Comity of Nations, the administration of which belongs exclusively to Supreme National Sovereignty. Now the provinces of the Dominion of Canada, by the wise precaution of the founders of our constitution, are not invested with any attribute of National Sovereignty; The framers of our constitution, having before their eyes the experience of the United States of America, have taken care that the B.N.A. Act should leave no doubt upon the subject. Within this Dominion the right of exercise of National Sovereignty is vested solely in Her Majesty, the Supreme Sovereign Head of the State, and in the Parliament of which Her Majesty is an integral part; these powers are, within this Dominion, the sole administrators and guardians of the Comity of Nations. To prevent all possibility of the local legislatures creating any difficulties embarrassing to the Dominion Government, by presuming to interfere in any matter affecting trade and commerce, and by so doing violating, it might be, the Comity of Nations, all matters coming within those subjects are placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion parliament; that the Act in question does usurp the jurisdiction of the Dominion parliament, I must say I entertain no doubt. The logical result of a contrary decision would afford just grounds to despair of the stability of the Dominion. The object of the B.N.A. Act was to lay in the Dominion Constitution the foundations of a nation, and not to give to provinces carved out of, and subordinated to, the. Dominion, anything of the nature of a national or quasi national existence.\nTrue it may be, that the Acts of the local legislatures affecting the particularly enumerated subjects placed by the B.N.A. Act under their exclusive control, if not disallowed by the Dominion Government, are supreme in the sense that they cannot be called in question in any court, but this supremacy is attributable solely to the authority of the B.N.A. Act, which has placed those subjects under the exclusive control of the local legislatures, and is not, in any respect, enjoyed as an incident to national sovereignty.\nTo enjoy the supremacy so conferred by the B.N.A. Act, these local legislatures must be careful to confine the assumption of exercise of the powers so conferred upon them, to the particular subjects expressly placed under their jurisdiction, and not to encroach upon subjects which, being of national importance, are for that reason placed under the exclusive control of the parliament.\nHow the species of legislation which appears upon the statute books, upon the subject of insurance and insurance companies, came to be recognized (by which it would seem as if the parliament and the legislatures had been attempting to make among themselves a partition of jurisdiction, for which the B.N.A. Act gives no Warrant whatever), I confess appears to me to be very strange, for it surely cannot admit of a doubt that no act of the Dominion parliament can give to the local legist latures jurisdiction over any subject which, by the B.N.A. Act, is placed exclusively under the control of parliament, and as the parliament cannot by Act or acquiescence transfer to the local legislatures any subject placed by the B.N.A. Act under the exclusive control of parliament, so neither can it take from the local legislatures; any subject placed by the same authority under their \u201cexclusive control. There is nothing in the B.N.A. Act to justify the conclusion that the subject of insurance is placed under the concurrent jurisdiction of the local legislatures, and of the parliament; if it were, the latter could itself apply the necessary remedy by an Act controlling the legislature of the former. The subject then, not feeing one of concurrent jurisdiction, must be under the exclusive control, either of the parliament or of local legislatures there can be no partition of the jurisdiction.\nIt is impossible to estimate the embarrassments which will be occasioned by the species of legislation which has been adopted, if not promptly checked and corrected. The only way of correcting the evil is to determine by an irreversible judicial decision to which authority the exclusive jurisdiction belongs, namely, whether to the parliament or to the local legislatures. In my judgment, it belongs, without doubt, to the parliament.\nThe arrival, by the majority of this court, at a contrary conclusion, will, I fear, justly expose their judgment to the imputation that it will be impossible, as I confess I think it will be impossible, to reconcile that judgment with the principle upon which Severn v. the Queen, and the City of Fredericton v. the Queen, have been decided; and that it will have the effect of unsettling, rather than of settling, the law upon a most grave constitutional question.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\n[1] 42 U.C.Q.B. 141.\n[2] 43 U.C.Q.B. 102.\n[3] 42 U.C.Q.B. 141.\n[4] 43 U.C.Q.B. 102.\n[5] 7 & 8 Vic.

Anderson departed this life, having first made his last will and testament, a true extract whereof is hereto annexed marked 'A.' At the time of his death he left several children him surviving, and amongst others Mary Louisa, then the wife of Charles H. B. Fisher, one of the parties hereto. The said Charles H. B. Fisher was married to the said Mary Louisa Anderson on the 26th day of May, A.D., 1864, and at the time of the death of the said John H. Anderson, there were living of the issue of the said marriage the following persons, namely: Henry Anderson, born on the 31st day of August, A.D. 1866, Edwin Bayard, born on the 7th day of December, A.D. 1867, Walter Stanley, born on the 11th of September, A.D. 1869. The said Mary Louisa departed this life on the 25th day of August, A.D. 1872, leaving the said children her surviving. The said Mary Louisa died without having made a will, and without having exercised any right or power of appointment conferred upon her by the said will.\n\"On the 14th day of September, A.D., 1877, the said Henry Anderson Fisher departed this life, leaving his two brothers him surviving and who are still living.\n\"The said extract hereto annexed marked 'A' is the only portion of the will of the said John H. Anderson which in any way bears upon the question intended to be raised by this case, but either party shall be at liberty to produce and use at the argument hereof a copy of the entire will of the said John H. Anderson, providing the same is certified under the hand of the Registrar of the Court of Probate for the county of Halifax, and sealed with the seal of the said Probate Court.\n\"George R. Anderson, John Starr and Andrew K. Mackinlay are now the executors and trustees of said will.\n\"The said Charles H. B. Fisher, as the father of the said Henry Anderson Fisher, claims that upon the death of the said Henry Anderson Fisher his share in the estate of the said John H. Anderson became the property of him the said Charles H. B. Fisher, and did not go to the surviving brothers of said deceased child.\n\"The foregoing statement of facts has been agreed upon by the said Charles H. B. Fisher on his own behalf, and by the said George R. Anderson, John Starr and Andrew K. Mackinlay, as such executors and trustees as aforesaid, on behalf of their cestui que trust who are interested in said fund, and the opinion of this court is sought as to whether or not the share of said Henry Anderson Fisher upon his death vested in his father, the said Charles H. B. Fisher, as his heir or legal representative.\n\"Nothing herein contained shall be construed to deprive the party against whom the judgment of this court shall be given of the right of appeal from such decision.\"\nThe clauses of the will of the said J. H. Anderson, upon which the determination of this appeal depended, are set out in the head note.\nThe case was argued before Mr. Justice J. W. Ritchie, Judge in Equity for the Province of Nova Scotia, who gave judgment in favor of the defendants. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia from that decision, and that Court dismissed the appeal with costs.\nThe question which arose on this appeal was whether, under the will of John Anderson, the children of the appellant by Mary Louisa Anderson, a daughter of the testator, took as joint tenants or tenants in common, the benefit which they derive?\nMr Gormully for appellant:\u2014\nOn the construction of the will, the children of Mrs. Fisher took as tenants in common.\nThere is very little dispute as to the law, the point is, does the will, as a fact, create a severance?\nNow, where in a will property, whether real or personal, is given to two or more persons, any expression, which in the slightest degree imports a division among the objects of the gift, creates a tenancy in common. It has been held, for example, that a tenancy in common is created by the use of the words \"to and among,\" \"respectively,\" \"between or amongst,\" and \"between them,\" and also by the use of the word \"participate.\"\nA court of equity leans in favor of a tenancy in common rather than a joint tenancy.\nThe Judge in Equity has founded his decision chiefly on the following clause of the will:\n\"That......................my executors......................shall divide all my remaining estate into as many just and equal shares as the number of my then surviving children and of my children who shall before then have died, having lawful issue then surviving, shall amount unto, and shall apportion and set off one such share to each of my said surviving children, and one such share to the lawful issue of each of my then deceased children whose lawful issue shall be then surviving, all the issue of each deceased child standing in the place of such deceased child.\"\nPerhaps if that clause stood alone the decision would be correct, but it is submitted that the learned Judge has not given sufficient weight to the other parts of the will.\nThe appellant relies on that portion of the will in which the grandchildren as well as the children of the testator are given several interests in the income thereby bequeathed to them, the words \"to and among\" being sufficient to create a tenancy in common. See Richardson v. Richardson[1], Stilworthy v. Sancroft[2].\nThe case of Crooks v. De Vandes[3], is relied upon by the respondents, but there the only words were \"what remains to go to my grandsons,\" and Lord Eldon did not think there was anything in the context to control the natural meaning of these words.\nThis was a gift to a class, and those who take are those who are alive at the time of the distribution, and the moment they took, they took absolutely. The time for division had passed before the child died, and if the executors had followed the directions in the will the division would have taken place. The Court below did not discuss the period of division.\nMr. Cockburn, Q.C., for respondents:\nIn one of the cases referred to by the learned Judge in Equity, Bridge v. Yates[4], precisely the same words were used, and there it was held that two grandchildren, the issue of a deceased child of testator, took as between themselves as joint tenants, and not as tenants in common, the testator not having spoken of any division amongst them. The only division contemplated in this case is that of the grand division of the children when they attain the age of 21 years. There never was a subdivision of one share left to the issue of the children dead contemplated. It is altogether a question of construction, and I contend it was not the intention of the testator that the husband of his child should take anything under this will.\nThe learned counsel relied on the reasons given in the three concurring judgments appealed from and the following cases therein cited, viz.:\nIn re Hodgson[5], McGregor v. McGregor[6], Leak v. McDowall[7], Crooke v. DeVandes[8].\nMr. Gormully in reply.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nThis was an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The question raised is as to the construction of the will of John Anderson, viz: Whether the children of the appellant by Mary Louisa Anderson, a daughter of testator, took under his will as joint tenants or tenants in common.\nOn 26th May, 1864, Mary Louisa Anderson married the appellant. The testator died on 24th December 1870. On the 25th August, 1872, Mary Louisa Fisher n\u00e9e Anderson died, leaving three children, Henry Anderson Fishers Edwin Bayard Fisher, and Walter Stanley Fisher.\nOn the 14th Sept., 1877, Henry Anderson Fisher, the eldest son of the appellant, and Mary Louisa Anderson died, and the appellant now claims that the three brothers took their mother's share under the said will as tenants in common and not as joint tenants, and the property being personal property vested in the appellant, his father. On the other side it is contended the brothers took as joint tenants, and that consequently the interest of Henry Anderson Fisher survived to his brothers.\nThough unquestionably at the present day tenancies in common are favored rather than joint tenancies, it cannot be doubted, that where the words used create a joint tenancy and there is nothing to indicate a contrary intention, no words or circumstances which, either expressly or by implication, create a severance, that must be taken to be the real intent of the testator, but wherever slight words of severance are found, the court acts upon them, and this the more readily in cases where provision is being made for families, for courts of equity have always inclined to tenancies in common when a question arises upon a provision for children.\nCruise thus states Lord Hardwicke's views, as taken from Stones v. Heurtly, MSS. R.[9]:\nCourts of law were anciently very favorable to joint tenancies to prevent the splitting of tenures and services, but since the abolition of tenures, even courts of law have been less favorable to them, but courts of equity always espouse tenancies in common as being a more suitable provision and prevents the descent of and right to the estate depending on an accident, that of survivorship, and are still more inclined to them when the question arises upon provisions for children, whereby an equality is established among them. It was said on the one hand that the word \"survivor\" makes a joint tenancy, and on the other hand that the words \"equally to be divided\" should sever it and make a tenancy in common, and I am of opinion in this case these last words must prevail, for it could never be the testator's intent that, if any one of his younger children should die leaving children, such children should have nothing at all, but their mother's share should go to the surviving sisters. It was said the daughters might have severed the joint tenancy, but here they were under age, any one of them might have married and had children and died under age before any severance of the joint tenancy could be.\nAn observation peculiarly applicable to the present case, and Mr. Jarman, after citing a great number of cases, showing what expressions have been held to create a tenancy in common, says:\nThe preceding cases evince the anxiety of later judges to give effect to the slightest expressions affording an argument in favor of a tenancy in common, an anxiety which has been dictated by the conviction that this species of interest is better adapted to answer the exigencies of families than a joint tenancy, of which the best quality is that the right of survivorship may, at the pleasure of either of the co-owners, (if personally competent), be defeated by a severance of the tenancy[10].\nIn Haws v. Haws[11], Lord Hardwicke says:\u2014\nThe general rules insisted on are true, for certainly joint tenants are not favored here, because they introduce inconvenient estates and do not so well provide for families, therefore this court leans against them, and so, I believe, do the courts of law now, though they favored them formerly, and the ground upon which they went was the multiplication of services under the old tenures, but the statute of 12 Car., 2 ch. 24, s. 1, has reduced the several sorts to socage tenure only.\nAgain, in Rigden v. Vallier[12], Lord Hardwicke says:\nHere is a father making provision for all his children: suppose one of them had died and left children, if a joint tenancy, it must have gone from them and survived to the other sons and daughters of the grantor, which could never be his intention.\nIn Taggart v. Taggart[13], Lord Redesdale says: Joint tenancy as a provision for the children of a marriage is an inconvenient mode of settlement, because during their minorities no use can be made of the portions for their advancement, as the joint tenancy cannot be severed.\nAnd Lord Hatherley, in Robertson v. Fraser[14], says:\nI cannot doubt, having regard to the authorities respecting the effect of such words as \"amongst\" and \"respectively,\" that anything which in the slighest degree indicates an intention to divide the property must be held to abrogate the idea of a joint tenancy and to create a tenancy in common.\nFrom all which it may safely be affirmed that where words of joint tenancy are coupled with words amounting to a division, there will be a tenancy in common.\nI think enough can be found in this will to indicate an intention of severance sufficient to justify the conclusion that a tenancy in common was created, that the share of the child of the testator Mary Louisa was on her death to be shared equally by her issue, that is by her children; for by the term \"issue\" as used in connection with that of \"parent,\" and to take the share primarily intended for the parent, I think the testator clearly meant children, and the word must be so construed.\nA critical examination of the terms of the will makes the intention of severance, I think, apparent. After vesting his property in trustees, giving directions as to the managing, selling and investing the estate, and after certain specific bequests, and after making provision for his wife, and also for the bringing up, maintenance and education of his children while under the age of 21 and unmarried, the testator provides for a division of his estate, on the expiration of four years from his death, but until the expiration of the four years, and until the division takes place, the executors are required, in these words, \"every year to place to the credit of each of my children the sum of $1,600, and if any of my children shall have died, leaving issue, then the like sum to and among the issue of the child so dying.\"\nThis sum of $1,600 a year was unquestionably to the issue as tenants in common, because it is abundantly clear from numerous authorities that the terms \"to and among\" create a tenancy in common. Then provision is made as regards the \"division, appropriation and ultimate disposition of my estate.\" These words indicate that the testator intended himself to divide, appropriate and ultimately dispose of the estate, and he proceeds to do so, subject to payment of debts, legacies, and expenses of management, in these words:\nAll the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, and the interest, increase and accumulation thereof, be distributed, settled, paid and disposed of to and among my children (who may be alive at the time of the division and appropriation into shares of my estate, hereinafter directed), and the issue then living of such of my children as may be then dead.\nThe words \"to and among,\" I think, apply quite as much to the \"issue\" as to the \"children,\" and quite as much as the words share and share alike were held to apply in Hodges v. Grant[15]. In that case, the language as to the residue was:\nUnto and among all the children of James Grant who shall be then living, and the issue of such of the children of the said James Grant as shall be then dead, having left issue living at the time of their respective deaths, equally to be divided between such children and issue share and share alike, but so that the issne of such children respectively, shall take only such share as their respective parents would, if living, have been entitled to.\nIt was contended that the children only took as tenants in common and the issue of deceased children as joint tenants. The Master of the Rolls says:\nYou cannot get over the words \"equally to be divided between such children and issue share and share alike,\" for the words apply to the issue as much as to the children.\nIn delivering judgment he also said:\nWith regard to the residuary gift, I am of opinion that the issue of deceased children of James Grant are entitled to take as tenants in common. That is to say, I think, this clause should be read the words \"who may be alive, &c.\" as matter of description, and as in a parenthesis \"to and among my children and the issue then living of such of my children as may be then dead.\"\nThen, as to the time and manner of this division, the testator provides that immediately on the expiration of four years from his death, his executors, after making provision for debts and legacies, and annuities outstanding, and the expense of the management of his estate, \"shall divide all my remaining estate into as many just and equal shares as the number of my then surviving children, and of my children who shall before then have died leaving lawful issue then surviving, shall amount unto, and shall apportion and set off one such share to each of my said then surviving children, and one such share to the lawful issue of each of my then deceased children, whose lawful issue shall be then surviving, all the issue of each deceased child standing in the place of such deceased child.\" This, I take it, was to indicate that though the estate was to be divided, as previously provided, to and among his children and the issue then living of such of his children as might then be dead, such issue should only have divided among them what the parent would have had had she been living at the time of the division and appropriation, and was not intended to interfere with an equal division of such share among her issue, and this, I think, is indicated by the next section which provides for the keeping of a separate account by the trustees of each share, thus:\nAnd it is my will, and I direct, that from henceforth a separate account shall be kept by my trustees of each share, and of the interest and profit thereof, and the payments made to or on account or for the maintenance and education of each of my said children or issue, shall be charged against the share apportioned to such child or children, or wherein such issue shall be interested, so that all accumulations and profits that may arise shall enure to the increase of each several share on which such accumulation or profit shall accrue, it being my intention that after such division shall take place, the maintenance, education and support of each of my children, while under the age of twenty-one years, shall be drawn from the separate income of such child, and the maintenance and education of the children of any of my children who may have before them died, leaving issue, shall be drawn from the share or shares set apart for the issue of such deceased child or children.\nThis separate account must have been intended to be kept, not only of each share apportioned to each child, but also of the share of each of the children of a deceased child, and this, I think, the following, as it were explanatory clause, makes very clear:\u2014\nAnd that my children, and such issue of deceased children being of age, that is to say, of the age of twenty-one years, or when respectively they shall attain the age of twenty-one years, shall be severally entitled to receive for their own use the whole of the interests and profits of the share and proportion of my estate to which they may be respectively entitled.\nWhat would be the share and proportion of his estate to which they would be respectively entitled, if the testator did not contemplate an equal division of the mother's share to and among the issue or children of a deceased child? What can this mean but that the children of the testator were to have equal shares of the estate, and the children of a deceased child to have equal shares of the deceased parent's share, and that an account was to be kept against each child and against each of the issue or children of a deceased child, so that each should be maintained and educated out of his or her share, and not that the whole or an unequal portion should be expended on one to the detriment of the other or others; and unless such an account was kept, as well against the children severally of the deceased child as against the children living of the testator, how could the testator's clearly expressed intention be carried out, viz: that his children and such issue of deceased children being of age, or when respectively they shall attain the age of twenty-one years, should be severally entitled to receive for their own use the whole of the interest and profits of the share and proportion of the estate to which they may be respectively entitled?\nUnless shares were set apart and these separate accounts kept with each and all, both children and issue, what would they respectively be entitled to? No distinction whatever is made between the children and their issue, but, as in the case of the children so in the case of the issue, each of the children and each of the issue is to receive on coming of age the whole of the interests and profits of the share or proportion of his estate to which they may be respectively entitled. All this, I think, indicates that the testator intended that his children should enjoy his estate share and share alike, and that the issue, that is the children of a deceased child, should take their mother's share, share and share alike, and should receive each one his share together with all interest and profits accruing thereon on coming of age, and so brings this case directly within the rule enunciated by Lord Hatherley in Robertson v. Fraser[16] where he says:\nAll the authorities go to this, that if there is to be a sharing, the shares must be equal; and division being once imported, the true interpretation must be a tenancy in common.\nI, therefore, think that though there may be in one part of the will an expression, which, if it stood alone, would indicate a joint tenancy, the words used are so coupled with provisions and directions, so clearly pointing to a severance and equal division, and separate interests in each of his children, and in each of the children, or issue, of a child dying, for whom the testator was making provision, that the bequest must be treated as a bequest to such issue as tenants in common and not as joint tenants; in other words, the testator intended division; the whole scope of the will shows that the intent of the testator was that his estate should be divided, and by consequence that there should be no survivorship.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that the children of the testator's deceased daughter, Mrs. Fisher, take the interest bequeathed to them as tenants in common and not as joint tenants.\nIt is quite clear that Mrs. Fisher, having died before the period of division, the legacy to her never vested. The children do not therefore take under the provision of the will which disposed of the reversionary interest in their mother's share, by giving her a power of appointment to the extent of $10,000, and in default of appointment, and as to the residue of the share, gave the fund to her children and grand children absolutely by words which clearly imported a tenancy in common. I think that that disposition has no influence on the immediate gift to the children on which depends the question we have to determine. The children here take under the direct bequest to them, in the event of their mother's death before the arrival of the period of distribution. The testator directs his executors, at the expiration of four years after his death, to divide the residue of his estate into as many just and equal shares as the number of his then surviving children, and of his children who shall before then have died shall amount unto, and shall apportion and set off one such share to each of said surviving children, and one such share to the lawful issue of each of his their deceased children whose lawful issue shall be then surviving, all the issue of each deceased child standing in the place of such deceased child. It is, I think, clear that there is nothing in this part of the will which indicates an intention that the issue of one of the testator's deceased children should take inter se as tenants in common, though, as between a class of such grand children and the testator's surviving sons and daughters, the directions as to apportionment, and other words imputing severance, are amply sufficient to shew that no survivorship was intended, but no such expressions apply to the grand children amongst themselves, who would therefore, if there was nothing more in the will explanatory of the gift, take as joint tenants.\nFurther, the gift to the children of a child deceased before the period of distribution of the annuity of $1,600 up to the expiration of the four years from the testator's death, does not, in my opinion, bear in any way on the point in dispute. It is clear that this annuity is given to grand-children as tenants in common, the words \"to and among the issue of the child so dying,\" being conclusive in that respect, but the circumstance of the testator having given this temporary provision to his grand-children as tenants in common in no way leads to the inference that he intended them to take their share of the residue, which he bequeaths by a distinct gift, in the same manner. To proceed on such reasoning, would amount to holding that, if a testator gives distinct legacies to the same persons in one bequest, using words of severance, and not applying such words to the other, both legacies would vest in the legatees as tenants in common, a course of reasoning manifestly unsound. If authority is wanted for so plain a proposition, the case of Crooke v. De Vandes[17] shews that, in the much stronger case of the interest being given with words of severance not extending to the corpus, the jus accrescendi, nevertheless, applies to the latter.\nThen the will contains this clause: \"And that my children and such issue of deceased children being of age, that is to say of the age of twenty-one years, or when respectively they shall attain the age of twenty-one years, shall be severally entitled to receive for their own use the whole of the interests and profits of their share and proportion of my estate to which they may be respectively entitled.\" I find here expressions which are decisive to show that a tenancy in common, and not a joint tenancy, was contemplated by the testator.\nIn the first place, the issue of the testator's deceased children are declared to be \"severally\" entitled to be paid when they \"respectively\" attain twenty-one\u2014stronger terms for inferring a tenancy in common than these words \"severally\" and \"respectively\" could not be suggested, and they must be conclusive, if I am right in considering, as I do, that by the words \"interests and profits\" of the share it is not intended to direct the payment, in the manner mentioned, to the issue of deceased children, merely of the accrued interest and profits, but of the whole corpus of these legacies. Supposing, however, that this direction has not reference to the payment of the capital, but is confined to the accretions, there remain still words referring to the original gift sufficient to explain the testator's intention to have been to create a tenancy in common; for the \"interests and profits\" which are to be paid \"severally\" to the issue as they \"respectively\" attain 21 are to be of the \"share and proportion\" of the estate to which they may be \"respectively\" entitled.\nThe testator must therefore in this last view be taken as furnishing an explanation of his intention in making the original gift; for if each grand-child was to take a \"share and proportion,\" and the members of the class of grand-children were to be \"respectively\" entitled to an interest in the testator's estate, all right of survivorship must be excluded. In Robertson v. Fraser[18], a much stronger case than this, Lord Hatherly determined that a legacy, which per se would have been taken in joint tenancy, was so explained by a codicil referring to the original bequest incidentally, and without any reference to the vesting or payment of the legacy, as to amount to tenancy in common, the word used, and which the Lord Chancellor fastened upon as indicating the intention, being one of much less force than the expression contained in the clause of this will which I have quoted.\nI need scarcely say that there is no room for arguing that these words \"severally\" \"respectively\" \"share and proportion\" do not refer to the children issue of a testator's child, as well as to the testator's own children; for the direction for payment at 21 of course applies to the grand-children individually, who are therefore, by force of the expression just mentioned, declared to be each entitled to a share in that portion of the testator's estate which is allotted to the class to which they belong.\nFor these reasons I am compelled to differ from the Court below.\nI do not see, however, that we can at present make any order upon this appeal, for we have not any order or decree of the Court below before us\u2014the printed case being in this respect incomplete.\nFurther, as far as I can see, none of the surviving infant children of Mrs Fisher are parties to the record; and without their presence no order for payment to the appellant or declaration of the construction of the will could properly be made. The trustees, it is clear on authority, do not for the purpose of such a suit as this sufficiently represent infant beneficiaries.\nIn my judgment, the appeal ought to stand over until the order or decree is produced; and, if it then appears that none of the children are parties, the cause ought to be remitted to the Court below with a simple declaration that the suit is defective for want of parties\u2014in which event no order should be made as to costs. If it appears that the children are defendants, then, I think, the construction of the will may be declared in conformity with the opinion I have before expressed, and in that event the costs of all parties should be paid out of the estate.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred in allowing the appeal.\nHENRY, J.:\nI concur. I had at first some difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that the children of the testator's daughter, M. L. Anderson, took as tenants in common; but taking the whole will together I have arrived at the same conclusions as my brothers. There are sufficient words in this will to create a tenancy in common. First, he makes provision for his own children, but gives them only a limited control, for they were not even entitled to their share when they arrived at age, Then he directs that a separate account of each share belonging to the lawful issue of each of his then deceased children should be kept, and directs that payments made to, or account of, or for the maintenance and education of each of his said children or issue, shall be charged against the share apportioned to such child or children, or wherein such issue shall be interested, so that all accumulations and profits which may arise shall enure to the increase of each several share on which such accumulation or profit shall accrue, &c. I think from that, and for other reasons, we may assume that the estate was intended to go to the heirs as tenants in common, and therefore I have come to the conclusion that this appeal should be allowed.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nThis a case which raises a question under the will of the late John H. Anderson, who died on the 24th Dec., 1870, and the question is, whether the children of testator's daughter, Mary Louisa Anderson, who derive a benefit under testator's will, take that benefit as joint tenants, or as tenants in common. The learned Judge in Equity in Nova Scotia, and a majority of the Supreme Court of that province, Weatherbe, J., dissenting, have held that they took as joint tenants, being of opinion that there is nothing in the will of the testator indicating an intention that they should take in severalty. With the greatest respect and deference for the learned judgments delivered in the courts below, the testator's will does appear to me sufficiently to indicate that intention, the assumed absence of which is made the basis of the judgment appealed from. The rule which governs the case is very emphatically expressed by Lord Hatherly in Robertson v. Fraser[19], namely, that:\nAny thing which in the slightest degree indicates an intention to divide the property must be held to abrogate the idea of joint tenancy and to create a tenancy in common; all the authorities go to this, that if there is to be a sharing the shares must be equal, and division being once imported, that the interpretation must be a tenancy in common.\nBy the clauses of the will, which raise the question, the testator directed that until the expiration of four years from the time of his decease, and until the division of his estate as thereinafter directed, his executors should every year place to the credit of each of his children the sum of $1,600, and if any of his children should have died leaving issue, then a like sum to and among the issue of the child so dying. Now, that the word \"issue\" in this last sentence is equivalent to \"children\" is clear upon the authority of Sibley v. Perry[20] and Lanphier v. Buck[21]. We have, then, in the case of one of testator's children dying leaving issue before the period appointed for the division of his estate, which is the event which has happened, a clear gift of $1,600 annually to and among the children of his child so dying, which upon the authority of all the cases constitutes a tenancy in common, and as this sum is to be placed to the credit of such children, it must be so done in equal parts in severalty.\nSubject, then, to the payment of his debts, legacies and the payment of the expenses of the management of his estate, the testator, as regards the division, appropriation and ultimate disposition of his estate, directed all the rest, residue and remainder of his estate, and the interest, increase and accumulation thereof to be distributed, settled, paid and disposed of, to and among his children living at the time of such division and appropriation, and the issue then living of such of his children as might be then dead in manner following, that is to say: That immediately on the expiration of four years from his death, his executors (after making provision for payment of debts, legacies and the expenses of the management of his estate) should divide all his remaining estate into as many just and equal shares as the number of his then surviving children, and of his children who should have before then died leaving lawful issue them surviving, should amount unto, and should apportion and set off one such share to each of his then surviving children, and one such share to the lawful issue of each of his then deceased children whose lawful issue should be then surviving; all the issue of each deceased child standing in the place of such deceased child. He then directs that a separate account of each of such shares shall be kept, and he declares the object he had in view in directing such separate accounts to be kept\u2014thus: \"And it is my will and I direct that from henceforth a separate account shall be kept by my trustees of each share and of the interest and profits thereof, and the payments made to, or on account of, or for the maintenance and education of each of my said children or issue, shall be charged against the share apportioned to such child or children, or wherein such issue shall be interested, so that all accumulations and profits which may arise shall enure to the increase of each several share on which such accumulation or profit shall accrue \u2014it being my intention that after such division shall take place, the maintenance, education and support of each of my children, while under the age of 21 years, shall be drawn from the separate income of such child; and the maintenance and education of the children of any of my children who may have before then died, leaving issue, shall be drawn from the share or shares set apart for the issue of such deceased child or children, and that my children and such issue of deceased children being of age, that is to say of the age of 21 years, or when they respectively attain the age of 21 years, shall be severally entitled to receive for their own use, the whole of the interest and profits of the share and proportion of my estate to which they may be respectively entitled.\"\nNow, the word \"issue\" in this paragraph being, upon the authorities already cited, and the whole context of the will, equivalent to \"children of a deceased child,\" the paragraph commences with a direction that a separate account shall be kept of all payments made to or on account of, or for the maintenance and education of each of the children of a deceased child, and that the same should be charged against the share wherein the children of such deceased child shall be interested, so that all accumulations and profits that may arise shall enure to the increase of each several share on which such accumulation or profit shall accrue, and that the children of a deceased child, when respectively attaining the age of 21 years, shall severally receive for their own use the whole of the interests and profits of the share and proportion of testator's estate to which they were respectively entitled.\nThe bearing which this paragraph has upon the construction to be put upon the will depends, not upon the fact that it provides that the children of a deceased child shall receive, for their absolute use, the full and ultimate benefit conferred upon them by the testator's will, at different times, namely, when each arrives at 21 years of age, but upon this, that it provides that at that age each should receive the whole of the interests and profits of the share and proportion of the testator's estate to which each is entitled, in virtue of the interest which became vested at the expiration of four years from the testator's decease.\nThe account which was directed to be kept was the means provided by the will, and the sole means for arriving at the amount of such share or proportion of testator's estate which each would be so entitled to receive, and that amount would necessarily depend upon the amount which during minority had already been paid to, or on account of, or for the maintenance and education of each; for what was so expended for one could not be charged to the account of, or reduce the amount of the share of the others, or of either of them. The amount expended upon each could only be charged to the share or interest of that one for whom it was so expended.\nNow, upon the death of Mary Louisa Anderson, wife of the appellant Chas. H. B. Fisher, her three children became entitled as tenants in common to the legacy of $1,600 per annum until the ultimate division of testator's estate at the expiration of four years from his decease, when these same children being still living, the share to which their mother, if then living, would have been entitled, became vested in interest in them. The interest so vested in them was made subject to charges, of which an account was directed to be kept, of all payments made to, or an account of, or for the maintenence and education of each, which amounts would vary in the several cases according as more or less should be expended upon one than upon another during minority.\nThe account so to be kept, together with the accumulations upon the shares of each in the legacy of $1,600 per annum, would alone shew, and this is the mode which the will provides for shewing, the amount which each heir arriving at 21 could claim as his own property, already vested in him, but then only payable.\nThis account so directed to be kept, from the instant of the interest of the children of Mary Louisa Anderson vesting, and the charges directed to be entered in it of monies expended upon each, necessarily, as it appears to me, involves a severance of the interests of each, and that therefore, according to the rule laid down by Lord Hatherly in Robertson v. Fraser[22], the children of Mary Louisa Anderson took as tenants in common and not as joint tenants.\nThe result is that the appeal should be allowed.\nAppeal allowed.\nAs to costs, the court ordered that the costs be paid by the respondents out of the general residue of the estate of the said J. H. Anderson, deceased, but if the said residue should have been distributed then the said costs should be contributed by the persons who should have received portions of the said residue ratably according to the amounts of the respective sums received by them.\nSolicitor for appellant: N.

J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, J. J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR ONTARIO.\nBribery\u2014Promise to pay legal expenses of a voter, who is a professional public speaker\u2014The Dominion Elections Act, 1874, sub-sec. 3, sec. 92.\nAppeal from a judgment of Armour, J., holding that appellant had employed and promised to pay the expenses of one H., a voter, who was a lawyer and a professional public speaker, and therefore was guilty of bribery within the meaning of sub-sec. 3 of sec. 92 of The Dominion Elections Act, 1874[1]. The evidence as to agreement entered into between H. and appellant was contradictory, and is reviewed at length in the judgment. It was admitted, however, that H. addressed the meetings in the interest of the appellant, and during the time of the election made no demand for expenses, except on one occasion, when attending a meeting and finding himself without money he asked for and received the sum of $1.50 for the purpose of paying the livery bill of his horse.\nHeld: That the weight of evidence showed that the appellant only promised to pay H's travelling expenses, if it were legal to do so, and such promise was not a breach of sub-sec. 3 of sec. 92 of The Dominion Elections Act, 1874. (Taschereau and Gwynne, J. J., dissenting.)\nPer Fournier, J.:\u2014Candidates may legally employ and pay for the expenses and services of canvassers and speakers, provided the agreement be not a colorable one intended to evade the bribery clauses of the Act.\nPer Taschereau and Gwynne, J. J.: Such a payment would be illegal.\nAppeal from the judgment of Hon. Mr. Justice Armour, of the Court of Queen's Bench for Ontario, the Judge trying the election petition under the Act of Canada, 37 Vic., ch. 70.\nThe petition was filed by the respondent against the appellant under the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, 1874, in the matter of an election of a member of the House of Commons for the electoral district of the north riding of the county of Ontario, holden on the 10th and 17th of September, 1878, setting forth that the petitioner and George Wheler were candidates, and that the returning officer returned George Wheler as being duly elected, and that Wheler before, during and after the election was, by himself and his agents, guilty of corrupt practices within the meaning of that expression as defined by section 4 of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, 1874, and the common law of parliament, whereby the election and return of George Wheler was null and void, whereupon petitioner prayed that it might be determined that Wheler was not duly elected or duly returned, and that the election was null and void.\nTo this respondent, Wheler, answered inter alia that he was not guilty of the charges in the petition set forth. This is the only issue material to the present inquiry.\nThe petition was tried before Mr. Justice Armour, who found that corrupt practices had been committed by the respondent Wheler and his agents at the said election.\nThe appellant only appeals from the judgment of the learned Judge as to charges Nos. 4 and 5, which allege that appellant had been personally guilty of bribery, and by notice, the appeal is in respect to corrupt practices so limited.\nThe charge involved in Nos. 4 and 5 is that appellant made a corrupt agreement to secure the vote and influence of one Prosper A. Hurd.\nThe evidence as to the agreement between the appellant and Hurd is contradictory.\nHurd's contention is that, appellant having had a conversation with one McClelland in reference to his supporting Wheler, he wrote a letter dated the 5th of August, 1878, to Mr. McClelland, as to the terms on which he would support Wheler, by attending meetings, speaking, canvassing and generally using his influence to secure Wheler's return; he then says that Wheler called on him, and, professing to be cognizant of the contents of this letter, entered into the agreement with him for his support, influence and services. The letter is as follows:\u2014\nAddressed to Mr. McClelland.\nPort Perry, August 5th, 1878.\n\"Dear Friend,\u2014I have not written the letter spoken of the day you were here, but have thought best to allow this matter to remain a matter of confidence between you and myself at present, and I write this letter under the seal of secrecy between you and myself. As you have extended to me your confidence, I feel safe in saying what I please to you; and whatever may be the final result of this letter, I desire to keep good faith with you.\n\"I almost regret that I consented to talk about this matter, but as I have gone as far with you as I have, I propose in this letter to be frank and speak out to you my mind.\n\"Until after you left I did not fully consider the responsibility I had assumed, and more than that, I felt I was placing you in a false position, for if this should go back on you I would be compelled to bear the loss or cause you to bear it yourself. I have learned something by the past thirty years as to how men will act when victory is theirs and they are no longer in want of assistance. Now in this matter I am disposed to be plain and explicit.\n\"If I should assume the position required, I at once sacrifice a large business awarded to me by strong party men, who would withdraw it at once. It would necessitate my leaving my office and business for at least one month, and entail on me the most constant application to prepare for the platform, and tax my energies to the utmost.\n\"The first thing that requires to be done is to organize the whole riding by having a central committee in every township and village, and sub-committees in every school section, and to do that requires a personal canvass of the most thorough character. The leading men require to be seen all over the riding, not saying about the numerous meetings that are to be called and attended to in the riding during the contest. Then there are also local difficulties to encounter, and above all, the party requires to be raised up to the utmost enthusiasm if victory is to attend the effort.\n\"I know what the riding is, for I have gone through election contests here for the last thirty-five years, and I never, with the exception of one or two cases, lost the election of the candidate I supported; but I know how difficult it is to create an excitement under the present circumstances, the party having been so frequently beaten here that they look upon defeat as certain and do not half work. The truth is, that not one for the party here talk as if there was any prospect of success, and I would not enter upon this contest and be cleaned out by the other party for any sum that could be offered, and I would not touch the thing unless I felt sure of success; but I do not intend to injure my own business and give others the benefit of thirty years' study and hard work without some consideration. I do not feel there is much that divides the two political parties, for \"John A.\" will never in practice adopt protection. As to the second man, my choice would be the man in the riding, all other things being equal, but unless my services on the platform and in the contest are considered worth the estimate I put upon them, I shall remain mute as far as this riding is concerned.\n\"I have had liberal offers from two other ridings since you were here, but have so far declined them.\n\"Now, as to what I shall expect. I will enter upon the personal canvass any time after the twenty-fifth of this month, and continue in the contest till the matter is over, deliver two addresses a day, when required, anywhere in the county of Ontario, and give an article every week in some of the local papers touching the issues under discussion, if necessary; in fact, the public press requires as much attention as almost anything else in order to ensure success, for which services I shall expect my expenses to be paid liberally; and for my professional services on the platform and my contributions to the local press, I shall expect to be paid four hundred dollars, thusly: One hundred dollars on entering upon my duties, and the balance during the contest, and if the candidate I support comes out triumphant, I shall expect to be paid six hundred dollars more within ten days after the election is over.\n\"In the first place, out of the four hundred dollars I shall save very little, if anything at all, for it will take all of that to secure the others.\n\"If those who are the most interested in the result consider it an object to comply with these terms, and will place you in a position so that you will be financially safe in promising them to me, I am satisfied to arrange with you alone; but if they consider the terms too steep, the matter can drop just where it is; for I would not be willing to assume the responsibility, suffer the loss to my business, and tax my brain for the next six weeks for anything less. Should I be unable to continue the fight through illness or other causes, the money advanced would be returned and no further demands made. I have suffered loss myself several times rather than ask a friend to carry out what he had agreed to when his endorser went back on him.\n\"Unless a man has been through a contest he knows nothing about it; and if any man expects to secure a seat in parliament without an effort at the present state of affairs, he will be mistaken. Now Mac, if you can satisfy yourself that the parties interested are willing to come to time, I will meet you at your own place the first of next week and definitely arrange matters. If they think they are paying too dear for the whistle, there is no harm done, and I will be at liberty to make other arrangements; but whatever is the result, I depend upon you as a man of honor. I shall mail this letter in Toronto while on my way to Rochester, and shall not return till Saturday. If you can write me Saturday to Port Perry, I will see it on Monday. If things are favorable, you can let me know what day I can see you at your place.\n\"Yours, &c.,\n\"P. A. HURD.\" Mr. McClelland says that he never replied to this letter or took any notice of it whatever, and never communicated its contents to Wheler or any body else, and Wheler swears that he never heard of the letter until after the election had taken place, and protesting it was spoken of, and that he never entered into any such agreement with Hurd. Hurd says he had a copy of the letter, but did not show it to Wheler, but that he dealt with Wheler on the assumption that Wheler knew all about it, as one Paxton had so informed him.\nWheler's contention is that it having been communicated to him that Hurd was going to vote on account of the National Policy, of which he did not approve, against his. (Wheler's) opponent, and it was proposed to him that Hurd should hold and address meetings in favor of Wheler's candidature, he (Wheler) \"paying Hurd's expenses, that, believing he would be successful, he was afraid of doing anything that might jeopardize the election; that being assured that he could legally pay Hurd's expenses without interfering in any way with the election, and Hurd assuring him that it was quite legal and proper for him to pay his (Hurd's) legal expenses, he agreed he would pay whatever was legal and proper toward Hurd's legal expenses, they being understood to be his travelling expenses; and that there was not a word said about paying him for speaking; and that this was the only agreement or arrangement he ever had with Hurd. He swears that from the beginning to the end he made every effort to secure a pure election as far as he was able to do it; that he was not aware whether it was legal to pay Hurd for his expenses as a speaker; that he gave McClelland no instructions, because he was not at all clear on that point, and he says \"I told him I would do nothing, nor make any arrangements that would affect the election in any way;\" that there was no talk between him and Hurd about a third party to make an agreement between them; \"there was nothing said about his expenses but his legitimate expenses and the printing.\"\nHe said:\n\"I know Mr. Hurd; he is a pretty prominent man in his profession in his part of the Hiding.\n\"Q. A man who has in former years taken a pretty active part in elections? A. He has addressed meetings. I was nominated against Mr. Paxton; I did not run against him. Mr. McClelland spoke to me about Mr. Hurd, the first intimation I had of Hurd's supporting me; he and others from Port Perry stated that they believed Mr. Hurd was going to support me in this election. Mr. McClelland stated that he had seen Mr. Hurd, and that Mr. Hurd was going to oppose Mr. Gibbs\u2014that he would not under any circumstances support Mr. Gibbs; that he was opposed to the National Policy; and that he might be got to support me. I think McClelland said he met him at some public gathering; that was told me at Uxbridge about the latter end of July or the beginning of August. I had heard before that from several parties in Port Perry that Mr. Hurd's support could probably be obtained; I think Mr. Mark Currie was one.\n\"Q. Who else? A. Mr. William Jones, and I think Mr. Edward Munday. I do not recollect positively whether there were any more. These parties told me he intended to support the Reform candidate, no matter who was before the Convention. * * *\n\"Q. Did he (McClelland) come to see you about election matters at Uxbridge? A. No; I think not.\n\"Q. What did he come about? A. He informed me that he was gathering samples of barley for Mr. Matthews, of Toronto. I had not any samples of barley. I do not know that he came to see me. I met him in the hotel, talking about the South Ontario election and the North Ontario election\u2014about elections generally; and he wished to see me particularly about meeting Mr. Glen in Whitby within the next week or two, with the object of getting the Hon. Messrs. Mackenzie and Cartwright to address meetings, one in North Ontario and one in South Ontario. He stated that he had met Mr. Hurd sometime previous to that, and he thought it likely Mr. Hurd would support me, from what he said. He stated that he was opposed to Mr. Gibbs anyway, and was opposed to the National Policy:\n\"Q. In consequence of that, did you ask Mr. McClelland to do anything? A. Nothing. He stated that he had spoken to Mr. Hurd, and he said he could do Mr. Wheler some good, and that Mr. Hurd stated that he had not decided what course he would take, but that if he addressed meetings he would have to be paid his expenses. I replied that I was not prepared to give any answer; that I was not aware whether the law would allow me to pay any expenses; that I was looking for information on that point; and that until I got that information I would not give any answer whatever. I understood that Mr. Hurd would require his expenses paid; I did not understand he had sent a statement to me to that effect. I did not ask Mr. McClelland to do anything whatever. I cannot say whether Mr. McClelland left Uxbridge for the purpose of going to Port Perry; I do not know where he was going; he said he was going on gathering more samples; he did not tell me where he was going; he remained in Uxbridge all night. I did not ask him to go and see Mr. Hurd, nor make him any such request, because I was not exactly favorable to receiving Mr. Hurd. I know Mr. Robson. I have never conversed with him on this subject that I know of. I remember meeting him in Port Perry some time since the election.\n\"Q. Did you tell Mr. Robson, at an interview, that Mr. McClelland came to your place and promised you to go over to Port Perry and make an arrangement with Mr. Hurd? A. I did not.\n\"Q. And that McClelland said to you Hurd would want money, or that some arrangement would have to be made with Hurd about money. Is it true that you told Mr. Robson that? A. It is not true.\n\"Q. Nothing of that kind? A. Nothing of that kind. I cannot say when I next said anything about this matter. I do not recollect hearing anything more particularly about it. I never heard from Mr. McClelland again about it. I never saw him again on that subject till the day of Mr. Glen's trial in Whitby. I never got a letter from Mr. McClelland on the subject or wrote him one.\n\"Q. Did Mr. McClelland send you any communication on the subject that he got from Mr. Hurd? A. Never. I did not hear of McClelland having got any letter from Mr. Hurd till about the time of this protest. I heard then for the first time about this letter. I never heard from Mr. Paxton about Mr. Hurd.\n\"Q. After you saw Mr. McClelland, did you ever hear of any further negotiations with Mr. Hurd by any other person? A. No; none except the conversation I had with Mr. Hurd myself. I had an interview with Mr. Hurd; I cannot tell exactly when it was; to the best of my recollection it was on the 10th of August. I saw him in his own office at Port Perry I called on him to solicit his vote; I did solicit it.\n\"Q. Did you want him to work for you? A. Well, he said he was not decided what he was going to do.\n\"Q. Did you want him to work for you? A. I do not know that I did. I asked his support, and then he stated that he had not exactly decided what course he would take; would not do so for a week. He was going the States; I think he said he would be away a week or two, and after he came back he would decide what he would do. He asked me my views. He said it depended much on my views of the National Policy\u2014if I was in accord with him. He wanted me to give him my opinion on certain points. I did so, and he said, \"Well, we are nearly in accord;\" and he said, \"I am determind not to support Mr. Gibbs after what he has done.\" I asked him then, \"Will you give me your support?\" He said he would not decide then. He said he had some business matter to arrange before he would give any body to understand what he would do; he had some business to arrange with Conservative parties; I think he said parties who would give him trouble after he announced himself. He stated that he was going over to the States for some information respecting protection, and if he decided to take any action in the matter, he would require his personal expenses to be defrayed by me if he addressed meetings. He asked me what I would require him to do. I said, if he took hold of the matter it would be to address meetings only. I told him I would want him to address meetings if my Reform friends decided to engage him to do it or to accept him. Nothing more was said about terms\u2014nothing about amount. He asked me whether I would want him to hold meetings generally throughout the Riding or in any locality. He said, \"If I do take hold of the matter, I propose to hold a meeting at Port Perry in the first place, or at Uxbridge Village;\" and he said, \"I wish to take control of the meeting.\" He would not allow anybody to address the meeting but himself; and that he would take up about two or three hours, and not refer to Mr. Gibbs or anybody else. He said he would not allow Mr. Gibbs or myself to address the meeting; and then he wanted his speech to be revised and printed in fly form, and five or six thousand distributed through the Riding, and he wanted to know if I would go to that expense. I said if he went on and addressed the meeting, and my friends considered his speech was worth it, we would consider whether it would be worth while going to that expense. There was nothing more said about expenses at that time. He stated it was quite correct and proper, and legal, for me to pay his legal expenses. I stated if it was, and if our people decided to accept him as speaker for us, I would pay whatever was legal and proper towards his legal expenses; that was not to cover his trip to the States; it was understood to be his travelling expenses. There was not a word said about paying him for speaking. Then we parted without any definite understanding. That interview lasted about twenty minutes; it took place in his office about six or seven o'clock in the evening; Saturday, I believe. Mr. Foreman came in, I suppose about five or ten minutes before we closed. I do not know whether he heard any part of our conversation; he was present at the latter part of our conversation. Foreman is a supporter of mine. I do not think McClelland's name was mentioned; it might have been mentioned.\n\"Q. Do you rember asking him whether he had seen McClelland? A. No. I think perhaps he asked me whether I had seen McClelland. He did not tell me he had written to McClelland. I did not tell him I had come to close up the matter with him.\n\"Q. Had you any other interview about this matter? A. No.\n\"Q. Never had any interview at which it was arranged that his expenses should be paid? A. No, never. The first thing I heard of him after that was that he wrote me that he had advertised a meeting at Tort Perry; that my friends had advised him to do so. I received the letter produced in Uxbridge (dated 20th August, 1878.) At our interview I told him I was prepared to pay his ligitimate expenses for addressing meetings, if the party accepted him. I do not recollect when I next saw him. The first intimation I got that the meeting was called was that it was advertised in the Port Perry Standard. I do not recollect when I next saw him. I do not think I met him again until the meeting at Scott, in the Town Hall. That was my meeting and Mr. Gibbs' together. All our meetings were held jointly. Mr. Hurd did not address that in my behalf I had not any conversation about this matter with him again. My understanding was that my party had accepted him, and that I was willing to pay his personal expenses. I thought his personal expenses would cover his conveyance, the printing and his own personal expenses. He did not say anything about his time at the interview. He stated that he would have to leave his office and his son there, and he could not afford to do it unless his expenses were paid. He said he had a few Conservative clients he would have to settle with before he could come out in my favor, and that he wanted a little time for it. He was very much annoyed, I was informed, because he did not get his first speech in the Globe newspaper, and was near breaking off on account of it. He called meetings in the south portion of the riding. As near as I can understand, he held about five or six meetings, all within a radius of a few miles. He came to my house on the Sunday following the Scott meeting. I think it was on the next morning after the Scott meeting. We did not talk election matters over then. He wanted to know if I wanted him to go with me to attend any of the meetings that were regularly advertised, and I said no. Mr. Hurd spoke at Cannington on the following Tuesday evening; that was nomination day; that meeting was a joint one of Mr. Gibbs' and mine. I am satisfied I was not elected through Mr. Hurd's agency. I am satisfied he was an injury to me; I was satisfied of that before three days were over. Mr. Hurd spoke to me the next morning after the Cannington meeting, and said, \"I did not expect to come to this meeting this evening, and I have not enough money; I wish you would let me have enough money to pay the expenses of my horses at Sunderland.\" I think he said Sunderland, and I gave him a dollar or two dollars; that was all the money I ever gave him. He has not sent me a statement of his personal expenses, and I have not settled up with him yet On the 12th of October, I think it was, the day the fair was there, I called at his office, and was there while his son was looking around for his father for an hour or an hour and a half, to get his bill of expenses to see what his expenses were. I left word with the son to write to me and send the bill of expenses. It was the younger son that I saw. I said to him that I wanted to see his father; he said his father was expecting to see me. This was at the fair, which was on that day. I afterwards went to his father's office, and the son went to try to find his father, but did not find him.\"\nThe Dominion Elections Act, 1874, sec. 92, provides that the following persons shall be deemed guilty of bribery, and shall be punishable accordingly:\n\"1. Every person who, directly or indirectly, by himself or by any other person on his behalf, gives, lends, or agrees to give or lend, or offers or promises any money or valuable consideration, or promises to procure, or to endeavor to procure any money or valuable consideration, to or for any voter, or to or for any person on behalf of any voter, or to or for any person in order to induce any voter to vote or refrain from voting, or corruptly does any such act as aforesaid on account of such voter having voted or refrained from voting at any election.\"\n\"2. Every person who, directly or indirectly, by himself or by any other person on his behalf, gives or procures, or agrees to give or procure, or offers or promises any office, place, or employment, or promises to procure, or to endeavour to procure any office, place, or employment, to or for any voter, or to or for any other person in order to induce such voter to vote or refrain from voting, or corruptly does such act as aforesaid on account of any voter having voted or refrained from voting at any election.\"\n\"3. Every person who, directly or indirectly, by himself or by any other person on his behalf, makes any gift, loan, offer, promise, procurement, or agreement, as aforesaid, to or for any person in order to induce such person to procure or endeavor to procure the return of any person to serve in the House of Commons or the vote of any Voter at any election.\"\n\"And any person so offending shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall also be liable to forfeit the sum of $200 to any person who shall sue for it; provided always that the actual personal expenses of any candidate, his expenses for actual professional services performed, and bona fide payments for the fair cost of printing and advertising, shall be held to be expenses lawfully incurred, and the payment thereof shall not be in contravention of this act.\"\nSection 100 provides that:\n\"Every executory contract, or promise or undertaking in any way referring to, arising out of, or depending upon, any election under this Act, even for the payment of lawful expenses, or the doing of some lawful act, shall be void in law, but this provision shall not enable any person to recover back any money paid for lawful expenses connected with such election.\" By section 101, corrupt practices by candidate or agent to void election.\nBy section 102, corrupt practices by candidate, or with his knowledge, renders him incapable during 7 years next (after found guilty) of being elected to or sitting in the House of Commons.\nAnd section 125 provides that:\n\"The words personal expenses as used in this Act with respect to the expenditure of any candidate in relation to the election at which he is a candidate, shall include the reasonable travelling expenses of such candidate and the reasonable expenses of his living at hotels or elsewhere, for the purpose of and in relation to such election.\"\nMr. Hodgins, Q.C., for appellant:\n[In opening his argument, the learned counsel reviewed the evidence relating to the charge of bribery by appellant, alleging that appellant made a corrupt arrangement to secure the vote and influence of Prosper A. Hurd, and contended that the account given by the arrangement made with Hurd was the only one that the court could accept, as Hurd's testimony was contradictory, unreliable, and uncorroborated.]\nAs to the question of law, the rule adopted is that where there is no money paid, the court will not draw any inference unfavorable to the candidate. In the cases relied on by the judge of the court below, the promise to pay was executed and large sums of money expended, whilst the following cases show that courts of justice will refuse to assume that there has been an improper expenditure, or an intent of corruption, unless there is abundant evidence of the fact. The Kingston case[2]; the Quebec East case[3]; the Middlesex case[4]; the Jacques Cartier case[5]. Now, it was generally known throughout the riding that Wheler was lacking in talent as a public speaker, and he might without a violation of the spirit of the law employ one who was well known as a political speaker to represent his views.\nBut the learned judge at the trial held that the employment of a voter who was a lawyer and a professional public speaker, to make public speeches in favor of the political questions at issue in the election, was the \"bribery of influence.\" This judgment overrules the judgments rendered from the earliest days to the present in English courts, as well as in Ontario and Quebec courts, on this point. In Quebec it has been held orateurs may be legally employed. Now there is no difference between the employment of a public canvasser and an orator as styled in the Province of Quebec. In England a landlord may canvass his tenants.\nWhat is meant in England as the \"bribery of influence\" has never been extended to mean the public speeches of local politicians or lawyers, nor of prominent public men before the electors in favor of a particular candidate or of a particular policy of a political party. In the case cited by the learned judge[6], Mr. Justice Willes said: \"But the candidate may pay his own expenses, and the candidate may, paying his own expenses, employ voters in a variety of ways; for instance, he may employ voters to take round advertising boards; to act as messengers as to the state of the poll; or to keep the polling booths clean. He may also adopt ... committees ... of selected persons who go about and canvass certain portions of the district, and for their services these persons are sometimes paid and sometimes not paid. Now, if the third clause was to be taken in its literal terms, the payment to canvassers under such circumstances, being as it is a payment to induce them to procure votes by means of their canvass, would come within the terms of this clause, and would avoid the election.\" But the learned judge in that case held that the employment and payment of such canvassers was legal.\nThere is more \"influence\" exerted in the private argument of the local canvasser, than in the public argument of the local professional speaker, and if the payment for such private arguments is not illegal, neither can it be held illegal to pay for the public argument of a professional speaker.\nWill we bring down the law to say only a laborer can canvass a laborer; will we have to classify canvassers?\nBut we have also the Ontario Elections Act which contains a similar proviso to that contained in the Dominion Elections Act, and under that clause the late Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Sir William Buell Richards, while Chief Justice of Ontario, held that \"expenses for actual professional services performed,\" meant fees paid to lawyers. And lawyers, as professional public advocates, may be retained and paid for their arguments in courts of justice, arbitrations, meetings of creditors, meetings of public companies, such as banks, railway companies, &c., committees of parliament on private bills, and meetings for political, municipal or trade discussions.\nThe Elections Act, sec. 73, in effect allows a candidate to employ voters for the purposes of the election, and provides that \"where any person retained or employed for reward, by or on behalf of such candidate, for all or any of the purposes of such election, as agent, clerk, messenger, or in any other employment,\" votes at the election, a vote shall be struck off from the poll of the candidate retaining or employing such voter.\nThe proviso in the Canadian Act is wider than the proviso in the English Act. The English Act excludes from the bribery clauses \"money paid or agreed to be paid for or on account of any legal expenses (i.e., expenses allowed by law) bona fide incurred at, or concerning the election. The Canadian Act sanctions \"the actual personal expenses of any candidate, his expenses for actual professional services performed, and bona fide payments for the fair cost of printing and advertising,\" and declares that such shall be held to be expenses lawfully incurred, and the payment thereof shall not be a contravention of this Act.\nThe use of the terms \"person retained for reward,\" and \"professional services performed,\" indicate the sanction which the law intended to give to the retainer by a candidate of professional advocates \"for the purposes of the election.\"\nIn the Cambridge case[7], it was held that the payment of messengers and canvassers was not illegal. See also Tamworth case[8], and the Chambly case[9].\nMr. Hector Cameron, Q. C., and Mr. Dalton McCarthy, Q. C., for respondent:\u2014\nThe statute only refers to professional services; and the Chief Justice in the East Toronto case said it means fees paid to lawyers as such. It certainly is not a part of a barrister's duty to take the stump. It may be within the Act to get a person to act as canvasser, but there is a manifest difference between a canvasser, as the word is generally understood, and a hired orator; for the former, besides speaking to voters, has to distribute bills and do a great deal of other work absolutely necessary in such a campaign, but of such a nature as cannot be performed by the candidate himself. Now, in this case, we have a voter hired to use his political influence, and that for a pecuniary consideration. See The Brantford case[10]; The Coventry case[11]; and The Preston case[12]. As to practice prevailing in Quebec as to the hiring of young lawyers, this court will have to decide whether it is valid. There can be no doubt that if Mr. Hurd had been known to have been hired, that would have destroyed his influence. As Mr. Justice Armour puts it: The bribery of influence is defined in our Act in the same way and by the very same words as the bribery of voters, and it follows that the application to the one is equally applicable to the other.\nNow, what would have been necessary on an indictment to convict the appellant? That there was an agreement between Hurd and the appellant to work for some consideration, and if this agreement comes within the literal terms of the Act, then there has been an offence. The terms used in our Act are designedly intended not to cover what the English Act does, so that in order to give effect to the plain meaning of the words in the 3rd sub-sec. of sec. 92, if the expenditure is not for professional services, the case against the appellant is made out. Now, the definition of the word professional had received a judicial construction when The Dominion Elections Act, 1874, came into force, and it cannot now be successfully contended that the hiring of orators and of canvassers comes within the words: \"expenses for actual professional services.\"\nThe learned counsel then referred to and commented upon the evidence, and contended that the respondent, having proved not merely a prim\u00e2 facie case, but a strong and clear case, having proved statements and correspondence by a prominent agent of the appellant, it lay on the appellant to call him as a witness to rebut the charges, and, failing to do so, the evidence given and the statements themselves must be accepted as true, or at least to the extent that would not have denied, but would have substantiated them. It was for the appellant to call his friends and agents, not, under the circumstances, the respondent.\nMr. Hodgins, Q. C., in reply.\nRITCHIE, C. J., after stating the case, proceeded as follows:\nIn deciding this case the learned judge did not determine which was the true agreement with Hurd, viz.: that deposed to by the respondent, or that deposed to by Hurd, because, in his opinion, \"they were both equally illegal; and assuming that the true arrangement was that deposed to by the respondent, the respondent was thereby guilty of bribery within sub-sec. 3 of sec. 92, of the Dominion Elections Act of 1874.\" In the view I take of this case I am constrained to ascertain, as best I can, which was the true arrangement, for while under the arrangement as put forward by Hurd the question would arise as to whether the respondent had been guilty of bribery under the sub-sec. referred to, I am of the opinion that under the arrangement as detailed by the respondent he was not guilty; and I am compelled to say, at the outset, that I cannot accept the witness Hurd's account of the transaction as correct; it rests almost, if not entirely, on his unsupported testimony, or rather, I should say, on his unsupported testimony, directly contradicted by the appellant and by his own statements at different times, and the account he gives of himself, and his utter disregard for truthfulness in connection with the matters in controversy, would, if he were not contradicted, render it unsafe to treat him as a credible witness.\nIt is hardly possible to believe that any professional man could have so little respect for himself and his duty as to have held the conversations, I can almost say the negotiations, which he details as having taken place between himself and Mr. McClelland and Mr. Paxton, with reference to selling himself and his influence to whomsoever would buy him, which may be summed up in the words he said Paxton, whom he describes as his personal friend, used to him: \"Hurd, I will just say this to you as a friend, altho' I would like to have you support the party, I would not work for Wheler or anybody else unless he paid me; your circumstances won't warrant you. But if you get a good remuneration for it, work for Wheler, and if you do not and you get it from Gibbs, work for Gibbs.\"\nIf Hurd's testimony could be relied on, I think there, could be no doubt that Mr. Wheler agreed to purchase for a very large sum the support and influence of a most unscrupulous man. But I am constrained to say (and I say it with deep regret) that I am unable to place the least reliance on the testimony of Mr. Hurd, contradicted as he is so unequivocally by both McClelland and Wheler, and discredited as he is by himself. That Mr. Wheler's statement is true, that all he undertook to do was to pay Mr. Hurd his legal expenses is, I think, confirmed in the strongest manner by Hurd's own testimony as to his conversation with Mr. Nott and Mr. Currie, though he endeavors to escape from the effect of that conversation in a way most damaging to his reputation and to his credibility. He says:\nI had communicated to a few other persons besides Mr. Wright that I had a claim against Mr. Wheler. My youngest son knew all about it, and my other son knew what I told about it, I told my wife about it. Before the thing came out at all, I told Mr. Nott; I spoke in some rather sharp terms against Mr. Wheler, and he asked me why, and I told him Mr. Wheler had never paid me my expenses yet. I told Mr. George Currie. My recollection is that I told Mr. Nott at the first conversation I had with him that Mr. Wheler was to pay my legal expenses, and that he had not done it. I do not think I went any farther with Mr. Nott before I put the matter in Mr. Wright's hands. It was perhaps a week or ten days before I put the matter in Mr. Wright's hands that I told Mr. Nott that. I told Mr. Nott that Mr. Wheler had agreed to pay me legal expenses. I think I told him and Mr. Currie too that the arrangement I had made with Mr. Wheler was that he was to pay me my legal expenses. I did not intend to give Mr. Wheler and Mr. McClelland away until I saw that they were not going to settle with me. There was never an agreement that Mr. Wheler was to pay my legal expenses.\nQ. Then you stated to those two parties what was not true? A. Yes; when a man begins to sin he generally goes on.\nQ. Then at that time, as a matter of fact, all you were complaining of was legal expenses? A. That is all I told them.\nThe ends of justice require that I should point out some of the contradictions, discrepancies, and self discrediting evidence of Hurd, to justify the position that his testimony is not of a character to be relied on.\nIn a letter from Hurd to McClelland, dated the 8th October, 1878, when pressing McClelland to interfere, he thus writes:\nW. may think that it is only a question of veracity between him and me, but it so happened that I intentionally had my son hear every word that was said, when he said he accepted my proposal and requested me to go down and see you, as he said you were fully authorized to make the arrangement with me. Paxton says he told him he knew what the proposition was. But, as he has said nothing, and as some other matters within my knowledge, he don't intend to come to time unless he thinks you are legally bound.\nThe letter of the 8th October, 1878, shows two things: first, that he intentionally had his son to hear every word that was said when (as he alleges) he said \"he accepted my proposal,\" but it also shews, that neither he nor Wheler could have considered that any agreement was then entered into, because he very clearly intimates that the arrangement into which Hurd was to enter, was to be, not with Wheler, but with McClelland, for he says: \"he said you were fully authorized to make the arrangement with me;\" and again, \"he don't intend to come to time unless he thinks you are legally bound;\" strongly confirmatory of Wheler's contention that he made no such arrangement as Hurd at the trial sets up.\nIn the statement of facts, as he calls them, handed\nMr. Cameron, dated 19th Oct., 1878, he heads it thus:\nThe following are facts which I am willing to put in the form of an affidavit:\nI next met Mr. Wheler; he came to my office, said he had called to see me about election matters, and asked me if I had seen McClelland. I said I had, but that I had not heard from him since I had written him my definite proposals. He said he had seen McClelland and had instructed him to arrange with me, and that Mac. had with him; said that he had come to close up the matter with me, and said he accepted my proposals, and wanted me to name some person in whom we both had confidence to act between us; I said I should prefer McClelland to any one else as I had full confidence in McClelland, and as he was not in the riding he would not be suspected. He asked me how far he could arrange with me himself; I told him he could pay my legal expenses liberally, but if he went beyond that himself, it might create difficulty if he was put under oath. He said he had authorized Mac. to act in the matter, and that they fully understood each other. My son Ralph was at the office door purposely to hear what passed, as I had some fears as to Wheler's acting in good faith. He then requested me to write Mac. at once and make an appointment with him. I did so at his request and got a reply by telegraph, which I mark No. 2, naming Whitby on next Saturday morning, but Wheler and I fully discussed the purport of the letter. He did not then say he had seen my letter to Mac, but I was satisfied that he then knew its contents, and Mr. Paxton had previously told me that Wheler knew what the proposal was and read the contents of my letter to Mac, and said he would accept it. I parted then with Wheler with the understanding that McClelland was to consummate the arrangement and act as our confidant both as to my proposition and the acceptance of it. I met McClelland up at Whitby at the time appointed, and he then accepted my proposition as made in my letter of the 4th of August, on behalf of Mr. Wheler.\nAnd again in the same document he says:\nI have seen Paxton since, and he told me that he had seen McClelland on that subject; that McClelland told him the arrangement was just what I said it was, and that Wheler authorized him to make the terms with me, and that his attempt to get out of the matter was an outrageous breach of faith, and that he would see Wheler at once, and if Wheler did not pay over the balance of the money, he would protest the election himself. I can prove all I have stated here by Paxton, McClelland, and my son Ralph, as to the bargain.\nHere again putting forward that he (McClelland) and not Wheler made the terms with him, and yet both McClelland and Wheler contradict this statement, and the son Ralph denies having overheard the bargain and his ability to prove it, and Hurd himself contradicts the fact of the arrangement having been made with McClelland, and contradicts the fact that his son was placed to overhear the conversation, or that he could prove the bargain as stated by Hurd; and Paxton, though present and summoned by petitioner, is not placed in the box to confirm Hurd or discredit McClelland. The burthen of establishing the affirmative was clearly on the petitioner. Paxton, to whom Hurd so often refers, and who, he said, told him Wheler knew the contents of Hurd's letter to McClelland, having been summoned by the petitioner but not called, I think when Hurd's evidence was strongly impeached, should have been called to corroborate Hurd if he could do so, and I cannot escape the conviction that if his evidence could have corroborated Hurd he would have been put on the stand; and after having thus written to McClelland and having forwarded a solemn document to Mr. Cameron, which he is willing to put in the form of an affidavit, we find him on his examination before Judge Armour deposing thus:\nOn the same day I wrote to Mr. Wheler I wrote to McClelland about it.\nQ. Why was it you did not write to Mr. Wheler in the same way you wrote to Mr. McClelland? A. Simply because I never had anything to say to Mr. Wheler about the matter.\nQ. I see in this letter of the 10th of October you say you intentionally had your son hear the arrangement that was made between you? A. Well, I do not think that is correct. My son was not present\u2014the whole conversation; anyway; and the word \"intentional,\" if I put it in there. I do not think I intended. There was no intention on my part of my son's being there. My son was in the office, as he is always in the office. I do not think he heard but very little of what passed between us. He knows the fact that Mr. Wheler was there, and he heard some part of the conversation. I spoke to my son about it afterwards, and he said, \"I was not there purposely, and I did not go there to see what the case was.\"\nRalph Hurd, who seems as regardless of the truth as his father, speaking of the interview between his father and Wheler, says:\nI would not swear positively that the interview lasted more than an hour, but I think it did. I will swear positively it was over half an hour. I will swear now positively that they were in there over an hour. The interview was in the afternoon. While I was in the outside room I did not hear anything that passed. I did not go into the room intentionally to hear what they were saying. It had not been arranged between me and my father that I should go in. I have not seen or heard read the statement my father made in this matter. I told my father one night that I was listening to what was said when Wheler was there; that was a lie.\nOn the trial he (Hurd) swears, notwithstanding what he had before said and written, the arrangement as to the $1,000 was made with Wheler thus:\nQ. Whose promise was it you say exactly was made to you here? A. Mr. Wheler was the person I made the arrangement with.\nQ. Then the arrangement you made with Mr. Wheler is, in fact, the only arrangement you made? A. I made no arrangement with any other person any further than McClelland was connected with it. No person but McClelland and Wheler made me any promise of anything. Paxton never made me any promise; he had not any, thing to promise.\nAnd again he says:\nI do not consider I ever had an arrangement with McCleland, any more than I looked upon it that the money was to come through McClelland's hands into mine. The arrangement was made between me and Wheler. It was simply this: Mr. Wheler said that he understood that I would support him on certain conditions, and that he was there for the purpose of closing it up. He referred to this letter I had written to McClelland. I stated to him the conversation that had taken place between me and McClelland, in the first place, and then referred him to the terms of this letter; and he told me he knew all about it; and Mr. Paxton had previously told me that he said he knew all about it. Then he said that he was there to close up the matter; and he asked if there was any third person there that the money could be paid to me by and I said no; as McClelland had been engaged in the matter in the first place, and as I had confidence in him, he might act in the matter.\nAnd he says:\nI had a copy of the letter at the time but did not show it to Mr. Wheler.\nIf McClelland's evidence is correct that he never showed to, or told, any person about the letter, and Hurd says he never showed the letter to Wheler, or told him its contents, there appears to be no way that Mr. Wheler could have had any knowledge of its contents, and if Paxton did tell Hurd, as he swears, the inference to my mind is irresistible, that not having been called, he was not prepared to confirm Hurd or testify to the fact. But Mr. Nott swears that Hurd told him it was McClelland who promised him.\nHis evidence is this:\nI live in Port Perry. I know Mr. Hurd.\nQ. Have you had any conversations with him about this matter that has been in controversy, about the part he took in the election, and the circumstances in which he took part in it? A. I have. I understood him to say he was to be paid a thousand dollars for his services. I think it was about the 25th of November when he told me this.\nQ. You had business at his office, I believe? A. He has been my lawyer. He told me from whom he was promised it.\nQ. Who did he say? A. McClelland.\nQ. Did he tell you that Mr. Wheler had ever assented to that, or promised to pay it? A. Never.\nQ. What did he say about the question of the validity of the seat? A. I think it was something like this, that if he got paid for his services, he could either be the means of Wheler keeping his seat or losing it.\nQ. Did he ever tell you anything definitely about his being paid the' thousand dollars? A. I never understood him to state anything definitely; he said he had been at a great deal of expense, and he had got some money from some friends of his; and that he had used his own money, and he thought it ought to be paid back. I think he said that on two occasions. I did not understand that Mr. Wheler was to pay him anything at all. Mr. Hurd stuck for his thousand dollars; and finally I understood him to state that if he could not get his thousand dollars he would be satisfied with less; that if the matter could be settled before protest was entered, less money would be accepted than a thousand dollars.\nCross-Examination\u2014I did not understand that anything had taken place between him and Wheler. Be said he had an interview with Mr. Wheler and talked over election matters with him. I did not understand him to say that any figures had passed between him and Wheler.\nRe-examination\u2014I did not understand from Hurd that Mr. Wheler had ever agreed or assented in any way to any proposition that he should be paid.\nThen George Currie swears:\nI live at Port Perry. I know Mr. Hurd very well. On one occasion he mentioned to me that he had been disappointed in getting money from Mr. Wheler; he said that he had been promised some money; expected to get $50 or $60 from Mr. Wheler, and had not been able to get a dollar from him; Wheler had not even recognized him, or recognized his letters or telegrams at all. He mentioned, I think, some $50 or $60 that he had expended. He did not say to me who had promised him that he should be paid anything; he did not say what the promise was that had been made to him any more definitely than that he had been promised his expenses during the election, and that he had disbursed to the extent of some $50 or $60. In speaking of expenses, he spoke of them as his travelling expenses and telegraphing; he might have mentioned horse hire, but I do not remember that. The conversation arose accidentally, and he just mentioned this as a reason why he had not repaid me a small sum of money he had borrowed of me. He spoke of the extreme difficulty he had in getting any recognition from Mr. Wheler, and the disappointment and vexation he had about it. I asked him if he had made any demand of Wheler for it, and he told me that he had repeatedly written and telegraphed, and got no response.\nQ. Did he ask you to do anything in the matter? A. I think I suggested myself. I do not think he asked that. I think I expressed my surprise that Wheler should be so negligent about it; that if Wheler had promised to pay his expenses, I thought Wheler was not the man to do what was wrong about it; and I said, \"If you like I will write to Wheler myself about it.\" I did not do so. This conversation took place in the early part of the afternoon, and I meant to write to Wheler that afternoon; I forgot to do so, and could not send the letter till the next day, and in the meantime I heard that Hurd had transferred his claim to the other party.\nI think Hurd always contemplated making money ont of the election, that he very highly estimated his powers and his influence, and, if he was to be believed, deemed his services almost if not quite indispensable to Mr. Wheler's success; and, I believe, he thought that after the election was over, if successful for Wheler, as it was, he would recognize and reward him accordingly, and this is to be inferred from his letter to Mr. Wheler after the election, dated October 8th, 1878, in which, after remarking on the surprise at the result of the elections generally and those of N. and S. Ontario particularly, he writes thus:\nStrictly private and confidential.\nPort Perry, October 8th, 1878.\n* * * * And while the contest has resulted satisfactorily to both you and your friends, so far as giving you a good majority, allow me to suggest that there is always after an election contest certain matters requiring the attention of the victorious candidate, and if neglected, produce great unpleasantness. What is to be done had better be done at once; neglect or indifference always leads to the supposition that it will never be done. I make these suggestions in all kindness, as the neglect of these little matters often leads to great dissatisfaction, and sometimes to an open rupture between the parties. Let me hear from you.\nYours, &c., P. A. HURD.\nHe puts forward here no agreement the fulfilment of which he claims on the basis of a legal or an honorable contract, but relies on some general understanding or practice as to what always takes place after an election and which requires the attention of the victorious candidate. I read this, put in plain English, as amounting to this:\u2014I have been very instrumental, if not indispensable, in securing your election, and I expect you will do as other victorious candidates have done, show your liberality and recognize my services. If you are neglectful or indifferent in this respect it will, as it often does, lead to great dissatisfaction, and sometimes to an open rupture.\nI have no doubt many a victorious candidate has after an election been approached and pressed by unscrupulous persons who have made themselves busy in the election, and I have no doubt many such persons, when repelled and treated as they ought to be, have become dissatisfied, and the result an open rupture. He also addresses Mr. McClelland and Wheler's friends, and evidently seeks to impress on them that Wheler is in his power and he can upset the election, and puts forward a corrupt contract with Wheler, and that if Wheler should swear differently from him, and a question of credibility should arise between them, which he appears to have anticipated, he puts forward that he had, by placing his son in a certain position, secured a witness who would prove the contract Wheler did not respond, and finding that his efforts were unsuccessful, we find him still determined to get money out of the election, and having failed on one side, he turns to the other, with obviously the same object, and seeks to make the defeated party believe that he possesses the necessary information to upset the election and disqualify Wheler, and with this view he prepares the materials for an affidavit, in which he again puts forward the same untruth as to his son, which he alleges he is prepared to put in an affidavit, and adds that McClelland and Paxton as well as his son could prove the corruption. I cannot on any other hypothesis reconcile his untruthfulness and conduct generally. But be this as it may, of a contract such as he alleges, there is, in my opinion, no reliable or trustworthy evidence.\nIn addition to all which contradictions, we find Mr. Hurd, when he can extract nothing from Wheler, taking steps to get money from the other side, and I have no doubt, what he did led to the present petition being filed, and in this operation we find from his own evidence that he was as regardless of truth as he has shown himself to have been in the earlier part of the business. He admits that he told a good many Grits, as he calls them, that he would get his money, his words are \"that I intended to get it from the other party, if I did not get it from him\" (Wheler), and in answer to this question: \"Have you stated to any person that Mr. Gibbs was advised that it would not be safe, or that he could not be advised that it would be safe to pay you $1000 till the trial was over?\" we have this answer: \"A. If I stated that, I have no recollection of it. I will not undertake to state that I did not state it. I may have stated a thing of the kind;\" and then adds \"It was not true if I stated it, because I have no authority for saying anything of the kind.\" And in reply to this question: \"Q. Then the long and short of the matter is that you may have told a good many lies about this matter? A. That is very true, that I may have told a good many stories about it.\"\nHe then states what took place:\nQ. When you put this matter in Mr, Wright's hands, and Mr. Wright gave these papers to Mr. Cameron, did he tell you that he had told any person about it? A. No. I do not think that he said at that time whether he had told any person or not; but he said that Mr. Cameron wanted to see me in Lindsay.\nQ. Did Mr. Wright tell you at that time that he had told any person other than Mr. Cameron anything about this letter? A. I think he told me he had not. I won't swear positively that he did. He said to me, \"Mr. Hurd, if you will allow me to mention this to anybody, I am satisfied that I can get your money.\" He mentioned a man's name to me.\nQ. Then he knew how much it was you were claiming? A. Yes; we talked it over after he came back that evening. I authorized him to tell this person; the person was Thomas Paxton. He did not give me any assurance that I could get my money in any way. Mr. Wright was a Conservative; he was a personal friend of mine.\nQ. Did he give you any assurance that you would get your money from the other side in any way, or any payment at all? A. No.\nQ. Did he ever say to you that any person would give anything for that information? A. No. I do not think he ever did; I am pretty sure he never did.\nQ. Did you ever say he did? A. Yes; I said I would get my money. I told a good many of the Grits that I would get my money; that I intended to get it from the other party if I did not get it from him. I intended to get it from Gibbs; and I let them suppose I would too. I had had no communication with Mr. Gibbs. I was not aware that any person had had any communication with Mr. Gibbs about it, or heard that any person had had any communication with him at the time I handed these papers to Mr. Wright. Since then I have heard that Mr. Gibbs had placed a thousand dollars somewhere for my benefit, to be given to me.\nQ. In any event? A. Yes; in the event of Wheler being unseated. But I did not believe a word of it. I was told by the Rev. Mr. Young in Port Perry that the thousand dollars was in cash. I was not told it by any other person. I did not have any talk with any person about getting a thousand dollars from Mr. Gibbs.\nQ. Nor any sum of money at all? A. No; nor any arrangement with Mr. Gibbs or anybody else. * * *\nQ. Have you not stated that a note for a thousand dollars has been put up as security for you? A. I have stated that I have heard so; I got that information. It was either a note or a thousand dollars put up by Mr. Gibbs; but I did not believe there was one single word of truth in it.\nQ. Did you discuss the question about getting this thousand dollars with any other person than the person from whom you heard that? A. I do not know that I have; I have told them that I heard this thousand dollars was put up.\nQ. Have you stated to any person that Mr. Gibbs was advised that it would not be safe, or that he could not be advised that it would be safe to pay you a thousand dollars till the trial was over? A. If I stated that I have no recollection of it. I will not undertake to state that I did not state it; I may have stated a thing of that kind. It was not true if I stated it, because I have no authority for saying anything of the kind.\nQ. Have you received any assurance from any person that they held any security for you of any kind? A. I have not.\nQ. Or that a promise has been made to them? A. No; I may have stated that it was so. I felt that I had been badly sold, and I knew that a good many of my enemies were chuckling over it, that they had secured my influence in this election, and that I had worked for the purpose of getting a thousand dollars, and they were getting my work for nothing and were laughing at me; and I wanted to make them believe I was not so badly sold as they thought I was. I do not recollect naming any person to whom this security was given.\nQ. Will you swear that you have not stated that Mr. M. C. Cameron held a note as security for you? A. I do not think I ever said any such thing.\nQ. Will you swear that you did not state that Mr. Cameron had promised that he would hold a note for you? A. I do not think I ever stated that; I won't swear that I did not. I will tell you the explanaton of that,\nQ. Then you do recollect that you stated it? A. No, I do not, if there was anything stated about it. There was a person very much interested in this matter\u2014I think it was my own brother; and he came to me to ask if I would be satisfied if I got my money in this matter, and if I would give up the papers; and I told him I had put the papers in Mr. Cameron's hands, and that they could do just as they pleased about the matter; I would get my money any way. And I may have said something of that kind to my eldest son. They thought I had been swindled from beginning to end; and I let it go out as a general report.\nQ. Did you ever state to any person that Mr. Gibbs had been advised that he could not pay any money on it, but that a note could be deposited which would be security for you? A. I do not recollect saying anything of the kind.\nQ. Then the long and short of the matter is, that you may have told a good many lies about this matter? A. That is very true, that I may have told a good many stories about it. I never had a promise from Mr. Gibbs himself in my life.\nI will not pursue the very unpleasant enquiry further as to this branch of the case.\nI have no doubt Hurd intended from the first to make money by the election, and having worked hard at the election, and the party he supported having been successful, he, no doubt, expected his services would be recognized and rewarded, but that there was any bargain or contract to that effect his evidence fails to convince me; and when he found he could not extract money from Wheler, which he evidently hoped to force from him, by making him and his friends believe he could upset the election and implicate Wheler, he determined to get money from the other side by making them believe the same thing, and by selling to them his services to upset the election, and he appears in reference to this to have been no more truthful then than he was when looking to the successful party for remuneration. It is to me painful to think that any professional man in the Dominion should present himself in such a scandalous light before any judicial tribunal.\nIf there ever was a self-discredited witness, I am sorry to be compelled to say that Hurd must be looked on as such.\nMr. Justice Blackburn in the Stafford case[13] says:\nThere is a peculiar class of evidence occurring upon these election petitions, I mean that of witnesses who, in a criminal court, one would call self-discrediting witnesses, spies, informers and persons guilty of crime, according to their own story, who come to seek the reward that is to be got by telling the truth the other way. In a criminal court a verdict of guilty would never be permitted upon the evidence of such witnesses without confirmation, - that has long ago been established. In a civil court, though they are looked upon with distrust, there is no absolute necessity that they should be confirmed. In such enquiries as these we must look upon it with considerable distrust, but still treat it as information which may be true. It calls upon the other side to give evidence of how it was. In that way these witnesses are valuable, but, as a general rule, they should not be made the staple of a case or be too much relied upon.\nUpon such contradicted discredited testimony I can adjudge no man a quasi criminal, subject him to penalties, and take away his civil rights and disgrace him in the eyes of his fellow subjects.\nIt then becomes necessary to determine whether, adopting Mr. Wheler's view, he has been guilty of bribery. I shall not discuss whether or not, under the law as it now is, candidates may, or may not, legally employ and pay for the expenses and services of canvassers and orators to place their views and the views of their party before the electors individually or collectively at public meetings, with a view of influencing the constituency in favor of a particular candidate, or of inducing the public to look favorably on any particular policy either of the great parties in the country may be upholding, because, if illegal to do so, I think Mr. Wheler made no corrupt bargain with a view to the purchase of either Hurd's influence or services.\nWheler's arrangement amounted to no more, as I read the evidence, than this: I am anxious to have your vote and support, (as, of course, he would to have that of a majority of the electors, without which he could not succeed,) but I am determined to gain the election by legitimate means, and not to resort to any illegal practice which could affect the election. I do not know whether it will be legal or illegal to pay your travelling expenses, but if legal to do so I will do it. And he does not do it, surely then he made no corrupt bargain to pay, if he could not legally pay, and he made no payment. Where then was the breach of the law? Where a corrupt bargain? In what did the bribery consist? Surely the promise to do a thing, if it can be legally done, cannot amount to a corrupt or to a criminal act? And if the act is illegal, if it is not done, and if he never made a promise to do it, if illegal, it is beyond my comprehension to understand how a party who never promised to do an illegal or corrupt act, and never did the act alleged to be illegal and corrupt, can be adjudged guilty of a breach of sub-sec. 3 of sec 92, Dominion Elections Act of 1874. The arrangement contemplated was, I think, as the weight of evidence shows, entered into by Wheler with the bon\u00e2 fide object of securing services which might be legitimately rendered, and in connection therewith to pay only what could be legally paid, and was not with a view of purchasing influence or corrupting, or unduly influencing the electors.\nBut it has been urged, that there was a corrupt payment made by Wheler to Hurd of $1.50. Hurd says:\nAfter a meeting at which I was, I asked Mr. Wheler for some money, I told him I was out of it, and he gave me a dollar and a half.\nWheler's account of the transaction is this; he says:\nHurd said I did not expect to come to this meeting this evening, and I have not enough money; I wish you would let me have enough to pay the expenses of my horse at Sunderland. I think he said Sunderland, and I gave him a dollar or two, that was all the money I ever gave him.\nIf this money was given for the purpose of bribing Hurd, though the amount may seem small, if the act of bribery was clearly established, I should not, as at present advised, go into the question of the comparative insignificance of the act of bribery. But I cannot think, when a man unexpectedly finds himself away from home, without money to pay for the care of his horse, and applies to a person with whom he is acting in concert in a common cause for a small sum, such as this, to enable him to pay for the expenses of his horse, this ought to be tortured into an unlawful act of bribery. I do not think it can be considered to be done with any corrupt intent to bribe the party to whom it was advanced, or to purchase his influence, or that it was given or received with any intention on either side of producing any effect on the election. I think if this could be held an act of bribery sufficient to upset an election and disqualify a candidate, I might say as Martin, B., said in the Salford case[14] \"it seems to me the law would be brought into contempt and ridicule.\"\nThe following cases enunciate principles applicable to this case: The Lambeth case[15] referred to by Willes, J., in the Coventry case[16]:\nA payment to some person who has great influence in a place in order to purchase that influence, * * * must be a payment or gift or loan of something valuable to him in consideration of his lending his influence or his assistance in the election * * * You must show an intention to do that which is against the law before you bring the case within any of those highly penal clauses of the corrupt practices prevention Act, 1854.\nIn the Westminster case[17] Baron Martin says:\nThe first inquiry that I have made in every case is, whether it has been proved to my satisfaction that the candidate really and bon\u00e2 fide intended that the election should be conducted according to law.\nIn the Lichfield case[18] Willes J., says:\nTo prove a corrupt promise, as good evidence is required of that promise illegally made as would be required if the promise were a legal one to sustain an action by B. against the respondent, upon B. voting for him, for not procuring or trying to procure him a place in the hospital.\nSir Wm. Richards, C. J., in the Kingston case[19], citing the Tamworth case and Willes' J.'s, observations[20], says:\nThat Act is to be construed as any other penal statute, and the respondent must be proved guilty by the same kind of evidence as applies to penal proceedings.\n* * * * * *\nPetitioner should prove his allegations affirmatively by satisfactory evidence[21].\nIn the Warrington case[22] Baron Martin said:\nI adhere to what Mr. Justice Willes said at Lichfield, that a Judge to upset an election ought to be satisfied beyond all doubt, that the election was altogether void, and that the return of a member is a serious matter and not to be lightly set aside.\nIn the Londonderry case[23], Mr. Justice O'Brien says: The charge of bribery, whether by a candidate or his agent, is one which should be established by clear and satisfactory evidence, the consequences resulting from such a charge being established being very serious.\nAfter referring to what Baron Martin said in the Coventry case and Justice Willes in the Lichfield case, and the severe penalties for the offence, he says:\nMere suspicion, therefore, will not be sufficient to establish a charge of bribery, and a Judge in discharging the duty imposed upon him by the statute, acting in the double capacity of Judge and Juror, should not hold that charge established upon evidence which, in his opinion, Would not be sufficient to warrant a jury in finding the charge proved.\nTherefore, I think, in this case the appeal should be allowed.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nSur les deux questions soulev\u00e9es par le present appel il ne reste plus \u00e0 d\u00e9cider maintenant que celle de savoir si l'appelant s'est personnellement rendu coupable de men\u00e9es corruptrices; l'autre, au sujet de la constitutionalit\u00e9 de l'acte des \u00e9lections contest\u00e9es de 1874 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e dans la cause de Valin v. Langlois.\nAfin de d\u00e9terminer, non-seulement si l'appelant s'est rendu coupable des faits qui lui sont reproch\u00e9s, mais pour d\u00e9cider la question plus importante encore de savoir si les faits en question constituent une offense pr\u00e9vue et d\u00e9finie par l'acte des \u00e9lections de 1874, il est n\u00e9cessaire de faire une courte exposition de ces faits. Il y en a deux versions tout-\u00e0-fait contradictoires\u2014l'une donn\u00e9e par l'appelant et l'autre par P. A. Hurd, qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet de l'acte de corruption imput\u00e9 au premier. L'hon juge Armour n'a point d\u00e9cid\u00e9 laquelle des deux il croyait la v\u00e9ritable, parce que cela n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 son point de vue. Prenant pour admis les faits tel que racont\u00e9s par l'appelant lui-m\u00eame, il en a conclu qu'ils \u00e9taient suffisants pour prouver que ce dernier s'\u00e9tait rendu coupable de l'offense que l'hon. juge d\u00e9signe par les termes de bribery of influence.\nL'appelant Wheler, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en nomination comme candidat du parti lib\u00e9ral aux \u00e9lections de 1878, pour le comt\u00e9 de North Ontario, apprit par Jos. McClelland que P. A. Hurd de Port Perry, avocat et orateur politique d'une certaine importance, qui avait jusque-l\u00e0 donn\u00e9 son appui au parti conservateur, paraissait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 supporter sa candidature; qu'il \u00e9tait dans tous les cas d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 opposer celle de M. Gibbs, et qu'il \u00e9tait contre la \"Politique Nationale\" sur laquelle se faisait en grande partie la lutte \u00e9lectorale de cette \u00e9poque. McClelland dit de plus:\nHurd told me he would support him (Wheler) if he had his expenses paid; that he would support him, and go and speak for him if he was remunerated for doing so.\nWheler r\u00e9pondit \u00e0 cette information en disant \u00e0 McClelland qu'il pensait remporter l'\u00e9lection et qu'il ne voulait rien faire qui p\u00fbt la compromettre,\u2014mais qu'il ferait avec Hurd ce qui \u00e9tait juste et l\u00e9gal.\nC'est dans une rencontre fortuite sur le steamboat \"Empress of India\" que Hurd avait fait de lui-m\u00eame ces d\u00e9clarations \u00e0 McClelland qui, \u00e0 lademande de Hurd, les communiqua ensuite \u00e0 l'appelant. Celui-ci d\u00e9clare formellement n'avoir jamais autoris\u00e9 McClelland \u00e0 faire aucune d\u00e9marche ni aucune offre dans le but de s'assurer les services de Hurd. Il d\u00e9clare de plus n'avoir eu avec M. McClelland que ce seul entretien avant l'\u00e9lection et n'avoir eu non plus avec lui aucune communication par lettres au sujet de l'\u00e9lection,\nWheler, ainsi renseign\u00e9 sur les dispositions de Hurd, a naturellement cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 le rencontrer. Vers le 10 ao\u00fbt, il se rendit \u00e0 son bureau et eut avec lui un entretien dont il donne la substance comme suit:\nI asked his support, and then he stated that he had not exactly decided what course he would take; would not do so for a week. He was going to the States; I think he said he would be away a week or two, and after he came back he would decide what he would do. He asked me my views. He said it depended much on my views on the National Policy\u2014if I was in accord with him. He wanted me to give him my opinion on certain points. I did so, and he said, \"Well, we are nearly in accord;\" and he said, \"I am determined not to support Mr. Gibbs after what he has done.\" I asked him then, \"Will you give me your support?\" He said he would not decide then. He said he had some business matter to arrange before he would give anybody to understand what he would do; he had some business to arrange with Conservative parties; I think he said parties who would give him trouble after he announced himself. He stated that he was going over to the States for some information respecting Protection, and if he decided to take any action in the matter, he would require his personal expenses to be defrayed by me if he addressed meetings. He asked me what I would require him to do. I said, if he took hold of the matter it would be to address meetings only. I told him I would want him to address meetings if my Reform friends decided to engage him to do it or to accept him. Nothing more was said about terms\u2014nothing about amount. He asked me whether I would want him to hold meetings generally throughout the riding or in any locality. He said, \"If I do take hold of the matter, I propose to hold a meeting at Port Perry in the first place, or at Uxbridge Village;\" and he said,\" I wish to take control of the meeting.\" He would not allow anybody to address the meeting but himself; and that he would take up about two or three hours, and not refer to Mr. Gibbs or anybody else.\n* * * * * *\nThere was nothing more said about expenses at that time. He stated it was quite correct and proper, and legal, for me to pay his legal expenses. I stated if it was, and if our people decided to accept him as speaker for us, I would pay whatever was legal and proper towards his legal expenses; that was not to cover his trip to the States; it was understood to be his travelling expenses. There was not a word said about paying him for speaking. Then we parted without any definite understanding.\n* * * * * *\nI had not any conversation about this matter with him again. My understanding was that my party had accepted him, and that I was willing to pay his personal expenses. I thought his personal expenses would cover his conveyance, the printing, and his own personal expenses. He did not say anything about his time at the interview. Les faits qui ressortent de ce t\u00e9moignage, sont que l'appellant est all\u00e9 solliciter le vote de Hurd; qu'apr\u00e8s un \u00e9change de vues sur les principales questions du jour, ce dernier s'est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 satisfait des opinions de Wheler, mais en remettant toutefois \u00e0 plus tard sa d\u00e9cision sur le parti qu'il prendrait dans l'\u00e9lection. Il est vrai qu'il a fait conna\u00eetre alors que dans le cas o\u00f9 il parlerait aux assembl\u00e9es publiques, il exigerait le paiement de ses d\u00e9penses personnelles,\u2014en faisant remarquer que Wheler pouvait le faire l\u00e9galement\u2014\"He stated it was quite correct and proper and legal for me to pay his legal expenses.\" Hurd n'est pas encore pr\u00eat \u00e0 se prononcer et ne s'engage \u00e0 rien. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9 l'appellant d\u00e9clare que s'il peut l\u00e9galement payer les d\u00e9penses l\u00e9gales de Hurd, et si ses amis acceptent son concours, il fera ce qui est l\u00e9gal et convenable au sujet des d\u00e9penses l\u00e9gales. Par les expressions d\u00e9penses l\u00e9gales,, il entend les d\u00e9penses personnelles de Hurd.\nQu'est-ce qu'il y a dans tout ceci qui prouve une offre, une promesse, ou autre fait quelconque d\u00e9clar\u00e9 men\u00e9e corruptrice par la sec. 92 de l'acte des \u00e9lections de 1874? Rien; \u00e0 moins que la d\u00e9claration faite par Wheler de s'engager conditionnellement \u00e0 ne payer que ce que la loi permettait de payer, ne soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une offense. L'offre de Wheler ne va pas au-del\u00e0. Il est inutile d'argumenter pour prouver qu'une telle promesse, m\u00eame si elle e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e, ne constitue pas une offense contre la loi \u00e9lectorale.\nD'apr\u00e8s la version de Hurd, l'appelant au lieu de se borner \u00e0 promettre de lui payer ses d\u00e9pense personnelles, se serait au contraire engag\u00e9 \u00e0 lui faire avoir $400 pendant l'\u00e9lection, et dix jours apr\u00e8s, une autre somme de $600, dans le cas de succ\u00e8s. Il n'y a d'autre preuve de ce fait que son propre t\u00e9moignage auquel, pour les raisons donn\u00e9es par l'hon. juge en chef, il m'est imposible d'ajouter aucune foi. D'ailleurs, l'Hon. Juge Armour ayant trouv\u00e9 les faits tels que rapport\u00e9s par Wheler suffisants pour constituer l'offense dont il l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable, je crois qu'il est peu utile d'entrer dans une longue discussion sur ce t\u00e9moignage. Il me suffira, je pense, d'examiner la question de savoir si les faits reconnus par Wheler constitue l'offense de bribery of influence.\nIl faut d'abord remarquer que dans l'entrevue rapport\u00e9e plus haut, bien que Wheler admette avoir sollicit\u00e9 le vote de Hurd, il n'y a absolument aucune preuve que cette demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 accompagn\u00e9e de promesse qui puisse en faire une offense contre la loi \u00e9lectorale. Le fait que Hurd \u00e9tait voteur n'est entr\u00e9 pour aucune consid\u00e9ration dans l'offre conditionnelle de payer ses d\u00e9penses personnelles. Ce paiement devait \u00eatre seulement de ses d\u00e9penses pour assister et parler aux assembl\u00e9es publiques\u2014et nullement pour son vote, ni pour les d\u00e9penses qu'il aurait pu faire pour se rendre au poll pour y donner son vote. Il n'en a \u00e9t\u00e9 nullement question. Il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 non plus aucunement question de l'influence que Hurd pouvait avoir sur qui que ce soit, autrement que par la discussion publique comme orateur de husting. Il ne devait recevoir pour ses services comme tel aucun autre avantage que le paiement de ses d\u00e9penses personnelles de voyage. Il ne devait rien recevoir pour l'indemniser de la perte de son temps, du trouble et des fatigues que lui imposerait cette t\u00e2che. Il n'avait d'autre int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 l'accepter que celui de faire triompher ses vues particuli\u00e8res sur la \"Politique Nationale,\" et sans doute aussi la satisfaction d'un ressentiment qu'il \u00e9prouvait contre M. Gibbs pour quelques griefs personnels. D\u00e9gag\u00e9e des circonstances mentionn\u00e9es plus haut, la question se r\u00e9duit \u00e0 savoir si l'offre conditionnellement faite de payer les d\u00e9penses personnelles de Hurd pour assister et parler aux assembl\u00e9es publiques en faveur de la candidature de Wheler, (appelant) constituait l'offense de bribery of influence, C'est sur le parag. 3 de la sec. 92, de l'acte des \u00e9lections de 1874, que l'hon. juge s'est appuy\u00e9 pour arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que le fait d'avoir offert de payer les d\u00e9penses personnelles de Hurd, comme orateur \u00e9lectoral constituait l'offense en question. Il est en ces termes:\nEvery person who directly or indirectly, by himself or by any other person on his behalf, makes any gift, loan, offer, promise, procurement or agreement as aforesaid, to or for any person in order to induce such person to procure or endeavor to procure the return of any person to serve in the House of Commons, or the vote of any voter at any election.......\nCette disposition est textuellement la m\u00eame que celle de l'acte Imp\u00e9rial 17 et 18 Vict., ch. 102, sec. 2, clause 3. Le juge Willes, dont l'autorit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9e par l'hon. juge Armour, en commentant cette section, dans la cause de Coventry[24], dit que toute chose donn\u00e9e \u00e0 quelqu'un pour acheter (to purchase) son influence \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection est indubitablement un acte de corruption. L'hon. juge Armour tire de cette autorit\u00e9 la conclusion suivante:\nNor does it make any difference under what name the promised money is to be paid, whether for speeches to be made or for influence to be exerted in any other way, and whether for loss of time and inconvenience, or for travelling or other expenses, the law is equally violated in one case as in the others.\nLe principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par le juge Willes est sans doute correct, mais l'application qui en est faite est-elle justifiable d'apr\u00e8s le fait ci-dessus qui me semblent les seuls \u00e9tablis d'une mani\u00e8re suffisante par la preuve.\nL'influence de Hurd a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9e? comment? et pour quelle consid\u00e9ration? A-t-il pour quelque motif int\u00e9ress\u00e9 chang\u00e9 ses opinions politiques? Non. On a bien la preuve que dans les \u00e9lections ant\u00e9rieures il soutenait le parti conservateur. Mais dans celle dont il s'agit, il est \u00e9vident qu'il n'a chang\u00e9 de parti politique que par suite du changement des circonstances politiques. Il cessait d'\u00eatre d'accord avec son parti sur un point important, il d\u00e9clare qu'il ne votera pas pour le candidat de son parti. Il fait cette d\u00e9claration \u00e0 plusieurs reprises avant d'avoir avec Wheler l'entretien rapport\u00e9 plus haut. Le changement d'opinion n'est le r\u00e9sultat d'aucune influence \u00e9trang\u00e8re.\nLa question politique du jour est nouvelle\u2014elle se pr\u00e9sente pour la premi\u00e8re fois devant les \u00e9lecteurs,\u2014et en exer\u00e7ant son libre jugement il se trouve divis\u00e9 d'opinion d'avec son parti. Sa s\u00e9paration est faite et avou\u00e9e avant sa rencontre avec McClelland et avec Wheler, plus tard. Il est tout-\u00e0-fait impossible d'apr\u00e8s la preuve d'attribuer cette modification de son opinion aux entretiens qu'il a eus avec ces derniers, puisque ce changement est ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque. Ce n'est donc par aucune des consid\u00e9rations que Wheler et McClelland ont pu faire valoir que ce changement a \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9.\nIl est vrai que Wheler consentait \u00e0 certaines conditions, dans le cas o\u00f9 Hurd parlerait aux assembl\u00e9es publiques, \u00e0 lui payer ses d\u00e9penses personnelles. Mais cette promesse n'\u00e9tant faite qu'apr\u00e8s le changement d'opinion avou\u00e9 par Hurd, peut-on dire qu'elle est une de celles que la loi avait en vue d'atteindre par la sec. 92? Hurd doit-il recevoir un avantage personnel, est-il indemnis\u00e9 pour l'exercice de son talent oratoire, pour la perte de son temps, les troubles et les fatigues in\u00e9vitables d'une pareille t\u00e2che? Non. Il ne doit absolument rien recevoir pour cela. Il sera seulement indemnis\u00e9 de ses d\u00e9penses de voyage. Peut-on dire que cette indemnit\u00e9 ait pu l'engager \u00e0 donner \u00e0 Wheler un appui qu'il ne lui aurait pas donn\u00e9 sans cela? Il est \u00e9vident qu'il n'avait aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 le faire.\nIl est certain que si le 3e parag. de la sec. 92 devait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la lettre, et si la signification g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et \u00e9tendue dont il para\u00eet susceptible ne devait \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e par d'autre section de l'acte, le simple fait de payer les d\u00e9penses personnelles d'un orateur supportant une candidature, serait prohib\u00e9 par cette section. Car il n'est pas douteux que le but d'un orateur dans ce cas est d'assurer ou du moins de s'efforcer d'assurer le retour du candidat qu'il supporte, in order to induce such person to procure or endeavour to procure the return of any person to serve in the House of Commons.\nMais est-il vrai que toutes d\u00e9penses quelconques sont prohib\u00e9es? Le proviso qui termine cette m\u00eame section autorise en ces termes le paiement de certaines d\u00e9penses.\nProvided always that the actual personal expenses of any candidate, his expenses for actual professional services performed, and bona fide payments for the fair costs of printing and advertising shall be held to be expenses lawfully incurred, and the payment thereof shall not be a contravention to this Act.\nDans la cause de Coventry, le juge Willes, commentant le m\u00eame proviso de la 17e et 18e Vic., ch. 102, autorisant comme notre acte d'\u00e9lection le paiement de certaines d\u00e9penses d'\u00e9lections reconnues comme l\u00e9gales, dit \u00e0 propos de l'effet de ce proviso sur la 3e sec:\nWe have here, therefore, a test supplied of the meaning of the third clause of the second section, by means of which we see that it was not intended by this section to do away with every payment made by the candidate in the course of an election. And to come more nearly to the present case, it affords a test of whether this third clause was intended to prevent every payment to persons for assisting the candidate in obtaining the election.\nCe raisonnement appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation de la sec. 3 et du proviso ci-dessus, qui sont de m\u00eame nature que les dispositions du statut criminel comment\u00e9es par l'hon. juge Willes, doivent nous conduire comme lui \u00e0 une conclusion contraire \u00e0 celle de l'hon juge Armour en cette cause; en effet, dans la cause de Coventry, l'hon. juge Willes conclut ainsi:\u2014\nTherefore, forming the best judgment I can, I must pronounce my opinion as I entertain it that to bring forward another candidate under such circumstances, without a view to purchase his influence, with the intention of serving a man's party, and because he does not mind spending his money upon the legitimate expenses of the election of himself and of the other candidate, with the view only to serve his party, and not with the view to purchase influence for himself, does not fall within that third clause of the 17 and 18 Vic., ch. 102, sec. 2. * * *\nTherefore, I come' to the conclusion that the fair payments of the expenses of a member, if he will stand, does not of itself constitute an illegality under the provisions of this Act.\nIl y a une grande similitude entre ce cas et celui dont il s'agit en cette cause; dans le premier, c'est un candidat auquel on promettait de payer ses d\u00e9penses l\u00e9gales d'\u00e9lection afin d'avoir son influence et son concours pour assurer, dans un int\u00e9r\u00eat de parti, l'\u00e9lection de deux membres. Dans celui-ci, c'est un orateur d'\u00e9lection poss\u00e9dant une certaine influence comme tel, auquel on promet de payer ses d\u00e9penses personnelles pour assister aux assembl\u00e9es publiques et y discuter les questions politiques du jour. Il y a une si grande analogie entre ces deux cas que si le paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9gal dans l'un il est clair qu'il doit \u00e9galement l'\u00eatre dans l'autre.\nA part du proviso ci-dessus cit\u00e9, il y a encore la sec. 73 qui admet le paiement de certains services rendus \u00e0 propos d'\u00e9lections, en d\u00e9clarant seulement que ceux qui re\u00e7oivent une remun\u00e9ration pour leurs services n'auront pas le droit de voter; et que si leur vote a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 il en sera retranch\u00e9 un au candidat qui les a employ\u00e9s. Elle est ainsi con\u00e7ue:\n73. Where a candidate on the trial of an election petition claiming the seat for any person, is proved to have been guilty by himself or by any person on his behalf, of bribery, treating, or undue influence in respect of any person who voted at such election, or where any person who voted at such election, or where any person retained or employed for reward by or on behalf of such candidate for all or any of the purposes of such election; as agent, clerk, messenger, or in any other employment, is proved on such trial to have voted at such election, there shall on the trial of such election petition be struck on from the number of votes appearing, to have been given to such candidate, one vote for every person who voted at such election, and is proved to have been so bribed, treated, or unduly influenced, or so retained or employed for reward as aforesaid.\nCette section introduite dans l'acte des elections de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec, a \u00e9t\u00e9, dans la cause de Gingras v. Sheyn[25] l'objet de savants commentaires de la part de l'Hon. juge en chef de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de Qu\u00e9bec, dont l'exp\u00e9rience \u00e9gale le savoir. On avait soulev\u00e9 dans cette cour la question de savoir si l'emploi et le paiement de bonne foi d'un cabaleur (canvasser) ne constituait pas une men\u00e9e corruptrice. On se fondait pour \u00e9tablir cette proposition sur le parag. 3 de la sec. 249, qui est identiquement le m\u00eame que celui de l'acte des \u00e9lections de la Puissance. Dans une savante dissertation, trop longue pour \u00eatre cit\u00e9e ici, mais \u00e0 laquelle je r\u00e9f\u00e8re comme parfaitement applicable \u00e0 la cause actuelle, l'hon. juge conclut ainsi:\u2014\nI necessarily come to the conclusion that we must reject the first proposition submitted by the petitioners, and hold, that the employment and payment bona fide of an elector as canvasser is not a corrupt practice so as to avoid the election, although an elector employed ought not to vote, and may be prevented from voting under sec. No. 167 of our Act.\nDans le cours de ses observations au sujet de la sec. 250, qui est la m\u00eame que le proviso de la sec. 92, il s'exprime ainsi:\u2014\nIt can hardly be contended that the object of this enactment was to render all payments illegal, excepting personal expenses, professional services and necessary printing; for, according to that interpretation, as pointed out by the learned counsel for the respondent, a candidate could not pay for a committee room, or for a secretary, or messenger for a committee, nor even the disbursements of the agent to be appointed under the law.\nIf, as I think, the section No. 250, was not intended to render illegal all payments excepting those which it expressly legalizes, then, I think, it must have the meaning contended for in the supplementary factum for the respondent. Cette d\u00e9cision a maintenu que le paiement fait \u00e0 un cabaleur employ\u00e9 de bonne foi n'est pas contraire \u00e0 la loi. Il est \u00e9vident que ce n'est pas une contravention \u00e0 la sec. 73 de l'acte des \u00e9lections de la Puissance. Cependant l'hon. juge Armour dit:\u2014\nThe hiring of orators and of canvassers, is, in my opinion, outside of what is permitted by the proviso, and is within the very words of sub-section 3, and is therefore bribery.\nSon attention ne me semble pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 attir\u00e9e sur la sec. 73. Il est clair que d'apr\u00e8s cette section il y a un grand nombre de services pour les fins d'une \u00e9lection qui peuvent \u00eatre l\u00e9gitiment pay\u00e9s. L'\u00e9num\u00e9ration qui en est faite dans le proviso de la sec 92, n'est pas restrictive. Si, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9, en vertu de cette section un cabaleur peut \u00eatre pay\u00e9 de ses services, pourvu qu'il ne vote pas, pourquoi un orateur qui fait publiquement ce que fait priv\u00e9ment le cabaleur ne le serait-il pas aussi?\nLes services d'un avocat qui est en m\u00eame temps orateur politique ne peuvent-ils pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des services professionnels dont le paiement serait l\u00e9gitime d'apr\u00e8s le proviso de la sec 92? Les fonctions de l'avocat sont-elles n\u00e9cessairement limit\u00e9s aux plaidoiries devant les tribunaux? Certainement non. Leurs services sont fr\u00e9quemment requis devant des bureaux d'affaires, conseils municipaux, etc. De plus, les termes de la sec. 73 ne sont-ils pas assez \u00e9tendus pour comprendre le cas dont il s'agit: \"Any person retained or employed for reward by or on behalf of such candidate for all or any other purposes of such election, as agent, clerk, messenger, or in auy other employment.\"\nLa seule p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 que prononce cette section contre ceux qui sont ainsi employ\u00e9s est la perte du vote, et contre celui qui les emploie, le retranchement de leur vote dans le cas o\u00f9 ils ont vot\u00e9. Il n'y en pas d'autre. Le fait dont il s'agit en cette cause n'est donc pas une offense contre la loi d'\u00e9lection; d\u00e9clarer qu'il en est une, ce serait aller contre la lettre et l'esprit de la loi, et imposer \u00e0 la libre discussion des affaires publiques une restriction qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e.\nIl est vrai que depuis la d\u00e9cision de l'hon. juge en chef Meredith, l'acte d'\u00e9lection de Qu\u00e9bec a \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re a rendre ill\u00e9gal l'emploi de cabaleurs pay\u00e9s; mais l'acte d'\u00e9lection de la Puissance n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 l'argumentation de l'hon. le juge en chef n'en a pas moins d'application \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause, la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9tant la m\u00eame que celle sur laquelle il a rendu le jugement ci-dessus cit\u00e9.\nCette question du paiement des d\u00e9penses des orateurs politiques en temps d'\u00e9lection a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration des tribunaux dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, dans la cause de Benoit et al v. Jodoin[26]. La port\u00e9e de cette d\u00e9cision est en faveur de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 du paiement des d\u00e9penses des orateurs, quoique dans le cas particulier il n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme l\u00e9gitimement fait. La raison en est que sous pr\u00e9texte d'\u00eatre des orateurs soutenant la candidature de Jodoin, un grand nombre de personnes s'\u00e9tait fait h\u00e9berger, par un h\u00f4telier du nom de Gibeau, sans avoir rendu aucun service en cette qualit\u00e9. Gibeau appel\u00e9 \u00e0 s'expliquer sur le compte de leurs d\u00e9penses qui se montait \u00e0 la somme de $362 .30, d\u00e9clare:\nQu'il n'a aucun d\u00e9tail m\u00eame dans son livre de m\u00e9moire, dont il a fait dispara\u00eetre les feuillets aussit\u00f4t qu'il eut donn\u00e9 son compte. Il pr\u00e9tend qu'il y avait huit ou dix de ces orateurs, qui venaient chez lu tous les jours. Cependant plus loin il reconna\u00eet qu'il y en avait quelquefois moins, quelquefois plus; mais il ne leur a jamais fait de questions, ni leur a demand\u00e9 d'o\u00f9 ils venaient. Il suffisait qu'une personne se dit orateur de Jodoin pour \u00eatre h\u00e9berg\u00e9e. De tous ces orateurs, il ne peut en nommer qu'un seul. Il est impossible de contr\u00f4ler son compte et de dire que ces d\u00e9penses n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites que pour services professionnels en faveur du d\u00e9fendeur, les seuls qui pourraient \u00eatre tol\u00e9r\u00e9s et \u00e9chapper \u00e0 la prohibition de traiter, contenu dans le statut\nIl est \u00e9vident d'apr\u00e8s cette derni\u00e8re observation que si dans ce cas on s'\u00e9tait born\u00e9 \u00e0 payer la d\u00e9pense personnelle de ceux qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9s de bonne fois comme orateurs pour faire valoir la candidature de Jodoin, l'hon. juge aurait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les services professionnels \u00e9chappaient \u00e0 la prohibition du statut.\nFaisant application \u00e0 la cause actuelle des principes expos\u00e9s plus haut, j'en viens \u00e0 la conclusion que la promesse faite par Wheler de payer \u00e0 Hurd ses d\u00e9penses personnelles pour assister aux assembl\u00e9es publiques, pendant l'\u00e9lection, pour y discuter les questions publiques, comme orateur politique, n'est pas une d\u00e9pense d\u00e9clar\u00e9e ill\u00e9gale par le statut.\nQuant \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me accusation port\u00e9e contre McClelland comme agent de Wheler\u2014je suis d'opinion qu'il n'existe aucune preuve de cette agence; Wheler n'a ni autoris\u00e9 ni approuv\u00e9 ni ratifi\u00e9 les d\u00e9marches faites par McClelland aupr\u00e8s de Hurd. La suggestion de payer celui-ci $10.00 par assembl\u00e9e \u00e9mane de McClelland seul, et n'a jamais eu la moindre approbation de Wheler.\nQuant \u00e0 la remise par Wheler \u00e0 Hurd d'une somme de $1.50 pour payer les d\u00e9penses de sa voiture, dans une circonstance o\u00f9 ils se sont fortuitement rencontr\u00e9s, je partage enti\u00e8rement l'opinion exprim\u00e9e \u00e0 ce sujet par l'hon. juge en chef, croyant comme lui que dans les circonstances o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait cet acte n'a rien de bl\u00e2mable.\nPour toutes ces raisons je suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre allou\u00e9.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThe charge against the appellant in this case is called by the learned judge, who tried the petition \"bribery of influence,\" and it is necessary in the first place to ascertain what the law is as to that particular offence. It is alleged to be an offence under sub-sec. 3 of sec. 92 of The Dominion Elections Act, 1874, and under the provision of that section the learned judge found against him. The section commences with the declaration that\u2014\nThe following persons shall be deemed guilty of bribery, and shall be punished accordingly.\nSub-section 3:\u2014\nEvery person who directly or indirectly by himself, or by any other person on his behalf, makes any gift, loan, promise, procurement or agreement as aforesaid, to or for any person in order to induce such person to procure, or endeavour to procure, the re turn of any person to serve in the House of Commons, or the vote of any voter at any election.\nUnder the leading provision of the section, the offences enumerated are stated to be bribery; and by section 102 the election of a candidate found guilty of bribery or undue influence shall be void, and the candidate so found guilty be incapable of being again elected for seven years, or of voting at any election, or holding an office in the nomination of the Crown, or of the Governor in Canada.\nThe consequences of a conviction are therefore very serious and penal, and consequently the proof should leave no reasonable doubt before such should be adjudged. Where the offence charged is not a payment of money, or the giving of some other valuable consideration, but a mere offer or promise of such, the evidence by all well established authorities requires to be irresistibly strong and explicit, for the reason that misapprehensions often arise on the part of one person as to the meaning of what another may say.\nThe circumstances of this case are very peculiar. The candidate was not the moving party, but the witness Hurd. He commenced by informing a friend of the appellant (Mr. McClelland of the South Riding) that he was opposed to what was known as the National Policy, which had been adopted by the respondent, and expressed his readiness to address meetings against him and it. He was apparently prepared to aid the appellant and give him ordinary support. Subsequently Mr. McClelland communicated what Hurd said to the appellant, but the latter alleges that he did not ask McClelland to say anything to Hurd on the subject. When McClelland told the appellant that Hurd would likely be willing to address meetings if his expenses were paid, he replied that he was not prepared to give any answer; that he was not aware whether the law would allow him to pay any expenses; that he was looking for information on that point, and that until he got that information he would not give any answer whatever. He says:\nI did not ask him to go and see Mr. Hurd, nor make him any such request, because I was not exactly favorable to receiving Mr. Hurd.\nAgain:\nI never heard from McClelland again about it. I never saw him again on that subject till the day of Mr. Glen's trial in Whitby. I never got a letter from Mr. McClelland on the subject, or wrote one to him.\nThis evidence is uncontradicted and may be considered reliable, and, if so, the appellant never in any way authorized McClelland to negociate with Hurd, and, as far as relates to the question before us, is in no way responsible for what took place between them. If he is responsible at all, it is for what he himself said or did.\nI have considered the whole evidence very carefully, and feel bound to rest my judgment upon that of the appellant alone as to the main point in issue. In doing so I am following the course of the learned judge who tried the petition. He seems to have placed no reliance on the testimony of Hurd or his son, and I am not surprised that he should have done so.\nThe appellant detailed the conversation he had with Hurd before the election about the 10th of August. He says:\nI called on him to solicit his vote. I did solicit it * * * I asked his support, and then he stated that he had not exactly decided what course he would take; would not do so for a week.\nThey then conversed about the \"National Policy\" and other points, after which Hurd said:\nWell, we are nearly in accord. I am determined not to support Mr. Gibbs after what he has done. I asked him then, will you give me your support? He said he would not decide then. * * * He asked me what I would require him to do? I said if he took hold of the matter, it would be to address meetings only. I told him I would want him to address meetings if my Reform friends decided to engage him to do it or to accept him. * * * He stated it was quite correct and proper and legal for me to pay his legal expenses I stated if it was, and if our people decided to accept him as speaker for us, I would pay whatever was legal and proper towards his legal expenses. * * It was understood to be his travelling expenses. There was not a word said about paying him for speaking. Then we parted without any definite understanding. The interview lasted about twenty minutes.\nThe appellant further says that he never had any interview at which it was arranged that Hurd's expenses should be paid, but subsequently says:\nAt our interview, I told him I was prepared to pay his legitimate expenses for addressing meetings, if the party accepted him. * * I had not any conversation about this matter with him again.\nThese extracts contain the substance of what the appellant said and did before and during the election, in regard to the matter which forms the charge under consideration. There is nothing to shew that Hurd was willing to accept at any time the repayment of his expenses, as the consideration for his holding and addressing meetings on behalf of the appellant. His letter to McClelland, of the 5th of August, shews clearly he would not have agreed to do so at the subsequent meeting with the appellant, even had the latter unconditionally offered such terms. There was no promise actually made, or indeed any definite understanding arrived at. Looking at the petition in this case, and the answer, it is impossible to discover what the charge is, and the case contains no particulars. Under such circumstances we have to look only to the judgment of the learned judge who tried the petition to see what it is. The offence then adjudicated upon is for having promised money to Hurd to hold and address meetings in the interest of the appellant. Does the evidence justify that finding? The evidence of what the appellant was willing to do after the election is not of much consequence. Such willingness to re-imburse Hurd would constitute in itself no offence, and unless in pursuance of a corrupt promise made before or during the election, re-imbursement by actual payment would be no offence. The subsequent circumstances would only be evidence to construe an ambiguous promise or understanding, but not to affect one where no such ambiguity exists. From the evidence, we see that the offer of Hurd's services was not induced in the first place, directly or indirectly, by the appellant. Hurd from the first was desirous of making money by means of his speaking qualifications at meetings. He commenced by a conversation with McClelland, who communicated with the appellant. The latter, from what he heard, expected Hurd's support, and called upon him and solicited it in the usual way, but the latter said he would not then decide, and would not until after he had visited the United States a week or two later. Then he asked the appellant what he would require him to do. He is the first to speak of his services. The appellant was not then prepared to make him any offer, but said he would want him to address meetings only. Hurd told him it was quite correct, and proper, and legal, for him to pay his legal expenses. If, then, the appellant engaged his services, and promised to pay his expenses, and that amounted in law to an offence, there would be sufficient evidence to sustain the charge, but what he said did not reach that point. There were two important qualifications and conditions contained in the reply \"I stated if it was,\" (referring to the statement of Hurd that it was) \"legal and proper to pay his expenses and if our people decided to accept him as a speaker for us, I would pay whatever was legal and proper towards his expenses.\" To recover on such a promise, proof would be necessary that the appellant could legally make the payment, and that his people had accepted the services. They must, therefore, have parted, as the appellant states, without any definite understanding, and how could, therefore, what passed be tortured into a promise, a definite and unconditional promise, which alone could militate against a candidate as being contrary to the statute; and when no subsequent interview or promise is shown, I feel myself unwarranted in finding that any corrupt practice is shown as the result of the interview in question.\nTaking this view of the evidence it is unnecessary to give any opinion as to the legal bearing of the question, whether it would be against the provision of the subsection mentioned, if a candidate bon\u00e2 fide agreed to pay the travelling expenses of one of his supporters to address meetings on his behalf. If, however, it be done to procure the support or influence of a party or his friends, it would no doubt be within it.\nThe small sum of one or two dollars advanced by the appellant to Hurd to pay for his bill at a hotel cannot, I think, have any necessary reference to what previously passed between them. It was given at the request of Hurd, who said he did not expect to have been at the meeting held by the appellant and respondent, and was without money. It was not one of the meetings held by Hurd, or one of those for addressing which he expected to be paid his expenses for holding. It would, I think, be making the law oppressive to unseat and disqualify a candidate for such an act.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and judgment given for the appellant with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion, with Mr. Justice Armour, who presided at the trial in this cause, that the hiring of electors as orators and canvassers is within the very words of sub-sec. 3 of sec. 92 of the Election Act, and is therefore bribery. Taking, then, Wheler's own version of the engagement with Hurd, this engagement was clearly illegal. Whether he thought it to be so or not does not make any difference. Corrupt practices in elections would easily be committed with impunity if courts of justice required their perpetrators to acknowledge under oath that they have acted with the intention to violate the law, before finding them guilty. The Quebec East election[27] has been referred to, as holding that the payment of canvassers is not a corrupt practice, under a statute similar to the one which rules this case. It is true, that it was so held in the case referred to, but what clearly shows that this decision was entirely opposed to the intentions of the legislature by which it was enacted is, that a few weeks after this decision they passed a special enactment[28], by which it is expressly ordered that the payment of canvassers shall be corrupt practices, and this, no doubt, to meet the point decided in the Quebec East election.\nBut, in the present case, I am of opinion further, that a gross case of bribery has been proved against Wheler. That Hurd sold himself to Wheler's party, with Wheler's knowledge, seems to me clearly proved. There is no doubt that Hurd is a witness of a very contemptible character, and that his evidence must be received with great caution. But there is, in my opinion, sufficient corroboration of his evidence to support the material parts of it. I need not refer at length here, to the depositions given by the witnesses. Mr. Justice Gwynne has done so, and having had communication of his notes, I can only say that I fully concur in all his views of the case. I will merely state, that the fact that Wheler, who knew all that Paxton could say in the matter, did not put him in the witness box, tells, in my mind, strongly against him. I think this appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nIt is painful to see a gentleman of the legal profession, a practitioner of upwards of eighteen years' standing, obliged to accuse himself in the unblushing manner in which the witness Hurd, in his evidence given under oath, has accused himself, of the infamy of selling his services and his influence to procure the return of the appellant as a member of parliament; but the picture which he has painted of his own infamy may serve to indicate the height to which corruption in parliamentary elections had reached, and the urgent necessity which there was for the stringent provisions enacted in the Dominion Election Acts of 1874, with a view to the purging and purifying the body politic from the odious plague spot. Of the fitness of the appellant to fill the high office to which he aspired, the venal advocate, upon his own shewing, seems to have known little. In a postscript to his letter of the 8th Oct., 1878, to Mr. McClelland, the convenient go-between, he says: If I had known this man as well before as I do now I would not have voted for him or worked for him if he had given me $2,000. He kept poor Paxton on starving allowance during the campaign. I know Paxton had to borrow $20 to pay his expenses, and without Paxton and myself he had no more chance of being elected than he had of Heaven.\nHow much beyond $2,000 would have been sufficient to have induced him to vote and to work for the appellant, if he had known him as well when he made the bargain which he says he did, as he did know him after the election was over, he does not say; but looking at the whole character of the witness's evidence, it would not seem to be an uncharitable conclusion to draw, that the price he would have set upon his venality would have been upon a scale in inverse ratio to the opinion he entertained of the qualifications and fitness of the candidate.\nWhether the bargain \"was of the nature which the witness swears he made the condition of his corruption, or of the nature which the appellant in his testimony admits, matters little; the only substantial difference between them, as it seems to me, is as to amount, the appellant admitting that he agreed to pay the witness the expenses attending his rendering the services contracted for, and the witness insisting, that besides his expenses he was to receive $400 in any event, and the further sum of $600 in the event of success. The learned judge who tried the case has found as a matter of fact, that the arrangement which the appellant, in his evidence, admitted that he made with Hurd was so made to induce Hurd to endeavor to secure the return of the appellant to serve in the House of Commons.\nIn all cases we should have great delicacy in overruling the finding of a learned judge upon a pure matter of fact. He has the superior advantage of observing the manner in which parties give their evidence to assist him in forming a correct judgment of their acts and of their motives, but without this aid, in this case, the matter of the appellant's evidence as appearing in the case before us is abundantly sufficient in my judgment to support that finding, at all events to prevent our overruling it and declaring that the fact so found by him is not warranted by the evidence. The appellant gave evidence, that McClelland had stated to him that he had spoken to Hurd, who said he could do appellant some good; that Hurd said he had not decided what course he would take, but that if he addressed meetings he would have to be paid his expenses. The appellant said that his reply to this was, that he was not aware whether the law would allow him to pay any expenses, that he was looking for information on that point, and that until he got that information he could not give any answer whatever. The appellant adds: \"I understood Mr. Hurd would require his expenses paid.\" Again he admits, that at an interview which he subsequently had with Mr. Hurd, he asked Hurd for his support, and that Hurd replied that he had not exactly decided what course he would take, that he would not do so for a week, that he was going over to the States for some information respecting protection, and if he decided to take any action in the matter he would require his personal expenses to be paid by appellant if he addressed meetings. The appellant adds:\nHe asked me what I would require him to do; I said, if he took hold of the matter, it would be to address meetings only. I told him I would want him to address meetings, if my Reform friends decided to engage him to do it, or to accept him. Nothing more was said about terms; nothing about amount. He asked me whether I would want him to hold meetings generally throughout the riding, or in any locality. He said, if I do take hold of the matter, I propose to hold a meeting at Port Perry in the first place, or at Uxbridge village; and he said, I wish to take control of the meeting. He would not allow anybody to address the meeting but himself, and that he would take about two or three hours and not refer to Mr. Gibbs or anybody else. He said he would not allow Mr. Gibbs or myself to address the meetings, and that he wanted his speech to be revised and printed in fly form, and five or six thousand distributed through the riding, and he wanted to know if I would go to that expense. I said that if he went on and addressed the meeting, and my friends considered his speech was worth it, we would consider whether it would be worth while going to that expense. There was nothing more said about expense at that time. He stated it was quite correct and proper and legal for me to pay his legal expenses. I stated if it was, and if our people decided to accept him as a speaker for us, I would pay whatever was legal and proper towards his legal expenses.\nAnd again he says:\nAt our interview I told him I was prepared to pay legitimate expenses for addressing meetings if the party accepted him. My understanding was that my party had accepted him, and that I was willing to pay his personal expenses. I thought his personal expenses would cover his conveyance, the printing and his own personal expenses. He stated he would have to leave his office and his son there, and he could not afford to do it unless his expenses were paid. He called meetings in the south portion of the riding. As near as I can understand, he held five or six meetings, all within a radius of a few miles.\nAgain he says:\nMr. Hurd spoke to me the next morning after the Cannington meeting, and said \"I did not expect to come to this meeting this evening, and I have not enough money. I wish you would let me have enough to pay the expenses of my horse at Sunderland.\" I think he said Sunderland. And I gave him a dollar, or two dollars. That was all the money I ever gave him. He has not sent me a statement of his personal expenses, and I have not settled up with him yet. On the 12th October, I think it was the day the fair was there. I called at his office, and was there while his son was looking around for his father for an hour or an hour and a half, to get his bill of expenses, to see what his expenses were. I left word with his son to write to me and to send the bill of expenses.\nThen, upon being asked if he remembered asking Hurd's son if he had heard anything about a protest, he replied:\u2014\nNo, I did not ask him that question. I did not send any message to his father by him, except that I wanted him to send a statement of his accounts. And again, being asked whether, at the interview which he had with Mr. Hurd on the 10th August, he did not say to Mr. Hurd\u2014\"I understand you will support me on certain conditions?\" he replied:\nWell, I said to him that I understood he would support me and address meetings. He told me he would support me, but that he would take no part unless his expenses were paid attending meetings.\nUpon this evidence, I cannot see that any objection can well be taken to the finding of the learned judge upon the simple question of fact, as to the promise by the now appellant to pay Hurd his expenses, in order to induce the latter to use his influence, (which he had refused to use unless paid) to procure the return of appellant as a member of the House of Commons.\nThe secrecy attending the whole transaction and the evidence generally, in my opinion, warrant the conclusion that, notwithstanding that Hurd may have expressed to the appellant his opinion that payment for such services was legal, the appellant himself entertained grave doubts as to the correctness of this opinion; but, however this may be, the appellant's belief in the correctness of the opinion will not exempt him from responsibility, if the opinion be not sound and the act be declared by law to be bribery and corruption.\nUpon principle then, and upon the authority of what was said by Martin, B., in the Bradford case[29] and by Willes, J., in the Coventry case[30], the conclusion of the learned judge that the appellant was guilty of bribery within sub-sec. 3 of sec. 92 of the Dominion Elections Act of 1874, cannot be impeached. Nor is this judgment at all at variance with what is said in the Lambeth case[31], to the effect that:\nWhere the consideration for the payment was the bon\u00e2 fide employment of persons as canvassers to ascertain the votes of the constituency, although, in the course of their employment, they had to recommend the candidate employing them,\nthat is not within the Act, for there is a great difference between the case of a person being employed to ascertain how the voters would vote, being paid for that service as the bon\u00e2 fide consideration of the payment, although the persons so employed should recommend the voters to vote for their employer, and the case of a person being employed for the express purpose of inducing, persuading and endeavoring to procure the voters to vote for his employer, upon a promise of payment to be made to the person so employed for such services. If, under the guise of employment as ordinary canvassers, persons are in fact employed and paid, or promised payment, for rendering services, such as Hurd was employed to render here, I see no reason why the person so employing them and paying, or promising payment, for such services should not, (within the express provisions of the Act) be deemed guilty of bribery.\nIt would be a mockery of justice and a reproach upon common sense to hold the promise of payment, to a poor voter, of his expenses in coming to the poll to record his vote (otherwise perhaps conscientiously given), to be bribery, and the promise of payment to the witness of his expenses, in consideration of his going through the electoral division using all his influence, by the exercise of his persuasive and oratorical powers, and of his local and professional influence, to procure the return of the appellant, not to be. Indeed, as was pointed out by the learned judge in his judgment, bribery of influence is more extensive, more effectual, and more pernicious than the bribery of a voter merely to give his vote. It is difficult to conceive any conduct more odious or corrupt than that of an advocate who, by his oratorical powers, and the extent of his acquaintance with the electors which the practice of his profession among them had given him, while concealing the fact that his praise and his advocacy was purchased, should, under the assumed character of an independent elector, disinterestedly and conscientiously in the public interest supporting a particular candidate, exert his influence by persuading his fellow electors to vote for the man whom, in truth, he was serving under a contract of hiring.\nBut the letter of the Act is clear that,\nEvery person who, directly or indirectly, makes any promise of any money or valuable consideration to any person, in order to induce such person to endeavor to procure the return of any person to serve in the House of Commons, shall be deemed guilty of bribery;\nAnd we have no right to cripple the Act by depriving this section of the smallest particle of its literal force and effect. Parliament has deemed it necessary to enact this peremptory provision, in order to secure the utmost purity in the election of members to serve in parliament, and to make them be in reality, as in name, the freely chosen representatives of an independent people. And, undoubtedly, the promise to pay Hurd even his expenses attending his rendering the services which the appellant admits he agreed to render, does come within the letter of the clause, unless it comes within the protection of the proviso which enacts:\nProvided always, that the actual personal expenses of any candidate, his expenses for actual professional services performed, and bona fide payments for the fair cost of printing, shall be held to be expenses lawfully incurred and the payment thereof shall not be a contravention of this Act.\nNow, that services of this nature should not be held to come within the term \"actual professional services,\" the honor of the profession and electoral purity, which it was the express object of this act to secure, alike require. Indeed, if the services contracted to be rendered, and which appear to have been rendered by Hurd, could be held to be professional within the meaning of the proviso, payment of the amount which he swore was the consideration agreed upon would be equally legal, for the amount agreed to be paid for services could not determine whether or not they were, in fact, professional services; it is the nature of the service which must determine that question, and the learned counsel for the appellant was forced to admit, that if the contract was for the amount sworn to by Hurd, he could not stand up in court to justify it as legal. If the services are not protected as professional, there is nothing in the proviso which protects the promise to pay anything for them from the operation of the clause. I do not feel disposed to extend the construction to be put upon the term \"expenses for actual professional services\" beyond that put upon it by Richards, C. J., in the East Toronto election case[32], namely, the fees payable for services rendered by lawyers as such.\nWe cannot construe the Act as making the promise to be bribery, only in case it should be made to any one but a lawyer, as if the clause ran thus: \"Every one who directly or indirectly promises, &c., in order to induce, &c., shall be deemed guilty of bribery and shall be punishable accordingly, provided always that such promise made to a lawyer shall not be a contravention of this Act.\"\nThe statute has expressly declared the Act of which the appellant has been found guilty, by the judgment of the learned judge, who tried the case and heard all the witnesses, to be bribery, and I can see no sufficient grounds to justify us in annulling that finding.\nWith the severity of the punishment annexed to the offence, we have nothing to do, but we are concerned to take care that we do not, by reversing upon insufficient grounds the finding of the learned judge, cause an Act which parliament has deemed to be so necessary to secure its independence to become a dead letter.\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs, and the Registrar should be directed to report the judgment of Mr. Justice Armour, and the appeal therefrom, and our judgment thereon to the House of Commons.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Hodgins & Spragge.\nSolicitors for respondent: Cameron & Appelbe.\n[1] (1) For the sec. of the statute see p. 444.\n[2] 11 C.

J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN\u2019S BENCH FOR MANITOBA.\nAppeal\u2014Monthly allowance of $200\u2014Amount in controversy\u2014Annual rent\u2014R.S.C. ch. 139 sec. 29 (b)\u2014Jurisdiction.\nThe Dominion Elections Act, 1874, sees. 96 and 98-Hiring a team to bring voter to poll a corrupt practice- \u201cWilful\u201d offence -Advance of money when not made in order to induce voter to procure the return of the candidate not bribery.\nAs to the case of one J. F. G., the charge was that the respondent bribed him by the payment of a promissory note for $89. The evidence showed that J. F. G. had been canvassing for respondent a long time before the note fell due, and had always supported him. He was on his way to retire his note, which was overdue or falling due that day, when respondent asked him to canvass that day, and promised to send into town and have the note arranged for him. At the same time J. F. G, was negotiating for a loan on a mortgage to respondent and it was at first stipulated that the amount of this note should be taken out of the mortgage money. The agent of the respondent, after the election, at the request of J. F. G., paid the mortgage money in full and allowed the matter of the note to stand until J. F. G. could see respondent. J. F. G. stated that neither the note nor the mortgage transaction influenced him in any way, and that he had to pay the note and did not expect respondent to make him a present of it.\nHeld:-That the evidence did not show that the advance of money was made in order to induce J. F. G. to procure or to endeavor to procure the return of respondent, and was not therefore bribery within the meaning of sub-sec. 3 of sec. 92 of the Dominion Elections Act, 1874.\nAs to the case of one M., the evidence shewed that M\u2019s team was hired some days before the opening of the poll by G, an agent of the respondent, for the purpose of bringing two voters to the polls. M. went for the voters, returned the day previous to the polling day without the voters and was paid fifteen dollars.\nHeld:--That the term \u201csix preceding sections\u201d in the 98th section of \u201cThe Dominion Elections, 1874,\u201d means the six sections immediately preceding the 98th, and therefore the hiring of a team to convey voters to the polls, prohibited by the 96th section ([1]), was a corrupt practice within the meaning of the 98th section ([2]). [Henry, J., dissenting.] APPEAL from the decision of Mr. Justice Betournay, of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for the Province of Manitoba, dismissing the petition against the return of Donald Alexander Smith, as member of the House of Commons for the Electoral District of the County of Selkirk, in the Province of Manitoba.\nThe petition charged the respondent with bribery, treating, undue influence, hiring teams to convey voters to and from the polls, and with corrupt practices, but the appellants limited their appeal to four cases of alleged corrupt practices, viz.:\u2014\n(1). The case of Donald Alexander Smith, as briber, and John F. Grant, as bribee.\n(2). The case of James Penrose, as briber, and Henry King, as bribee.\n(3). The case of Elias George Conklin, as the person hiring teams, and John Henry Mason, as the person from whom Conklin hired the teams.\n(4). The case of Donald Alexander Smith and Sedley Blanchard, bribers, and Jean Baptiste Lapointe, Elz\u00e9ar Lafemodi\u00e8re, Louis Deschambault, L. J. A. Levecque, J. A. Provencher, Alezander Begg, and A. F. DeGagnier (or Gauthier), as bribees.\nThe facts and the evidence relating to these charges are reviewed in the arguments and judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. Hector Cameron, Q.C., for appellants:\nThe evidence in the Smith-Grant case consists only of the testimony of Mr. Grant and Mr. Blanchard, and the facts are not in controversy. Smith desired to get Grant to go with him to canvass the voters in a particular district, and had been advised by Mr. Blanchard, his solicitor and election agent, to do so. Grant goes to Smith\u2019s house on his way to town to take up an overdue note of $89. Smith asks him to go to canvass with him that day and, as an inducement, promises to send into town and get the note paid. In the words of Grant, \u201cI suppose the consideration for the arrangement was, that I should accompany Mr. Smith to Headingly. I consented to go with him after that. He canvassed the parish and I accompanied him. I advised the voters to vote for Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith knew that I was doing this.\u201d Grant was at that time negotiating for a loan on mortgage from Smith, and it was at first stipulated that the amount of this note should be taken out of the mortgage money: but when he settled the mortgage transaction with Blanchard, Smith\u2019s agent, a week or 10 days before the election, the mortgage money was paid over in full, without deducting the amount of the note. Grant thus states it: \u201cI did not tell Mr. Blanchard that I never would pay the note, but said I had a claim against Mr. Smith. The claim was for previous election services rendered 4 or 8 years ago, and I wanted to see Mr. Smith about it.\u201d Mr. Blanchard says (page 11): \u201cHe begged so hard that I gave him the whole of the mortgage money and there the thing has stood ever since.\u201d\nThere was here undoubtedly a loan of money, if not an entire gift of it, under the suspicious pretext of paying an old election debt of 4 or 8 years standing, for the corrupt purpose of procuring the vote and influence of a leading man in the constituency, and even if the object of the respondent was not to influence the vote of the elector, of which he may have felt secure, yet if it was to procure his influence and to reward him for exerting it in the respondent\u2019s favour, it was equally a corrupt practice within the statute and the law of Parliament. The procuring of influence for a consideration is a violation of the 92nd and 93rd sections of the Dominion Elections Act, 1874.\nThe learned Counsel referred to the judgment of Mr. Justice Armour, in the North Ontario case (before this Court in appeal) ([3]), and to the Coventry case ([4]); Cashel case ([5]); Bradford case ([6]).\n[As to the Penrose case the learned counsel did not rely on it.]\nThe next case, on which there can be no doubt, is the Conklin-Mason case, that of hiring a team to bring voters to the poll, which hiring was contrary to the statute. The Judge in the Election Court disposed of this charge on the ground that while the hiring of teams was illegal, yet it was not a corrupt practice. Mr. Conklin was on Mr. Smith\u2019s committee, and I did not think from the face of the evidence the respondent could deny the fact. Mason\u2019s team was hired and paid for by Conklin; the teamster was given the name of two voters on a slip of paper. It is said that he could not get the orders. The mere fact, however, that the teamster was hired to fetch them is in itself corrupt by the statute.\nThe respondent endeavors to uphold the learned Judge\u2019s decision on this point by Woodhouse v. O\u2019Donohoe (5), decided under the repealed Act of 1873. The Act of 1874 expressly altered the law; the language of the 98th section is clear and decisive on the point. Neither of my learned friends have ever doubted since the Act of 1876, that the hiring of a team, prohibited by the 96th section, is a corrupt practice. The construction which is for the first time put forward is that the words \u201csix next preceding sections\u201d in section 98 apply to the sections preceding section 93, and not sections 92 to 98. The language is clear and unambiguous and must be construed in their literal sense and include the 96th section which prohibits the hiring of teams to carry voters to the polls.\nThe agency cannot be denied successfully, when we come to look at Mr. Conklin\u2019s evidence. He was on a committee which Mr. Smith recognized, and he canvassed.\nThe learned counsel then concluded his argument by shortly referring to the evidence in the Gauthier case.\nMr. Robinson, Q. C., and Mr. Bethune for respondent:\nThe first case is the Grant case upon which my learned friend seems to insist.\nThis loan was not made to Grant to induce him to give a general support or his vote to Smith, because that would have been given without the inducement. The loan was offered to Grant to induce him to give on a particular day, to suit the convenience of Mr. Smith, the assistance which he would have given without the inducement on another day. There was no corruption in the act.\nIt is no use arguing whether this is a case of undue influence or not. The charge is not that he canvassed on that particular day, but that Grant was personally bribed by respondent. Now he neither bought his influence or his vote. [The learned counsel then briefly referred to the cases of Penrose and Gauthier.]\nThe only case which involves a question of law is that of the hiring of Mason to convey voters to the poll. First of all we contend there is no evidence to show Mr. Smith knew Mr. Conklin was on the committee. There was nobody influenced at all by the transaction. Conklin did not know whether Mason had a vote, and Mason did not know which side Conklin supported. It was merely an ordinary case of hiring a team, and the teams actually returned before polling day without the voters.\nThen as to the question of law. It is clear until this clause was put in, hiring per se was illegal and not corrupt. The view taken by the learned Judge who decided this case, is that the act must be corrupt. Now, the hiring took place as a teamster and not as voter, and the object of the act was to prevent the conveyance of the voters and not the sending of the cabman for the voter, and that is all that was done in this case.\nThe term \u201cthe six next preceding sections of this Act,\u201d referred to in sec. 98, cannot mean the sees. 92 to 97 inclusive; for the word \u201cwilful\u201d is insensible as applied to most of the acts there specified, which are in themselves illegal acts even at Common Law, and involve a corrupt intention and purpose as part of the offence.\nIt seems absurd to speak, for example, of wilfully giving money, or agreeing to obtain an office for a vote, or corruptly doing so as a reward for having voted; of wilfully paying money with the intent that it shall be spent in bribery; of wilfully receiving money for votes; of wilfully treating for the purpose of corruptly influencing voters; of wilfully threatening or inflicting violence, or using fraud, to compel voters to vote or abstain from voting; or of wilfully inducing any one to personate a voter or take a false oath. The word \u201cwilful\u201d cannot have been used here in the sense either of doing these acts intentionally, or of doing them knowing that they were illegal.\nThen what do these words mean? We say that the word \u201cpreceding\u201d means preceding the definition of bribery, personation, treating and undue influence in this Act; and that the clause may be so read. It seems probable that the clause has been transposed in framing the statute, or that sections 93 to 98 inclusive were originally framed as sub-sections of section 92. The word \u201cwilful,\u201d in the sense of knowing it to be an offence, would have a reasonable application to the acts prohibited in the then six next preceding sections, (sees. 86 to 91) many of which are acts which are in themselves innocent, and might well be supposed to be so by any one not aware of the statute, or conversant with the special law of elections. It is further to be observed that the effect of section 98, if applied to sections 92 to 97, is first to declare bribery, &c., to be a corrupt practice without disqualification, and then to make it so only if done wilfully. As to the effect of the word \u201cwilfully,\u201d see Regina v. Prince ([7]), Abbott\u2019s Law Dictionary ([8]), United States v. Three Railroad Cars ([9]), Bishop\u2019s Crim. Law ([10]),Lewis Y. Great West. Railway ([11]), the Brockville case ([12]), the Bolton case ([13]), Cunningham on Elections ([14]), Rogers on Elections ([15]), Meirelles v. Banning ([16]).\nMr. Hector Cameron, Q.C., in reply.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\nFour charges were pressed before us in this case. First the payment of a tavern bill incurred by the respondent and a few friends during the canvass. The agent did not pay the bill till after the election, and although the charges appeared to him very high, he said he paid the amount rather than have a dispute. Moreover I have no means of discovering from the evidence what it would have been reasonable to pay under the circumstances, nor what are the usual charges in that part of the country. I can see nothing corrupt in this. There is another charge as to the payment of a note\u00bb Mr. Smith called on one of his supporters (Mr. Grant) to canvass with him on a certain day, and the supporter said he could not, because he was then going into \u2018 Winnipeg to settle a promissory note which had fallen due. Mr. Smith said: \u201cOh, my agent is going in and he can attend to that.\u201d The respondent then instructed his agent to pay the note and charge it against the mortgage money he was lending Grant. I do not think there was any loan or gift of money. I think it was only natural for Mr. Smith to say in such a case, if you will go with me I will have your note attended to. There was no corrupt object in lending the money, as Grant was and had been always a strong supporter and canvasser of the respondent, and certainly there was actually no loan in the general acceptance of the word.\nAs to the Penrose case I am not prepared to say the Judge was wrong.\nBut then we come to the Conklin case. In this case I think there has been a corrupt act done by the agent which must avoid the election. The charge is: \u201cthat Donald Alexander Smith, by his agent, hired and promised to pay and paid for divers horses, teams, carriages and other vehicles to convey divers voters to and from the poll, and to and from the neighbourhood thereof.\u2019\u2019 The particulars of this charge are as follows: \u201c Name of person hiring, Elias George Conklin; name of person from whom hired, John Henry Mason; sum promised to be paid, fifteen dollars a day, by Elias George Conklin to John Henry Mason; sum paid, fifteen dollars per day, by Elias George Conklin to John Henry Mason.\u201d Now what are the facts? Conklin hired a teamster to fetch two electors a few days before the polling. The teamster went into the country for them and returned the day before polling, but without the two men.\nThe learned Judge has certainly misapprehended the law in this case. He was under the impression that the 96th section only disqualified the voter and exposed him to penalties. [The Chief Justice then read the 96th section.] But he seems to have entirely overlooked and been unaware of the 98th section, and held that the act complained of, though unlawful, was not a corrupt act.\nMr. Bethune argued very ingeniously that it should not apply to the \u201csix next preceding sections,\u201d but to the sections preceding the 97th section. I do not think we can enter into such a refined process of reasoning. If this clause has been put in its wrong place, the error must be rectified by Parliament and not by us.\nThen was this a \u201cwilful\u201d offence or not?\nIf this statute had simply declared that whosoever shall wilfully pay a voter to bring voters to the polls shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, can it be doubted that on an indictment on proof of the act done, it would be no defence to set up ignorance of the law? It is too clear for argument that ignorance of the law does not excuse.\nHere the illegal act was done without any legal excuse, and without any ignorance or mistake in fact, and consequently it was a wilful breach of the law, and consequently a corrupt act.\nIt seems to me impossible to suppose that the intention of the legislature could have been to make the corrupt act depend upon the knowledge of the doer of the act of the law. When he engaged in that election and undertook to do acts in connection therewith, he was bound to know the law and to take care that he did no illegal act. If he had stated to the person: I do not know the law, 1 do not intend to break the law, but if it is lawful to pay you for bringing the voter to the poll, I will do so, but never does pay, and so never promises to do an illegal act and never does it, he would be within the principle of the Wheler v. Gibbs case, just decided, and as I understand the law in such a case, there would be no corrupt act. But that is not this case. Here the unquestionably unlawful act was done, and his only justification or excuse to denude it of its wilful character is, I did not know it was illegal. But it is very clear, in my opinion, that such a pretence will not deprive the act of its wilful character. If a man voluntarily breaks the law, this, in the eye of the law, is a wilful act, because the act done is a wrongful act without just cause or excuse. To deprive an unlawful act of wilfulness, there must be an ignorance or mistake of fact, not ignorance or error in point of law.\nAll the cases turn on ignorance of fact, not ignorance of law:\u2014\nIgnorance or mistake is not the defect of will when a man intending to do a lawful act does that which is unlawful, for here the deed and the will acting separately, there is not that conjunction between them which is necessary to form a criminal act. But this must be an ignorance or mistake of fact, and not an error in point of law. As if a man intending to kill a thief or house breaker in his own house, by mistake kills one of his own family, this is no criminal action, but if a man thinks he has a right to kill a person excommunicated or outlawed wherever he meets him and does so, this is wilful murder ([17]).\nIn this case the maxim \u201cActus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea \u201c does not apply.\nIn a very late case also\u2014Reg. v. Prince ([18])\u2014this doctrine was clearly laid down. In that case, a man was charged with having abducted a girl under age; and all the judges agreed in saying that mistake in law is not a defence.\nThe respondent in this case, however, had, according to the evidence, no knowledge whatever of the transaction.\nThe appeal is allowed, with costs, and the House of Commons will be notified that the election is void.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nI will not enter my dissent in this case, although I confess it is hard to unseat the respondent because there has been an unintentional violation of the law.\nConklin said that he was under the impression that he could send for voters before the polling day, so long as he did not send for them on the actual polling day. However, against the weight of authorities, I must admit the respondent\u2019s agent was bound to know the law, and, therefore, the appeal must be allowed.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThere were four cases of alleged corrupt practices argued before us in this case:\n1. For alleged bribery by the respondent for corruptly lending or advancing money to one John F. Grant.\n2. The case of alleged bribery by the offer of one James Penrose to bribe Henry King to vote for the respondent\n3. The alleged bribery by respondent and his agent, Sedley Blanchard, of Lapointe and six others named, by the payment after the election by Blanchard of about $30 to one Gauthier for the hire of committee rooms, for fire and light, and for board and the feeding of horses, including the boarding of five parties and the keeping of their horses.\n4. The hiring of Mason\u2019s team by one Conklin to convey voters to the poll.\nI will deal with these charges in their order. As to the first, I have carefully read over and considered the evidence applicable to it. It amounts to this: That Grant, some months previous to the election, without any reference being made to it, obtained from Blanchard, the respondent\u2019s solicitor, subsequently his agent for the election, the promise to advance him six or eight hundred dollars on a mortgage security on his real estate. The respondent, before the election, set out to canvass an outlying district and was recommended by Blanchard to get Grant to go with him. Before reaching Grant\u2019s house, he met him on his way to Winnipeg, and requested him to return with him. Grant had been previously a pronounced supporter of the respondent and had been canvassing for him, but at first declined to accompany the respondent because he had a note for about $89 due that day in a bank and said he must go to Winnipeg to have it taken up, upon which the respondent said he would send in and have that done in the meantime. Grant thereupon went with the respondent, and the latter sent and had the note paid and retired by Blanchard, who charged the amount of it to Grant as a part of the sum he had agreed, on the part of the respondent, to advance upon the mortgage. After the election, the mortgage was executed by Grant and the balance offered to him by Blanchard. Grant, however, objected to allow the amount of the note to be deducted from the amount of the mortgage, as he had a bill against the respondent for a previous election, and because he required the whole amount of the loan to pay off the demand for which he wanted it. Under the circumstances, Blanchard paid it to him, upon a promise from Grant, that he would repay the amount of the note to him, if the respondent did not allow the account against him. Under such facts I cannot under-, stand anything corrupt. If a candidate wanted the presence with him of his warm supporter, and to obtain it it was necessary to substitute some other means of having done what alone could secure that presence, I think that under the circumstances it would be adding to the rigour of the statute to decide that there was anything corrupt in the transaction; which, from the evidence, we have every reason to consider bona fide.\nAs to the second case: The evidence is so conflicting that I do not feel at all at liberty to question the finding of the learned judge who tried the petition; besides, there is no sufficient evidence of the agency of Penrose to make the respondent liable for the serious consequences of his acts. He says he at first thought he was on one of respondents committee, but that the day before the election he found he was not; he, however, thinks he attended one or two committee meetings afterwards. Attendance at committee meetings is not confined to persons composing them, and there is nothing to show what he calls committee meetings were called with the knowledge or sanction of the respondent. Frequently the friends of a candidate form themselves into committees and clubs without his knowledge, and it would be unwarrantable to hold him personally answerable for their acts, so as to bring them within the laws which make candidates answerable for the acts of their agents.\nThe third charge is not at all sustained. It was for the payment by Blanchard, the respondent\u2019s agent, after the election, of a bill for which the respondent is in no way liable. The agency terminated with the election. No arrangement or agreement was made with Gauthier, before he supplied to the persons named the board and feed for their horses, by the respondent, or any one on his behalf, that the bill would be paid. Be appears to have furnished what he charged for without orders from any one, and after the election was over made up a pretty high bill as many others do against candidates in such cases, and more especially against successful ones. I can speak from a long personal experience of such cases.\nThe fourth and last charge remains for consideration. It is founded on sections 96 and 98 of the Election Act of 1874.\nSection 96, after reciting that doubts might arise as to whether the hiring of teams and vehicles to convey voters to and from the polls, and the paying of railway fares and other expenses of voters, be, or be not according to law, it is declared and enacted that\nThe hiring or promising to pay or paying for any horse, team, carriage, cab or other vehicle, by any candidate, or by any person on his behalf, to convey any voter or voters to or from the poll, or to or from the neighbourhood thereof, at any election, or the payment by any candidate, or by any person on his behalf, of the travelling and other expenses of any voter in going to or returning from any election, are, and shall be unlawful acts, and the person so offending shall forfeit the sum of one hundred dollars to any person who shall sue for the same.\nSection 98 provides that\nAny wilful offence against any of the six next preceding sections of this Act shall be corrupt practices within the meaning of the provisions of this Act.\nAlthough it would, in my opinion, be difficult to point out six next preceding sections to section 98, as provided by it, we must assume that the legislature intended it to apply to the next preceding six sections, and therefore to refer to and include section 96, and thereby provides for another and more serious offence. Section 96 creates an offence against a candidate, and also against another person for doing any of the acts prohibited by it, including as well the person who hires as the person who lets to hire a horse, team, &c., and subjects them to the penalties provided by the section, no matter how innocently done. Section 98, however, which is much more penal, requires that when a charge is made under it there must be evidence that it was done wilfully. The evidence under it should show that the act was done in such a way, and in such circumstances, that a jury would be justified in finding it to have been done wilfully. That it was done negligently, though sufficient under section 96, would not be so under 98, for the legislature has clearly provided for something more when consequences much more important and severe are to be the result. By a comparison and consideration of the two sections, no other conclusion can be arrived at. That every one must be presumed to know the law is a judicial maxim well known and long established, but, like every general maxim and rule, there are limitations of it in the construction of statutes, and authorities are found to shew that in cases similar to that now under consideration, the maxim is not always fully applicable.\nThe case cited on the argument by Mr. Robinson, Meirelles v. Banning ([19]), establishes that view. In giving \u201cjudgment in that case Lord Tenterden, C. J., said:\nThe words \u201cwittingly,\u201d \u201cwillingly\u201d and \u201cknowingly,\u201d in this penal clause must have been introduced with some view. If we suppose them to have no particular meaning, it would have been sufficient without adding more, to impose the penalty on any person opening or detaining letters, or suffering them to be opened or detained. Then, if these words have a meaning, we must look for the explanation of them, first to the preamble clause in question ; and that recites that abuses may be committed by wilfully opening, embezzeling and detaining letters. The enacting part states what shall be the consequences of so doing, namely, that the person so offending, or who shall embezzle any letter, shall for every such offence forfeit \u00a320 to be recovered by a qui tarn action; and, over and above such penalty shall be forever incapable of exercising any office, trust or employment in, or relating to the post office. Now, in the interpretation of the act so highly penal on the party offending, we must be careful to adopt such a construction as will strictly answer to the intention expressed by the legislature: and so construing the clauses in question it seems to me that the words \u2018 wittingly,\u201d \u201cwillingly\u201d and \u201cknowingly\u201d must be taken to denote acts done with a conscious mind that the party is doing wrong.\nParke, J., said:\nIn an action for penalties and where a judgment against the defendant would be attended with such serious consequences, the law must be strictly construed: and I think we must consider the fortieth section of this Act as applying to cases where the officer knowingly and willingly does what is wrong And cites Wright v. Smith ([20]), wherein it was decided by the Court of Exchequer: that a holding of the premises by a tenant without fraud\/and a fair claim of right, was not a wilful holding over within the statute.\nPatterson, J., added:\nThe statement in this case being that the delivery of the letters was bond fide, I think it cannot be said that the defendant acted \u201cwittingly, willingly and knowingly,\u201d against the statute.\nSee also Lewis v. Great Western Railway Co. ([21]), in which the same doctrine is held. In that case Brett, L. J., says:\nIn a contract where the term wilful misconduct is put as something different from and excluding negligence of every kind, it seems to me that it must mean the doing of something; or the omitting to do something, which it is wrong to do or omit, where the person who is guilty of the act or the omission knows that the act which he is doing, or that which he is omitting to do, is a wrong thing to do or to omit; and it involves the knowledge of the person that the thing he is doing is wrong ([22]).\nBramwell, L. J., says:\nThere is such a mass of authorities to shew what \u201cwilful misconduct\u201d is, that we should hardly be justified as a Court of Appeal in departing from them even if we thought them to be wrong. \u201cWilful misconduct\u201d means misconduct to which the will is a party. Something opposed to accident or negligence; the mis-conduct not the conduct, must be wilful (4).\nI have made the foregoing extracts from the judgments in the two cases mentioned for the purpose of applying them, as I will now briefly do, to this case, after another brief reference to the statute and the evidence. We have only to refer to section 96 to find the legislative declaration that up to the passage of that Act doubts existed as to the law bearing on the question now under consideration, and the enactment was considered necessary to remove them. The offence by the section is stated to be for conveying voters to or from the polls, or the neighborhood thereof. The evidence in this case shows that the hiring of Mason and his team was not to bring the voters sent for to the polls or the neighborhood of it on polling day but some days previous. The party hired went for them and returned before polling day without them. Conklin swears that he understood the prohibition only to apply to polling day, and therefore thought, in hiring Mason to go and return before polling day, he was doing what the law permitted. If, therefore, he bon\u00fb fide and honestly believed he was within the law and doing what it permitted, and I see no reason to doubt the fact, then I cannot conclude he was wilfully guilty of misconduct within the principles and doctrines held in the judgments which I have just referred to. By the authority of these cases, in the words of Bramwell, L. J., it is not the conduct that is to be wilful, but the misconduct. If Conklin believed he was not doing an illegal act, there was no wilful misconduct on his part. If he violated the provision of the section, it is not at all to be wondered at, for the construction he put upon it is that which most people would be likely to do, and although I will not say it is the right one, still I have little doubt professional men could be found who would agree with him, and it is certainly the one an unprofessional man would be most likely to adopt. The section being capable of two constructions, is a man to be found guilty of a wilful breach of it who is unconscious that he is violating it. A man unaccustomed to criticise acts of parliament might reasonably assume that as no polling booths had been erected or polls open, he might, previous to polling day, hire teams to bring voters from greater distances than would be practicable on polling day. Such being the case, we can the more readily give credence to the statement of Conklin, that he considered the law would permit his doing legally what he is charged with and acknowledges having done.\nIt will be seen that there is no difference between the case of Conklin and the postmaster who was the defendant in Meirelles v. Banning, before cited. In the latter there was but the one offence created by the statute, and the court drew its conclusions solely from the words of the section \u201cwittingly,\u201d \u201cwillingly\u201d and \u201cknowingly.\u201d In this case two offences are created with different penalties, the second only providing that the offence should be committed \u201cwilfully.\u201d The two must therefore be differently construed, and I feel bound to conclude, the legislature intended that before the more serious penalties attached, there must be evidence that the \u201cmisconduct\u201d and not the \u201cconduct,\u201d was wilful. Proof of the prohibited act might be itself sufficient prima facie evidence to sustain the charge of wilful misconduct, but if so, that is in my opinion sufficiently rebutted by the sworn statement of Conklin as to his view of the law. As the result of this case he is a disinterested witness\u2014the consequences of the decision will not immediately affect him, but the respondent and his constituency generally. The Judges in England are unwilling to avoid an election, which to do, is there considered a serious matter, but in this case, if our decision is against the respondent, the election will be avoided, not because of any wilful misconduct, but because an agent of the respondent took what may be held to be a mistaken view of a statutory provision, but one not at all to be wondered at. I cannot bring myself to think a construction producing such a result is at all necessary to secure the fredom or purity of elections, or that it would be in accordance with the letter or spirit of the statute. I am of opinion for the reasons I have given, that the appeal should be dismissed and the original judgment affirmed with costs. TASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nIgnorantia juris non excusat, and he who wilfully commits an act which the law declares illegal, wilfully commits an offence against that law. The word \u201cknowingly \u201c is not in the statute, and wilfully here cannot mean \u201cknowingly.\u201d\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nI see no reason for objecting to the finding of the learned Judge before whom this Election Petition was tried, to the effect that the advance made by the respondent to take up the note of Mr. Grant, then about falling, or fallen, due, was not made in order to induce Mr. Grant to procure, or to endeavor to procure, the return of the respondent to serve in the House of Commons. The purpose for which any gift, loan, offer or promise is made is the essence of the offence. It is that which makes it bribery within the 3rd sub-sec. of the 92nd section of the Dominion Elections Act of 1874, and upon that point I concur in the judgment of the learned Judge, that no such purpose or intent was established by the evidence.\nUpon the other point, namely, the hiring of a team or vehicle by Conklin to convey voters to the polls, I am of opinion that the term \u201csix next preceding sections,\u201d as used in sec. 98, must mean the six sections next preceding the 98th, and not, as was contended, the six next preceding the 92nd sec.\nThe 98th sec. is certainly not very felicitously expressed, for the 92nd and 93rd cover \u201cbribery,\u201d the 94th covers \u201ctreating,\u201d the 95th \u201cundue influence,\u201d and the 97th the inducing a person to commit personation\u201d; all of which are expressly mentioned in the 98th sec, before the words \u201cor any wilful offence against any one of the six next preceding sections of this Act.\u201d So that under these latter words there is only \u201cthe hiring of teams, &c.\u201d which, is prohibited by the 96th section, to apply; however, no such strained construction can be entertained as that the \u201csix next preceding sections \u201c should be referred back to the sections preceding the 92nd, or to any other sections than the six preceding the 98th. And as to the words \u201cwilful offence\u201d in the latter section, the meaning of the Act, I think, must be held to be that, whereas the 96th sec. declared the act, there pointed to, to be an unlawful act, the 98th section declares that the wilful or intentional doing of an unlawful act shall be corrupt. Now, that the hiring here was wilful, that is, intentional, there can be no doubt, and the excuse that the party doing it did not know that it was made a corrupt act, or that it was an illegal act, cannot be received without frustrating the intent of the legislature by a judicial repeal of the act\u2014ignorantia juris non excusat. As, however, the evidence does not affect the respondent personally with the act, the election can only be set aside for the corrupt act of an agent, with which corrupt act the evidence fails personally to connect the respondent, and to this effect the report to the House of Commons should be.\nThe appeal must therefore be allowed with costs, and the election be set aside for the above cause, also with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: John Milnes Macdonell.\nSolicitors for respondents: Sedley Blanchard.\n[1] 37 Vic, ch. 9., sec. 96 :-\u201d And whereas doubts may arise as to whether the hiring of teams and vehicles to convey voters to and from the polls, and the paying of railway fares and other expenses of voters, be or be not according to law, it is declared and enacted, that the hiring or promising to pay or paying for any horse, team, carriage, cab, or other vehicle, by any candidate, or by any person on his behalf, to convey any voter or voters to or from the poll, or to or from the neighbourhood thereof, at any election, or the payment by any candidate, or by any person on his behalf, of the travelling and other expenses of any voter, in going to or returning from any election, are and shall be unlawful acts ; and the person so offending shall forfeit the sum of one hundred dollars to any person who shall sue for the same ; and any voter hiring any horse, cab, cart, waggon, sleigh, carriage or other conveyance for any candidate, or for any agent of a candidate, for the purpose of conveying any voter or voters to or from the polling place or places, shall, ipso facto, be disqualified from voting at such election, and for every such offence shall forfeit the sum of one hundred dollars, to any person suing for the same.\u201d\n[2] Sec. 98 \u201c The offences of bribery, treating, or undue influence, or any of such offences, as defined by this or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, personation, or the inducing any person to commit personation, or any wilful offence against any one of the six next preceding of this Act, shall be corrupt practices within the meaning of the provisions of this Act.\u201d\n[3] See p. 430\n[4] 1 O\u2019M. & H. 98 and 101.\n[5] 1 O\u2019M. & H. 289.\n[6] 1 \u2018M, &H, 30 and 35,\n5 10 C.

S., agreeably to the plans in the engineer's office and specifications, and with such directions as would bo given by the engineer in charge during the progress of the work. By the 7th clause of the contract no extra work could be performed, unless \"ordered in writing by the engineer in charge before the execution of the work.\" By letter, dated 26th August, 1873, the Minister of Public Works authorized the suppliant to make an addition to the wharf by the erection of a superstructure to be used as a coal floor, for the additional sum of $18,400. Further extra work, which amounted to $2,781, was performed under another letter from the Public Works Department. The work was completed, and on the final certificate of the Government's engineer in charge of the works, the sum of $9,681, as the balance due, was paid to the suppliant, who gave the following receipt, dated 30th\" April, 1875: \"Received from the Intercolonial Railway, in full, for all amounts against the government for works under contract, as follows: 'Richmond deep water wharf works for storage of coals, works for bracing wharf, rebuilding two stone cribs, the sum of $9,681.'\" The suppliant sued for extra work, which he alleged was not covered by the payment made on the 30th April, 1875, and also for damages caused to him by deficiency in and irregularity of payments. The petition was dismissed with cost; and a rule nisi for a new trial was subsequently moved for and discharged.\nHeld, affirming judgment of Court below: That all the work performed by the suppliant for the government was either contract work within the plans or specifications, or extra work within the meaning of the 7th clause of the contract, and that he was paid in full the contract price, and also the price of all extra work for which he could produce written authority, and that written authority of the engineer and the estimate of the value of the work are conditions precedent to the right of the suppliant to recover payment for any other extra work. (Henry, J., dissenting.)\nPer Ritchie, C. J.\u2014That neither the engineer, nor the clerk of the works, nor any subordinate officer in charge of any of the works of the Dominion of Canada, have any power or authority, express or implied, under the law to bind the Crown to any contract or expenditure not specially authorized by the express terms of contract duly entered into between the Crown and the contractor according to law, and then only in the specific manner provided for by the express terms of the contract.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, discharging a rule nisi, for a new trial in a petition of right case tried before Fournier, J.\nThe suppliant filed a petition of right, claiming compensation for extra work performed in connection with the building a deep sea wharf and coal floor, &c., at the Richmond Station, at Halifax, N.S.\nThe petition alleged as follows:\u2014\n\"That on the fourth day of December, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two, your suppliant by articles of agreement under seal and duly executed in duplicate, between your suppliant of the first part, and Her Majesty Queen Victoria, represented by the Honorable the Minister of Public Works of the Dominion of Canada, of the second part, bound and obliged himself to construct, complete and finish in every respect to the satisfaction of the said Minister, all the work required in and for the construction of a deep-water wharf at or near the Richmond Station of the Nova Scotia Railway in the said Province of Nova Scotia, and in accordance with certain plans and specifications also duly signed, remaining on record in the Department of Public Works for said Dominion of Canada, which said plans and specifications are respectively deemed and taken and read as part and parcel of said agreement, as by reference thereto will fully and at large appear. In consideraton whereof Her Majesty Queen Victoria, represented by the said Minister aforesaid, agreed to pay the sum of seventy-eight thousand dollars, to be paid according to certain schedule of prices designated to be used to ascertain the approximate value of the work done. And it was further agreed that if any change or alteration, either in the position or details of any part of the work during the progress thereof, your suppliant, the contractor, was bound to make such alteration or change, and if such alteration or change should entail extra expense on him, the same was to be allowed him.\n\"That your suppliant proceeded with the work. That in the summer of the year 1873, material alteraions were made in the plans changing the original structure providing for a coal floor, &c., at an expense of eighteen thousand four hundred dollars as estimated by the Engineer. This alteration proving injurious to the structure, a further sum of two thousand seven hundred dollars additional was estimated by the Engineer for bracing the structure. On the completion of all the aforesaid works the Engineer required of your suppliant to perform a vast amount of extra work involving additional labor and expenditure of material not provided for in any former contract or estimates. That your claimant claimed extra payment therefor which the Engineer refused to allow, but obliged your suppliant to do the work which he did under protest, always claiming, however, that such work should be paid for as extra.\n\"That your suppliant alleges that the extra work for which he claims compensation consists of additional fenders, besides other works, extra ballasts, scarfing timbers, substitution of long for short timbers, labor and material occasioned by alteration of plan of elevation, alterations in site and level of elevation, additional piles required and furnished, extra bracing and framing to cribs, longitudinal framing for elevation, scarfing longitudinal timber, cutting ends of logs under low water for which marine divers were employed at great expense; extra fenders for cribs and floors; all these besides divers other additional work and labor were required to be done, and which compelled your suppliant to lay out and expend divers large sums of money in the employment of labor and purchase of material\u2014for which he has received no compensation whatever.\nYour suppliant alleges that the foregoing outlay and expenditure of labor and material was rendered absolutely necessary from the want of proper foresight in making the original plans, and for not providing for the additional strain or pressure on the work occasioned by the alterations and additions hereinbefore set forth. That this additional work was ordered by the engineer or officer in charge, was strictly performed as directed, but has never been paid for.\n\"Your suppliant alleges that he sustained great damage and loss from inequality of payments, falling very far short of what he was strictly entitled to under the contracts and amount of work done; he also sustained heavy loss and damage from the great irregularity of payments which not only crippled his operations, but put him to loss and expense in procuriug money which was long overdue him under his contract, and which, even if it had been paid, with reasonable punctuality, would have saved him a large amount of interest expended in obtaining money elsewhere.\n\"Your suppliant alleges that his claim for compensation does not come within the provisions of the Act of 31st Vic., entitled, \"An Act respecting the Public Works of Canada,\" or Acts in amendment thereof; because under the terms of the contract signed by suppliant, it is provided that the determination of any matter of difference arising out of or concerned with the same shall be decided by the Minister or Architect, or by an Engineer or Officer of the Department, and that his claim for compensation comes strictly within the provisions of the Act passed during the last Session of the Dominion of Canada, entitled, 'An Act to provide for the Institution of Suits against the Crown by Petition of Right, and respecting procedure in Crown suits.'\n\"Your suppliant therefore humbly prays that,\" &c.\nThe Attorney General on behalf of Her Majesty by his answer admitted the contract and said:\n\"2. I admit that the suppliant proceeded with the work mentioned in the said contract, and that certain alterations were made in the plan thereof, providing for a coal floor, and that the cost of such alterations was estimated by the engineer in charge, and agreed to by the suppliant at the sum of $18,400.\n\"3. I admit that additional bracing was required in the work, and that the sum of $2,781 was estimated by the engineer, and agreed to by the suppliant as the cost thereof.\n\"4. The price which the suppliant was to receive for alterations occasioned by the construction of the coal floor, and the extra bracing as aforesaid, was agreed to by the suppliant as aforesaid, before he did the work, and the supplicant was fully paid and satisfied, the original contract price of $78,000, and also the other two sums of $18,400, and of $2,781, before the institution of this suit.\n\"5. Besides the last mentioned sums, the suppliant demanded and was paid before suit, a sum of $400 as and for the cost of repairs of a crib or cribs in the said work of faulty construction, to which the suppliant had no just claim, inasmuch as by the terms of contract, he was bound to lay the same down in a proper and sufficient manner, without any extra remuneration beyond the contract price.\n\"6. After all the works in the said petition mentioned, were fully completed by the suppliant, to wit on the 30th day of April, A.D. 1875, there was a settlement of accounts between the suppliant and the engineer in charge of the said works, acting thereon on behalf of Her Majesty, when it was found that there was a balance due to the suppliant, in respect to the said works of $9,681; and upon the last mentioned day, the said sum of $9,681 was paid to the suppliant, and was received and accepted by him in full satisfaction and discharge of all demands against Her Majesty in respect of the said works.\n\"7. The suppliant performed none of the work mentioned in the said petition after the last mentioned settlement of accounts and payment, and I deny that the petitioner has any just claim against Her Majesty in respect of any of the matters mentioned in the said petition, and I plead the said settlement and payment as a complete bar thereto.\n\"8. I deny that, with the exception of the extra works hereinbefore mentioned, and which have been fully paid for as aforesaid, any other work was performed by the suppliant, for which he was or is entitled to be paid, over and above the contract price.\n\"9. Such of the works mentioned in the third paragraph of the suppliant's petition as were in fact done, were done in the proper construction and completion of the works comprised in the contract and to remedy defects therein, and to make the same conform to the terms of the contract and in fulfilment thereof and not otherwise.\n\"10. I deny that the outlay and expenditure of labor and material mentioned in the third and fourth paragraphs of the said petition were rendered necessary by the want of foresight in making the original plans, or by not providing for the additional strain or pressure on the work occasioned by the alterations and additions in the said petition mentioned; and I say that, except the alterations hereinbefore mentioned, and which have been paid for as aforesaid, no alterations in, or additions to, the said work were ordered by the engineer or officer in charge, or were performed by the suppliant, except what was required to complete the work in a proper manner, according to the requirements of the contract.\n\"11. I submit that the Honorable the Minister of Public Works having, through the engineer in charge, as the fact is, determined that the works mentioned in the said petition, other than those paid for as aforesaid, were within the terms of the said contract, and the plans and specifications, the said determination is final and conclusive upon the suppliant under the 9th clause of the said contract, and is a bar to this suit.\n\"12. The suppliant was bound, by the terms of the contract, to have the said work completed by the 30th day of April, 1873, but it was not finished until about the end of the year 1874, and Her Majesty might justly have claimed a large sum for damages for the said delay, and for expense of superintendence under the 11th clause of the said contract, but I submit that all matters in question between Her Majesty and the suppliant were finally settled by the payment of the 30th day of April, 1875, hereinbefore mentioned.\n\"13. I deny that the suppliant has any just ground of complaint by reason of delay or irregularity of payments as alleged in the 5th paragraph of the said petition. He was, at his special request, paid the sum of $15,000 on account of materials before he had any part thereof on the ground. He was afterwards regularly paid on progress estimates given by the engineer, who on some occasions, however, necessarily and properly delayed giving the same until faulty work was done according to his directions, but which the suppliant for some time refused to do.\n\"14. I charge that the suppliant has been fully paid and satisfied for all the work comprised in the said contract, and for all the extra work he was authorized in writing to do, according to the terms of the 7th clause of the said contract, and that he is bound by the amount of the said extra work, as determined by the engineer in charge, as also provided in the said 7th clause.\n\"15. I pray, on behalf of Her Majesty, that the said petition may be dismissed with costs.\"\nThe portions of the agreement which bear on the matters in controversy, are as follows;\u2014\n\"ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT, entered into on the fourth day of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two, and made in duplicate between William Desmond O'Brien of the City of Halifax, in the Province of Nova Scotia, contractor, of the first part, and Her Majesty Queen Victoria, represented herein by the Minister or Public Works of the Dominion of Canada, of the second part: Witness, that the party of the first part hereby binds and obliges himself, his heirs and assigns, to and in favor of Her said Majesty, her heirs and successors, for and in consideration of the covenants, conditions and agreements hereinafter mentioned, to find all necessary tools, implements and materials whatsoever, and to construct, complete and finish, in every respect, to the satisfaction of the said Minister, in a good substantial and workmanlike manner, agreeably to the true intent and meaning of the specification hereunto annexed and duly signed, \"ne varietur\" by the parties hereto, and in accordance with the plans, also duly signed, remaining on record in the Department of Public Works, where reference thereto may be had:\n\"All the work required in and for the construction of a deep water wharf, at or near the Richmond Station of the Nova Scotia Railway, in the said Province of Nova Scotia.\n\"The whole to be completed and finished, and to be in every respect ready for use, on or before the thirtieth day of April, A. D. one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three.\n\"In consideration whereof, Her Majesty Queen Victoria, represented by the said Minister as aforesaid, doth hereby promise and agree to pay to the party of the first part, or to the heirs, assigns, or legal representatives of the party of the first part, the rates and prices hereinafter mentioned, which shall be computed in currency, and payment thereof will be made by Her said Majesty according to the provisions of the Act thirty-first Victoria, ch. twelve, that is to say:\n\"For the full final and satisfactory completion of the said wharf agreeable to the plans in the Engineer's office and specification hereunto annexed, and with such directions as shall be given by the engineer or officers in charge during the progress of the work; the party of the first part shall be paid by Her Majesty, represented by the said party of the second part, the sum of seventy-eight thousand dollars. And for the purposes of monthly certificates the following schedule of prices shall be used to ascertain the approximate value of the work done, but in no case shall the whole contract price of seventy-eight thousand dollars be exceeded, that being the total amount which the said party of the first part is to receive from the said party of the second part for the full and final completion of the said wharf.\n\"And the said party of the first part and Her said Majesty, represented as aforesaid, do hereby declare, covenant and agree that the said contract and undertaking shall be and is further made and entered into by them, the said party of the first part and Her said Majesty, represented as aforesaid, under the express agreements, stipulations, covenants and conditions following, that is to say:\u2014\n\"Firstly.\u2014That payments of the price hereinbefore mentioned, shall be made to the party of the first part within ten days after an estimate of the engineer or officer in charge shall have been received by the Minister, specifying the amount of work done, to the satisfaction of the said Minister or of his Engineer, during the month then ending; but that, nevertheless, it shall be lawful for Her Majesty to withhold from the party of the first part and retain ten per cent. out of the amount of the estimates until the perfect completion of the work, and the acceptance of the same by the Minister, which ten per cent., so withheld and retained, shall be paid with the last instalment, within ten days after the engineer or officer in charge shall have delivered to the Minister his final estimate of the work performed, and the materials furnished, in virtue of these presents, with detailed measurements, weights, &c., and his certificate of the work having been fully completed and finished, if the Minister shall so soon have accepted and approved of the work; and that in forming his final estimate, the engineer or other officer shall not be bound or governed by the preceding monthly estimates, which shall be taken and considered merely as approximate. Provided always, and it is further agreed, that Her said Majesty from time to time during the progress of the works, may pay to the party of the first part the whole or any portion of the ten per cent., so withheld and retained.\n\"Fourthly.\u2014That all materials for the said work shall be inspected and approved of, before being used, either by the Minister or such person as he may appoint, and any materials disapproved of shall not be used in the work, and if not removed by the party of the first part, when directed by the minister or his engineer or person in charge, then the rejected materials shall be removed by the Minister, his engineer or person in charge, to such place as he may deem proper, at the cost and charge, and at the risk of the party of the first part, but it is distinctly understood and agreed that the inspection and approval of materials shall not in any wise subject Her said Majesty to pay for the said materials, or any portion thereof, unless employed or used in the said works, nor prevent the rejection, afterwards, of any portion thereof, which may turn out unsound or unfit to be used in the work, nor shall such inspection be considered as any waiver of objection to the work on the account of the unsoundness or imperfection of the materials used.\n\"Seventhly.\u2014That if any change or alteration, either in tin position or details of any part of the work shall be required by the said minister during the progress thereof, the party of the first part is hereby bound to make such alteration or change, and if such alteration, or change shall entail extra expense on the said party of the first part, either in labor or materials, the same shall be allowed to the said party of the first part, or, should it be saying to the said party of the first part in either labor or materials, the same shall be deducted from the amount of this contract; in either case the amount is to be determined by the estimate made by the Minister, his engineer or officer in charge. But no such change or alteration, whatever may be the extent or quality thereof, or at whatever time the same may be required to be made, pending the said contract, shall in any wise have the effect of suspending, superseding, annulling or rescinding this contract, which shall continue to subsist, notwithstanding any such change or alteration; and every such change or alteration shall be performed and made by the said party of the first part, under and subject to the conditions, stipulations and covenants herein expressed, as if such a change or alteration had been expressed or specified in the terms of this contract; and should the said party of the first part be required by Her Majesty, represented as aforesaid, to do any work, or furnish any materials for which there is not any price specified in this contract, the same shall be paid for at the estimated prices of the engineer in charge of the works; but no change or alteration as aforesaid whatever, and no extra work whatever, shall be done without the written authority of the engineer in charge, given prior to the execution of such work, nor will any allowance or payment whatever be made for the same, in case it should be done without such authority.\n\"Eighthly.\u2014That the party of the first part shall not, in any way dispose of, sub-let or re-let any portion of the work embraced in this contract, except the procuring of materials.\n\"Ninthly.\u2014Should any difference of opinion arise as to the construction to be put upon any part of the specifications or plans, the same shall be determined by the minister alone, and such determination shall be final and conclusive, and binding upon the parties to this contract, and every of them.\n\"Fourteenthly.\u2014The specification hereunto annexed, together with the plans of the work herein agreed to be performed, shall respectively be deemed taken and read as parts and parcels of these presents as if the same were actually embodied herein.\"\nThe following clauses of the specifications were referred to:\u2014\n\"4. On figure one are laid down three parallel lines of soundings taken on west side, centre and east side of wharf, but contractors are required to verify the same before tendering for the work; as soon as the work is commenced accurate soundings for each crib must be made by the contractor that the outline of the bottom may be known previous to their being founded, and provision must be made for the slope of the ground by stepping the bottom courses in the manner shewn on the plan, as each crib must be carried up perfectly level.\n\"5. The cribs must be placed in a straight line and at the proper distances apart, and if considered necessary by the engineer or officer in charge of the work, guide piles shall be driven to assist in founding each crib and preserving the alignment.\n\"13. So soon as it is considered by the engineer or officer in charge that a firm foundation has been obtained, and the cribs have settled to their position, they will be connected at the top both in a horizontal and transverse direction by three rows of timber, each row having two courses and being secured to the cribs by iron bolts 7\/8 inch diameter; the timbers on the outside are to be squared to 12 inches on three sides, and the remainder flatted on the upper and under sides to 12 inches in depth.\n\"26. The contractor must exercise great care in sinking the cribs, and distribute the weight of stone over the whole area that they may strike the bottom when perfectly plumb.\n\"28. The work throughout must be executed in a substantial and workmanlike manner in accordance with the plan and specification, and to the satisfaction of the engineer or officer in charge, who shall have full power and authority to reject any materials or workmanship not in accordance with the true intent and meaning of this specification as expressed or understood.\n\"29. This specification, together with the plan exhibited, are to be taken to give a general idea of the work required, and omissions in either are not to be considered as invalidating the contract, and parties tendering must embrace everything in their tender, whether mentioned or not, as they will be required to complete the work according to the true intent and meaning of the specification and plan at the contract sum.\n\"30. The bulk sum mentioned in the tender must include the entire cost of furnishing all labor, materials, tools and machinery, and every contingency connected with the work, and the contractor is to assume all risks, and make good, at his own cost, any damage which may result from loss of materials or otherwise by storms, or from any other cause whatsoever during the progress of the work, and up to its full and satisfactory completion. \"31. Contractors must prepare for themselves an estimate of the quantities of material required for the work, and shew the same in the schedule attached to the tender.\n\"34. Payments will be made as the work proceeds on the certificate of the engineer, less 10 per cent. to be retained until the completion of the contract.\"\nThe case was tried in May, AD. 1877, before the Hon. Mr. Justice Fournier, who delivered the following judgment:\u2014\n\"The suppliant, a contractor, on the 4th day of December, 1872, entered into a contract with Her Majesty, represented by the Honorable the Minister of Public Works of the Dominion of Canada, to construct a deep-water wharf at or near the Richmond Station of the Nova Scotia Railway, in the Province of Nova Scotia. All the works mentioned and detailed in the said contract, in accordance with the plans and specifications, which are deemed and taken and read as part and parcel of the contract, were duly executed by the contractor and were (as admitted by suppliant) paid for. Suppliant avers that by a special agreement he bound and obliged himself to construct on the said wharf a structure providing for a coal floor, with additional trestle-work to support an elevated railway, for the sum of $18,400, and that he also performed additional extra work to the amount of two thousand seven hundred and eighty-one dollars.\n\"He admits also to have been paid these two last mentioned sums. He does not therefore, make any claim for these works, which are only referred to for the purpose of better understanding the subsequent averments of his petition of right. Suppliant's actual claim is based on the fact that on the completion of all the aforesaid works, the engineer who was in charge of the works, required him to perform a vast amount of extra work involving additional labor and expenditure of material not provided for in any former contracts or estimates. The works for which he claims compensation, are enumerated in the third paragraph of his petition, and are as follows:\u2014\n\"June, July and August, 1873\u2014Divers and assistants employed in removing boulder stones and fixing ballast to sustain cribs on the outside\n$600 08\nBallast for same\n160 00\n\"October 6, 1873\u201425 and 30 feet timbers in front of 28 cribs, 345 tons at $7\n2,415 00\n(Directed by Engineer, and insisted upon by contractor as extra.)\n\"October 22, 1873\u2014Extra pay to Graham Bros. for change in plan of elevation after contract\n300 00\n\"May 4, 1874\u2014First raising trestle work\u2014cash paid\n100 00\nTimber for same\u201460 tons at $8\n480 00\n\"July, 1874\u2014Scarfing long timbers (ordered by Engineer, but not required by contract)\n300 00\n\"Sept., Oct. and Nov., 1874\u2014135 fenders at $7, not in specification\n945 00\n\"Nov. 1, 1874\u201472 extra fenders on 4 cribs, $8\n576 00\n\"Nov. 10, \"\u201422 piles, 60 feet each, 1,320 feet, at 75c. per foot\n990 00\n\"Outside crib framing and bracing 2,000, board measure at $40\n80 00\n\"Inside cribs, framing and bracing, 6,500 board measure\n260 00\n\"Cutting off by divers of ends of logs to a depth of 20 feet under low water on all outside cribs\n2,000 00\n\"Damage and loss sustained by deficiency in, and irregularity of payment; expense incurred in procuring money elsewhere, when same due and payable under contract, interest, &c\n1,500 00\n$11,166 00\n\"Suppliant also claims interest on amount of claim from date of petition of right until judgment.\n\"It is also alleged that these extra works were rendered absolutely necessary from the want of proper foresight in making the original plans, and for not providing for the additional strain or pressure occasioned by the structure necessary for a coal floor and the trestle work erected on one side of the wharf.\n\"Another averment is for the damage and loss he sustained from the inequality of payments and insufficiency of the monthly progress estimates.\n\"And, lastly, it is alleged that suppliant's claim for compensation does not come within the provisions of the Act of 31st Vic., ch. 12, entitled \"An Act respecting the Public Works of Canada,\" but comes strictly within the provisions of the Act intituled \"The Petition of flight Act of 1876.\"\n\"With reference to this allegation, it is as well to dispose of it at once by stating that the contract in question formally declared that it was entered into in accordance with the provisions of the Act 31 Vic., ch. 12, respecting the Public Works of Canada. I will not therefore say anything further on this point.\n\"It will be seen by this summary of the petition of the suppliant that his claim can be stated in the following words: 1st, For extra works rendered necessary from the want of proper foresight on the part of the engineer in making the original plans for the construction of the wharf; 2nd, For extra works rendered necessary by not having previously calculated what would be the consequences of altering the original plan in constructing a coal floor and a trestle-work for an elevated railway on the wharf.\n\"The defence produced in the name of Her Majesty by the Attorney General of the Dominion admits that the suppliant was entitled, 1st, to the sum of $78,000 as the amount of the original contract; 2nd, to $18,400, being the price of the coal floor and trestle work; 3rd, to a sum of $2,781 for divers extra works ordered by the engineer; 4th, to a sum of $400 for repairs, which amount, though not legally due, was admitted.\n\"Beside these admissions, it is also pleaded that a final settlement took place and payment was made. The defence is worded, as follows:\nAfter all the works mentioned in the said petition, were fully completed by the suppliant on the 30th day of April, A. D. 1875, there was a settlement of accounts between the suppliant and engineer-in-chief of the said works, acting thereon on behalf of Her Majesty, when it was found that there was a balance due to the suppliant in respect of the said works of $9,681; and upon the last mentioned day, the sum of $9,681 was paid to the suppliant, and accepted by him in full satisfaction and discharge of all demand against Her Majesty in respect of the said works.\n\"By the 11th paragraph of the defence, the decision rendered on the suppliant's claim by the Minister of Public Works is invoked as being final and as being a peremptory answer to suppliant's demands, viz.:\nI submit that the Minister of Public Works, having through the engineer-in-charge, as the fact is, determined that the works mentioned in the said petition, others than those paid for as aforesaid, were within the terms of the said contract, and the plans, specifications, the said determination is final and conclusive upon the suppliant under the 9th clause of the said contract, and is a bar to this suit.\n\"The other paragraphs of the defence deny specially each and every allegation of the said petition.\n\"The principal question which arises in this case is, whether the suppliant has established his right to be paid the value of the extra works he alleges to have. performed. In order to answer this question it is necessary that reference should be made to the agreement entered into between the suppliant and Her Majesty., Towards the end of the year 1872, the Honorable the Minister of Public Works, wishing to have a deep water wharf constructed as before stated, ordered plans and specifications of the works to be prepared, in order to receive tenders for the work. The suppliant's tender having been accepted on the 4th of December of the same year, a contract duly signed by the suppliant and the Honorable the Minister of Public Works, and countersigned by the Secretary of Public Works and sealed with the official seal of the Department of Public Works, was executed in conformity with the provisions of ch. 12, 31 Vic. By this contract the suppliant bound and obliged himself to construct and complete, on or before the 30th April, 1873, to the satisfaction of the Minister of Public Works, and in accordance with the specifications annexed to the said contract, all the works required in and for the construction of the said deep water wharf; and as a consideration for the complete execution of the siad work in accordance with the plans and specifications and directions to be given to him by the engineer who would be in charge of the said works, the suppliant was to receive from Her Majesty the sum of $78,000, payable by monthly instalments on the certificate of the engineer stating the quantity of work done during the month.\n\"By the 7th clause of the contract, which provides for alterations which the Minister of Public Works may deem necessary during the progress of the work, and for any increase or diminution of price which these alterations might cause, it was expressly agreed and declared that, in either case, the amount was to be determined by the Minister, his engineer or other officer in charge, and that such alterations would be made subject to the provisions of the contract, and in the same manner as if said alterations and changes were inserted and specified in the said contract.\n\"This clause concludes as follows:\u2014\nBut no change or alteration as aforesaid whatever shall be done without the written authority of the engineer in charge, given prior to the execution of such work, nor will any allowance or payment whatever be made for the same, in case it should be done' without such authority.\n\"According to the terms of the contract no extra work can be performed, except as provided for, that is to say:\nIf ordered in writing by the engineer in charge before the execution of the work.\n\"Has this condition, under which alone the suppliant can have the legal right of being paid for his alleged extra work, been complied with? Does the suppliant produce in support of his claim any written authority signed by the engineer? No.\n\"On the contrary, when he is questioned he declares he has received no such authority and does not produce any. He refers, however, to a letter from engineer McNabb, dated 10th November, 1874, as a written authority for certain items of his claim. This letter is produced, but on reading it, it is evident that the works therein mentioned were ordered as works within the terms of the contract. It is in the following terms:\u2014\nIt is necessary that the following works (reported upon by the clerk of works) should be performed by you under your contract for the construction of the Richmond wharf, and I beg to request that you will lose no time in their execution.\n\"In a letter of a later date, 19th January, 1875, in answer to a demand of payment for extras, the engineer, referring in the following words to what he had answered him in his letter of the 10th November, says: 'You will observe that no payment will be allowed for the four first items named in my letter of the 19th November, they forming part of the work mentioned in your contract as stated therein.'\n\"It is clear to my mind from the admissions of the suppliant and from his correspondence with the Engineer that no written authority was ever given to the suppliant to perform the said work. He is necessarily bound by the clauses of the contract he has signed, and which furnish a direct answer to the case, viz: that he shall be refused payment for any extra work done without a written authority. Can he now complain of his position and address himself to a Court of Justice in order to have his contract set aside and be relieved of his obligations? Certainly not.\n\"It is an elementary principle, that agreements made between parties are binding in law on those who make them, and that Courts of Justice have no other power than to enforce the execution of the agreements. A Judge must also respect them, and it is only when the terms of the agreements, are uncertain or doubtful that he should intervene, in order to interpret the agreement in such cases in accordance with the intention of the parties, but he has no power to make a contract other than the one they mutually agreed upon. This is certainly not a case in which the Judge can exercise his power. The clause above cited and which has reference to extra work is so clear and precise that it does not admit of a doubt. Such a clause is binding. It has been decided frequently by Courts of Justice in a number of cases of which I will give a list later on. It would not be necessary for me to add anything further, and I might dispose of that part of the suppliant's claim which has reference to extra work without examining the evidence offered in support of this portion of the petition; but I think it is as well to ascertain if the work done is really extra work for which the suppliant would be entitled to recover, had he complied with the condition or formality of obtaining a written authority from the engineer; or if it is work done, as stated by the engineer within the terms of the contract; or again, if it is work done in consequence of the unskilfulness of the contractor, or as one of the risks he undertook when he signed his contract.\n\"This I will endeavor to ascertain by going over the items of the suppliant's claim, not in the order given in his bill of particulars, but as classed by the suppliant himself when giving his evidence. The first two items of his bill, which, as he states, refer to the said work, are for works which he was required to do in consequence of a want of proper foresight on the part of the engineer and of the insufficiency of information given as to the nature of the soil or bottom on which he was to rest the foundations of the wharf. The work consisted in removing boulder stones which prevented him from fixing his cribs on a level on the bottom on which they were to rest, and also in fixing ballast to sustain cribs on the outside.\n\"He admits having executed the work without being directed to do so, and that he did so in order to protect the work already done, and which would have been otherwise endangered.\n\"The works were in jeopardy because the ground beneath the water was very steep and irregular, and the cribs, constructed in what they call \"steps\" according to the plan, had no firm hold on the bottom, and the result was they had a tendency to step.\n\"He says he placed his cribs in accordance with the plan, and the work was done to protect the cribs, which were in danger from the unevenness of the bottom. This was no fault of his. It is true the plan, in order to give a general idea of the way in which the cribs should be placed, shows that the lower parts of the cribs to have a firm hold on the bottom, should be constructed like the steps of a stairs. The plan does not exactly correspond with the unevenness of the bottom, and the suppliant concluded that the work claimed under these two items was necessitated in consequence of the insufficiency of the plan, and want of proper foresight on the part of the engineer. However, after giving this explanation in the first part of his evidence, he states afterwards that it was only after the shifting of some of the cribs that he employed divers to examine the foundations, and that it was only through his own experience, that he was able to know what the bottom was like, and to ascertain that the engineer was as ignorant as himself on this point. Now, whose duty was it more especially to make the necessary soundings to know the outline of the bottom?\n\"Do not the specifications oblige the contractor to perform certain work in reference to these soundings? Yes, most certainly. The work is distinctly specified, and he must have entirely forgotten that he was obliged to perform it, for there can be no other reason why he makes a claim for these two items. To settle this point it is sufficient to refer to the specifications. By the 4th clause the party who tenders is notified that soundings made at the places marked by three parallel lines on the plan, should be verified \"before tendering for work.\" Thus, even before putting in his tender, suppliant was cautioned as to the foundations. He is told that he must verify the soundings made by the engineer. The reason for this, no doubt, was because the Government did not care to cause disappointment to contractors, or wish to incur any responsibility in consequence of the insufficiency of these soundings. Thus notified, was it not the duty of every person who desired to tender to ascertain most precisely what the nature of the foundations were, in order to ask a price calculated on difficulties which did not appear by the soundings made by the engineer, but which by the terms of the contract he was bound to include in his estimate.\n\"Not only is the party who tenders cautioned to be prudent, but once he becomes the contractor his first duty is:\nAs soon as the work is commenced, accurate soundings for each crib must be made by the contractor, so that the outline of the bottom may be known previous to their being founded, and provision must be made for the slope of the ground by stepping the bottom courses in the manner shown on the plan, as each crib must be carried up perfectly level.\n\"This certainly seems sufficient to leave no doubt as to the duty of the contractor with regard to the foundations, but sections 13 and 16 of the specifications prove in a more positive manner, if it is possible, the necessity for the contractor to comply with this obligation, by stating that the contractor shall not brace together the cribs until the engineer in charge shall be satisfied that the contractor has got a solid foundation, and that the cribs have settled to their position. The 16th clause is as follows:\u2014\nThe contractor must exercise great care in sinking the cribs, and distribute the weight of stone over the whole area, that they may strike the bottom when perfectly plumb.\n\"Now, if the suppliant did not deem it necessary to make soundings before making his tender; if he did not complete the soundings, as it was his duty to do when he commenced the work; it he did not protest the engineer in order to ascertain if the foundation was firm; if he did not ask his opinion, or exact a report, as to whether the cribs had settled to their position in order to continue without any danger his works; if after neglecting to take the necessary precautions, it was only after an accident that he perceived the foundations were bad, who should be responsible for the consequences? Is it not the party who had neglected to take the necessary precautionary means which were imposed on him in his interest by his contract? Most assuredly, he alone is responsible. The Crown could not, without injustice, be made responsible for what it has so positively guarded against.\n\"Moreover, whatever might be the consequences, it is one of those risks which the suppliant has assumed in virtue of the 30th clause of the specification, viz:\u2014\nThe bulk sum mentioned in the tender must include the entire cost of furnishing all labor, materials, tools and machinery, and every contingency connected with the work, and the contractor is to assume all risk and make good at his own cost any damage which may result from loss of materials or otherwise by storms or from any other cause whatsoever, during the progress of the work and up to its full and satisfactory completion.\n\"I must also add that the suppliant admits that, previous to the filing of his petition of right, he did not ask payment for these two items. He relied so little upon this part of his claim, that he only made it known for the first time, four years after the works were completed, when he prepared the bill of particulars annexed to the present petition.\n\"Would it not have been better for him not to include these two ill-founded items in his claim?\n\"For the above reasons I do not hesitate to declare, that the work included in items 1 and 2 were rendered necessary in consequence of want of foresight on the part of the suppliant, and because he did not comply with the conditions of the contract and of the specifications in regard to the foundations. On this part of his demand he cannot even rely on equity.\n\"The third item of suppliant's claim is $2,415 for having placed 25 and 30 feet timbers in front of twenty; eight cribs by order of the engineer. By the specifications the shore cribs are smaller than the outer cribs which were to be sixty by twenty-five feet. The 22nd clause of the specifications refers to these outer cribs in the following words:\nIn building the three large cribs both logs and square timber are to break joint at least eight feet.\n\"If no specification of the length the logs and square timber to be used in building the smaller cribs is given, it is because the plan sufficiently shows that the timber must be of the same length as the cribs, viz.: 25 to 30 feet without breaking joint; the break joint in section 22 refers to the large cribs only in order to show that they may be different from the others.\n\"In this paragraph of the specifications the suppliant deemed there was a singular contradiction and that he would be guilty of an error of architecture in not breaking joint. True, it does appear strange at first to say that it is necessary to employ timber of a greater length for building smaller cribs than you would for large cribs; but the engineer, in accordance with the specification in his correspondence, as well as in his evidence, explains this in a satisfactory manner.\n\"In his letter of the 2nd October, 1873, in answer to suppliant's contention, the engineer in charge says:\nThe clause in the specifications referring to joints broken at eight feet, refers to the sides of the long cribs 60 x 25 but not to the end, as it would not be possible to get them of the former length unless at great expense. The sides of the large cribs are treated in a manner similar to solid, or continuous crib work, which necessitates the joints to be broken at a proper distance.\n\"In the same letter he insists on his using timber of the same length as the short cribs. I will cite his words:\nI regret that I cannot withdraw the objection made to your using short pieces of square timber for the cribs. There can be no difficulty whatever in your procuring timber 30 and 25 feet long, and even if such were the case, it is of the first importance that such difficulty should be met and overcome when it has so direct a connection with the strength and durability of the work, not to speak of the workmanship. \"I am of opinion that the engineer has thus correctly interpreted the specifications and the plan. It must also be borne in mind that in such cases his opinion is to determine, for the suppliant has so covenanted by the 28th clause of the specifications which form part of the contract, and is as follows:\nThe work throughout must be executed in a substantial manner in accordance with the plan and this specification, and to the satisfaction of the engineer or officer in charge, who shall have full power and authority to reject any materials or workmanship, not in accordance with the true intent and meaning of this specification as expressed or understood.\n\"This clause, as well as that referring to the payment of extras, is binding, provided bad faith is not imputed to the arbitrator agreed upon. The law on this point is as well settled as on the first; this was a matter over which the engineer had entire control, and which he decided in accordance with the meaning of the contract. I am, therefore, compelled to dismiss also this item of suppliant's claim.\n\"Items 4, 5 and 6 refer to a change made by the Government in the original plan of the works contracted for by the suppliant. In the month of May, 1874, a short time after the works were commenced, the Honorable the Minister of Public Works availing himself of the 7th clause of the contract, which authorizes him on certain conditions therein specified to make such alteration or changes in the work contracted for, directed the engineer to get information as to building on the said wharf a coal floor and a trestle work for an elevated railway. Engineer McNabb had an interview with the suppliant and explained to him the nature of the work that was wanted. In order to be well understood he showed him as a model a similar structure erected on an adjoining wharf, with this difference, that it should be more elevated. On this occasion a fixed sum of $18,400, was agreed upon, but the authority of the Minister of Public Works was still wanted to complete the agreement. Before it was given the suppliant transferred this new contract to Messrs. Graham Brothers. One of them (James) thereon interviewed engineer McNabb, who repeated to him what he had already, explained to the suppliant, and directed him not to commence work until he got the plans of the work. These plans were afterwards furnished. By the evidence of McNabb it appears the work was executed on the model that was given, with this difference, that it was slightly more elevated and somewhat larger, but in accordance with the plans. It is in consequence of this difference that suppliant claims as extra the price of these three items; alleging that the change took place after his verbal contract with engineer McNabb was concluded. It is evident there was an agreement passed as to this work, but at what date? Certainly not when suppliant interviewed McNabb, and was told by him that he had no authority to make the contract unless authorized by the Minister, and that he was not to commence work before he had been furnished with the plans. The agreement was not therefore binding until this authorization was obtained, and this was given by telegram on the 1st of September, after the plans had been furnished. On that date the contract came into force. Graham, in his deposition admits that it was only after he had received the plans he made a binding contract with O'Brien. It is also proved that no alteration was ordered after he had received them. But it appears that the suppliant, in his eagerness to dispose of the new contract to Graham, with whom he was making a large profit (as Graham executed the work for $6,000 for which suppliant was getting $18,400) did not give him sufficient information as to the size of this new building. He was consequently obliged to pay him $300, which he now claims under item 4, and to personally incur the expense which forms items 5 and 6. This expense was incurred because the work was commenced before the plans were furnished,, and evidently must be paid for by the suppliant. The engineer, by obliging the contractor to increase the height of the building in accordance with the plan of the works, only did his duty.\n\"For these reasons I declare and adjudge his claim under these items, ill-founded.\n\"Items 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14, may be considered together; they proceed from the one cause (as suppliant himself says) which was above mentioned, a change made in the original plan. He claims these works were rendered necessary because the building of the coal floor and the elevated railway on trestles on one side of the cribs weakened very much the wharf.\n\"At pp. 32, 33 and 34 of his evidence he explains in the following words the effect of the change:\u2014\nTo make this new class of work, the strength of the works was weakened very much. Owing to that and the nature of this superincumbent work, the elevated railway on trestles being placed on one side of the cribs caused a lodgement on that side, and when the work was completed by agreement, it was found the work sank with it, and it did not present a perfectly level front, Mr. McNabb ordered it to be lifted up, which was a costly operation to do, and to be protected underneath.\nQ. You say those two items became necessary in consequence of the yielding of the work under the original plan? A. Under the altered plan. Had the original work been kept in its entirety as I signed the contract for, it would not have yielded. The alteration of the coal yard required the wharf to be lowered some six feet on one side, and the binding was thereby broken up. The binding was broken and weakened the wharf very much.\n\"Graham, sub-contractor, of these works, when examined by the suppliant as one of his witnesses, corroborates this statement; he says:\u2014\nI think the coal floor had the effect of settling the seaside of the inner row of cribs, the east side\u2014the furthest out into the harbor. Cribs that form the coal floor settled towards the east. I think it was the effect of the superstructure. \"This witness is not an engineer and his position of sub-contractor of the suppliant for the same work, naturally prejudiced him in his favor. It will be seen that in this respect he goes much further than Keating, the engineer, who was also examined as a witness on behalf of the suppliant, and who, while declaring that: The effect of lowering part of the wharf for that floor was bad, as it cut the top timbers which run from side to side of the wharf, points out, however, that the bad foundations were the principal cause of the settling of the wharf, of the leaning over of certain cribs and of the yielding of others. He corroborates on this point McNabb, the engineer, and to show this I will cite a part of his evidence. When asked what caused the yielding of the cribs he answered:\u2014\nThe bottom must have been soft to begin with, and of course the weight of the superstructure made it settle.\n\"Another question being put to him as to whether the weight of the trestle would cause the difference he answers:\u2014\nIt is the additional weight of any thing that may be put on it in connection with its use, the condition of the bottom and everything taken together. I have referred to the structure as a whole.\n\"Further on he adds:\u2014\nShore end cribs were canted a great deal. The top was bent towards the sea. Pretty nearly all of them. * * * This is owing to a soft bottom in one instance, their own weight and any additional weight that may have been put on the top of them.\n\"Again, in answer to a subsequent question, he explains in a more precise manner the principal cause of the setting of the works. I will cite the passage.\nQ. These cribs were put down upon a soft bottom and they necessarily had some weight of their own and they were intended to be used for putting heavy weights upon them, how do you conceive they should have been put down? A. I think provision should have been made for them to rest upon a level bottom; on a solid bottom of some kind or other. * * * If this had been done the work would not have canted.\nQ. The canting, in your opinion, then, was not occasioned by the change from the original structure to the coal floor. A. No. It may have been assisted by the additional weight of that structure put on top of it.\nQ. If the cribs had been properly put down, the placing of the trestle work would have canted them? A. If a proper provision had been made for the bottom it would not.\nQ. I suppose the trestle work was not heavy enough to crush the cribs? A. No.\nQ. Then if it was on a proper foundation it would not disturb the cribs? A. No, certainly not.\n\"It is clear that in this engineer's opinion, one of the suppliant's witnesses, if the foundations had been made in accordance with the specifications, the suppliant's work would not have suffered any damage. But in addition to this witness, we have the evidence of engineer McNabb, who proves beyond all doubt what really rendered necessary the additional works comprised in the different items now under consideration. I think it necessary, in order to clearly establish this all important fact, to give an extract of his evidence on this point. The following question was put:\nQ. It has been said that the change in the plan of structure necessarily weakened the structure and produced injurious effects to it, what is your opinion? A. My opinion is the alteration did not weaken it. There were more struts beyond the timber than called for in the original contract, and therefore the tendency, in my opinion would be to protect the structure. There were more timbers spanning the western and centre rows of cribs than originally.\nQ. Now what was the cause of that? (The canting of the crib.) A. It made a serious bend or bow in the wharf.\nQ. How did it happen? A. The difficulty was in the bottom in my opinion.\nQ. I see by the specification, it says, in the first section, that it was the duty of the contractor to ascertain carefully the nature of the bottom and place his cribs down in such a way that they would be adapted to the formation of the bottom and come up square? A. Yes.\nQ. Now if that had been done would this canting have occurred? A. I consider if the cribs had touched the solid foundation of the bottom they would not have canted.\nQ. Would the trestle work which was built upon the cribs, or any other reasonable weight have canted the cribs, if that had been done? A. I don't think it would have been possible for them to have done so.\nQ. What did the soundings show the formation to be? In what direction did it slant? A. It slanted seawards and it slanted towards the centre of the structure.\nQ. That is longitudinally? A. Yes, and cross-wise also.\nQ. So, each crib had to be stepped in two ways? A. Yes, in two directions.\nQ. Would there have been any greater weight upon the cribs if the wharf had been constructed according to the original design than according to its present construction? A. I think not because they were reduced in height five feet.\nQ. And that was all heavy structure? A. Yes, it was similar in character to the balance of the crib.\n\"On this point, as well as on many others, engineer McNabb's opinion is directly opposed to that of suppliant. McNabb declares that the yielding and settling of the wharf, which rendered necessary the works mentioned in the above items, is not due to the change from the original plan, but to the bad foundations.\n\"I have already stated what were the contractor's obligations with regard to the foundations and the placing down of the cribs, and I only refer-to them to show that the items now under consideration must also be dismissed for the same reasons as the first item.\n\"It cannot be doubted, according to the opinions above cited, that had the suppliant taken the precautionary measures which his contract had imposed upon him, he would not have been obliged to execute works to repair the effects of his negligence or his imprudence and which he now claims as extras. I also am of opinion that this was the reason why the wharf and the trestle-work yielded, and why other changes took place. It was to make it substantial and workmanlike work (as has been said), in accordance with the plane and specifications, that the works mentioned in these items were deemed necessary.\n\"For these reasons I cannot admit the suppliant's contention with respect to these items.\n\"I now come to items 7, 8 and 15, which should be separately considered, because they are of a different category, and are based on different grounds. Item 7 refers to scarfing long timbers (ordered by engineer, but not required by contract.) The contract, it is true, does not specify any particular mode of scarfing or joining the long pieces of timber; but in this case, as in the former, it is a matter of difference of opinion between the engineer and the contractor as to the right mode of executing the work (scarfing long timbers.) In such cases, by virtue of the contract, the engineer is to determine and his opinion is final. For this reason, and for the reasons given at length when considering item 3, I am of opinion that he is not entitled to recover anything under this item.\n\"As to item 8, amounting to $945.00, claimed also as an extra, and which is for having put fenders to the wharf, the suppliant contends that they are not mentioned in the specifications, and that they were not indicated on the plans furnished to him. If the first part of this contention is well founded the second is certainly not so. It is true that the fenders are not mentioned in the specifications, but there can be no possible mistake as to their being marked on the plan. The plan produced by the suppliant at the trial shews the position of these fenders. The original produced by the Crown is exactly the same. The fenders are marked on figure No. 3, and they are shewn in other places by dotted lines. The plan is in exactly the same condition as when the suppliant signed his contract. The size of these fenders and the manner in which they should be attached to the wharf is even shewn on the plan. It is more than sufficient to prove that the suppliant's claim for this item is ill-founded. I deem it again necessary to refer to item 14 which has already been considered. The suppliant claims under this item $2,000 for having employed divers to cut the ends of the ties or logs which hold together the two sides of the wharf. I find a still more complete answer to the suppliant's contention on this point than the one I have before given. It is to be found in the 8th paragraph of the specification, which is as follows: 'The logs are to be notched 2 1\/4 inches on the underside at their intersection, and the ends are to project eight inches beyond the face of the crib.'\n\"Instead of complying with this condition, the suppliant allowed the ends of the ties to project much more than eight (8) inches, and that against engineer McNabb's and superintendent Walsh's directions. It was only when the engineer refused to certify to the payment of the work, that the suppliant executed this work. He has tried to justify his refusal to do the work as part of the contract, by contending that the projection was increased and became dangerous only when (resulting in his opinion on account of a change in the plan) the cribs canted. I have already shown that the cause was quite different. These cribs, according to McNabb's evidence, canted in a body, so that the ends of the ties could not project more afterwards than when they were put into position; the altered position of the cribs cannot have increased or lessened this projection. If the cribs had been built with logs projecting eight inches at first, there would have been nothing to cut off. The suppliant has therefore no one to blame but himself if this work, the cost of which was greatly increased because executed in winter, had to be done. Had he complied with the conditions of the specifications and the directions of the engineer, he would not have incurred this expense. \"The suppliant also complains in his correspondence that he was tyrannically treated by engineer McNabb. It seems to me, on the contrary, that this last gentleman on many occasions shewed a great deal of indulgence towards the contractor. With reference to this last item, he is far from having exacted what he might have under the specifications.\n\"In accordance with the specifications, he could have ordered that the projecting ends be cut as far down as the foundations to their proper dimension\u2014whilst he was satisfied with their being cut to only twenty feet below the low water mark. Neither did he exact that they should project but eight inches as stated in the specifications, but allowed them to project as much as the fenders alongside of the wharf that are twelve inches thick. This work was rendered necessary in order that vessels be not damaged by these projections. No vessel could have otherwise moored alongside of the wharf. McNabb in his evidence uses the following words:\u2014\nNo vessel would have dared to approach the wharf while those projections remained as they were.\nQ. Her sides would have been staved in, in a few minutes? A. Yes.\n\"We now come to the last item of $1,500, which the suppliant claims for damages suffered by reason of the insufficiency of the monthly progress estimates and irregularity of payments. The insufficiency of the estimates has not been proved. The work omitted in the engineer's estimates was the work claimed by the suppliant as extra, and which the engineer determined to reject, as being either work within the terms of the contract, or work rendered necessary by the contractor's negligence.\n\"It is true payments were not made in every month, but there is no proof of any negligence or delay in granting the certificates on which the payments were made. Engineer McNabb in his evidence satisfactorily explains these delays. The first payment of $15,000 was made on the engineer's certificate given by a telegram dated the 13th of April, 1873, before the contractor had brought materials on the ground or had commenced work. This amount was advanced in order to allow the contractor to procure the means to start his works. No money afterwards was paid until September, 1873, as the works were only then sufficiently advanced to warrant the engineer to give another certificate for eight thousand seven hundred and ninety-six dollars. Certificates were granted in October, November and December of the same year, also in January, February, March, April, May, June, July, September and October, 1874. The certificate for August was refused because the engineer was not satisfied of the progress made in the \"bracing\" which he had ordered as forming part of the work included in the contract, and which the suppliant refused to go on with because he wanted to be paid for it as an extra. Here the engineer only exercised such powers as were given him by the contract, and it was for the suppliant to comply with the directions received, and thus not prolong the delay.\n\"The last but one of the certificates was for the $4,185.55 granted in October, 1874. From that date until the 17th of March, 1875, no certificate was granted, because the suppliant neglected to perform works ordered by the engineer in his letter of the 10th of November, 1874. He was endeavoring to have them declared extra before executing them.\n\"It was only on the 17th of March, 1875, when the wharf was sufficiently completed to be accepted, that the engineer granted his final certificate, for the amount which was paid to the suppliant, as appears by his receipt dated the 30th April, following. The engineer positively declares that this certificate was granted by him in his professional capacity, without favor and in good faith. The suppliant has not adduced any evidence to contradict this statement, and I have failed to discover anything in his conduct which can lead me to believe that he acted otherwise than in good faith.\n\"For these reasons I am satisfied that the suppliant's claim under this item is as ill-founded as under the preceding items.\n\"By reviewing these different items I have shown, I think, that none of them can properly be classed as extra; but that on the contrary they are for work which either formed part of the contract or were rendered necessary (through the contractor's fault) to complete the works in accordance with the agreement. I am, therefore, of opinion that the receipt of the 30th April, 1875, produced with the plea of payment in full, covers not only the items admitted by the defence but also those claimed under this petition of right. The suppliant cannot, after being paid the amount and after giving a receipt in full of all demands, now endeavor to avoid the consequences of this receipt by alleging that it was given under protest. It is true that on the same day, immediately after he received the sum of $9,681, he wrote to the Minister of Public Works to inform him that when he signed this receipt he had no intention of abandoning his claim for extras, and of which, till that moment, he had not spoken. Why did he not then press his claim and refuse to sign the final receipt they demanded? Can he now repudiate his own act, or does he give a good reason? No, certainly not. I consider the plea of payment is legally proved and is a complete bar to all the items claimed by the petition, and covers the prices agreed upon by the contracts as well as the extra work ordered in writing by the engineer.\n\"The Crown has moreover invoked another plea, which is to be found in the eleventh paragraph of the defence, and is as follows: That by the 9th clause of the contract the determination of the Minister of Public Works on all differences which might arise during the execution of the works, was final and conclusive.\nThe clause in the contract reads thus:\nNinthly. Should any difference of opinion arise as to the construction to be put upon any part of the specification or plans, the same shall be determined by the Minister alone, and such determination shall be final and conclusive, and binding upon the parties to this contract and every of them.\n\"As it has not been proved that such a determination was ever made by the Minister of Public Works, the Crown could not take advantage of this clause. It appears by the evidence that the report on which the final settlement of the 30th April, 1875, was based, was made by Mr. Schreiber, the engineer in chief, but as there is no power given to the minister to appoint a substitute to fulfil this duty, I cannot give to this report the same effect as I would to the determination of the minister himself as mentioned in the ninth clause. The learned counsel for the Crown contended on this point, that it was an error in the contract, and that the word engineer should be read instead of the word minister. Nothing in my opinion warrants such an interpretation or modification of the contract. A party cannot for any reason whatever, without the consent of the other party, modify his obligation. However, from what I have already said, it is evident that this point is of no importance to the decision of this case.\n\"The conclusion at which I have arrived is founded on the reasons which I have before given at length, and which can be summed up in the following words: 1st. The want of a written authorization in accordance with the terms of the contract to perform the extra work; 2nd. The fact that part of the works for which extra payment is claimed, are works within the terms of the contract; 3rd. That part of the works alleged to be extra were rendered necessary on account of the suppliant's negligence and unskilfulness; 4th. That the payment and final settlement which took place on the 30th April, 1875, comprised all the items of the claims.\n\"For these reasons I must dismiss the petition with costs.\"\nOn the 16th April, 1878, the suppliant took out the following rule nisi:\nIt is ordered that the defendant, upon notice of this rule to be given to Her Majesty's Attorney General for Canada, and to Messrs. Walker, McIntyre, & Ferguson, the agents of the Attorney General, shall at the expiration of eight days from the date of this order, or so soon after as the case can be heard, show cause why the verdict or judgment rendered for the defendant in this cause should not be set aside, and, instead thereof, a verdict or judgment entered for the suppliant for such sum or sums as the Court shall see fit, or why a new trial should not be directed in this cause on the following grounds:\n1. On the grounds disclosed in the affidavit of the suppliant filed.\n2. For the erroneous admission as evidence for the defence of certain reports and written papers signed by one William Marshall, the same not having been duly verified nor the statements therein proved by evidence.\n3. For the erroneous finding of the learned Judge that there had been a final settlement between the parties before action brought.\n4. For the erroneous omission of the learned Judge to find that the damage to works was caused by the dumping of stone and earth against the cribs as also by change of the plans and weight of superstructure added to the work, as also by the omission to provide for any solid foundation for the cribs and for dredging the bottom, and also by the general weakening of the binding of the works (as provided by the contract) necessitated by the superstructure and change of plan.\n5. For the erroneous finding of the learned Judge that certain extra works charged for had been done without the written authority of the engineer, whereas such written authority was proved and is in evidence.\n6. For the erroneous finding of the learned Judge that it was the suppliant's duty under the contract to do more than he was proved to have done before sinking the cribs in regard to securing a more firm foundation.\n7. For that the claims for scarfing and for piles and fenders and the sum paid for divers, for ballasting and other extras enumerated in his Lordship's judgment were not allowed, although the same were ordered and adopted by the engineer and accepted by the Government, and the same are not mentioned or estimated for in the contract.\n8. For that certain of the charges are in connection with the trestle work and are necessary to that work and extras to the verbal contract, and should have been allowed the special conditions of the written contract not applying thereto.\n9. For the discovery of new and important evidence as set forth in the affidavit so filed as aforesaid.\n10. That the verdict was against law and evidence and against the weight of evidence.\n11. For not finding for the suppliant some damages or compensation for the delays in the payments as required by the contract. And in the meantime it is ordered that all proceedings be stayed.\nOn the 29th April, 1878, this rule nisi was discharged and the suppliant thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMr. Cockburn, Q. C., for appellant:\nThis petition of right was brought to recover extras and additions under a contract under seal, with the Minister of Public Works, to construct a deep sea wharf at Richmond Station, at Halifax, N. S., and claimed compensation for serious changes in, and damages to, the works already constructed, entailing expense, and for delays in the monthly payments made to the suppliant.\nThe new works required by the Grovernment, consisting in a coal floor and a trestle work and railway upon the floor, materially weakened the wharf, as so far constructed under the contract, and suppliant contends that the damage caused to the whole works was by weight of this superstructure, by the settling and canting of the cribs.\nThe contract for the wharf is dated 4th Dec., 1872. The 7th section, which provides for alterations during the progress of the work, is the one on which the case will turn. We contend the estimates of the engineer is not a condition precedent, but the only condition precedent is that authority in writing to do the work must be given in advance. But we do not admit that we claim for extra work, with the exception perhaps of a small part of our claim, as to which there may be a doubt, and it can only be as to this part that this condition precedent can apply.\nIn the first place the suppliant contends, that he was not required by his contract to prepare a solid foundation to receive the cribs, (a contention put forward on part of defendant at the trial). On the contrary, the provision as to stepping the bottoms of the cribs after soundings was all that suppliant was required to do, and all this was faithfully done under the daily inspection of the engineer or his officers in charge, without objection, and no such objection was ever urged till after this action was brought.\nNow, it was some months after work was in progress that the engineer in charge entered into a verbal contract with the suppliant to put up the coal floor and railway on the wharf. This, we maintain, was a distinct work. There is nothing in the contract to show the wharf was to be used for shipping coal. The foundation of wharf had been constructed by suppliant for a wharf, and not for any superstructure of 200 tons. There was no guarantee of any kind. Under the contract, the cribs were to be bound together at the top, but when the superstructure was required, this building had to be cut through, so that, not only by the weight of superstructure, but also by the loosening of the bonds, the cribs canted.\nThe contract relates to the wharf. The coal floor was done under the personal inspection of the engineer, as to the sufficiency of the work. It was an independent work not contemplated at first. There were certain extras flowing out of this new work for which we claim, and also certain extras entailed on former work by this new work.\nThe answer admits the work was all completed and the government entered into possession, and have had possession ever since.\nThe provision in the contract, that the minister shall \"determine, &c.,\" applies only to the work under the contract, and, in any event, the evidence shews the minister was applied to, but failed to comply; and there are cases to show that where what is to be done is in the power of one of the parties, and everything has been done by the other to have that done, this is equivalent to performance of the condition[1].\nAnother defence is, there was a receipt in full. This is only in full of items mentioned in it, and does not apply to the extras, the subject-matter of this action. The evidence shews suppliant received the money with a qualification, Read v. Lancashire[2].\nThe contractor was ordered to desist until the cribs should find a solid foundation, showing that no other foundation was contemplated. The steps cannot be used where there is a rock foundation.\n[The learned counsel then referred to the evidence to show that the new work had weakened the original structure, and had it not been for this new work the cribs would not have canted.]\nThis claim for compensation does not come within 31 Vic., ch. 12.\nThe question comes back to this\u2014whose duty was it to prepare the foundation for these cribs?\nMr. Maclennan, Q.C., for respondent:\nThe contract in question was made under the Public Works Act, 31 Vic., c. 12, and every provision in that Act applies to it.\nThe tendency has been towards the curtailment of the powers of Ministers by the Legislature. This has been shown in all departments, (see especially 31 Vic., c. 5,) as regards the contingencies, and the various statutes provide as to how the Crown shall be bound for articles furnished.\nSec. 7 of the Act therefore disposes of all claims outside the contract, for there was no authority to bind the Crown in any other way than provided for by the statute.\nMoreover, the evidence does not show any claim upon the favour of the Crown\u2014the case is one without merit. The learned judge, who tried the case, has so found. In the court below my learned friend did not contend he had any claim outside the contract. It is put on a quantum meruit for the first time in appellant's factum.\nUnder the terms of the contract the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.\nThe evidence shows the wharf was to be constructed to bear the heavy traffic of the ocean steamships.\nTo entitle the appellant to be paid for work outside of the contract, the written authority of the engineer was required therefor previous to its execution. No such authority was given for the works claimed as extras, except what has been paid for.\nThe engineer told him certain things would have to be done in connection with the work before a final estimate would be given. The contractor does these things without claiming extra pay. The coal floors, trestle work and railway, were not separate work and could only be done under the contract. When the changes were made, the contractor was informed of them, and he was paid for them under the terms of the contract. It was the Minister who was to determine what alterations were to be made. The appellant has been paid for everything he had the written authority of the engineer to do. There is no evidence that any particular question was submitted to him for his decision under this clause.\nThen as to the adaption of the cribs to the bottom. The contract shows what the duty of the contractor was as to the soundings. The suppliant was told he should do this extra work as part of his contract, and to make his contract good, and he agreed to do it. Sec. 28 of contract says the work throughout must be executed to the satisfaction of the engineer, who had full power and authority to reject work and materials not in accordance with the specifications, as expressed or understood. The cribs tilted from causes apart from the coal floor, and the engineer required certain things to be done which were proper and reasonable. The engineer acted in a manner favorable to the contractor as may be seen by referring to the correspondence.\nThe item of $2,000 for \"cutting off, &c.,\" was for work he was bound to do in accordance with the specifications.\nThe structure had made no great progress when the coal floor was agreed upon. It was an alteration coming within the contract. The original structure was altered. This he was bound to give up in a business workmanlike manner. He contracted to do it for $ 18,000. He paid to sub-contractors $6,000 for doing it. The original contract was for a work which might be varied.\nThe wharf was intended to bear thousands of tons, and yet the trestle work disturbed his cribs. Keating was obliged to admit that the superstructure could not be the cause of the tilting of the cribs, if the cribs had been put down in a proper manner in the first place.\nWhen the engineer required the protective works, he required only what was his duty to require, and his determination is binding upon the suppliant.\nThe two first items in the settlement have been abandoned. The learned Counsel then referred to:\nFerguson v. Corp. Galt[3]; Diamond v. McAnnany[4]; Ekins v. Corp. Cy. of Bruce[5]; Elliott v. Roy. Ex. Ins. Co.[6]; Stodhart v. Lee[7]; Sharp v. San Paolo Ry.[8]; Scott v. Liverpool[9]; Clarke v. Watson[10]; Ranger v. Great Western Ry. Co.[11]; Roberts v. Bury[12].\nAs to the receipt: Mr. O'Brien does not say it was given under any mistake. The documents annexed to the receipt show how careful the Public Works Department were in such matters. The receipt not having been signed under any mistake or misapprehension, and with a full knowledge, (for all the substantial items of his claim had been agitated before,) it should be binding on him.\nMr. Cockburn in reply:\nThe clause in the Public Works Act does not apply to executed contracts.\nOur claim does not come within the contract and sec. 20 shows that it is not an invariable rule that the contractor should be bound by a written contract.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nThis was an appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Fournier, dismissing the suppliant's petition with costs.\n[After referring to the pleadings, His Lordship continued as follows:] I have no hesitation, at the outset, in saying that the suppliant's contention that this contract and the work done under it, and his claim for compensation, is not to be subject to the provisions of the Act 31 Vic., ch. 12, \"An Act respecting the Public Works of Canada,\" cannot be sustained. The contract was undoubtedly made by virtue of the authority of that Act, and was duly executed under seal, in accordance with, and must be governed by, its provisions. By the seventh section of this Act it is provided that\nNo deeds, contracts, documents or writings, shall be deemed to be binding upon the department, or shall be held to be the acts of the said minister, unless signed and sealed by him or his deputy, and countersigned by the secretary.\nAnd by section 21, which provides that security shall be taken where any public works are being carried out by contract, and makes provision when the lowest tender is not taken, it is enacted:\nBut no sum of money shall be paid to the contractor on any contract, nor shall any work be commenced until the contract has been signed by all the parties therein named, nor until the requisite security shall have been given.\nThe substance, then, of suppliant's complaint is, that independent of the original structure agreed for at $78,000, and the coal floor at $18,400, and the sum of $2,700 for additional bracing estimated by the engineer, all which sums were duly paid to the suppliant, the engineer required the suppliant to perform a vast amount of extra works, involving additional labor and expenditure of materials not provided for in any former contracts or estimates, for which the suppliant claimed extra payment, but which the engineer refused to allow, and obliged suppliant to do the work which, he alleges, he did under protest, always claiming that such work should be paid for as extra.\nThe suppliant also complains that such outlay and expenditure of labor and material was rendered absolutely necessary from want of proper foresight in making the original plans, and for not providing for the additional strain or pressure on the work, occasioned by the alterations and additions.\nHe likewise complains of damage and loss from inequality of payments, falling short of what he was entitled to and that he sustained heavy loss and damage from irregularity of payments. The answer denies that, with the exception of the sums so paid, and the $400 paid for the costs of repairs to a crib, to which it is alleged the suppliant had no just claim, any other work was performed by the suppliant, for which he was, or is, entitled to be paid over and above the contract price.\nThe rights of the suppliant must be determined by the contract and the statute, and by these alone. It is not necessary to enquire into or express any opinion as to the legal binding effect on the Crown of the verbal contract for the coal structure, assuming that work to be outside of and dehors the original contract, because it was submitted to the Minister of Public Works, assented to by him, and the amount agreed on by him has been paid; but it cannot, I think, be too unequivocally put forward, that neither the engineer, nor the clerk of the works, nor any subordinate officer in charge of any of the public works of the Dominion, have any power or authority, express or implied, under the law to bind the Crown to any contract or expenditure not specifically authorized by the express terms of the contract duly entered into between the Crown and the contractor according to law, and then only in the specific manner provided for by the express terms of the contract.\nIn examining the contract we find that the contractor undertook for a lump sum to construct, complete and finish, in every respect to the satisfaction of the minister, all the work required for the construction of a deep water wharf agreeably to the plans in the engineer's office and specifications, and with such directions as would be given by the engineer in charge during the progress of the work; and while the specification and plan exhibited are to be taken to give a general idea of the work required, omissions in them are not to be considered as invalidating the contract, but the contracting parties must, as the specification says, embrace everything in their tender, whether mentioned or not, as they will be required to complete the work, according to the true intent and meaning of the specification and plan, for the contract sum; and, as if to prevent the possibility of any doubt arising as to the whole work and everything connected with it necessary for its full and final completion being done and provided by the contractor, it is expressly declared:\nThe bulk sum' in the tender must include the entire cost of furnishing all labor, materials, tools and machinery, and every contingency connected with the work, and the contractor is to assume all risks, and make good, at his own cost, any damage which may result from loss of materials, or otherwise, by storms, or from any other cause whatever during the progress of the work, and up to its full and satisfactory completion.\nAnd while provision is made for any change or alteration of any part of the work which shall be required by the minister, and whether it should entail extra expense, or should be a saving to the contractor, the amount was to be determined by the estimate made by the minister, his engineer, or officer in charge, and while providing that every such change or alteration shall be made subject to the conditions, stipulations and covenants in the agreement expressed, as if such change or alteration had been expressed or specified in the terms of the contract, it is provided that if the contractor is required to do any work, or furnish any materials, for which there is not any price specified in the contract, the same shall be paid for at the estimated prices of the engineer in charge of the works. But it also expressly provided that\nNo change or alteration whatever, and no extra work whatever, shall be done without the written authority of the engineer in charge, given prior to the execution of such work, nor will any allowance or payment whatever be made for the same, in case it should be done without such authority.\nAnd in case of a difference of opinion as to the construction to be put upon any part of the specifications or plans, the same shall be determined by the minister alone, and his determination shall be final and conclusive and binding on all parties to the contract.\nNow, to enable the contractor to fulfil his contract and construct such a wharf as he undertook to build, it was absolutely necessary that a good, solid and sufficient foundation should be obtained. This the contractor, I think, clearly undertook to secure. He undertook to complete the whole work with every thing that was requisite for the purpose of completion from the beginning to the end for a lump sum.\nThere is not a word in the contract from which any covenant, agreement or undertaking, express or implied, can be inferred, indicating that the Crown in any way guaranteed the foundation or assumed any responsibility therefor. On the contrary, secs. 4, 26, 29 and 30, of the specifications most clearly shew that the entire risk and responsibility was thrown upon the contractor, who could not possibly do what he undertook to do with a defective foundation.\n[The learned Chief Justice then read these sections[13].]\nA great portion of the labor expended and materials furnished for which the suppliant claims compensation, with reference to both the wharf and coal floor, was unquestionably caused by the defective foundation, and this arose from the want of a thorough and proper examination of the bottom, which does not appear to have been made by the contractor till he found his work in danger, when he says he got divers to explore the bottom to find if any obstructions lay in the sites of the cribs, when they found several large boulders at the bottom.\nAnd as he was, in my opinion, responsible for the foundation, and could not complete the wharf and coal floor as he agreed to do, by reason of his not having placed the original wharf on a proper foundation, the risk and burthen of securing which, I think, he assumed under his contract, he has no claim whatever, in my opinion, on the Crown for any such expenses or outlays occasioned by his own failure to perform his own undertaking. But I have gone through the items of his claim, and I cannot discover from his own showing, that under the terms of his contract he has established a claim to any one of the items.\nThe suppliant admits the receipt of the contract price, and also the $18,400 for the coal floor and additional trestle work, and $2,781 for extra work, which \"was agreed on\" (he says) \"between engineer and himself, and accepted and paid for,\" and $400 for rebuilding two cribs which were injured by another contractor, which, he says, was paid for as an extra. The amounts he now claims to recover are as follows: [His Lordship read the statement of claim[14]]\nI have numbered them in the order put forward in the suppliant's statement of claim; they are 15 in all. As to Nos. 1 and 2, which refer to removing the boulder stones and fixing ballast to sustain the cribs, they are, in my opinion, most clearly matters the contractor was bound to do under his contract; in addition to which he says:\nThey were not ordered. I did it because the work was in jeopardy. They were done without any instructions or order, but simply because the damage to the cribs was imminent, and I had to protect them at this cost.\nThis, no doubt, arose from not securing a proper foundation, by reason of which the cribs were likely to shift their ground. His cross-examination clearly shows that he made no proper exploration of the bottom, as he was bound to do, but relied, he says, on the engineer's and his own soundings, which conveyed no adequate idea of the bottom, or what was necessary to be done to secure a solid and proper foundation. He says, on cross-examination, in the winter of 1873-'74 he began to find the cribs sliding away.\nQ. And it was in consequence of this sliding away that you made this work to protect it? A. When I found my first cribs likely to change their position, and having great trouble to take them up and remake parts of them, when I got them into position again, I thought that what led to that trouble might lead to further trouble with the other cribs. I got divers to explore the bottom, and to find if any obstructions lay in the sites of the cribs. They found there were several large boulders at the bottom which they leaded and attached a piece of cork to a line so as to indicate their presence.\nQ. What I asked you was this: it was when you found the cribs subsiding or giving way, you did this work to protect the cribs for which you claim payment? A. Not at all. It is a distinct thing altogether.\nQ. I am asking you about the two first items? A. It was when I ound that these cribs were likely to shift their ground, and were shifting their ground, I protected them.\nQ. What month was that in? A. Possibly it was March or April. About April, as near as I can guess, the first year.\nQ. Then I understand you had to take some of the work up? A. Yes, I had.\nQ. What was that owing to? A. Owing to the subsidence this same way, and the work breaking asunder in consequence of the cribs slipping away.\nQ. After you put them down? A. Yes.\nQ. Were these the first you put down? A. Yes.\nQ. Were they sinking in the mud? A. Not so much that as slipping out into deeper water.\nQ. So you took them up, and what did you do? A.I did not take them up altogether, one went away and I had to tear it to pieces and put it together again.\nQ. What was the cause of that? A. The unevenness of the bottom and the want of a level surface for those narrow cribs to rest upon.\nQ. That was just one of the difficulties of the situation? A. The surface below was exceedingly irregular. It was a very difficult place to build crib-work on.\nQ. You had considerable difficulty and one crib you had to tear to pieces and re-build in consequence of its not standing after its being put down? A. Yes.\nQ. Was it to prevent a recurrence of that you performed this work? A. It was that led me to explore the whole ground, to see if there were any difficulties in the way that we did not see before and remove them. The soundings did not give them before.\nQ. This expenditure was incurred in removing those difficulties and protecting the cribs from the injuries you feared? A. Yes.\nQ. To make the work safer, in point of fact? A. Yes, to provide that the future work, I would put down, would be safer.\nQ. That was done without any orders from the engineer or any body else? A. I had none.\nHe says he had no written order, nor any communication with the engineer on the subject. And if any inference is to be drawn from his conduct, it is very strongly to the effect that he did not suppose he had any past claim to them; for on his cross-examination in answer to the question: \"Did you submit the first two items of your account to the engineer?\" he says: \"I did not.\" \"Q. You never made any claim for those items until you fyled your petition? A. No.\" And this was years after the work was done and the receipt to be spoken of hereafter given.\nItem No. 3.\u2014Suppliant says: \"Those timbers were not specified in the contract to be those lengths. The engineer insisted I should put in those lengths. I demurred to it. We had a correspondence. He finally ordered it and I did so.\" He says the engineer refused to allow the contractor to put in shorter pieces. The engineer required it to be done according to his construction of the specification; he says he demurred and claimed it was an extra. I think it was clearly within the contract, but if an extra no estimated price or written order is shewn, without which the contractor is expressly prevented from claiming or recovering.\nItem 4\u2014For extra payment to Graham Bros. This item grew out of what the suppliant calls the second subordinate or verbal contract. He appears to have proceeded with the work without waiting for a plan which was promised him. He says the engineer, after some work was done, changed the plan. So far from this being a change or alteration under the contract for which the suppliant has a claim against the Crown, not only was there no estimate of the cost, or written authority, but the suppliant says: \"I telegraphed to Mr. McNabb about this $300, and requested him to pay it to me, but he said he had no authority to pay it.\" McNabb's answer, which he received, says: \"I have no authority to increase contract price.\" He says: \"It was deemed necessary, and I had to bow.\" Clearly this is not a claim enforceable against the crown.\nAs to items 5 and 6, the necessity for this expenditure grew out of the yielding of his own work by reason of the defective foundations, and therefore, for the reasons before assigned, not chargeable against the government; but in addition to this the suppliant could not recover if the work had been extra, because he has shewn no estimated price or written authority. He says in answer to the question: \"Had you any orders as to this too? A. I had none but verbally, that I know of.\" And here again, like the first two items, the inference from his answers on cross-examination are certainly not favorable to his own belief in his present contention, for he says in answer to the question\u2014\nYou made a claim for that as for extra work? A. Yes, the engineer ordered the work and I did it. I conceived at the time that every order he made I was to be paid for. He ordered the work, and I did it. Q. Did you claim for it as extra at that time? A. Not at that particular time. Q. When did you? A. When I put in my bill of costs. Q. Did you submit these two items to the engineer? A. I think not.\nAs to No. 7, it appears by the suppliant's statement he was putting in the timbers in a manner objected to by the engineer, and as to which the suppliant says:\nMy own way was not strictly in accordance with the plan but it was far better.\nAnd again:\nQ. Then you were not following the plan? A. No. I was putting them in a way I believed to be better.\nHe failed to convince the engineer of this, he says his work was not approved of\u2014\nAnd I was ordered to put in a sort of notch called a scarf in the timbers. It was not in the specification or in the plan. I protested against it, but it was insisted on. It was extra work.\nHe says he put it before the engineer as an extra work which should be paid for. \"Q. What did he say? A. He insisted it should be done as part of the contract.\"\nAs to item No. 8, 135 fenders not in the specifications, suppliant says: \"they are upright timbers that fend off vessels,\" \"such things are attached to wharves more or less, but they are not in my specification or plan.\" And in answer to the question:\nAnd they are not mentioned in the specifications anywhere? A. No, not in this specification anywhere, but the clerk of the works showed me a specification in his hands where they were mentioned, and I felt if they were in any specification they should be put in.\nOn his cross-examination he gives this account of the transaction:\nQ. What distinction do you make between items 8 and 9? A. The first item, \"135 fenders at $7,\" were properly to fend off vessels. They were put all around the whole structure. These extra fenders were added with a view of putting a false face upon some of the cribs that went backward out of line, and to bring them back to a true line. Timbers were put down in front and braced back, and a floor run out to make a smooth surface. Q. It was to remedy the defect in the way in which the cribs rested on the bottom? A. No; you beg the question there. It was not to remedy the defect on the bottom, it was to remedy the defect that accrued from the alteration of the plan.\nQ. These cribs did not lie evenly on the bottom? A. They did lie smoothly, but they did not lie on the same bottom. They press on the ground the same as before, but they will tilt\u2014the front will not be perpendicular as it was before.\nQ. At all events it was to protect vessels from the effects of the subsidence of the cribs, the fenders were put in? A. No; it was not. It was to bring the frontage out, so as to make one uniform line.\nQ. Why was it not a uniform line? A. Because the cribs had moved a year after they were built.\nQ. So the outer wall of the crib was uneven and dangerous to vessels\u2014was that it? A. That was not the intention of the work. The work was merely to please the eye.\nQ. So it was not dangerous to vessels then? A. It was dangerous\u2014just as dangerous after it was clone. They were put on to please the eye merely.\nQ. Whose eye was it intended to please? A. Everybody's eye.\nQ. That was your intention in putting them there? A. It was, and it was the intention with every one.\nQ. How did you gather that? A. I gathered it from conversation. I explained to Mr. McNabb before that, I intended to do it.\nQ. So you put that particular item in of your own motion? A. Yes; so as to give a good appearance to the work.\nQ. Without any request or order for it? A. It was done without any order, but there was a verbal instruction.\nQ. On what ground did you expect pay for it? A. For improving the wharf and rendering it more uniform; I did not do it to please myself.\nI am at a loss to conceive what legal claim under this evidence can be set up against the Crown.\nNo. 9. He says he has no writing for this item. I think there is no doubt that the contractor was bound to put them in, in consequence of his own defective work, but as he admits there was no estimate or written authority, it is clear he has no claim.\nAs to No. 10, \"22 piles,\" there appears to be no writing authorizing these. They became necessary in consequence of defendant's bad work and bad foundation; they became necessary in order to make his work satisfactory, and from McNabb's evidence it was an indulgence to him, instead of requiring him to build a new crib, and the suppliant admits that he went on with the work and did the work in the face of the distinct declaration that he was not to be paid for it.\nThe items 11, 12, 13, 14, the suppliant was, in my opinion, clearly bound to do to fulfil his contract, and were not extra, but he claims them as such, and that he had a written order to do them as such; but a reference to the letter from the engineer to him, which he claims contains the authority to do the work as extra work, shows the exact opposite. So far from treating or ordering the works as extra they were expressly required to be done by the contractor as part of his contract in these words:\nIt is necessary that the following works (reported on by the clerk of works) should be performed by you under your contract for the construction of Richmond wharf, and I beg to request that you will lose no time in their execution.\nAnd on the 19th Nov., the engineer writes to O'Brien:\nMy letter to you on the 10th instant did not specify any payments for items 1 to 4 inclusive, for the reason it forms part of your contract for the construction of the wharf.\nAs to the item for damage and loss sustained by deficiency in and irregularity of payments, and expense incurred in procuring money elsewhere, the only merit that this claim has, is that of novelty. It has not, in my opinion, the slightest legal foundation, to rest on.\nIf suppliant's contention could prevail, that the Crown could be bound by verbal communications between himself and the engineer or officers superintending the construction of public works, or that he could, when called upon to do work as work which the engineer, to whose satisfaction under the contract the work was to be done, claimed he was bound to do under his contract and which he would not be allowed for as extra, do the work and afterwards found thereon a legal claim against the Crown for the work so done, would be simply to permit him to repudiate the express provisions of his contract, ignore the authority of the Minister of Public Works and set at defiance all the statutory provisions enacted for the protection of the Crown and the public interest, and would allow, nay encourage, contractors to impose liabilities on the Crown without any authority or sanction recognized by law as competent to bind the Crown.\nFrom the suppliant's own account of these transactions, considered in connection with the statute and the contract, it is, to my mind, abundantly clear that he has established no case to justify this Court in reversing my brother Fournier's decision. But it is still clearer when the suppliant's evidence is considered in connection with that on the part of the Crown, all which has been so fully and so satisfactorily referred to in the able judgment of my brother Fournier, that it is unnecessary for me to go over it again. In addition to all which, after the work was completed, a final estimate, dated 17th March, 1875, was made out and signed by the engineer, \"for work done and materials delivered up to 9th March, 1875, at Richmond deep water wharf,\" specifying the particulars on \"contract work\" and on \"extra work,\" with a certificate signed by the engineer, that the above estimate is correct; that the total value of the work performed and materials furnished by Mr. Wm. D. O'Brien up to the 9th March, 1875, is $99,581, and the net amount due $99,581 less previous payments. This estimate is the final estimate of the engineer after the work was performed, and without which, nor till ten days after, the contractor could not claim the final balance as provided for by the contract, and beneath which is the following receipt, dated 30th April, 1875, signed by the suppliant:\nReceived from the Intercolonial Railway, in full of all demands against the Government for works under contract, as follows: Richmond deep water wharf works for storage of coal, works for bracing wharf, rebuilding two shore cribs, the sum of $9,681.\nI think this receipt was intended to cover, and does cover, as expressed in the engineer's certificate, the total value of work performed and materials furnished by Mr. Wm. D. O'Brien up to 9th March, 1875, notwithstanding any secret or open intention of Mr. O'Brien to put forward, after receiving this amount, further claims for more extra work than was included in the estimates and certificate.\nUnder all these circumstances, I have no hesitation in adopting and affirming the conclusions of my brother Fournier, which he sums up as follows:\n1st. The want of a written authorization in accordance with the terms of the contract to perform the extra work; 2nd. The fact that part of the works, for which extra payment is claimed, are works within the terms of the contract; 3rd. that part of the works, alleged to be extra, were rendered necessary on account of the suppliant's negligence and unskilfulness; 4th. That the payment and final settlement, which took place on the 30th April, 1875, comprised all the items of the claims.\nIt is quite unnecessary to cite any authorities, as the principles of law which govern contracts of this description have been so often and so clearly laid down, and are now so well understood and established. I will merely mention two or three cases in which the observations of several of the learned judges seem peculiarly applicable.\nIn Westwood v. The Secretary of State for India in Council[15]:\nA contract contained a clause that the engineer for the time being should have power to make such additions to or deductions from the work as he might think proper, and to make such alterations and deviations as he might judge expedient during the progress of the work;\n* * * * *\nand that the value of all such additions, deductions, alterations and deviations should be ascertained and added to or deducted from the amount of the contract price;\n* * * * * *\nand further that if any doubt, dispute or difference should arise concerning the work, or relating to the quantity or quality of the materials employed, or as to any additions, alterations, deductions, or deviations made to, in or from the said work, the same should from time to time be referred to and decided by the engineer, whose decision should be final and binding on both parties.\n* * * * * *\nIn an action to recover the amount of certain extra works:\nHeld: that the ascertainment of the value of the extra works was a condition precedent to the right of the plaintiffs to maintain their action.\nWightman, J.:\u2014\nThe great question in this case is, whether or no the 11th clause of this contract amounts to a condition precedent. The present case may be limited to the extra works, and the question is, whether there was a condition precedent, that the value of the additions should be ascertained before the plaintiff's are entitled to maintain their * * * * * * Then it is said, that the uncertainty of having the value ascertained renders the provision inoperative. As a preliminary, it seems to me, that the value must be ascertained by agreement between the parties themselves; but supposing they do not agree, there is a provision in the contract that it is to be referred to the decision of the consulting engineer. I think, therefore, that on this point the defendant is entitled to judgment.\nIn Sharpe v. San Paulo Railway Co.[16], the head note is as follows:\nIn this case the engineer of a railway company prepared a specification of the works on a proposed railway, and certain contractors fixed prices to the several items in the specifications, and offered to construct the railway for the sum total of the prices affixed to the items. A contract, under seal, was thereupon made between the contractors and the company, by which the contractors agreed to construct and deliver the railway completed by a certain day at a sum equal to the sum total above mentioned. * * * The contract contained provisions making the certificate of the engineer conclusive between the parties; and it was provided that all accounts relating to the contract should be submitted to and settled by the engineer, and that his certificate for the ultimate balance should be final and conclusive. * * *\nThe railway was completed, and the engineer gave his final certificate as to the balance due the contractors. * * *\nThe contractors filed a bill against the company, making claims on several grounds and praying an account and payment.\nHeld: That the contractors could not, on mere verbal promises by the engineer, maintain against the company a claim, to be paid sums beyond the sums specified in the contract under seal.\nHeld: That although the amount of the works to be executed might have been under-stated in the engineer's specification, the contractors could not, under the circumstances, maintain any claim against the company on that ground.\nHeld: That in the absence of fraud on the part of the engineer, and where his certificate has been made a condition precedent to payment, his certificate must be conclusive between the parties.\nIn the Exchequer Chamber, the Master of the Rolls allowed the demurrer, and Lord Romilly, M. R., said[17]:\nIt is quite clear that the engineer had no power to vary the contract; he had power to give directions to do certain things upon the line within the limits of the contract, and, if the contractors thought that these things were not within the contract, they were not bound to do them. The bill alleged that the contractors had executed certain other works on the faith of the promises and agreements of Mr. Brunlees; that the contractors should be paid for those works by the company; but these were merely the inferences and opinions of the contractors on which the Court could not act, and the company certainly never led the contractors to take any such view. * * *\nThen, as to the extra works, the mere allegation that the contractors did these things upon certain vague statements of the engineer (Brunlees), and the allegation of their own feelings and opinions, and the reasons why they did these things, would not ground an equity by which they would be entitled to come for relief to this court. His Lordship was of opinion that they were bound by the contract, and that the contract was precise and distinct upon this subject, and that unless the plaintiff could show that the company had by some means or other in writing, not necessarily under seal, clearly and decisively bound themselves, the plaintiffs could not vary the contract, and make a new and substituted contract by reason of any conversations said to have been held with the engineer, which it was obvious, upon the bill itself, he had repudiated, and would not assent to. * * *\nThe plaintiff had no grounds for relief, because Mr. Brunlees had not given the certificates required. In Kimberly v. Dick, he considered the case very fully, and had held that if persons chose to enter into a contract by which they agreed that they should be paid what a certain engineer or a certain builder should certify is the proper amount, and nothing more, they were bound by that, if they could not show any dishonesty or any fraud or sinister motive. They must be bound by their contract, and they ought to have considered that before they entered into it.\nThe Master of the Rolls allowed the demurrer.\nThe plaintiffs appealed, when the decision of the Master of the Rolls was held right, and the appeal refused.\nSir W. M. James, L. J.[18]:\nIn this case the contractors undertook to make the railway, not to do certain works; but they undertook to complete the whole line, with everything that was requisite for the purpose of completion, from the beginning to the end; and they undertook to do it for a lump sum, something short of two millions sterling, which was the amount upon which the Brazilian Government had undertaken to guarantee the interest.\n* * * * * *\nThe first contract was that the line should be completed for a fixed sum. But the plaintiffs say they are, upon several heads, entitled to a great deal more than that sum. The first head is, that the earthworks were insufficiently calculated, that the engineer had made out that the earthworks were two million and odd cubic yards, whereas they turned out to be four million and odd cubic yards. But that is precisely the thing which they took the chance or.\n* * * * * *\nThe plaintiffs say it is quite clear that this was a miscalculation. But that was a thing the contractors ought to have looked at for themselves. If they did not rely on Mr. Brunlees' experience and skill as an engineer, they ought to have looked at the consequences and made out their own calculations.\n* * * * * * The bill says that the original specification was not sufficient to make a complete railway, and that it became obvious that something more would be required to be done in order to make the line. But their business, and what they had contracted to do for a lump sum, was to make the line from terminus to terminus complete, and both these items seem to me to be on the face of them entirely included in the contract. They are not in any sense of the word extra works.\nThen it is alleged that the engineer, finding out that this involved more expense than he had calculated upon, promised that he would make other alterations in the line, making a corresponding diminution so as to save the contractors from loss on account of that mistake. And then in the vaguest possible way it is said that all these promises of the engineer were known to and ratified by the company. I am of opinion you cannot in that way alter a contract under seal to do works for a particular sum of money. The plaintiffs cannot say that the company is to give more because the engineer found he had made a mistake and promised he would give more, and the company, verbally, or in some vague way, ratified that promise. To my mind it was a perfectly nudum pactum. It is a totally distinct thing from a claim to payment for actual extra works not included in the contract.\n* * * * * *\nThe very object of leaving these things to be settled by an engineer is that you are to have the practical knowledge of the engineer applied to it, and that he, as an independent man, a surveyor, a valuer, an engineer, is to say what is the proper sum to be paid under all the circumstances. That was the agreement between the parties. The contractors relied upon Mr. Brunlees, and the Railway Company relied upon Mr. Brunlees. That is the ordinary course between such companies and such contractors, and practically it is found to be the only course that is convenient for all parties, and just to all parties. I myself should be very loath to interfere with any such stipulation upon any ground except default or breach of duty on the part of the engineer.\n* * * * * *\nSir G. Mellish, L. J.:\nI am entirely of the same opinion, and I agree with the reasons given by the Lord Justice.\nIn Thorne v. Mayor of London[19] the marginal note of which is:\nThe defendants being about to erect a bridge, an engineer prepared for them at their request certain plans and specifications, both of the bridge and of the mode in which it would be constructed; the plaintiff on the faith of these plans and specifications, and without any independent inquiry whether the work could be done as specified, entered into a contract with the defendants to do it in accordance with the terms of the plans and specifications. After the plaintiff had incurred great expense, it was found the work could not be executed in the manner specified. The plaintiff sued the defendants on the ground of an implied warranty by them, that the work could be executed in the manner described in the plans and specifications.\nHeld that no such warranty could be implied.\nKelly, C. B., said[20]:\nWe must beware how we hold, that in contemplation of law people have contracted for something which is not to be found within the written contract to which they have put their hands, or that they must have intended something which they have not declared they intended, and which one of the parties in this case certainly did not contemplate, namely, that the work contracted for could be performed in the time and mode contained in the specification. There is no authority for so holding, and, looking to principle, it appears to me that we should be making a contract for the parties and a different one from that into which they have entered, if we implied this warranty. It is said that the engineer was the agent of the corporation, and must be taken to have contracted for and on behalf of the corporation that the specification was sufficient, and that it was reasonably practicable to execute the work in the mode prescribed; but the contract entered into by the plaintiff was absolute and unconditional, that he would execute these particular works for a certain sum and in a certain time.\nAnd Amphlett, B., says[21]:\nThe plaintiff, instead of employing on his own account a competent engineer, made his tender on the footing of the plans and specifications of the engineer of the corporation, who was known to him as an engineer of eminence and reputation. The contractor chose to rely on his well known ability. If there had been any case set up of an attempt to impose on the contractors, this matter would have assumed a different aspect, but nothing of this kind is suggested. The question, which underlies the whole matter, is whether the corporation impliedly contracted that the plans were such as to make the work reasonably practicable. To say that a contractor, who has chosen to rely on the name and reputation of the person employed by the other party, when he finds that he should not have done so, can make the principal liable, is going far beyond any case that has been cited.\nThis case went to the Exchequer Chamber, and the judgment of the Court of Exchequer was affirmed[22]:\nBlackburn, J., says:\nNow, certainly when you have a formal document under seal without a warranty in express terms, we should not be likely to imply a warranty unless there is the clearest reason for it. Mr. Benjamin admits that he is unable to find any analogous cases in which a warranty has been implied under circumstances similar to these; and it seems to me that the burden is on the plaintiff to show that a warranty is fairly implied. I may say that, far from seeing any reasons, legally or morally just, from which we should imply it, it seems to me that the convenience and the right of things are all on the other side. As was well expressed by Mr. Baron Amphlett on the occasion of the consideration of this case by the court below, the contractor might, if he doubted whether the scheme was practicable, have asked the corporation for an express stipulation, or he might have declined to enter into the contract. He has done neither. He has chosen rather to act on Mr. Cubitt's reputation or his own notions as to its being practicable, and has asked for nothing. It seems to me that if we were to introduce a warranty, we should be putting something into the contract, which not only the parties did not put in it, but which they did not intend to put in it, and which if it had been proposed to them, would probably have been refused, or if they had agreed to any at all, it would have been a warranty considerably modifying any provisions as to how the work was to be carried out. Taking that view of it, I agree with what is the substance of the judgment below, that the plaintiff cannot recover on an implied warranty, there being no express warranty in the contract, and consequently the judgment of the court below must be affirmed.\nMellor, J., says:\nThe contractors were at liberty, if they pleased, to employ their own engineer to see whether or not these plans were such as could be executed, and executed within the time limited. Both of the parties were. I think, on equal terms.\nLush, J., says:\nI also concur in the opinion of my learned brothers, that the judgment of the court below ought to be affirmed; and I do so on the short ground that there is nothing in the contract which shows an intention on the part of the corporation to warrant the efficiency of the mode described of keeping out the water and so enabling the contractors to go on with the work of building up the piers of the bridge. It is admitted that there is no express contract of the kind, and there is nothing whatever, in my opinion, to justify the court in implying any such contract; therefore, to impose such an obligation on the corporation would be to introduce a stipulation into the contract which the parties, either from design or inadvertence, it does not matter which, omitted; and we should, by so doing, introduce a new term into the contract, which the court certainly is not competent to do.\nTharsis Sulphur Coy. v. M'Elroy[23]:\nA contract for the construction of large iron buildings for a lump sum contained a clause that no alterations or additions should be made without a written order from the employer's engineer, and no allegation from the contractors or knowledge of, or acquiesence in, such alterations or additions on the part of the employers, their engineers or inspectors should be accepted or available as equivalent to the certificate of the engineer, or as in any way superseding the necessity of such certificate as the sole warrant for such alterations and additions during the execution of the contract; the contractors alleged it was impossible to cast certain iron trough girders of a specified weight, and subsequently they were allowed to erect girders of a much heavier weight, and the actual weights were entered in the engineers certificate issued from time to time authorizing interim payments. On the completion of the work the contractors claimed a considerable amount in excess of the contract price for the extra weight of metal required. Held:\u2014That the engineer's certificates were not written orders, and the claim was therefore excluded by the terms of the contract.\nSTRONG, J., was of opinion that the judgment of the Exchequer Court should be affirmed, and delivered a written judgment to that effect.\nFOURNIER, J., adhered to the judgment delivered by him in the Court below.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThis action was brought by the suppliant by petition to recover payment for extra work alleged to have been done by him, in connection with two contracts entered into by him for the erection, in the first place, of a wharf at Richmond, Nova Scotia, and secondly, for a trellis work thereon for the shipment of coal. He was paid the contract prices for both, and also for some extra work done by him, for which he gave a receipt in full.\nOne defence set up is that the receipt in question is a discharge in full of all claims and demands, and it would be, if the amount stated in it was received and accepted as the full amount then due the suppliant or claimed by him. The receipt is in these words:\nReceived from the Intercolonial Railway, in full of all amounts against the Government for works under contractas follows: Richmond deep water wharf, works for storage of coal, work for bracing wharf, re-building two stone cribs, the sum of nine thousand six hundred and eighty one dollars, this 30th day of April, 1875.\n(Signed,) William D. O'Brien.\nPreceding this receipt on the same sheet is a full statement of the items for which the suppliant was paid, shewing the amount stated in the receipt as the balance then due him for but four items which do not in any way include or refer to any of the items which form his present demand. The receipt or discharge is for other works than those in question in this suit, and, therefore, inapplicable to those latter items, and no release for them, and the issue raised by the sixth plea that the sum of $9,681 \"Was received and accepted by him in full satisfaction and discharge of all demands against Her Majesty in respect of the said works,\" is not proved, and must, therefore, in my opinion, be adjudged in favor of the suppliant.\nThe seventh clause of the contract provides for changes or alterations either in the position or details of the work, but no change or alteration whatever was to be made and no extra work whatever to be done; \"Without the written authority of the engineer in charge given prior to the execution of such work.\" The contractor, according to the terms of that clause, could only recover for such changes or alterations or extra work as had been so ordered in writing. He would not be bound to make any changes or alterations, or do any extra work, unless ordered in writing.\nThe evidence on both sides, written and oral, shows that a large amount of the extra work for which the suppliant claims compensation was ordered in writing by the engineer in charge of the works, but he alleged, at the same time, that such work was a part of the contract, and that the compensation therefor was included in the lump sum therein named. The suppliant, however, at the time disagreed to that contention, but, being bound to perform the work so ordered, under the said seventh clause, he notified the engineer that he would perform the work ordered, but only under the terms of that clause.\nThe ninth clause of the agreement contains a provision that:\nShould any difference of opinion arise as to the construction to be put upon any part of the specifications or plans, the same shall be determined by the Minister alone, and such determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon the parties to this contract, and every of them.\nThere is nothing in the evidence to show that the question in difference in this respect between the engineer and the suppliant was ever submitted by the engineer for the decision of the Minister, or that he (the Minister) ever made any decision, or, in reference to such work, put any construction on the specifications or plans. That such was not done appears not to have been the fault of the suppliant, for he addressed letters to the Chief Engineer of the Intercolonial Railway (Mr. Schreiber), to Mr. Brydges, and also to the Minister, protesting against the ruling of the resident engineer, and asking for an investigation and decision, to which he received but one answer, and that was from Mr. Schreiber, declining to interfere. The work having been ordered in writing, and the Minister failing even to reply to the urgent request of the suppliant to decide the matters in dispute, and the resident engineer having no power to construe judicially the agreement, specifications, or plans, the question is an open one which we are called upon to decide as we best may from the evidence before us, and that, under the circumstances, I think we can legitimately do.\nIt is admitted on all sides that a great part of the extra work was rendered necessary by the sinking, tilting and upsetting of some of the cribs\u2014caused in a great degree by their foundation being soft and unsustaining, and, as alleged by the suppliant, and, to some extent, admitted by the resident engineer, in consequence of a change made by the latter in the construction of the wharf, and the erection of a raised trellis work and coal-floor, in the building, by which, it is alleged, the connections of the cribs was weakened and unable on one side of the trellis-work to bear the extra weight of the added works. In respect, therefore, of the question of a sustaining foundation \u2014the want of which seems to have created the necessity for the extra expenditure\u2014we must see where the fault lies; and, in doing so, we must first ascertain what the work was that the suppliant undertook to perform.\nIt was to build a wharf of certain dimensions, and in such a manner as the specifications and plans showed, and, undoubtedly, on the site and foundation selected by the engineer and pointed out to the suppliant.\nSection 4 of the specification, referring to one of the plans, is as follows:\nOn figure one are laid down three parallel lines of soundings taken on west side, centre and east side of wharf, but contractors are required to verify the same before tendering for the work. As soon as the work is commenced accurate soundings for each crib must be made by the contractor that the outline of the bottom may be known previous to their being founded, and provision must be made for the slope of the ground, by stepping the bottom courses in the manner shown on the plan, as each crib must be carried up perfectly level.\nThere is here no provision for a sustaining bottom. It was not the sustaining power of the bottom, but the correctness of the \"three parallel lines of soundings\" that was to be proved, and contractors were called upon to verify \"the same.\" The outline of the then existing bottom was, therefore, alone to be verified by the contractors before tendering, and \"accurate soundings were to be made for each crib and any unevenness in the \"outline of the bottom\" was to be overcome by the \"stepping of the cribs.\" Such, then, is the description of the work the contractor was expected, and contracted to do, and not in any way touching the question of a sustaining bottom. In fact, the contractor was not to alter or change the bottom, but to fit the cribs to it as it then was. If he had been expected to excavate and remove any accumulation of unsustaining matter or to make a sustaining bottom by means of stones thrown down and graded or levelled, or otherwise, the specification would have shown it; and the agreement would have included a reference to it and compensation for the outlay; and the schedule of prices for the monthly payments would have included the cost of that artificial sustaining foundation. Such a provision would have nevertheless been to some extent in conflict with the provision to erect the wharf by verifying the \"soundings\" to the top of the bottom as then existing, and on which the work was to be laid. The contract and specification contain no one expression to sustain the construction that the suppliant was to do anything more than to erect the cribs upon, and step them to suit, the form and shape of the then existing bottom. All the documents show he was paid for nothing else, and when a contractor tenders for a work and enters into a contract to perform certain and defined works according to a specification and plans, how can he be expected to perform works not mentioned or included therein, and for which no compensation is provided.\nSection 13 of the specification shows conclusively to my mind, that when the tenders were asked for and the contract entered into, the party who prepared the specification, acting for the Minister, fully intended that the cribs should be adapted to and settled upon the then outline of the bottom, under the belief it would be sufficiently sustaining, or that at least, if the cribs were stepped to suit the existing bottom, they would settle evenly. It provides that:\nSo soon as it is considered by the engineer or officer in charge that a firm foundation has been obtained and the cribs have settled to their proper position, they will be connected at the top both in a horizontal and transverse direction by three rows of timber, &c.\nThis shows plainly that it was expected there would be some settling, for which the stepping of the cribs was intended to sufficiently prevent to any great extent and to overcome. From such evidence of facts I can come to no other conclusion than that the suppliant in stepping and sinking the cribs on the then outline of the bottom, did exactly what he had contracted to do. He was bound to do the work: \"With such directions as shall be given by the engineer or officer in charge during the progress of the work.\" It is shown that a man named William Marshall, apparently a very competent person, was the officer in constant supervision and direction of the works. The cribs were all made, stepped and sunk by his direction and with his approval. They were so sunk on the outline of the bottom then existing, with the exception of the removal of some boulders by the suppliant which would have interfered with the proper settling of the cribs on the bottom. The cribs were properly ballasted and sunk, and stepped so as to be level and according to the specification. The work was done to the satisfaction of Marshall, and that is all the suppliant contracted to do. Although all this appears satisfactorily by the evidence, it is contended that, because during the progress of the works, after the completion of the cribs, some of them tilted and moved, and one tumbled over in consequence of the soft bottom, the suppliant was bound by fenders, piles, and other means not included in the specification to remedy the damage so as to render the wharf safe for vessels to lie beside and load at it. Under the true construction of the agreement, as far as I have yet referred to it and the work to be done under it, I feel bound to say, that such a conclusion would be wholy inequitable, and I think unwarranted. The suppliant was not only told by the specification to place the cribs where, and in the manner he did place them, but did so by the direction and with the approval of the other contracting party by his agent the officer in charge, as provided by the agreement; and how then can that other contracting party be permitted to transfer the blame of not providing in the contract for a proper sustaining bottom from the engineer who planned the work to the innocent contractor who erected the works according to his contract and to the satisfaction of the officers in charge? How can he be permitted to order the works to be erected on a certain foundation and then complain that his own orders were carried out, when his plans have failed; and to call upon the contractor to bear a heavy loss arising from the fault of his own specification. If I engage a contractor to build a stone wall in a trench a foot deep, and after two-thirds of it is set up and accepted and approved, wet weather supervenes, the foundations give way, and the wall topples over or sinks into a bog, could I either equitably or legally require him at his own cost to rebuild or repair it? That position is, in my opinion, identical with that in the present case.\nIf a party undertakes to perform work in a situation and under circumstances which he subsequently finds impracticable, he is, I admit, liable to the consequences of his failure, unless he has a guarantee from the other contracting party against the existence of the controlling causes of failure, Here the position is different, for when the cribs tilted and got into wrong position, the engineer, instead of leaving the suppliant to fulfil his contract as he best could, relieved him of his responsibility to have them replaced, if he were, under the circumstances, bound to do so, by ordering the execution of other and extra works not provided for in the specification. There was no agreement for the substitution of the works ordered and claimed as extra by the suppliant. If there had been, the suppliant would have been estopped from claiming compensation. The engineer had the right to order changes and alterations of the details of the works in progress, or any extra works. Those claimed for are clearly not in the shape of changes or alterations, but extra works. When the cribs got tilted or injured, and it was the duty of the suppliant to replace them, the engineer could have required him to do so; and the former could either have done so, or resisted the demand that he should do so. Or the engineer might have waived his replacing them, on condition that he, the suppliant, would perform the extra work as a compromise for not being required to replace them. Nothing of this was done, but the engineer peremptorily ordered the execution of the extra works, as being covered by and included in the original specification, when such was not the case, and the necessity for which could not have been foreseen or anticipated. If the suppliant failed in his contract, of which I, however, see no evidence, he was legally answerable for the consequences; but I know of no law, and can discover no authority in the contract, to make the engineer judge of the penalty for such failure. The suppliant never agreed to perform, at his own cost, the extra labour, and furnish the materials, which became necessary from the giving way of the cribs, but did it, as he protested at the time, under the seventh clause of the agreement. I am therefore of the opinion that he is entitled to recover therefor a sufficient sum to indemnify him for his outlay.\nFor the first two items of the suppliant's claim he cannot, in my opinion, recover, as he admits he had no orders to do the work charged for.\nAs to the third item, I have some doubts, owing to the absence of satisfactory scientific evidence, and as I feel unable to say that the specification would have been fulfilled by the use of shorter timbers breaking joints, as provided for in the case of the three large cribs, I do not feel justified in deciding the engineer had not the right, under the specification, to require the lengths insisted upon by him.\nAs to item four, I have some difficulty, arising from the want of explicit evidence, as to whether the alleged change was really made. From the evidence of the suppliant, I would say it was different from the original agreement for the coal structure, but the plan had not been prepared when the agreement was made. When it was, extra work appeared by it to be necessary, which cost the suppliant $300. I am inclined to think him entitled to it, but, owing to the loose way the verbal contract was entered into, I have some doubt, and therefore do not feel justified in allowing for it. For the 5th and 6th items for raising trestle-work, and for timber for the same, I think the suppliant should be paid. The work was duly ordered and became necessary, as the engineer himself admits, in consequence, to a great extent, of the subsiding or canting of the cribs, caused by the soft foundation.\nItem 7, I think also, he is entitled to be paid for, as the work was ordered but not included in the specification.\nItems 8, 9 and 10 were not required by the specification, and, for the reasons already given, I think the suppliant is entitled to recover for 9 and 10 ordered by the engineer, but not for 8, which work was done by the suppliant himself without any such order.\nItems 11, 12 and 13 were not included in the specification, but the work was ordered in writing to be done by the engineer. It was required in consequence of the upsetting or canting of the cribs by the yielding of the foundation, and, for the reasons already given, I think the suppliant is entitled to compensation for the extra work done.\nItem 14, for cutting off the projecting ends of logs, although ordered by the engineer to be done, should not, I think, be allowed under the evidence. By the specification the ends of the logs were to be cut off at the distance of eight inches from the connecting notch for the junction with the side timbers, and if they had been so cut I cannot see how they could have been outside of the fenders which were 12 inches outside of the side timbers, and had the cross timbers been so cut they would certainly not only not have required cutting again, but would have been four inches inside of the fenders. All the cutting then to bring the ends of the logs even with the fenders was, in my judgment only pursuing the agreement as stated in the specification, and for which I cannot see the suppliant has any claim for compensation. As to item 15, I think the evidence is insufficient to base any claim for damages. It is conflicting, and although delays did take place, and possibly unnecessary in some of the cases, there is shown no legal claim for damages. The payments were to be made monthly as the work proceeded, on the certificate of the engineer, and they were so made; but the suppliant complains the engineer improperly, on some occasions, withheld his certificate. This is denied by the engineer, and reasons are given by him for the delay; but although in one instance they may be considered hardly sufficient, I don't think the withholding of the certificate for a certain time under the circumstances, would warrant a judgment for special damages.\nThere is one clause of the specification (No. 30) to which I am bound to refer:\nThe bulk sum mentioned in the tender must include the entire cost of furnishing all labour, materials, tools and machinery, and every contingency connected with the work, and the contractor is to assume all risks and make good, at his own cost, any damage which may result from loss of materials, or otherwise, by storms, or from any other cause whatsoever during the progress of the work, and up to its full and satisfactory completion.\nThis clause is not specially pleaded as an answer to the suppliant's claims, nor is it in any way alleged that under the sweeping and comprehensive expression therein: \"or from any other cause whatever during the progress of the work,\" the suppliant took upon himself the risk of a sustaining foundation for the cribs\u2014the want of which necessitated the performance of so much extra work. That issue was not raised by the pleadings, and we are, therefore, not called upon to decide it; but, if we were, I would feel bound to say, in addition to the views I have already expressed, that such a defence could not be set up where the cause of the extra work was solely to be attributed to the defect in the foundation of the cribs, by their having been placed with the concurrence and by the direction of the engineer, and provided for so plainly and palpably in the specification. The bulk sum mentioned was certainly to include compensation for \"every contingency connected with the work,\" but that work was the building of the wharf, as described in the specification, from \"the outline of the bottom\" then existing, and the \"contingency\" was limited to that work. The contractor was certainly to assume all risks, and make good, at his own cost, any damage which might result from loss of materials or otherwise by storms, and then follow the words \"or from any cause whatsoever,\" but the latter cannot be construed to include the overt acts of the other contracting party, or to vary the true construction of the specification. The \"causes\" covered by the words in question must, I think, be ejusdem generis with the two preceding provisions and within the terms of the contract, as stated and set out in the specification, and within the compass of the work prescribed to be done. The law, as found in the cases cited by my learned Chief, is unquestionable; but, in my opinion, this case is essentially different from any of them.\nI think for the reasons given the appeal should be allowed and that a judgment should be entered for the plaintiff for the amount of the items I have enumerated, with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI concur in the reasons given by the Chief Justice for dismissing this appeal. I think that the appellant has been paid in full the contract price and all the extras done in pursuance thereof; that for the extras outside of the contract, the appellant has failed to produce a written authorization in accordance with the clear terms of section seven of the said contract, and without which he can not claim such extras; and, lastly, that the receipt dated April 30, 1875, by the appellant to the Crown, is a complete bar to appellant's claim.\nI am of opinion the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Robert Motion.\nSolicitors for respondent: Mowat, Maclennan & Downey.\n[1] Hotham v.

McC., and they justified breaking and entering the said close in their own right, and the other defendants as their servant and, by their command.\nThe case was tried by Armour, J., without a jury, and he rendered a verdict for plaintiff with thirty dollars damages. The judgment was set aside by the Court of Common Pleas, and they entered a verdict for the defendants in pursuance of R.S.O. c. 50, sec. 287.\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversed this judgment, and restored the verdict as originally found by Armour, J. The defendants thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court.\nHeld: That the appellants (defendants), on whom the onus lay of proving their plea of liberum tenementum, had not proved a valid documentary title, or possession for twenty years of that actual, continuous and visible character necessary to give them a title under the Statute of Limitations; therefore plaintiff was entitled to his verdict. (Henry, J., dissenting.)\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario restoring a verdict as originally found in favor of respondent (plaintiff.)\nThis was an action of trespass quare clausum fregit brought by the respondent against the appellants. The trespass complained of was the breaking down of a fence erected, or in course of erection, around the said land by the respondent, and the action was brought for the purpose of trying the title to the said lands which comprise fifty acres adjoining the city of Belleville.\nThe pleas were: 1. Not guilty. 2. That at the time of the alleged trespass the said land was the freehold of the defendants, Mary Elizabeth McConaghy and Louisa Jane McConaghy. 3. \u201cAnd for a third plea the defendants say that, at the time of the alleged trespass, the said land was the freehold of Mary Elizabeth McConaghy and Louisa Jane McConaghy, and the defendants Francis McConaghy, Sarah Ann Kennedy and Patrick O\u2019Hara, as the servants, and by the com- mand of the said Mary Elizabeth McConaghy and Louisa Jane McConaghy, broke and entered the said close and committed the alleged trespass.\u201d\nThe plaintiff joined issue on the defendants\u2019 pleas.\nThe case was tried at Belleville at the autumn assizes of 1878, before the Honorable Mr. Justice Armour, who found all the issues for the plaintiff, and entered a verdict for him for $30.\nThe Court of Common Pleas, composed of Wilson C.J., and Galt J., set aside this verdict and entered a verdict for the defendants in pursuance of R. S. O. cap. 50, sec. 287.\nFrom this judgment the respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and the said court allowed the said appeal, and restored the verdict as originally found by Mr. Justice Armour.\nThe question to be decided on this appeal was whether the evidence shewed that the appellants had acquired a title under the Statute of Limitations.\nThe evidence is reviewed at length in the judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. Hector Cameron, Q.C., for appellants:\nThe plaintiff failed to prove title by possession, as he professed and attempted to do, and should not have been allowed to go into a paper title in rebuttal of defendants\u2019 possessory title. See Doe dem. McKay v. Purdy[1].\nThe opinion of the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas was that the title was in the Crown, and that defendants\u2019 possession was better than plaintiff\u2019s. The Court of Appeal declare that our possession was not sufficient and not according to law. I submit that it was, for there is great difference between a man who takes possession under a title and a squatter. In applying the law to the facts, no Weight has been given to defendants\u2019 title, and for this reason I contend the judgment of the Court below is erroneous.\nNow, the evidence adduced at the trial shows that the defendant, Francis McConaghy, and one Hugh McGuire, in good faith and for a good and adequate consideration, purchased the south half of lot number one in the second concession of the Township of Thurlow from one Alexander Chisholm, the heir-at-law of John Chisholm, one of the alleged patentees, through whom the respondent professes to claim title to the lands in question, who in the presence and to the knowledge of one Zwick, through whom the respondent also professes to claim, was in possession and occupation of the said half lot (100 acres) as early as A.D. 1825, and who in A.D. 1831 conveyed the same, apparently in fee, by deed to them the said Francis McConaghy and Hugh McGuire. In pursuance of this purchase they went into possession and occupation of the said half lot and cleared and cultivated a part of the same, and continued so to occupy, clear and cultivate until the time of the partition of the said half lot between them, in the year 1832 or 1833, as shown by the evidence, when by the said partition the said McGuire was allotted the west 50 acres and the possession thereof, and the said McConaghy the east 50 acres and the possession thereof, (which said east 50 acres embrace the lands on which the trespasses complained of by the respondent are alleged to have been committed by the appellants). Francis McConaghy in pursuance of the said partition then entered into possession of the said east 50 acres, and from that time continued in uninterrupted peaceable possession of the same until the time of the said alleged trespasses, being a period of over 40 years; and if the prior joint possession of the said Francis McConaghy and Hugh McGuire, and the possession of the said Alexander Chis- holm were included, the period would be over 50 years, and the said partition, though not shown to have been: in writing or by deed, was a good and valid partition. The contract therefore shown by the evidence being proved to have been followed immediately by a survey of the lands, for the purposes of such partition, and a change in the possession by the said Francis McConaghy and Hugh McGuire, as well as other acts of performance, so that the alleged dispossession of the said Hugh McGuire, even if proved, could not affect the title acquired by such length of possession, and possession under these circumstances, even if actual as to part of the lands, is in law deemed a possession of the whole, and this title is shown by the evidence to have been acquired by the appellants Mary Elizabeth McConaghy and Louisa Jane McConaghy, and to have been in them at the time of the said alleged trespasses, and as they the said Mary Elizabeth McConaghy and Louisa Jane McConaghy in their defence set up this title and the other appellants, (defendants) in their defence, justified them, and proved such justification, the judgment of the said Court of Common Pleas was correct.\nThe learned counsel relied also upon the following authorities:\nDavis v. Henderson[2]; Dundas v. Johnston[3]; Mulholland v. Conklin[4]; McKinnon v. Conklin[5]; Findlay v. Peden[6]; Attorney General v. Harris[7].\nMr. Henry J. Scott for respondent:\nMr. Justice Armour, who tried the case, found all the issues for the plaintiff. The Court of Common Pleas, under sec. 287 c. 50 Revised Stats. Ontario, practically retried the case. I contend that as the learned judge who tried the case found as a matter of fact that the defendants had not acquired any title by possession, such finding should not have been disturbed by the Court of Common Pleas, which did not see the witnesses and could not judge as to their credibility; nor should the Court disturb the verdict. As to the objection that the judge at the trial should not have allowed the plaintiff to prove a paper title, this objection was not taken in the Court below, and moreover, having taken a verdict in his favor in the Court of Common Pleas, he cannot now say the trial was all wrong. It is too late.\nBefore coming down to the substantial question between the parties, I will call the attention of the Court to this important fact\u2014that all through these years the acts Francis McConaghy proved were only acts of ownership and not of possession, and these acts are stretched over a period of 30 years.\nI contend that the defendant Francis McConaghy never had such possession of the land as is required to acquire a title under the Statute of Limitations.\nIn order to oust the legal owner and acquire a title under the statute, the person must be in adverse possession, which has been variously defined to be \u201can actual occupation and appropriation within some defined boundaries[8]\u201d; \u201cthat constant visible possession of it which could only be regarded as exclusive possession, and a shutting out of the true owner[9]\u201d \u201cnot only an entry on the land, but a visible and notorious continuance of the possession so taken[10]\u201d. And all definitions, both in text books and in cases, recognize the fact that the possession must be such as to give notice to the world and the owner of the occupancy, and put him to assert his rights if he means to retain them, and that mere occasional acts of trespass do not give a title under the statute as they are not an adverse possession, or in fact any possession at all, and such a doctrine should be enforced more stringently in a new country, where land is continually left unoccupied by the Owner.\nI am quite prepared to admit that, if the appellants had been in possession under colour of title of any part, they would have the right to claim the whole. But neither the appellants, nor any one through whom they claimed, ever lived on the lot, or on any adjoining land.\nThe learned counsel then reviewed the evidence and claimed that it was altogether insufficient to establish the fact of the possession of the lands in dispute by the appellant Francis McConaghy, so as to give him a title under the Statute of Limitations, even if it stood unquestioned.\nMr. Cameron, Q.C., in reply;\nThis is an appeal from a final judgment of the Court of Appeal in which arises a mixed question of law and fact, and it is open for this Court to review the whole case as the Court of Appeal did. From the evidence it was clearly a case for the jury.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nThis was an action of trespass brought by plaintiff against defendants for entering certain lands of the plaintiff, known as lots Nos. 2, 6, 8, 10,12, 14, 15, 16 and 17 on a certain plan of lots laid out on lots Nos. 1 and 2 in the second concession of the township of Thurlow, in the County of Hastings. He claimed one thousand dollars, and also claimed a writ of injunction to restrain the defendants. To this declaration the defendants pleaded, 1st, not guilty; 2nd, That at the time of the alleged trespass the said land was the freehold of the appellants, M.E. McConaghy and L.J. McConaghy; 3rd. That by command of the appellants, M.E. McConaghy and L.J. McConaghy, the other defendants, as servants, broke and entered the said close and committed the alleged trespass. The plaintiff joined issue on defendants\u2019 pleas.\nThis state of the pleadings threw upon the defendants the burden of shewing that this land at the time of the alleged trespass was the soil and freehold of the defendants, Mary Elizabeth and Louisa Jane McConaghy. It is not pretended that they produced any valid documentary title vesting this property in them, but they relied upon a title by virtue of the Statute of Limitations. I have gone over the evidence very carefully, and I have not been able to arrive at the conclusion that they have made out such a continuous, open, undisturbed possession of this property as would justify me in saying that the Court of Appeals were wrong in coming to the conclusion that the statutory title had not been made out.\nMy brother Gwynne has kindly permitted me to look at a judgment he has prepared in this case, and he has gone through the evidence so fully, and, to my mind, so satisfactorily, that it would only be an imposition on the patience of the court if I were to deal with the evidence more minutely. I am not prepared to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case.\nHENRY, J.:\nThe action in this case is trespass for breaking and entering certain lands of the respondent known as lots numbers two, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen and seventeen, on a certain plan of lots laid out on lots number one and two, in the second concession of the township of Thurlow, in the county of Hastings, Ontario, by Henry A.F. McLeod, Provincial Land Surveyor, for the Honorable John Ross, duly registered, and known as the \u201cLemoine Lands,\u201d and for cutting and breaking down certain fences of the respondent thereon. The writ was issued on the 29th of April, 1878.\nThe pleas are: 1st. Not guilty. 2nd. Claims title in two of the defendants. 3rd. Claims title in the same defendants, and a justification for the other defendants, as their servants and by their command.\nUpon the pleas issue was joined.\nThe trespasses are proved against all the defendants except Patrick O\u2019Hara, and, under the evidence, he was entitled to have had a verdict under the first plea, and is now equally entitled to our judgment. To recover against the others, the respondent must, at the time of the alleged trespass, have been in either the actual or constructive possession of the land upon which the trespasses are alleged to have been committed. Apart from title, he had, it is clear, no possession to sustain the action, unless the entering into the land and house, formerly in possession of some of the defendants, and the putting up of the fences, partly by the materials of the house which he had pulled down, could be called so.\nWithout title, or some justification, these acts would themselves be trespasses which could give no right of action against Francis McConaghy and those claiming under him. To sustain the action therefore, title is necessary to be shown in the land as described in the declaration. The description is not by metes and bounds, but by numbers of lots \u201cknown as lots numbers two, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen and seventeen, on a certain plan of lots laid out on lots numbers one and two in the second concession of the township of Thurlow, in the county of Hastings, by Henry A.F. McLeod, Provincial Land Surveyor, for the Honorable John Ross, and known as the \u2018Lemoine Lands.\u2019 \u201d\nA copy of a plan is in evidence, but it is not in any way proved to be a copy of the plan referred to in the declaration. It is not even sighed or certified, or proved in any way as identical with any plan made by the surveyor McLeod. The respondent, in order to identify the land described in the declaration with that covered by his title, is bound to locate each. Without some evidence, how could any court or jury decide that the lands marked in the plan is the same as in McLeod\u2019s plan. This copy is but a sketch, which is useful to illustrate the contents of documents in evidence, but by itself constitutes no proof. No witness was examined who, from knowledge of the locality, was able to say that the land in the sketch was identical with the title produced by the respondent. A particular plan was referred to in the declaration, and under the general denial of the appellants the respondent was bound to show that on the identical piece of land described in the declaration the alleged trespasses were committed, and that his title covered the locus. Even should the respondent have shown that his title covers the eastern half of the front of lot one in the second concession, it is not shown that McLeod\u2019s plan by the particular numbers given it is the same land. Nor do I see how it could have been so shown unless McLeod\u2019s plan were produced and proved, and evidence given of the necessary identity. It would seem, however, that the plan in evidence was not objected to, and that in the case it is referred to as McLeod\u2019s plan, showing the sub\u2011divisions of lots 1 and 2 in the second concession.\nAdmitting, however, that the serious difficulty just mentioned did not exist, has the respondent shown title to the locus? He relies upon title from the Grown to himself by two distinct series of con-\n[Pages 619]\nveyances, one through a person named John Chisholm, the other Joseph Lemoine. If the conveyances either way covet the locus it is sufficient. The land upon which the respondent alleges the trespasses to have been committed is what is understood as the eastern half of the southern or front part of lot one in the second concession. Let us first see if there was any title shown in the respondent through the grantee John Chisholm. The grant to the latter is dated 6th March, 1798. The land conveyed by it is called generally lot 1 in concession 1 and part of lot 1 in the 2nd concession. It is, however, particularly described. The line, beginning at a post in the front marked \u00bd, is to run a course north 16\u00b0 west, 125 ch. and 25 links, then west-wardly parallel to the bank in front to township line; then S. 16\u00b0 E., 105 ch., 27 links to the Bay of Quinte; then easterly along the front to the place of beginning. By the plan and survey of the surveyor Emerson, a witness called by the respondent, it is clearly shown that the lines, according to the description in the grant, would not only not include any part of lot 1 in the 2nd concession, but would exclude also a part of lot 1 in the 1st. concession across the lot about 4 chains in depth on the east side and 22 chains on the west. The particular description\u2014controlling the general one\u2014limits the boundaries of the grant. The latter does not therefore cover any part of lot 1 in the 2nd concession. The description in the deed from Chisholm to Zwick is a copy of that in the grant, and therefore covers no part of lot 1 in the 2nd concession. The title, by that branch of the conveyances, entirely fails.\nThe first link in the other chain of title is a grant from the Crown to Joseph Lemoine, dated 17th May, 1802. The evidence leaves no little obscurity as to the land covered by it. It purports to grant 450 acres, being the rear parts of lots numbers 1 and 2 in the 2nd conces- sion and lot 18 in the 7th concession. It requires the line for the former to commence at the north eastern angle of certain lands granted Peter Vanderhyden in the said lot number 2 second concession, at a distance of 106 chains from the front, thence N. 16 W. to the front line of the third concession; then S. 74 W. 38 chains; then 8. 16 E. to certain lands granted John Chisholm; then north easterly along the rear boundary of said lands to lot number 2; then N. 74 E., 19 chains to the place of beginning. The position of Vanderhyden\u2019s north east corner is not shown. The description however places it somewhere in lot number 2 in the 2nd concession. If so, and the lines are run as in the grant, we have this singular fact, that they will surround and include the lands referred to as granted to Vanderhyden. If again, the third course of Lemoine\u2019s grant be taken from the front line of the third concession till it strikes the rear line of Chisholm\u2019s grant, it will come over the line between concessions 1 and 2 by about 22 chains, and then, running along the rear of Chisholm\u2019s lot, it will strike the side line between lots 1 and 2 in the first concession about four chains in front of the rear line of the first concession as shown on the plan, and would not, in that case, as directed by the description, come at all to number two in the 2nd concession, and therefore could not, by the course indicated, reach, as required, the point of commencement. By running the course of the side line for about 4 chains, a course not in the grant, it would strike the south west angle of lot number two in the 2nd concession, and by running from that point the course and distance indicated in the grant, it would strike the south east angle of lot number two but not the north east angle of Vanderhyden\u2019s grant, the point of commencement, as provided by the grant. It would be at least 40 chains south of it. The description is therefore wholly defective. Had it been shown by the production of the grant to Vanderhyden, or otherwise, where his north east corner was, when Lemoine\u2019s grant was issued, there might have been possibly no difficulty in locating Lemoine\u2019s grant, but without that, any decision arrived at cannot be the result of conclusions from evidence but from assumptions that may or may not be well founded. It was the duty of the respondent to have given the evidence necessary to locate properly his own grant, upon which his right to recover is based, and if, by not furnishing available evidence, he unnecessarily leaves the location of his grant in doubt or difficulty he must take the consequences.\nThere is, however, a more serious and controlling difficulty. No conveyance from the grantee Joseph Lemoine is shown. He is not identified. In fact he is not in the slightest degree referred to. There is a deed from one William Lemoine, who therein is alleged to be the heir at law of Joseph Lemoine, late of the town of Kingston, deceased.\nTo establish title in William Lemoine some, even if slight, evidence of the identity of Joseph Lemoine was, under the circumstances, necessary. Secondly, his death; and, thirdly, that William Lemoine was his heir. Without evidence of all three the deed of William Lemoine is worthless as a conveyance under the grant to Joseph Lemoine. There is, therefore, as I think, no conveyance of title under the deed from William Lemoine to Mr. Ross, and consequently none transferred through him from the grantee to the respondent.\nTurning then to the defence, and the evidence on both sides, we find that in 1831 (46 years before the commencement of this suit) Francis McConaghy, one of the defendants, and Hugh McGuire purchased for fifty pounds from Alex. Chisholm, the son of the grantee, John Chisholm, and received from him a deed of the front part (being 100 acres) of lot number 1, in the 2nd concession, of which the eastern half part is the land now in dispute. Some years previously Alexander Chisholm entered upon the lot\u2014then in a wilderness state\u2014and commenced a clearing by cutting down a piece across the front. McConaghy and McGuire, on getting the deed, immediately went into possession, cut down and jointly cleared upon the land for two or three years. They then got a surveyor and divided it between them, McGuire taking the western and McConaghy the eastern half. A line fence was put up between them and each took possession by the survey. They continued to hold possession by the division line then established between them. McGuire put up a house on his half and lived on it. He cultivated it and claimed it as his own until 1845, when he sold and conveyed it to Peter O\u2019Reilly. The deed shews the sale was intended to convey fifty acres, being what he occupied, but it really covers the whole front of lot 1, and includes the lot now in dispute. In 1848, Reilly conveyed all his right to the 100 acres conveyed to him by McGuire to John Ross. By those two conveyances Ross is brought into priority of estate with McGuire, and is bound by the same estoppels as he would be. McConaghy had been then in possession by the purchase, and the overt act and admission, by the division, of McGuire, as sole owner of the east half for 12 or 13 years, and by virtue of the former statute of limitations that possession, as against McGuire and those claiming under him, ripened into a title in the year 1852 or 1853. After twenty years McGuire would be estopped from disputing the title and possession of McConaghy; and those claiming under him would occupy the same position. McConaghy was never ousted from the possession, nor did either Ross or any one claiming under him ever enter upon the land, except to make a survey in 1852 without the knowledge of McConaghy, until the respon- dent did so in the first place by committing a trespass in taking possession of McConaghy\u2019s house in the autumn of 1877, and by the destruction of it and putting up a fence round the lot in the spring or summer following. McConaghy, under the compact with McGuire for the division and occupation of the land, had held it from 1832 or 1833 up to the autumn of 1877\u201444 or 45 years before respondent entered. The respondent, then, without title otherwise, as I have shown, than through McGuire, enters upon the land, commits acts of trespass thereon, claims to be in possession as against McConaghy and his assigns, and sues them for knocking down the fence he erected partly out of boards taken from McConaghy\u2019s house. This position is not taken or claimed by the respondent, but it is the one established by the evidence, and with which we have to deal.\nBy the pleas, however, the respondent is admitted to be in possession at the time of the alleged trespass, and the defendant under the justification by the plea of liberum tenementum, must show a right to enter upon the land and break down the fences.\nHad the appellants denied the possession of the respondent, the latter, on the evidence, must have entirely failed; but having depended on the plea of liberum tenementum we must now consider if they have proved it.\nThey claim title under a deed from Alexander Chisholm in 1831 to McGuire and McConaghy of the front one hundred acres of lot one in the second concession, of which the locus is the eastern half part. Chisholm six years before had entered upon the lot and cut down a part of it in front to make a clearing. The consideration of the deed was \u00a350. They immediately entered into the possession of the lot and commenced making improvements and clearings thereon. In 1832 or 1833 they employed a surveyor to divide the lot from front to rear. He ran a line between them which they adopted, and ever after held by, McGuire taking the west and McConaghy the east half. From that time each occupied, according to a line fence put up between their lots on the division line run and established by the surveyor which both agreed to. McConaghy\u2019s possession was, therefore, under the deed and agreement with McGuire by the division, that of owner, and unless disseized by McGuire, or some one claiming through him, that possession ripened into a good title against him and them. They became estopped, after the prescribed limitation, from claiming title to or entering upon it. The only title shown in the respondent is through McGuire, and he is therefore estopped from disputing McConaghy\u2019s possession or title. But in the absence of that fatal objection, the title of McGuire is through the deed from Alexander Chisholm to him and McConaghy, and if McGuire could convey a title to his fifty acres, surely that of McConaghy was, as to his 50 acres, at least as good.\nIf that question of estoppel had not arisen, what position did the appellants occupy who had a deed of the lot from their father at the time the respondent first entered in 1877? The evidence of the appellants establishes the fact that, for forty-six years from the time Alexander Chisholm conveyed the lot until that time, no one but McConaghy had entered upon the lot as owner (except the survey made for Mr. Ross,) which I will hereafter refer to,) or had in any way possession of it. It is in evidence that every year McConaghy and McGuire cleared upon the lot and had previously burnt over what Chisholm had cut down. In the spring of 1832 they fenced round 20 acres and sowed wheat in the place fenced in. In 1833 they arranged with three men, and got them to cut down about 20 acres more Those 20 acres were some years afterwards ploughed and sown. It is also shown that McConaghy afterwards by his tenants occupied the lot at different periods, and he swears (and is in no way contradicted) that the line fence put up between him and McGuire was always kept up till the year before the suit was tried. It is shown that the whole lot was fenced in the ordinary way for several years. During; all that time no one interfered with McConaghy\u2019s possession. It is true he did not live on the lot, but in the adjacent town of Belleville. He was a cooper by trade, and from year to year got firewood and cooper\u2019s stuff off it as he required. It is not pretended that any other party was in possession as owner or claimant of the lot at any time during that long period. The first act of possession was by the respondent, who in the autumn of 1877 took possession of a small house put up on the lot by McConaghy, This, without title, was simply a trespass for which McConaghy might have recovered damages. His next and only act of possession was in tearing down the house, and, with the boards with which it was built and other materials, putting up the fence, the pulling down of which is the trespass complained of. It is true, that the plea of liberum tenementum admits such a possession in the respondent as would have enabled him to sustain trespass against a wrong doer, but McConaghy\u2019s grantees could have maintained trespass against him for his acts in 1877 and 1878. The defective pleading of the appellants, in not contesting the respondent\u2019s possession, no doubt alters the nature and form, but not the substance, of the enquiry. Nobody will contend (successfully at all events) that if A buys, pays for, and obtains a deed of a piece of land, goes into immediate possession, clears, crops, improves it, and no one for forty-six years interferes with his manual possession of it, or in any way disturbs him, he would not have a good title against all the world, except, it might be, under very peculiar circumstances, the owner, through title derived from the Crown. Such, then, in my matured and well considered judgment, is the position of the appellants who set up title as the defence to this action.\nIn 1845, McGuire conveyed the whole lot of 100 acres, which he and McConaghy purchased from Chisholm, to O\u2019Reilly, and in 1848 O\u2019Reilly conveyed the same to Ross. In 1852, a judgment in ejectment was recovered on the demise of Philip Zwick against McGuire, who remained in possession of his fifty acres, and it was called in the record \u201cthe front fifty acres of lot number one in the second concession.\u201d The action was substantially that of Mr. Ross, who brought it in the name of Lemoine and Zwick. No writ of possession was issued, as McGuire became, by a lease for a year from Ross, the tenant of the premises, and in that lease the judgment was recited, and the lease was of the same fifty acres. The evidence shows that the front 100 acres was divided by McGuire and McConaghy from front to rear, making, consequently, two front fifty acre lots. It was the western fifty acres that McGuire was in possession of, and for which the action was brought to recover, and which the subsequent lease covered. No possession was attempted to be taken under the judgment of the fifty acres now in dispute, which is shown to have all along been in McConaghy\u2019s possession. McGuire occupied till his death the fifty acres under the lease from Ross. Under such circum-stances, the recovery against McGuire, and his subsequent possession under Ross, can have no effect in regard to the possession of McConaghy of his lot.\nAs I before stated, the evidence establishes the fact of McConaghy\u2019s possession during the long period before mentioned. It is true some witnesses stated they knew the place at different periods, saw McGuire working upon his lot, but saw neither McConaghy or any one else working on the eastern lot. There is nothing in this to negative the fact that Chisholm, McGuire and McConaghy cut down and cleared a portion of the 100 acres, and that after the division McConaghy yearly cut and carried away the wood and timber until the whole lot was cleared. If McConaghy had, like McGuire, been a farmer and lived on the lot, as he probably would have done, his possession would have certainly been more palpable and better known, but such was not necessary\u2014his possession was marked by line fences; he yearly exercised acts of ownership over it animo domini; he had tenants on it for some years, and his possession and claim by all these circumstances must have been, and no doubt was, well known in the neighborhood. There was some evidence that McGuire\u2019s son-in-law raised some wheat one year on the east half. The witness who spoke of it seems rather to have known it from what that person told him than from his own observation, but if it even had been so, if done without McConaghy\u2019s assent, he would have been but a trespasser, and his act would not have disseized McConaghy.\nThe only other point necessary to be noticed is that of prescription.\nBy section 4 of chapter 108 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, prescription of ten years against grantees who did not enter into possession was not to run until knowledge of the actual possession of another was shown, \u201cbut the right to bring an action shall be deemed to have accrued from the time such knowledge was obtained; but no such action shall be brought or entry made after twenty years from the time such possession was taken as aforesaid.\u201d\nIn the application of this legislative provision no reference need be made to the question of the know- ledge by the grantees, Chisholm or Lemoine, or those claiming under them, for, as I have shown, the respondent has traced no title from the Crown through them; but how will it affect him under the title derived through McGuire, O\u2019Reilly and others?\nThe knowledge of either of them for ten years before the suit would be sufficient to bar any right of entry or action. It cannot be pretended that McGuire had not such knowledge, for McConaghy was in possession by his assent and knowledge, and as to Mr. Ross, we have only to consider what took place when he offered the small lots for sale, to conclude that he also had full knowledge of McConaghy\u2019s possession. After the sale by Ross, McConaghy posted up public notices dated October 30th, 1863, in which he claimed to be the owner of the 50 acres, alleging he had been in possession of the same by a deed for valuable consideration since 1829, and that he had been in peaceable possession ever since, and threatening to \u201cprosecute all persons found trespassing on said fifty acres or any portion thereof, as Mr. Ross never had a claim or right to it.\u201d It was shown that in consequence of these notices parties who had purchased declined to complete the purchases, and the sale was abortive. We must conclude therefore from these facts, and what it is otherwise shown Mr. Ross was aware of, that he had full knowledge of McConaghy\u2019s possession and claim of title. That there being more than ten years before the suit, the right of entry or action was barred. But, claiming under McGuire, the respondent having no claim through a grantee, the knowledge is not at all necessary to be shown. The prescription without knowledge of another being in possession is, by the clause, limited to twenty years, and certainly the respondent\u2019s right was barred, for the right under any circumstances was limited to the latter period. I am of opinion the two defendants who have pleaded title have proved their plea, that the other defendants, except O\u2019Hara, have established a justification under them, and that O\u2019Hara should have judgment under his plea of denial\u2014the whole with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nThis was an action of trespass, quare clausum fregit, brought by the respondent against the appellants for breaking and entering the lands of the plaintiff, known as lots numbers two, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen and seventeen, on a certain plan of lots laid out on lots numbers 1 and 2, in the second concession of the township of Thurlow, known as the \u201cLemoine lands,\u201d and cutting and breaking down certain fences of the plaintiff\u2019s thereon erected, and committing other injuries upon the said lands of the plaintiff.\nIn this action the defendants have pleaded only: 1st, Not guilty; and 2nd, that at the time of the alleged trespass the said land was the freehold of the defendants, Mary Elizabeth McConaghy and Louisa Jane McConaghy, and they justified the breaking and entering the said close in their own right, and the other defendants as their servants, and by their command.\nThe case came down for trial before Armour, J., with a jury, when two witnesses having been called, who established the act of entry of some of the defendants, such entry having been effected by the breaking the plaintiff\u2019s fence, and a third witness, one Reuben Jackson, having been called for the like purpose, namely, to prove the trespass, the defendants\u2019 counsel admitted that Jackson was there, and that he had assisted to take down the fence in question, at the instance of the defendants.\nThis admission put an end to all occasion for the plaintiff to give any further evidence, and he accord- ingly closed his case and the defendants entered upon their defence, under the plea of liberum tenementum.\nIn the course of the trial of the issue upon the plea, the learned judge, in order to enable the plaintiff to procure the exemplification of letters patent, under which the plaintiff set up title in reply to the evidence of title offered by the defendants, discharged the jury and put the case at the foot of the list, and afterwards took up the case and disposed of it as a case tried by a judge without a jury, under the provisions of the revised statutes of Ontario, ch. 50, and he rendered & verdict for the plaintiff, with thirty dollars damages.\nThe defendants moved for and obtained a rule to shew cause why this verdict should not be set aside and a non-suit or verdict for defendants entered, the latter upon the ground that the verdict was against law and evidence and the weight of evidence. The interposition of the court to enter a verdict upon this latter ground could only be invoked or justified upon the basis that the case was properly tried by the judge without a jury. Yet, in the rule, the defendants also asked to set aside the trial upon the ground that the case was improperly withdrawn from the consideration of the jury, and that the jury was improperly discharged by the learned judge who tried the cause. The Court of Common Pleas was of opinion that the discharge of the jury was an improper act of the learned judge, but that the defendants had waived all objection upon that ground, and they made the rule absolute to enter a verdict for the defendants upon the law and evidence, treating the case as one properly tried by a judge without a jury, in which case the whole action, both on the law and evidence, comes at large before the Court. From this judgment the plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which court unanimously reversed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, and restored the verdict in favor of the plaintiff which had been rendered by the learned judge who tried the cause. From this latter judgment an appeal is brought before us by the defendants, in which the sole point which arises is; Did the defendants (upon whom it is clear that the onus lay of proving their plea of liberum tenementum) establish that plea by showing a good title to the land in question, which appears to be admitted to be situate upon the south\u2011east or front of lot No. 1 in the 2nd concession of Thurlow?\nNow this plea admits such possession in the plaintiff as entitles him to recover in trespass against every one except the defendants, who, in right of the freehold estate alleged to be vested in Mary Elizabeth and Louisa Jane McConaghy, are asserted to have had a right to the immediate possession at the time they made the entry upon the plaintiff\u2019s possession which the plea admits[11].\nThe plea asserts, in fact, such a title as would enable Mary Elizabeth and Louisa Jane McConaghy to recover as plaintiffs in an action of ejectment, and to evict the plaintiff. The title thus asserted could only be established by showing a good paper title, or such a possession for 20 years as under the statute of limitations would have the effect, not only of barring the title of the true original owner, but of transferring that title by force of the statutes to the defendants Mary Elizabeth and Louisa Jane, or to some person under whom they claim. In this case the defendants showed no paper title, for although it is true that a memorial was produced of a deed poll, dated the 29th June, 1831, whereby one Alexander Chisholm purported to remise, release and quit claim to Hugh McGuire and Francis McConaghy, their heirs and assigns, the front part of lot No. 1 in the 2nd concession of the township of Thurlow, covering the land in question in this suit, and whatever might be the operation of that release as against any person claiming through Alexander Chisholm, if he had the fee simple estate in the land at the time of the execution of that release and quit claim, yet it does not appear, that in 1831 Alexander Chisholm had any title to, or estate in, the land; indeed, it is admitted now, although the releasees may at the time have believed him to have had title, that, in truth, he had none; and although, there was evidence to show, that in 1825 Alexander Chisholm had some chopping done on the land, which, however, was never cleared off, yet there was no evidence to show that he ever occupied the lot, or had any possession of it in 1831, or at any time, unless when the chopping was being done in 1825; indeed, the evidence rather shews that he had not, and that he lived in a neighboring towsnship, viz.: Sydney, of which he is described in the release. The defendants therefore could shew title in Mary Elizabeth and Louisa Jane McConaghy only by such a possession under the Statute of Limitations as would be sufficient to have vested the freehold estate of inheritance in them, or in their father, the defendant, Francis McConaghy, one of the releasees in the deed of 1831, and from whom, by deed executed in 1876, they claim, and the commencement of such possession can date no further back than the time when Francis McConaghy took possession (if ever he did take such possession as enabled the statute to operate) after the execution of the release of 1831.\nNow, by a long unbroken chain of decisions extending over a period of upwards of 40 years, it has been held by the courts in Upper Canada that the possession which will be necessary to bar the title of the true owner must be an actual, constant, visible occupation by some person or persons (it matters not, whether in privity with each other in succession or not) to the exclusion of the true owner for the full period of 20 years; and that to transfer the title to the person in possession at the expiration of the 20 years such person must claim privity with the persons preceding him in the possession during the period of 20 years, unless he himself was continuously in such possession during that period. The difference being that, while any person in possession, after the title of the true owner is barred by a possession to his exclusion for 20 years, may defend successfully an action of ejectment brought by the original owner, however short may have been the possession of such defendant, and notwithstanding his want of privity with the persons in possession during the 20 years, yet no one can recover as plaintiff in ejectment in virtue of a, title acquired by possession against the true owner for 20 years under the provisions of the statute, unless he himself alone or in privity with others in possession before him had that continous possession which was required to bar the true owner; and payment of taxes, or the committing of acts of trespass, by cutting timber from time to time, by a person not in actual, visible possession, will avail nothing towards establishing the possession which the statute requires[12].\nThe defendant Francis McConaghy admits that he never lived upon the land, nor, according to his own showing, does he appear to have entered upon the land (until within the last few years) for any purpose since the year 1835, except from time to time to take some timber off the land, and if we look to the other evidence, which is more to be relied upon than his, there seems good reason to conclude that he did not even enter for that purpose subsequently to 1838 or 1839, or perhaps 1840.\nJohn Mulquin says that he knows the lot, that he has seen McGuire and Zwick his son-in-law cultivating the lot, and that Zwick worked across the whole front of it. Witness saw McConaghy putting up a shanty on it two or three years ago.\nWilliam Dafoe says he knows the lot, that he lived for a long time on a farm a mile from it, that McGuire and Bill Morgan were in possession of it, that he has had conversations with McGuire who claimed to own it, then there was a suit, and afterwards he understood that McGuire had given it up to Mr. Ross and had taken a lease; he does not recollect; ever seeing McConaghy there. McGuire worked on the south part of the west half, and his son\u2011in\u2011law, Zwick, worked on the east half.\nCharles Wilkins has lived near the lot since 1844. He says that McGuire was in ocupation of the front part then, and from that lime until his death, (from other evidence he appears to have died 3 or 4 years before the trial of this action). Morgan was on the rear part. Witness never knew of McConaghy having been in possession; witness has known McConaghy for a great many years, he has bought cooper stuff from witness; but witness never knew him to get timber off the lot.\nWilliam Morgan lived at the rear of the lot for 12 years, 25 years ago. During that time McGuire was in possession of the front; witness was put on the lot as care-taker for Mr. Ross. He found McGuire living on the front when witness went to live on the rear. While witness lived there, McGuire, with the assistance of his son-in-law, cultivated the lot right across the front, the south end of the lot all the way across. Witness knew McConaghy, but witness never saw him at work there, nor did he ever to witness\u2019s knowledge get timber there.\nPhilip Roblin, now 60 years of age, has known the lot ever since he was a boy big enough to know anything. He lived across the road; he says:\nFor a long time we did not know that there was any one who owned it but McGuire. Then it came out that Lemoine owned it; then the Hon. John Ross. A man named Calvert cleared 15 or 20 acres in the rear, and put in fall grain and fenced it. McGuire was the only man I ever saw doing so on the front. Zwick, McGuire\u2019s son-in-law, worked with McGuire on shares. He worked the part that McGuire had fenced, and part of the east all across the front.\nWitness never knew of McConaghy chopping on it at any time, nor of his getting timber or cooper\u2019s stuff there. Witness has bought rails off the lot from a man there under Ross.\nPatrick O\u2019Hara, a defendant, has known the lot for 30 years. He did not see any person in possession of the east part. He never saw anybody working on it. It was in the same state as all commons. It was not cultivated. No person was living on the land. Land had been in dispute. Witness never saw McConaghy or any one else doing anything on it. McGuire had enclosed 10 or 12 acres on the west half. This was a witness called by defendants.\nJames Maghar, a witness also called by the defendants, says that he has known the property for forty years. That he lived then two lots away from it. He says that he does not know that he ever saw the east half cultivated. \u201cIt was,\u201d he says, \u201cgenerally what we used to term a common.\u201d He never knew of any person living on the east half. About 30 years ago he understood that Ross claimed it.\nJohn Emerson, a surveyor, surveyed the lot, and made a plan of the lot in dispute in 1845, for Mr. FitzGibbon, who was acting as attorney for Lemoine. Hugh McGuire was in possession of the front at that time. He does not recollect anybody else. He was on the lot several times, and he knew that McGuire was there all the time. He never saw any one else there except McGuire. Witness was a witness in the suit of Lemoine v. McGuire, for which suit the survey was made, and it was after that trial he says that the war began between the Hon. John Ross and McGuire.\nFrom this evidence, it is apparent that at this time, in 1845, when Emerson entered in right of Lemoine, who claimed to be seized of the land, and made his survey, there was no one then having any possession which, consistently with the authorities cited, could have ever matured into a title, by virtue of the Statute of Limitations, unless it was McGuire, and his possession lacked, in so far as appears in evidence, the first essential element to have enabled it to have ever matured into a title; for there is no evidence that the grantee of the Crown, his heirs or assigns, their servants or agents, had ever taken actual possession by residing upon or cultivating any portion of it, and it does sufficiently appear that when McGuire and Francis McConaghy entered in 1831, the land was in a state of nature. It was necessary, therefore, for McGuire, or any person claiming in privity with him, in order to acquire and establish a title to the land in virtue of 20 years\u2019 possession, as the first step, to shew that the grantee of the Crown, or some person claiming under him, while entitled to the land, had knowledge that it was in the actual possession of McGuire, or of some person in privity with him, and until such knowledge should be brought home to the person entitled to the land under the grantee of the Crown the statute would not begin to run. Of such knowledge there was no evidence whatever, so that even if Mary Elizabeth and Louisa Jane McConaghy had claimed in privity with McGuire, which they do not, they failed to show any title.\nBut further, it appears by Mr. Bell\u2019s evidence, who proves a lease executed by the Hon. Mr. Ross and McGuire in March, 1852, that an action of ejectment, which had been brought against McGuire at the suit of John Doe on the several demises of William Lemoine and Philip Zwick for the whole of the front 50 acres of this lot No. 1 and so including the land for trespass upon which this action is brought, had then recently been determined by a judgment in favor of the plaintiff upon the demise of Philip Zwick, and that a writ of possession having been issued to give effect to that judgment, McGuire surrendered possession to Ross, who had purchased all the title of Lemoine and of Zwick in the whole lot, and who thereupon executed a lease of the said front 50 acres for a year, at a rent of \u00a37 10s., to McGuire, who entered thereunder, and who continued in possession thenceforth as tenant of Ross and his assigns, the owners of the property up to McGuire\u2019s death, which occurred three or four years ago, and that until his death McGuire retained the possession as such tenant, looking after the property and protecting it from trespass and injury in lieu of rent, and that, in fact, during such possession, Mr. Bell, upon the information of McGuire, prosecuted Francis McConaghy, and had him fined for trespassing on the lot and removing gravel.\nFrom McConaghy\u2019s own evidence, it appears that he was aware of this action of ejectment having been brought, and from all the evidence it is apparent, that when it was brought McConaghy was not, nor during its pendency was he, in visible, actual occupation of the land for which it was brought, or of any part of it. The bringing of the action against the only person against whom it could be brought, namely, the person in actual, visible occupation, broke the continuity of any possession, if any there was, which could have matured into a title, and from the moment that McGuire accepted the lease from Ross and entered thereunder, such his entry was the entry of Ross, and his possession was the possession of Ross and of his assigns who, therefore, by McGuire, their tenant, have been ever since, as the evidence shows, in possession until McGuire\u2019s death; the title therefore of any person claiming title by possession must commence in virtue of a possession actual and visible taken to the exclusion of Ross and his assigns while McGuire was in possession under them or since his death[13].\nNow, title is shown in Ross and his assigns by conveyances from Lemoine and Zwick, the lessors of the plaintiff in the ejectment suit, one or other of whom was seized of the land under Letters Patent from the Crown, if ever the land has been granted by the Crown. The learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas seems to have doubted whether the description in either of the Letters Patent to Lemoine or to John Chisholm, in virtue of which letters Zwick claimed, was sufficient to cover the land in dispute, although he thought there was no doubt that the Letters Patent to Chisholm were intend-ed to cover the land; but if this doubt be well founded, it will be no better for the defendants, because, if the land has not been granted by the Crown, It is plain that the freehold title, (in assertion of which the defendants justify the trespass which they admit,) was never vested in Mary Elizabeth and Louisa Jane McConaghy, and upon the trial of the issue joined upon this plea of liberum tenemenlum (if not in them) the defendants must fail upon this record, in whomsoever the title is, for the plaintiff, being in possession, was entitled to retain that possession against all the world, except against the person having title. The notice published Oct. 89th, 1863, was spoken of as a piece of evidence supporting Francis McConaghy\u2019s alleged title by possession, but it is plain it can have no such effect. The notice purports to be signed by James McConaghy. Who he is does not appear. But not to object upon that ground, and assuming it to be signed by Francis McConaghy himself, it could make no difference, for in 1863, it is clear that Ross was in actual possession, and that he was exercising very marked acts of actual ownership. He had the land surveyed into town lots, with streets laid down across it, and was offering those lots for sale, and it was to interfere with his sales, that the notice was published. At the time, then, of its being published McConaghy, as a fact, was not in actual possession, and by the notice what he claimed was that constructive possession and right to possession, which is incident to the title which he set up, namely: \u201cby deed for valuable consideration from the nominee of the Crown since the year 1829.\u201d\nThat he had no such title is clear, and upon the whole evidence the learned judge who tried the case could not with any propriety have rendered any verdict other than in favor of the plaintiff.\nThe appeal therefore must be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG, FOURNIER and TASCHEREAU, J.J., concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for Appellants: M.A. Dixon.\nSolicitor for Respondent: W.H.

McK. is one and McM. & Co. are second.\u201d An interim receipt was issued by the company, dated 19th November, 1877, which stated the insurance to be subject to the conditions contained in and endorsed upon the printed form of policy in use by the company, one of which conditions (No. 4) stated, that if the property insured should be assigned without a written permission endorsed on the policy by an agent of the company duly authorized for such purpose, the policy should be void.\nOn the 28th November the appellant transferred the insured property to the said G. McK., in trust for his creditors, the balance, if any, to be payable to himself. The agent of the company was notified of this transfer and assented to it, stating that no notice to the company was necessary, the policy being made payable to the creditors. The property was destroyed by fire on the 15th January, 1878. The policy sued upon was dated the 12th December, 1877, but was not delivered until the morning after the fire. By it the loss was made \u201cpayable to G. McK. and McM. & Co., and others as creditors, as their interests may appear.\u201d After the fire the Inspector of the company wrote twice to McK. calling for proof of loss.\nHeld,\u2014Reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario\u2014that the notice of the trust assignment to the company\u2019s agent was sufficient, that the company must be considered as having assented to such assignment and to have executed the policy with full knowledge of it; and that such assignment was not one contemplated by the condition on the policy.\n2. That the words \u201closs payable, if any, to G. McK., &c.,\u201d operated to enable the respondents, in fulfilment of that covenant, to pay the parties named; but as they had not paid them, and the policy expressly stated the appellant to be the person with whom the contract and the respondents\u2019 covenant was made, the action for a breach of that covenant was properly brought by him alone.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas[2].\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the head note and judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. Mowat, Q.C. for appellant.\nIt is important, in this case, to consider carefully the terms and the object of the assignment and the circumstances under which it was executed by the insured. Clearly the object of the assignment was not, and the effect of it is not, to divest the appellant of all interest in the goods, but as the evidence of both McKenzie and McQueen shows, to enable the appellant to dispose of the goods and to apply the proceeds towards paying the appellant\u2019s creditors, the very men to whom the policy is made payable, the appellant still retaining an interest in the goods.\nThen also by the terms of the application the loss is made payable to \u201cGeorge McKenzie and McMaster & Co.\u201d only. The policy is made payable to \u201cGeorge McKenzie, McMaster & Co., and others, creditors\u201d of the appellant. The trust assignment makes the proceeds of the goods payable to all the creditors of the appellant, exactly in the terms of the policy, thus largely extending the number of payees mentioned in the application and in this respect differing materially from the application. From this circumstance alone the appellant contends that it is clear that, between the date of the trust assignment on the 28th November, 1877, and the date of the policy 12th December, 1877, the respondents must have had notice of the trust assignment, else how does it come that the payees in the trust assignment and the policy are identical, and both differ from the payees in the application.\nMoreover, with full knowledge of this assignment, at latest in the month of January, 1878, the respondents call on the appellant for proof of loss. Peck, the Inspector of respondents, sent McKenzie a postal card; and again, on the 13th February, 1878, and by direction of the manager wrote a letter, both communications calling for proof of the loss\u2014and all this long after the manager had full knowledge of the assignment, \u201cknowledge\u201d before the date of policy as appellant contends, or at all events \u201cknowledge\u201d before calling on appellant for proof of loss, as the manager in his evidence admits.\nAnother answer to the argument founded upon the execution of this trust deed is this, when the assignment was made the interim receipt was the only contract between the parties, the policy had not issued, the defendants were not bound to issue it at all. The appellant is not shown to have had any notice of the conditions. No evidence to show that condition 4 was one of the conditions on policies issued by respondents at the date of the interim receipt. The appellant should not be bound by conditions not made known to him, and not shown to be one of the conditions in respondent\u2019s policy when insurance effected. Fourdrinier v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co.[3] And the respondents, having held the policy until after the fire, dispensed with the necessity of endorsing the assignment on the policy. Appellant could not have this done, and it was not necessary that it should be done. Where an endorsement is required to be on a policy that assumes the issue of a policy. Parsons v. Citizens Insurance Co.[4] The want of this interest is one of the two grounds on which the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of the Common Pleas.\nIf during the currency of the policy the insured transferred his interest in the goods, but before the loss he regains it, the policy will not be void. Here the appellant transferred the goods to pay his creditors, reserving to himself the residue after paying such creditors; before the loss these creditors were paid, and whatever goods remained revested in appellant. Crozier v. Ph\u0153nix Ins. Co.[5]\nThe words \u201caliened by sale\u201d in condition 4 mean an absolute and unconditional sale, in which no interest is reserved to vendor. Here an interest is reserved in the trust deed to vendor, and he, therefore, had an interest in the property at the time of loss. Sands v. Standard Ins. Co.[6] and the cases there cited. See also Hardcastle on Statutes[7].\nAnd I may add also that condition No. 4 only refers to alienations made after the policy was issued. Here the policy is dated on the 12th Dec. 1877, but not issued to appellant until after the fire, while the alleged alienation was on the 28th Nov., 1877. The condition says: \u201cIn case any property be alienated by sale, &c., the policy shall be void,\u201d clearly implying the existence of a policy prior to the act of alienation. The condition does not say that the insurance in existence at the time of change of owner- ship under an interim receipt shall be void, but only when policy issued.\nWe have also express decisions by American courts that an assignment for benefit of creditors does not avoid a policy unless the assignment is of such a character as to deprive the debtor of all interest in a loss. Lazarus v. The Commonwealth Ins. Co.[8]\nWe also contend the evidence shows that the agent of the company had notice of the assignment. And notice to the agent is sufficient. Rome v. The London & L.F. Ins. Co.[9]\nAnd in any event, if the respondent\u2019s agent led the appellant to believe that notice of the assignment to the company was unnecessary, the company cannot now take advantage of the want of notice to them or of non-compliance with condition 4. Beebee v. The Hartford Insurance Co.[10], referred to in Herbert v. Mechanics F. Ins. Co.[11]\nHere the agent had express notice of the assignment, and when told to notify the respondent, said \u201cNotice to company not necessary,\u201d and when the agent thus misleads the insured, and tells him not to do a thing called for by the condition, the company is bound by the act of the agent. Hastings M.F. Ins. Co. v. Shannon[12]; Gore D.M.F. Ins. Co. v. Samo.[13].\nFinally I submit that R.S. of O. ch.161, sec 43, leaves it optional with the company to pay claims which are void under, and to waive objections mentioned in, sec. 41, which covers condition 4. Here the company by calling for proof of loss waived the objection now relied on, and did not exercise their option by cancelling the policy when made aware of the assignment. Smith v. Commercial Union Ins. Co.[14] The learned counsel also referred to Richards v. Liv. & London Ins. Co.[15]; Hutchinson v. Wright[16].\nMr. Foster for respondents:\nThe appellant sues upon the policy issued by the respondents, with its conditions, as a perfect and complete contract. The thirty days insurance effected by the interim receipt had expired prior to the date of the policy and the occurrence of the loss.\nIf the statements in the application are correct, they form continuing representations upon which the policy issued, and form the basis of the respondents\u2019 liability. Now, at the time of the application, there was no idea of an assignment, such as was made on the 29th Nov., 1877. The policy is the only contract upon which the appellant can succeed, and this policy includes the conditions upon which we rely, and upon a breach of which the learned Chief Justice found a verdict for the respondents. See Pim v. Reid[17]; Sillem v. Thornton[18].\nWe contend that the conditions avoid the policy, for at the time of the loss the appellant had ceased to be the owner of the property insured, and the insurance had been rendered null by the alienation. Dadman Manufacturing Co. v. Worcester[19]; Kanady v. Gore District Mut. Ins. Co.[20] Nor can it be open to the appellant to rely upon the interim contract, as he has not declared upon it. But in any event the interim contract was by its terms subject \u201cto all the conditions, rules and regulations contained in and endorsed upon the printed form of policy, in use by the company,\u201d and, if relied upon by the plaintiff, became void under the conditions mentioned. Grant v. Reliance M.F. Ins. Co.[21]; Hatton v. Beacon Ins. Co.[22] Then as to what took place between the agent and the insured, it is immaterial, as notice to the local agent of the respondents cannot bind them, because when the local agent had transmitted the application to the head office of the respondents he was functus officio.\nTo bind the respondents, notice to the chief agent, or the board of directors, was requisite. Billington v. The Provincial Insurance Company[23]; Stringham v. National Ins. Co.[24]\nAs to waiver by respondents. The policy of insurance and the conditions of the policy date from the day on which the application was signed, and to make out a case of waiver it must be proved the agent had power to waive a statutory condition. The alienation was without the knowledge, assent, permission, or ratification of the defendants, their directors, secretary, or duly authorized agent. There was no written endorsement of, or valid, authorized assent to, the alienation, or to a waiver of the conditions of the insurance: Hawke v. Niagara District,[25]; Mason v. Hartford[26]; Hendrickson v. The Queen[27]; McCrae v. Waterloo County M.F. Ins. Co.[28]; Shannon v. Gore District M.F. Ins. Co.[29]; Xenos v. Wickman[30]. There was no transfer of the insurance to the alienee.\nMr. Mowat, Q.C., in reply:\nSillem v. Thornton was overruled by Thompson v. Hopper[31] on the point relied on by respondent Moreover the variation relied upon does not apply to a cash policy, for the very words used in the whole clause show they are only applicable to a mutual policy. This company had power to issue cash policies and this was a policy of that character. RITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nThe plaintiff, being indebted to certain persons, and desiring to have his stock of goods insured, applied to defendants\u2019 agent for insurance to the amount of $2,000 for three months. \u201cLoss, if any, to be paid to his creditors, of whom George McKenzie, of Wingham, is one, and McMaster & Co., of Toronto, are second.\u201d Whereupon the said agent granted to plaintiff an interim receipt in these words:\u2014\nINTERIM RECEIPT.\nPH\u0152NIX MUTUAL FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY\u2014HEAD OFFICE, TORONTO. Provisional Receipt No. 9. Agent\u2019s Office, 19th November, 1877.\nReceived from James McQueen (Post Office), Wingham, twenty-two dollars, being the premium for an insurance to the extent of $2,000 on the property described in his application of this date, numbered 9, subject, however, to the approval of the Board of Directors in Toronto, and it is hereby declared that the property so described shall be held insured for thirty days from this date, or until notice be given that the proposal is declined, but the insurance hereby made is subject to all the conditions, rules and regulations contained in, and endorsed upon the printed form of policy in use by the Company at the date hereof.\nCash received, $18.50.\nTHOMAS HOLMES.\nN.B.\u2014In the event of the above insurance not being completed, an equivalent portion of the premium now paid will be retained for the period during which the company has been upon the risk.\nR.J.W.M.\nOn the 28th November the plaintiff, by deed, transferred, inter alia, the property so insured, to the said McKenzie, in trust to sell the said property, and out of the proceeds thereof, in the first place, to pay all costs, &c., connected with the trust, and in the second place, to pay the creditors of the plaintiff named in the schedule annexed, including the claims of McKenzie (they being all creditors of plaintiff) in proportion to their respective claims, and in the third place to pay the balance of such proceeds (if any) to the plaintiff. McKenzie and Holmes, defendants\u2019 agent, and plaintiff, give this account of the transaction:\nMcKenzie\u2019s examination resumed\u2014We went to Holmes\u2019 office and made application to have an insurance effected on the goods of McQueen; that was on the 13th November. It was to the amount of $4,000.00. Holmes said on that occasion he would put it in the Western Assurance Company; he asked how long we wished to insure, and then wanted to know the reason why we only wanted it for three months; we told him McQueen intended to run the goods off, and at the end of three months he would insure for a less amount. Then the application was made; and, shortly after, Holmes called me in, and told me the Western had accepted $2,000.00, and he was going to put the other $2,000.00 in the Ph\u0153nix; he stated he had filled up a policy. Mr. Holmes filled in the application. That is Holmes\u2019 writing; the loss is made payable to McMaster and me. Holmes filled it up, knowing that McQueen had called a meeting of creditors on the 12th November, and that the creditors insisted the goods should be insured; the agent of McMaster insisted upon the goods being insured, and if McQueen had not done it he would have done it himself. We were the largest creditors, and it was made payable to us. Nothing was said about the assignment at that time. That is, I think, about the sum and substance of it; that the creditors insisted upon having the insurance put on for their security. The application was drawn out first on the Western, on the 18th November, and this application on the 10th. Up to the making of this application nothing was said about an assignment; from the time of the application to the Western to the date of the application to the Ph\u0153nix, nothing was said. When we made the application to the Western, it was said the creditors were to get the loss; and it was still understood in putting it in the Ph\u0153nix that the payment was to be the same. I cannot say whether the interim receipt was given that day or not. From the time of the application until the time the trust deed was given Mr. McQueen went on carrying on the business\u2014up to the 28th November. I went to Mr. Holmes\u2019 office two or three times\u2014cannot say when, to a day\u2014before the deed was made, and I told Mr. Holmes that Mr. McQueen wanted to make the assignment for the benefit of his creditors; wanted this, as the creditors, some of them, were crowding him. It was intended to make the assignment to myself, in order to not go into the regular system of assignment, to save expense. I asked Holmes if he could fill a document of that kind, and he advised me to go to you\u2014Mr. Cameron. I asked Holmes on that occasion if it was necessary to notify the Insurance Company of this proposed assignment, and as I understood him, he said no, as the policy was payable to us, it was not necessary to notify them. I went to him twice on that business. One time I wished him to notify the Company, and afterwards I told him of the agreement; on which occasion I told him, I cannot say. I came to you. It was in pursuance of that arrangement I got the document prepared. When I got the document prepared, I went to Holmes and told him I had got the thing arranged; that there was an agreement drawn up between McQueen and myself, with the consent of some of the creditors. I told Holmes about it, and spoke to him about the insurance again. Either on one occasion or the other I wished him to write to the Company and tell them what had been done; he told me on one occasion there was no necessity, as the policy was payable to the creditors\u2014and I, being one, it was not necessary. McQueen was not insolvent; if he had been, this arrangement would never have been made. After the deed was signed, I went into the shop and sold goods. McQueen continued there all the while; he continued business the same as before, until the fire. I managed, and my son was the principal one. He was a clerk there and was employed by McQueen. McQueen was carrying on business all the time. There was no change whatever in the mode of carrying on the business\u2014only I took charge of the cash, they counted the cash to me, and I took charge of it. We pushed the business a little harder and tried to dispose of the goods. I got the policy from Holmes. I got it on the morning after the fire. I did not get the policy until after the fire. The policy was not handed over to either McQueen or myself until after the fire\u2014the morning after the fire. I knew nothing of the terms of the policy whatever. Neither the application or the policy were read by me or to me by any one. If the amount of the policy is paid there will be over $900.00 coming to McQueen; that is, if he succeeds in this suit, there will be over $900.00 coming to him. This is after payment of all his debts.\nCross-Examined\u2014I am the person who gave instructions for this suit. I managed this throughout under the power of Attorney annexed to the deed, and another power of Attorney was given at the time of the fire for the purpose of collecting this loss. We did not intend at the time we made application to keep up the stock. Both McQueen and I intended to reduce the stock. This was in order to satisfy the creditors. It was not arranged what was to be done afterwards. There was no amount fixed to reduce it; we intended to reduce it as much as we could in order to satisfy the pushing creditors. Mr. McQueen\u2019s lease continued for three years. We had no idea of the assignment at the time we made the application; we intended to reduce the stock. The agent ought to have known what was necessary. The amount of stock, if it had been properly taken at that time, would be $7,000.00. At the time the insurance was effected, Mr. Holmes was told to insure it for three months, and that the reason of the short date policy being asked for was that we intended to reduce the stock; that they did not wish to pay insurance on a larger stock than they were carrying. That they intended to reduce the stock, and then insure on the smaller stock. I have now got the claims of most of the other creditors\u2014nine-tenths of them. I purchased some of them at a shave. I have got about the same amount of interest as Mr. McQueen. There was some cash on hand at the time of the fire. I have got a larger interest than Mr. McQueen; it is close on a thousand dollars. There is not much difference between us. I did not see the policy in the hands of Holmes before the fire. I did not ask for it. I did not know he had that one. I knew he had the Western. I thought it necessary to notify the Company of the transfer. I thought the agent was the proper party to notify. I was not often in Toronto at that time.\nThomas Holmes\u2014I am the agent of the Ph\u0153nix at Wingham. I knew McQueen and Mackenzie. I think Mr. Mackenzie spoke to me first about the insurance. The application was made to the Western first. I think both McQueen and Mackenzie were present then. Subsequently an insurance was effected in the Ph\u0153nix for $2,000.00. Mr. Mackenzie said to me, when the Western would not take the whole, to fill up the application for the Ph\u0153nix and he would send Mr. McQueen up for it. I think it was Mr. Mackenzie who said they were going to run off the goods. I think Mr. McQueen was present then. I asked them why they did not take it for a longer period, and they told me they were going to run off the goods to pay the creditors; then they would insure for a longer period for a smaller amount. I do not know that any reason was given why they were making it payable to the creditors. Both these men told me to make it so. I do not remember that they gave any particular reason. Some time after Mr. Mackenzie had been away, and he came back and told me he had been appointed manager or assignee of McQueen\u2019s or something like that, and he asked me if that would make any difference. I think this was before I got the policy from the head office. I am not sure what answer I gave to him, but my impression is I said to him that it would not make any difference, as the loss was made payable to the creditors. I really cannot say whether Mr. Mackenzie asked me to notify the Company; I do not remember whether he did or not. I do not think he said anything further about manager or assignee. I think he was there after he told me this. I think that was the only time this matter was spoken of. I do not know that I recollect anything being said about drawing up an assignment. I have a kind of a recollection of his being at Goderich, but I am not sure. I do not recollect his asking me to draw up an assignment. After he had been away in some place, he came and told me he had been made assignee or manager. I do not recollect where he had been. I do not recollect recommending him to go to your (Mr. Cameron\u2019s) office to get the papers prepared, but it is very likely I would. In the application I took from Mackenzie the loss is payable to Mackenzie and McMaster. The loss in the policy is made payable to McQueen, McMaster and others. I do not know why that went in there; the policy is generally made the same as the application. I cannot say that I ever knew it to differ. I do not know whether in this case it differs or not. I never read the policy. I may have written them for Mackenzie as assignee or manager, but I have no recollection of it. I have no recollection of writing the company after getting the notice from the company, and before the fire. I do not remember writing any between the application for the insurance and the fire itself. I wrote them once after the fire. I do not remember what was in the letter exactly, but I remember saying I was sorry they were not settling up the claim. I do not remember saying anything in that letter about notice being given to me of the assignment. I sent one letter with the application, and, after the fire, this other letter that I have just told you of. I do not recollect of any but these two letters. There may have been a third letter written some time after, advising them to pay the loss. That is the letter I am referring to now. I am not sure whether I wrote that the day after the fire. I wrote, some considerable time after the fire, this letter I am telling you of. It is quite likely I would write to them, telling them the fire occurred. I cannot tell you the date. I do not know if I said anything in that letter about the assignment. I told them it was an honest claim and that they ought to pay it. That is all I remember.\nCross-examined\u2014My powers were to take applications and to forward them to Toronto, and to give interim receipts. I was agent, and had whatever powers that gave me.\nRe-examined\u2014There might be other agents there for anything I knew. I do not remember of giving any notice of any change in the risk. The Company has not been in operation very long, I think, over a year. I do not recollect of any change being made in the risk I took. I never took many risks for this Company.\nExamination of plaintiff under order:\u2014\nBy virtue of an order of this Honourable Court, made herein under \u201cThe Administration of Justice Act,\u201d bearing date the 26th day of September, A.D., 1878, and hereunto annexed, directing the examination, on oath, of said plaintiff before me under said Act, at such time and place as should be appointed by me in writing endorsed on said order, I did in pursuance of said order appoint Tuesday, the eighth day of October, A.D., 1878, at ten o\u2019clock in the forenoon at my chambers in the court house, in the town of Goderich, for such examination, at which time and place the said plaintiff did attend, and having been duly sworn said as follows: I am the plaintiff. I had been in business before. I effected this insurance a little over a year. I came to Wingham 4th October, 1876. I bought out McKenzie\u2019s stock and rented his store. The stock was taken by me, McKenzie and his son before I bought. It was valued at something over $6,000. I paid $5,560 for the stock. We took stock again about 1st November, 1877. Mr. McKenzie assisted me in this. I entered it in the stock book then. It was burnt I suppose. There was a safe there at the time of the fire. At the time of the fire there was nothing but the lost stock book and the cash book in the safe. I had finished stock-taking at time I made this insurance. At the time I made the insurance, 19th November, 1877, I was considerably in debt. McKenzie and I had not at that time any condition as to going out of business. Mr. Holmes took my application. It was some time before I received any policy. He gave me a receipt for the money I paid at the time of the application. I had it up to the time of the fire. I read it through. It wasn\u2019t a printed form. I believe it is destroyed by fire now. I paid Holmes the cash he asked. At that time we were doing a nice business. I think Holmes went over the premises when he took the application. He asked me some questions, but I can\u2019t say what. I knew the kind of business carried on next door. After I made the application, I made an agreement with Mr. McKenzie, now produced marked \u201cA.\u201d I remember all about the agreement. There had been no condition between us as to such an agreement before I made the application. It was at the time of the agreement the condition occurred. He went on selling off. He was taken in to take care of the cash. The business went on in that way up to 15th January. The stock was then reduced. I intended leaving the place as soon as I got everything sold off, and my creditors paid off. The arrangement was made to secure McKenzie and the other creditors. Most of our sales were cash sales, but there were not many credit sales. The books shewing the credit sales were destroyed by fire. We bought no stock after this arrangement was made. I don\u2019t know how the fire took place. It occurred between one and two o\u2019clock. The first notice I had of it was when I got up to attend to my little girl and I saw some smoke in the room, and I then went to the room where we kept a stove and saw the fire was out there, and then I got hold of my wife and child and carried them out. There was then no fire in my place. I went out by the back of my house and saw the fire coming out of the hardware store next door. They kept some coal oil next door. I couldn\u2019t tell how much. There was a place back in the yard where they kept coal oil. I couldn\u2019t say in what part of the hardware store they kept coal oil. Mr. McKenzie carried on the business with me at the time of the fire. His son had been with me all along, and was with me when the fire occurred. Mr. Holmes handed me my policy. I had no connection with Holmes from the time I made the application till I got the policy. From the time I got the policy and the fire Holmes and I had no conversation about it. At the time he gave me the policy nothing was said. He just handed it to me. I didn\u2019t write to Holmes at any time. I never sent any letter to the company before the fire. The signature to the proof of loss, now produced marked B, is mine. The signature to the paper produced marked \u201cC,\u201d is Mr. McKenzie\u2019s. I can\u2019t say, I am sure, why I didn\u2019t tell the company of the arrangement with Mr. McKenzie when I made the application. I thought there was plenty there to pay every man. After I made the arrangement with McKenzie I began to reduce the stock, and had no intention of increasing it. I intended to sell off. I gave no notice to Holmes of my arrangement with McKenzie, nor did I authorize any one to do so, nor have I any reason to believe any other person gave such notice. At the time of the fire I suppose my liabilities were somewhere between $2,000 and $3,000. We arrived at the credit sales, after the loss, from what we knew of them in round figures. The cash sales were something over $700. The stock book we last used was not the same one that we used when I purchased. It\u2019s a new stock book. The old one was destroyed by the fire. At the last stock-taking we put down the goods at less than invoice price. Some of the stock destroyed had been in hand since the purchase. I was also insured in the Western. I valued stock at the time of fire, at $4,354.91. It was because he was there to look after things, that I stated in my application that I was the bona fide owner.\nCross-examined\u2014The valuation of stock at time of fire was based on the last stock\u2011taking. Because the stock was taken at a reduced figure the amount at the time of the fire would be much larger. We add usually more than 20 per cent. to actual cost price to cover profits, carriage, &c. When I made this valuation I honest- ly believe it was correct. Our sales were mostly cash, and very little credit from the beginning. I believe the amount of debt due me from beginning to time of fire was $288. There might have been a few dollars of this incurred after the last stock-taking. I think in the cash book no distinction was made between cash received on sales and cash received on debts due from the beginning. The cash received for sales made before last stock-taking would be about the same as the amount of credit sales after last stock\u2011taking. We arrived at amount of stock at the time of fire by deducting from the amount at last stock-taking the cash sales, less 10 per cent., and the value of goods saved. I never saw the policy before the fire. When I made the application I told Holmes that McKenzie and McMaster & Co. had a claim against me. I told him the insurance was for the benefit of my creditors. The agreement marked \u201cA\u201d was subsequently made to carry out the intention I expressed to Holmes. Thomas Holmes filled out this application for me; I did nothing but sign it. He read it over to me. I applied to Holmes first for an insurance on the whole, and he put the half in the Ph\u0153nix of his own notion. It was read over to see if it was right for the benefit of my creditors. [Mr. Cameron proposed to ask, \u201cwhen you stated in application the average value of your stock at $6,000 did you mean before the application?\u201d and I refuse to admit it.] The reason why I did not afterwards mention the agreement marked. \u201cA\u201d was because I thought it was sufficiently mentioned in the application. I don\u2019t know whether I ever saw the inspector before now. The papers for proof of loss were first sent to Mr. McKenzie. I remember getting papers from the inspector to have proof made in my name at the time of the application and after I was really owner of the goods, subject to the claims of McKenzie and others. I never ceased carrying on the business up to the time of the fire. I had the general management of the business all the time. McKenzie was helping me to sell. There was no change in the books, or accounts. I took home the goods that were saved. At the time of the agreement I was indebted, but I had enough to pay everybody in full, but I wanted Mackenzie in to help me. Holmes lives near me.\nRe-Cross-Examined\u2014According to the way it was done the Western would only take $2,000 on the stock. Mr. Holmes didn\u2019t tell me why application was made in the Ph\u0153nix. I gave Mr. Holmes the information contained in the application. I mean the answers to the questions. I mentioned to Holmes that loss was to be payable to my creditors. Up to that time I had not spoken to McKenzie about it. At the time of the application my creditors had been pressing me. Mr. McKenzie was pressing me. I myself suggested the agreement with McKenzie, and the agreement was drawn up by a lawyer. I didn\u2019t explain any of my business difficulties to Holmes. I only told Holmes, McKenzie and others were creditors.\nJAMES MCQUEEN.\nTaken and signed before me this 8th October, 1878.\nW.R. SQUIER, EXR.\nA fire occurred which destroyed the property insured on the 15th January, 1878; the policy, which was dated the 12th December, 1877, was not delivered until the morning after the fire. After the loss on the 30th of January, 1878, the inspector of the defendants wrote McKenzie as follows:\u2014\nPOST CARD.\nGeo. McKenzie, Esq., Wingham, Ont.\nToronto, Jan. 30th, 1878.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014Yours of the 24th inst. to hand, and in reply would say Mr. McQueen has been sent claim papers to be filled in, and as the policy has not been assigned to any one, he is the only one that can make out such papers; of course when the amount of damage is settled, the parties named in the application have a right to receive the same.\nI am, yours, &c.,\nOGLE R. PECK,\nInspector.\nAnd on the 13th January, 1878, he agrees with McKenzie as follows:\u2014\nLETTER.\nGeo. McKenzie, Esq.\nToronto, 13th February, 1878.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014I would like to have all the information possible to lay before the Board at its next meeting in reference to the McQueen claim. Will you kindly let me know who were McQueen\u2019 s creditors at the time the fire occurred, and what was the amount of their respective claims. As vouchers for correctness of prices at stock-taking, the Board will probably require duplicate invoices of stock, which you had better have ready.\nRespectfully yours,\nOGLE R. PECK,\nInspector. The manager says: \u201cI presume that was written by my authority.\u201d\nIt is now claimed that the loss cannot be recovered on account of the transfer to McKenzie, and because it is alleged no notice was given of it to the company; and if entitled to recover, the plaintiff is only entitled to recover to the extent of his own interest.\nAs to the first, the interim receipt was granted with full knowledge by the agent of defendants that the insurance was for the security of plaintiff\u2019s creditors as well as himself. He was informed and consulted as to the transfer and the notification thereof to the company, and McKenzie says: \u201cWhen he wished the agent to write to the company and tell them what had been done, he told him (McKenzie) there was no necessity, as the policy was payable to the creditors and I being one it was not necessary,\u201d and after the fire, from the letters of the inspector, the liability, if not in express terms admitted, certainly was inferentially recognized.\nIt is not at all to be wondered at that the agent treated the information as immaterial to be communicated, for in substance and reality there was no change in the position of matters, as between the plaintiff and defendants, and no new parties were introduced into the transaction. Had the plaintiff made an assignment whereby he had parted with his interest in the property, the case would have been very different. Though he transferred the legal title in the goods to McKenzie, the real pecuniary interest of neither him nor McKenzie was altered. As insured by the interim receipt, if the goods were destroyed by fire the creditors would receive their payment, and plaintiff so be relieved from his indebtedness, and plaintiff would receive the surplus; if the goods had not been insured the whole loss would fall on plaintiff, as he would lose his goods and still have to discharge his indebtedness to his creditors; so, though the assignment was made to McKenzie, if the goods were destroyed without insurance, plaintiff would be in the same position, and if destroyed, as they were, the result is just the same as if destroyed after interim receipt given and before assignment, for McKenzie and creditors will be entitled to receive only what is due them, and plaintiff will get the surplus. So that, as plaintiff was at the time of the making of the interim receipt interested to the whole value of the property and to the full amount assured in case of loss, so was he interested after the assignment and at the time of the loss. And so the creditors were in like manner interested in the insurance under the interim receipt in case of loss, and under the assignment and policy, but not to any other or greater or less extent, the only change in the position of the parties being that the legal title of the property was, after the assignment, in McKenzie in trust for the creditors and plaintiff, instead of the legal title being in plaintiff for the benefit of the creditors and himself, the equitable and beneficial interests of both plaintiff and creditors being at time of interim receipt and continuing till time of loss the same. I think it is not open to defendants, after what took place between plaintiff, McKenzie and the defendants, by and through their agent, and after having, after the loss, handed over the policy, and subsequently, through their inspector, after knowledge of the assignment, recognized the claim as valid and apparently only desired to be satisfied as to the amount, now to dispute it; and as to plaintiff only recovering what may after payment of the creditors be coming to him, what I have already said shows he had an insurable interest in the whole value of the goods. All matters connected with the transaction, both before the interim receipt and after, and before the date and issuing of the policy and its delivery as a valid and binding instalment, were fully and truthfully com- municated to the agent authorized by the company to effect the insurance. In fact, all was done under his advice and subject to his directions. He was the party, as agent for defendants, in immediate communication with the assured, and the assured through him with the defendants. I think he must be assumed to have been furnished by his principals with all necessary information to enable him to deal in a proper manner with the parties who the company, through him, sought to get to insure with them.\nTo him the assured most naturally would and did apply, and on the information furnished by him the assured acted, and he well knowing that in fact the interest of the parties remained the same, and that there was no substantial change in the position of the property or the parties in reference thereto, the change being, in truth, merely to keep the property in the position it was, so that it might not be seized by any one creditor, but be held for the benefit of all, and they get the benefit of the insurance money in case of loss, as was contemplated when the original application was made in other words, simply to secure the continuance of the arrangement as to the insurance for the benefit alike of the creditors and the assured, and without in any way increasing the liability of the insurers. The company, through him, their agent, did not treat the transfer in this case as an \u201calienation by sale, insolvency or otherwise,\u201d and, therefore, not such a transfer as was contemplated by the conditions of the statute, and so not in this case a transfer of a character to affect their position as insurers, or in anyway to change the risk or increase their liability, and, therefore, not necessary to be communicated in writing to the company or endorsed on the policy, which, in fact, could not be done. Therefore in view of what took place between the assured and the company thro\u2019 their agent, and the delivery of the policy after the loss without objection, and the conduct of the company, thro\u2019 their officers, in inferentially recognizing and admitting their liability after the loss and after knowledge of the assignment, desiring only to be satisfied as to the amount, was a full ratification of all that had been done by the agent, I think, now to permit the company to ignore the knowledge and conduct of their agent and officers (all which I think we must assume was within the scope of their authority) and to repudiate all they wrote and said and did, and so to deny successfully their liability under such circumstances, would be, in my opinion, to allow them, with the sanction of a court of justice, to evade payment of what their agent, cognizant of all the circumstances and who acted for them throughout, says is an honest claim, and would be thereby to assist them in perpetrating a gross fraud on an innocent party, who dealt with them through their agent and officers in a frank, truthful and straightforward manner.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs in this court and in the Court of Appeal, and the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas affirmed, except so much requiring the plaintiff to produce and file the releases by said judgment required to be produced by the plaintiff.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI concur with Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThe discussion of the points in this case took a wider range than, in my opinion, was necessary to determine the rights of the parties to be affected by our judgment.\nThe action was brought to recover two thousand dollars, insured upon goods of the appellant by a policy issued by the respondent\u2019s company, dated the twelfth of December, 1877, but not delivered to the appellant till after the loss, which occurred by fire on the fifteenth of January, 1878. The declaration sets out the policy with the statutory conditions applicable to the points in issue, and \u201cvariations in conditions applicable to mutual insurances\u201d and \u201cadditional conditions.\u201d In it the appellant avers that after making application for this insurance, and some time before the fire, he made an assignment in trust to one George McKenzie of the goods insured (he having then a contract of insurance upon them in the shape of what is called an interim receipt) to sell the goods to pay:\u20141st, the costs of the execution of the trust; 2nd, to pay himself and the other creditors of the appellant the amounts due to them, or if insufficient for that purpose, to divide the trust fund amongst them in proportion to their respective claims; and, in the third place, to pay the balance of the trust fund, if any, to the appellant; that at the time of the loss the property assigned was more than sufficient to pay his creditors, and a surplus was afterwards coming to him out of the property so insured; that at the time of the making of the policy the respondents were aware of the assignment in trust; and that the creditors were interested in the insured property, of which, at the time, the respondents had due notice; that the plaintiff and the creditors were so interested when the loss occurred; and assigned a breach for non-payment of the amount insured either to the appellant or the creditors referred to in the policy, and to whom the loss, if any, was made payable.\nTo this declaration seven pleas were put in.\nThe first one requiring notice is the third. It alleges that the appellant \u201cwas not, at the time of the alleged loss, interested in the said dry goods, groceries, boots and shoes, as alleged.\u201d\nThat plea is put in as an answer to the whole claim of the appellant. It must be sufficient to defeat the whole claim, or it is not an answer at all. If, therefore, the appellant at the time of the loss had any insurable interest in the goods covered by the policy, our judgment must be for him. The evidence shows that the appellant was the owner of the goods in question, which formed the stock of a business then being carried on by him. Being in solvent circumstances, but behind hand in meeting promptly the bills of some of his creditors, and to secure them, he made, on the 28th of November (some days after his application for the insurance), the assignment in trust referred to and in part recited in the declaration. It would be, I think, an unnecessary waste of language to prove, that by such an assignment the appellant did not part with his whole interest; but afterwards had, as cestui-que-trust, a valid insurable interest. I will have occasion hereafter to refer more particularly to this subject when dealing with the defence under other pleas, and feel it quite enough to say at present that the third plea is not an answer to the appellant\u2019s claim or the declaration setting it out.\nThere is not the slighest pretence that there is any evidence to sustain the fourth plea, that the appellant made a false and fraudulent account of the loss.\nThe 5th plea alleges the making of the application, and that the appellant therein represented, amongst other things, that the goods were not encumbered by mortgage or otherwise; that the value of his average stock was six thousand dollars; that the appellant therein declared the statements in the application were a just and true exposition of all the facts, &c., in regard to the condition, situation, value and risk of the property to be insured, so far as the same was known to him; and agreed that the same should be held to form the basis of the liabilities of the respondents; that the policy was effected upon those representations; that after the application, and before the making of the policy, to wit, on the 28th of November, the appellant assigned the insured property to one George McKenzie, in trust to sell the same and apply the moneys to arise from such sale in the manner set forth in the declaration, and put McKenzie in possession of the goods; that the plaintiff then ceased to carry on business or keep his stock in trade up to an average value of six thousand dollars; that it was material to be made known to them (the insurers) that the appellant had so assigned and transferred the property and had ceased to cary on business or keep his average stock up to the value of six thousand dollars, in order to enable them to estimate the risk, but (and here is the gravamen of the charge and upon which the defence is rested.)\nThat the plaintiff, fraudulently and deceitfully, and with intent to induce the defendants to effect the said policy, concealed from the defendants the fact that he had so assigned, transferred and set over the said property to the said George McKenzie, and delivered possession thereof, and had ceased to carry on business, or to keep up the general average value of his stock, and did not give the defendants, or their local agent, any notice thereof, by reason of which concealment the defendants aver the said policy was and is void.\nI have had no little difficulty in determining whether the alleged concealment is by the plea made applicable to the time of the application, or to a concealment of the transfer between the time of the application and the making of the policy, and I cannot even now congratulate myself upon having arrived at a proper conclusion as to what was intended. Some parts of the plea could only apply to a concealment at the time of the application, but that again is wholly inconsistent with other parts of it, and with the acknowledged facts, and is in its nature impossible, for there could be no concealment at time of the application of what had not then taken place. If applicable at all, it can only be an alleged concealment of the subsequent assignment between the time of its execution and the making of the policy. How the failure to give notice of the assignment (if such were the case) can be called a fraudulent or deceitful concealment, I am wholly at a loss to discover. The plea shows that there is no ground for imputing any concealment when the application was made. The application being then correct and unassailable, the policy might be avoided for other reasons, but certainly not for those set out in the plea. But the plea rests the defence under it on the further ground that the appellant \u201cdid not give to the defendants or their local agent\u201d any notice of the assignment and other things therein mentioned, but the evidence shows the local agent knew all about it. He was consulted before it was made, and agreed to it, and knew of it several days before the policy was issued.\nI will conclude my remarks as to that plea briefly thus: In the first place, it raises no material issue, nor does it contain a sufficient answer. 2nd. It is untrue, when charging the appellant with any fraudulent or deceitful concealment, and it is equally untrue in the statement that he did not give the respondents or their local agent notice of the assignment when made. The evidence shows the very opposite. 3rd. I think the plea is bad for the reason that the assignment was not of that nature, that in this case rendered any notice of it necessary. The appellant, it is true, by the assigment changed the nature of his interest, but he still retained such an interest as would be considered an insurable one for the whole value of the property; and if his application had been made after the assignment, his right to insure and recover on a policy would have been in law the same as it had been previous to it. If, indeed, the appellant stated in his application that he was the sole owner, so as to negative the fact of a trust assignment, the case might be different, and the assignment and a change of possession, if shown, might be reasonably considered as circumstances necessary to be communicated in the application, and if made after the issue of the policy to the applicant, it might require the written assent of the Company. I have, however, looked carefully at the application and, strange to say, although apparently stated, in reality it is not, that the appellant was the owner of the goods. The first question to be answered by the applicant relates to landed property, and is so answered. The 2nd, \u201cIs applicant owner of property insured? If not, give owner\u2019s name.\u201d The answer is: \u201cThe owner, Geo. McKenzie,\u2014applicant is tenant.\u201d The 3rd question, \u201cName of tenant or occupant?\u201d Answer \u201cJames McQueen.\u201d These are the only questions and answers in any way relating to the ownership of the goods, if even they do, which I think is not the case. The three questions read seriatim are calculated to impress the idea that the second did not refer to landed property. It is seldom, if ever, such a question would be asked as to goods; but owing to mortgages, &c., it is more necessary to ask such about landed property. The question is followed by the direction \u201cIf not, give owner\u2019s name,\u201d and that immediately followed by requiring the \u201cname of tenant or occupant,\u201d shows clearly that question number two was originally, at all events, intended to enquire as to landed property. The application was filled in by Holmes, the local agent of the respondents, and he, as their agent, and acting for them, wrote an answer to question number two as applicable to landed property. The result is, that if the question was intended to ascertain the owner of the goods, it failed in its object; and under the circumstances the appellant cannot be said to have represented himself as the owner of goods wholly unencumbered. If a mistake in this respect was really made in the filling up of the application by the respondents through their agent, the appellant is not answerable. The agent, in his evidence, says: \u201cMy powers were to take applications and to forward them to Toronto, and give interim receipts. I was agent, and had whatever powers that gave me.\u201d Some fire insurance companies provide against their liability through the mistake or wrongful act of any of their local agents, and the policies provide that if an application be filled up by such agent it will be deemed the act of the applicant. There is no such provision in this policy, and in such a case I must look at the act of the agent here as that of his principal. He had authority over the whole subject-matter up to the receipt of the premium and the granting of the interim receipt, and, as I hold, he was the proper recipient of a requisite notice of any change up to the making of the policy. Under the circumstances, I think no notice of the change was necessary, but if it were, I think that given to the agent was sufficient. If the manager of the company looked carefully, as it was his duty to do, at the answers given to the printed questions, he could not have failed to discover the mistake (if it was one) of the agent in filling up that to question number two. By not doing so, and by not seeking for further information as to the ownership of the goods before issuing the policy, the company is now estopped from saying that the appellant made any false representation whatever as to such ownership.\nThe sixth plea alleges the application and payment of the premium and the issue of the interim receipt which it recites: that the receipt constituted an insur- ance for thirty days unless sooner cancelled, \u201csubject to all the conditions, rules and regulations in and endorsed upon the printed form of policy in use by the defendants at the date thereof;\u201d that the receipt was not cancelled, but the same was in force, to wit, on the 12th of December, 1877, \u201cwhen the defendants executed and delivered the policy in the declaration mentioned\u201d; that the conditions, rules and regulations set out in the declaration are the same as those referred to in the interim receipt; that the appellant, at the time of the application, was the legal and equitable owner of the insured property; but that, while the same was covered by the interim receipt, he made the assignment referred to in the declaration,\nWithout the written permission endorsed on the policy by an agent of the defendants duly authorized for that purpose, as required by the condition endorsed on the said policy, and without the knowledge and consent of the defendants.\nHad the appellant\u2019s right of action been founded on an insurance contract, which at one time existed, under the interim receipt and no policy issued, I could understand a contention that a transfer of the property which would have left no interest in the insured at the time of the loss would prevent the recovery of the amount covered by it; and the same principle is equally applicable when the insurance was by a policy. We are, however, not called upon to say anything as to the effect of the conditions as applicable to an interim receipt. By the terms of it and by the tacit and understood agreement of the parties, that was only to be in force till a policy should be issued, and that when issued the parties were to be governed by it alone. The interim receipt was only for an insurance in the meantime. The policy by express words related back to the time of the application, and was in all respects a substitution for the interim receipt. The question then is not, whether the appellant forfeited his insurance under the interim receipt, for that is not the issue, but did he forfeit it under the subsequent policy? To plead to the action on the policy what is stated to be a defence under the interim receipt would be a departure, would raise an immaterial issue and be therefore no defence. How then does the condition (No. 4) operate in regard to the interim receipt, is a question that may be asked; and my answer is that in consequence of the pecular wording of it it may, as I think it is, be wholy inapplicable. The condition is that license to assign must be \u201cendorsed hereon.\u201d Until a policy exists it is impossible to endorse anything upon it. The condition is therefore only inapplicable to an interim receipt; and if no policy issued, and an action were brought on an interim receipt, I should have great difficulty in deciding that the condition formed a part of the contract. The undertaking of the insured amounts to this, \u201cshould a policy be hereafter issued on my application, I hereby agree to make no assignment of the property without a written permission endorsed thereon.\u201d The defence therefore, as I think, could not be set up to an action on the interim receipt. It may be considered inequitable to rule so, but it must be remembered this is but a technical objection to a large extent, and where such are raised they should be clearly provided for, and companies should either make contracts of their own drawing plain, or take the consequences of all ambiguities or defects. I think that condition No. 4 refers to an assignment subsequent to the policy, and not to one subsequent to the application and before the making of the policy which is the case here.\nThe seventh and only remaining plea alleges, that at the time of the sealing and delivery of the policy and loss, the property was owned by one George McKenzie, As set out in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, and the interest of the plaintiff in the said property was not stated in or upon the said policy as required by the said statutory condition in that behalf endorsed on the said policy as required.\nThe answer to the defence set up by the latter plea is, first, that the property was not owned by McKenzie, as evidenced by the declaration and the assignment therein recited, at any time up to the loss, so as denude the assured of his insurable interest; and secondly, that by the wording of the condition it does not apply to an assignment previous to the policy.\nThe 4th statutory condition, respecting which we have heard so much, is after all to a great extent the same as the law otherwise prescribes. By the latter no one can recover on a fire insurance policy unless he has an interest at the time of the loss. If a party insured property and subsequently assigned it, but got it back before the loss, he could recover. The conditions generally annexed to policies and the statutory conditions provide otherwise. They, however, provide that, if the company in a particular manner manifest their assent, the insurance still remains notwithstanding the assignment, and, in case of loss, the interested party will be indemnified up to the amount insured. In some cases this is secured by an assignment of the policy with the assent of the company. Such an arrangement dispenses with the necessity of a new policy and enables the purchaser to appropriate for his own benefit, what he otherwise would not have, the policy of the seller. Where the whole interest in insured property is assigned, a case arises wherein it is necessary, for the object just mentioned, to obtain the assent of the company, the object being, as the seller\u2019s interest in the policy will be terminable by a sale and transfer, to enable the purchaser to get the benefit of the unexpired term, and in case of loss to recover the insurance. Such then I take to be the object and intention of the condition in question annexed to policies. The assignment contemplated I take to be one by which the assignor divests himself of all title and interest. The words are: \u201cIf the property is assigned,\u201d\u2014which means wholly transferred. It is not prohibitory of the assignment of an interest as security by way of a chattel mortgage or otherwise, where the resulting beneficial interest remains; or to a conveyance made to enable a party to sell and convey property for the use and benefit of the party making it. It is admittedly good law that an equitable interest is sufficient, and this court unanimously lately so held in the case of Clark v. The Scottish Imperial Insurance Company[32]. In that case the plaintiff had but an equitable lien without any possession of the subject\u2011matter, but the authorities justified our judgment. In this case the appellant always retained an insurable interest to the extent of the whole value of the property, and also the possession in the same building. He, it is true, made an assignment to McKenzie, but it was for special objects\u2014first to sell the property, then to apply proceeds to pay the creditors of the appellant and to pay any remaining balance to him, the appellant. That assignment was not irrevocable. The assignor, by paying otherwise his creditors, or, in certain events, without doing so, might call for a re-assignment. None of the creditors, except McKenzie, had any vested interest, for thereis nothing to shew their acceptance of the assignment or agreement to be bound by it, and the latter was under no obligation to them to execute the trust. They were not bound in any way to agree to the assignment or to the terms contained in it. If McKenzie executed the trust they might of course adopt the assignment so far as to claim from him payment according to their several interests, but up to the loss the assignment was one to a great extent between the appellant and McKenzie only[33]. The appellant was interested throughout. He was not insolvent, and is shown to be entitled to $900 after providing for the payment of all his creditors\u2019 demands, if he recovers in this suit. Nothing could more pointedly show his continuing interest in the insured property.\nI regret to have been obliged to go so much into detail in this matter, but as differences of opinion have been expressed by several of the learned judges of the courts in Ontario in regard to some of the points in issue in this and other cases, I have thought it but right to give my views at length in regard to those involved in our decision. According to my best judgment the appellant is legally entitled to succeed, and I think the appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario reversed, and that of the Court of Common Pleas affirmed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J., concurred.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nIn the view which I take of this case, it raises no question, whether the Ontario Statute, known as \u201cThe Fire Insurance Policy Act of 1876,\u201d is or not ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature; nor whether the provisions of that statute, assuming it not to be ultra vires, apply to an insurance effected through the medium of what is known as an \u201cinterim receipt;\u201d nor can the fact, that the plaintiff had been temporarily insured through the medium of such an \u201cinterim receipt,\u201d before the execution by the defendants of the policy which is declared upon, be at all invoked to the prejudice of the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover upon the policy declared upon, which is duly executed under the common seal of the defendants.\nThe case went down for trial before a judge without a jury, under the provisions on that behalf contained in ch. 50 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario. The learned judge who tried the cause, after hearing all the evidence on both sides, entered a formal verdict for the defendants, reserving to the plaintiff leave to move the court in which the action was pending to enter a verdict for him for the sum of $2050, if the court should be of opinion that, upon the whole evidence, the plaintiff ought to recover; and it was agreed that to give effect to this reservation all amendments that might be necessary should be made. This reservation was plainly made in view of the provisions contained in sections 7 and 8 of ch. 49 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, which enacted that no proceeding at law or equity should be defeated by any formal objection, but that at any time during the progress of any action, suit, or other proceeding at law or in equity, the court or a judge may, upon the application of any of the parties, or without any such application, make all such amendments as may seem necessary for the advancement of justice, the prevention and redress of fraud, the determining of the rights and interests of the respective parties and of the real question in controversy between them, and best calculated to secure the giving of judgment according to the very right and justice of the case.\nNow, the effect of this reservation accompanying the verdict was to impose upon the Court in which the action was pending the duty of determining the rights of the parties upon the real question in controversy between them, upon a view of the evidence alone, and to say whether or not, upon such view of the evidence, the plaintiff was entitled to recover, with this provision added, that his right should not be defeated by any formal objection, but that if the issues joined were not such, having regard to the evidence, as sufficiently to raise the very point in controversy, the Court should amend the pleadings, nunc pro tunc, so as to make them conform to the evidence, or might render such judgment as the evidence warranted, irrespective of the issues as joined, in case there should prove to be any defect or informality in those issues, or that these were not appropriately framed, having regard to the evidence.\nThe short material substance of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration is, that before effecting the insurance of the goods mentioned in the policy declared upon, which is dated the 12th day of Dec., 1877, to wit on the 28th Nov., 1877, he assigned the goods to one George McKenzie in trust to sell, and out of the proceeds thereof in the first place to pay all expenses, &c., attending the trust, and in the second place to pay the creditors of the plaintiff, and among others the said George McKenzie, McMaster & Co., and others, who were then creditors of the plaintiff, the amounts due to them, and in case the said trust fund should not be enough to pay the said creditors in full, then to pay them such trust fund in proportion to their respective claims; and, in the third place, to pay the balance of such trust fund to the plaintiff; and the plaintiff averred that at the time of the making by the said defendants of the said policy the defendants were aware of the said trust assignment as aforesaid, and that the said George McKenzie, the said McMaster & Company and others, the creditors of the plaintiff, were interested in the said property so insured as aforesaid, and the said defendants at the time aforesaid had due notice thereof. And further, that the plaintiff and the said George McKenzie, the said McMaster & Company and others, the creditors of the plaintiff, continued interested in the property so insured by the defendants until the loss by fire stated in the declaration. Yet the defendants did not make good the said loss or damage so sustained or any part thereof, and did not pay to the plaintiff, nor to the said George McKenzie, McMaster and Company and others, or either of them, the said loss or any part thereof, to the plaintiff\u2019s damage of $3,000. The real point in controversy between the parties appears to have been, was it or not true, as alleged in the declaration, that at the time of the making of the policy declared upon the defendants were aware of the trust assignment stated in the declaration? The defendants, however, pleaded several pleas in bar of the plaintiff\u2019s action.\n1st. Non est factum\u2014this plea was disproved.\n2nd. That the goods insured were not destroyed by fire as alleged, this was also disproved.\n3rd. That the plaintiff was not at the time of the loss interested in the said goods, as alleged in his declaration. This plea was also disproved, for it appeared that the plaintiff\u2019s interest at the time of the loss was just the same as it was at the date of the policy.\n4th. That after the loss the plaintiff delivered to the defendants a false and fraudulent account of the alleged loss and damage, in which (among other things) he stated that he was the bon\u00e2 fide owner of the property stated to be destroyed, holding the same as stated in the policy, and that no other person or person had any interest legal or equitable in the said property, excepting as mentioned in the said policy, whereas the plaintiff before the happening of the said loss without the knowledge or permission of the defendants had assigned, transferred and set over to one George McKenzie the said property in the said policy mentioned, in trust to sell the same and to apply the monies arising from such sale in the manner mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration.\nThe defendants could scarcely have expected to have succeeded in establishing a statement to be false and fraudulent, which, assuming it to have been made, was made in the belief, which the evidence warrants the conclusion that the plaintiff entertained, that the words in the policy whereby the defendants covenanted with the plaintiff: \u201cThat the loss, if any, should be payable to George McKenzie, of Wingham, and McMaster & Co., and others as creditors, as their interest may appear,\u201d were inserted therein for the purpose of expressing the true nature of the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the property, especially if, as is alleged by the plaintiff in his declaration, the precise nature of the plaintiff\u2019s interest, and the fact of the execution of the trust assignment, by which alone McKenzie, McMaster & Co., and others, the creditors of plaintiff, acquired any interest, was communicated to the defendants before they granted the policy sued upon, in which case, if the policy did not sufficiently express plaintiff\u2019s interest according to the fact, it was the defendants own fault: however, a verdict upon this issue had necessarily to be rendered in favour of the plaintiff, for the defendants do not appear to have offered any evidence in support of this plea, or to have relied upon any such false or fraudulent account of loss as is alleged in the plea.\nThe 5th plea, after averring that on the 19th Nov., 1877, the plaintiff made a written application for insurance, which he agreed should form the basis of the defendants\u2019 liability, in which he represented the goods to be unincumbered and that the value of his average stock was $6,000, and that the defendants executed the policy sued upon on the faith of the representations contained in the said application, alleges, by way of defence to the action, that on the 28th Nov., 1877, the plaintiff executed the trust assignment in the declaration mentioned and ceased to carry on business and to keep his stock up to an average value of $6,000, and the defendants say that the plaintiff fraudulently and deceitfully, and with intent to induce the defendants to effect the policy, concealed from the defendants the fact that he had so assigned the said property to McKenzie and had delivered possession thereof, and had ceased to carry on business, or to keep up the general average value of his stock as aforesaid, and did not give the defendants, or their local agent, any notice thereof, by reason of which concealment the defendants aver that the policy is void.\nAs to this plea, it is to be observed, in the first place, that the policy does not import into it anything contained in the written application referred to in this plea. If the insurers desire to make the contents of the application, or any part thereof, part of the policy, such part should be introduced into the policy; they may elect to make such part of the application as they please part of the policy by introducing it into the policy; or they may exclude the whole from the policy by omitting to introduce any part into it[34].\nThere was nothing then in this policy which required the plaintiff to keep up the average value of his stock to $6,000. The gist of this plea, however, is that the plaintiff fraudulently and deceitfully, and with intent to induce the defendants to grant the policy, concealed from the defendants, and did not communicate to their local agent, the fact of the execution of the trust assignment of the 28th November, or give him any notice thereof. In this it joins issue directly with the allegation in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration upon what is the real substantial point in controversy between the parties. Now the evidence upon this point establishes beyond all doubt that the local agent of the defendants, at the time of receiving the application set out in the plea of the date of the 19th November, was informed that the plaintiff had called a meeting of his creditors, and that it was they who insisted that the goods should be insured, and that in reply to a question put by him enquiring why the application was not for a longer period than three months, he was informed both by the plaintiff and Mackenzie, to whom the trust assignment was subquently made, that they were going to run off the goods to pay the creditors; that subsequently, and just before the 28th Nov., the local agent was also informed that the plantiff was about to execute an assignment for the benefit of his creditors to Mackenzie, and the defendants local agent was asked to prepare the document, but that he advised Mr. Mackenzie to go to a lawyer, a Mr. Cameron, for that purpose; that Mr. Mackenzie asked him to notify the company, the defendants, of the proposed assignment; that upon the trust assignment being executed the said local agent of the defendants was informed thereof, and was requested to write to the defendants and to tell them what had been done, and that he said there was no necessity, as by the application then already sent forward the policy was asked to be made payable to the creditors, and as McKenzie was one of the creditors it was not necessary.\nNow at this time the policy had not been granted, nor was it executed for a fortnight afterwards; there can be no doubt that upon the 28th of Nov. Mr. Holmes, the respondents\u2019 local agent, to whom the application was originally made, was as much the agent of the defendants to receive information and notice of any matter which might influence the defendants in determining to grant the policy, or to decline assuming the risk, as he was their local agent to receive the application in the first instance, and notice to him of the intention to execute the trust assignment and of the fact of its having been executed when executed was notice to the respondents. There is nothing that I know of that requires that notice to him of these matters should of necessity be in writing. The plaintiff seems to have done every thing necessary for him to do, to enable the defendants deliberately to determine whether they would incur the risk or not, when he communicated these facts to the local agent through whom the application had been made. These facts were so communicated before the defendants granted the policy which is sued upon, and although it may be true that the local agent of the defendants neglected to convey to the defendants the information communicated to him for the purpose, still the defendants, when they executed the policy upon the 12th of December, must be held to have had knowledge of the facts so communicated to their agent, and to have executed the policy with the knowledge of those facts. There is, however, a piece of internal evidence in the policy which is not explained, and from which the reasonable and rational inference can be drawn, that in fact these officers of the company who prepared and executed the policy were aware of the execution of the trust assignment; for the policy provides that loss, if any, should be paid to plaintiff\u2019s creditors, precisely as is provided in the trust assignment, \u201cas their interest may appear.\u201d The issue therefore upon this plea, which raises the real point in controversy between the parties, could only have been found for the plaintiff.\nThe sixth plea, after averring the application made upon the 19th Nov., 1877, to defendants\u2019 agent for a policy for $2,000.00 for 3 months, and the granting by such agent of an interim receipt, which the plea avers to have operated as an insurance for 30 days, unless cancelled within that period, subject to all the conditions, rules and regulations contained in and endorsed upon the printed form of policy in use by the defendants at the date thereof, proceeds to say, that while such interim receipt insurance was in full force, the defendants executed and delivered the policy in the declaration mentioned, and the defendants further say that at the time of the making of the said application, and while the said property was so insured as aforesaid under the said receipt, subject to the conditions, rules and regulations contained in and endorsed upon the printed form of policy in use by the defendants, which are those set out in the declaration as endorsed upon the policy declared upon, the plaintiff on 28th Nov., without the written permission endorsed on the said policy by an agent of the defendants\u2019 duly authorized for such purpose, as required by the condition in that behalf, endorsed on the said policy, and without the knowledge and consent of the defendants, executed and delivered to George McKenzie, the deed of assignment mentioned in the declaration, by reason of which the said policy and the insurance so effected with defendants became void.\nThe issue offered by this plea is substantially the same as that offered by the 5th plea, although the form of the plea has created some confusion.\nThe declaration had already alleged the execution of the trust assignment of the 27th Nov. and the subsequent execution by the defendants of the policy of the 12th Dec., with full knowledge and notice given to them of the execution of the trust assignment in favor of plaintiff\u2019s creditors.\nThe gist of the plea is in its closing paragraph: It alleges the application for insurance on the 19th Nov., the granting then of an interim receipt, the execution of the trust assignment of the 28th Nov., the subsequent execution of the policy of the 12th Dec., which the plea insists is avoided for the reason that, as the plea alleges, it was granted without any knowledge of the execution of the trust deed, and without the consent of the defendants.\nNow, if it be true, as alleged in the declaration, and as established by the evidence, as I have already point- ed out when considering the 5th plea, that at the time of the trust assignment being contemplated the intention to execute it was communicated to the defendants\u2019 agent who had received the application, and that immediately upon its execution the fact of such execution and its purport were in like manner communicated, and that the defendants did not execute the policy for a fortnight afterwards, and that under the circumstances the defendants must be held to have consented to the assignment and to have executed the policy with full knowledge of it, it can make no possible difference that at the time of the execution of the trust assignment, and of the communication to the defendants, through their agent, of the fact of its execution, there was an insurance existing upon an interim receipt.\nWhen the information was so communicated the defendants might, if they had pleased, have avoided the insurance upon the interim receipt and have refused to grant a policy under seal; not having done so, but on the contrary having issued the policy under their seal, whereby they consented with the plaintiff that in case of loss the amount should be payable to George McKenzie and McMaster and Company, and others as creditors of the plaintiff as their interest might appear, the defendants must be held to have consented to the trust assignment, so that the only point in controversy in reality was, as was raised on the 5th plea: had the defendants, directly or through their agent, knowledge of the execution of the trust assignment before the policy declared upon was granted?\nThe condition relied upon in the plea is a condition which, in terms of the endorsement on the policy, is restricted in its application to \u201cMutual Insurances.\u201d The condition is verbatim taken from the Act relating to Mutual Insurances, and its provisions relate to a policy granted upon the Mutual Insurance principle, whereas the policy declared upon appears to have been granted for a cash premium paid once for all, and not at all upon the mutual insurance principle; but assuming for the sake of argument, a temporary insurance, effected by payment of premium and an interim receipt pending the determination of the company upon an application for a policy under seal for a definite term extending beyond the period covered by the interim receipt, to be subject to the 4th condition endorsed on the policy, unaffected by the variation which is declared to be applicable to mutual insurances; and, indeed, assuming the interim receipt insurance to be subject to the condition as varied (points which are not necessary to be determined in this case), still it is apparent that the assignment there contemplated is an assignment made subsequently to the granting of the policy under which the property assigned, is, at the time of assignment, insured. The condition is that if the property insured is assigned, &c., &c., without written permission endorsed hereon\u2014that is on the policy whereby it is insured\u2014the policy in existence shall become void thereby\u2014that is by such assignment. Now, granting for the sake of argument it to be necessary in the case of an interim receipt insurance, that an assignment made pending the existence of the insurance upon the interim receipt should be endorsed upon the interim receipt at the peril, in default, of forfeiture of the insurance existing under the interim receipt, it is plain that the condition does not require such an assignment to be endorsed upon a policy subsequently granted under the seal of the company, containing the covenant of the company and extending the period of insurance beyond that covered by the interim receipt. The assignment when made could not be endorsed on a policy not in existence, nor could a policy not in existence become void. The insurance existing under the interim receipt might become void by reason of such an assignment not being endorsed upon the interim receipt; but if the company with full knowledge of the assignment should recognize it by issuing their policy under seal for a term extending beyond the period to which the interim receipt applied, such an assignment so recognized cannot, it is plain, be within the scope of the condition against assignment endorsed upon the subsequently issued policy. There is no sense or reason in the contention that it should be, for if the assignment was made known to the Company before they granted the policy under seal, it is but reasonable that they should be bound by the covenant contained in the policy, which was made with full knowledge of the assignment; and if the assignment made an alteration in the condition of the property different from that in which it was when they insured, and upon the faith of which they did insure, and which it was material should have been made known to them, and was not made known to them, in that case the policy so granted might be avoided, not for a breach of the condition endorsed on the policy, but upon plea averring, as has been here averred by the defendants expressly in their 5th plea, and substantially also as it appears to me in the 6th plea, that the plaintiff fraudulently withheld from the defendants all knowledge and notice of a fact material to be made known to them, and so by fraud and deceit procured the policy. This, as I have already said, is the real point in controversy between the parties here, and upon the evidence could not properly have been decided otherwise than against the defendants.\nThe Court of Common Pleas, on the argument of the case reserved, and in pursuance of the terms of the agreement entered into at the trial, allowed a replication to be filed to this 6th plea, but, as it appears to me, the issue which had already been joined between the parties, and which put in issue the material part of the 6th plea, which, in my opinion, consisted in the allegation that the assignment of the 28th November had been made \u201cwithout the knowledge and consent of the defendants,\u201d that is at the time of their executing the policy on the 12th December, was quite sufficient. However, the material part of the replication as allowed was, upon the evidence, properly found in favor of the plaintiff; it would have been better and more conformable to the evidence if the replication, instead of alleging that notice of the assignment had been given as therein stated \u201cbefore the loss,\u201d had alleged, as the evidence established that it had been given before the defendants granted and executed the policy declared upon. The case, when analysed and its facts are thoroughly understood, seems to me to be free from all difficulty, the whole point being, whether or not an agent of an insurance company authorized to receive applications for insurance, and who had received such an application, is the proper person, (while the application is still under the consideration of the company who have not yet agreed to grant the policy) to whom any alteration in the subject of the insurance, affecting such application, and material to be communicated to enable the company to determine whether they will or not grant the policy, may be communicated so as to affect the company with notice thereof.\nI cannot entertain a doubt that he is, and that he is was never doubted or disputed, but on the contrary was assumed as clear law upon all sides, and by this court in Liverpool, London & Globe Insurance Co. v. Wyld[35].\nNothing was said in argument upon the 7th plea, nor do I think could be, because the evidence, I think, shows that the interest of McKenzie in the property was known to the defendants when they granted the policy, and also the interest of the plaintiff, and the reference to McKenzie in the policy as a creditor of the plaintiff does, I think, sufficiently comply with the condition referred to in the 7th plea, but assuming it not to do so, still, as the defendants are held to be affected with knowledge of all the facts of the case when they executed the policy, it is wholly their fault if the interest of the plaintiff is not sufficiently stated in the policy, and as by the reservation at the trial, the rights of the parties are to be determined by the evidence, the defendants could not be allowed to prevail upon this plea if there were anything in it.\nThe Court of Common Pleas, in the rule which is the subject of this appeal, has ordered that a verdict be entered for the plaintiff for $2,050.00, upon the plaintiff producing to and filing with the master a release from all necessary parties of their claim to the insurance monies, proof of necessary parties to be given by affidavit to the satisfaction of the master, such release to be handed over by the master to the defendants by their attorney. I confess I cannot see the necessity or propriety of this condition so attached to the entry of a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The policy, although having in it the words \u201closs if any payable,\u201d &c., &c., is granted to the plaintiff. He is the person named therein as the insured, he is the person with whom the defendants contract, with whom the defendants covenant to make good all loss or damage to be sustained by the peril insured against, and the words \u201closs if any payable,\u201d &c., &c., operate to enable the defendants, in fulfilment of that covenant, to pay the parties named, and to set up such payment to an action by the plaintiff against them for breach of this covenant, but if they do not pay them or any one, then, if loss has been incurred within the terms of the policy, a breach of their covenant is committed, and the plaintiff is the person in whom the right of action for such breach is vested\u2014he is the proper person to sue.\nIn McCallum v. The \u00c6tna Insurance Co.[36], the Court of Common Pleas held, and I think rightly, that, even in a marine policy which had not in it the words \u201cfor or in the name of all parties interested,\u201d nor \u201cfor whom it may concern,\u201d but stated that the policy entered into \u201con account of A.C.\u201d\u2014\u201closs if any payable to L. McC.\u201d the contract was with A.C., who only could sue for a breach of the contract. A fortiori in this case, which is not a marine policy, and where the policy expressly states the plaintiff to be the person with whom the contract is made and with whom the defendants\u2019 covenant is made, he should sue alone for a breach of that covenant.\nI cannot see upon what principle the Court should have interposed its authority to impose a condition affecting the plaintiff\u2019s verdict, in the interest of the defendants who have committed a breach of their covenant sued upon, and which condition was of a nature that the defendants, not only had not set up any claim to be entitled to the benefit of, but could not have put the claim upon the record in the shape of a plea in excuse of the breach of covenant for which the action is brought, or in bar of the action.\nAlthough the plaintiff is not a party objecting under rule 61 of this Court to the rule against which the defendants have appealed, still, lest this case should be regarded as a precedent approving of the restriction imposed by the Court upon the entry of a verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor, and lest these conditions should be found embarrassing in the particular case, I think that under the rule we may with propriety order the rule of the Court of Common Pleas to be amended by omit- ting the condition imposed as to filing releases, and leave the assignee McKenzie to protect the interest of the creditors, which he can easily do if there be any necessity for his interfering for that purpose.\nThe defendants have no right that I can see to claim the interference of the Court to protect them against the legal consequences of the breach of their covenant with the plaintiff, and to suspend the recovery of a verdict against them until all plaintiff\u2019s creditors shall release the defendants from all claim they may have to the money recoverable by the plaintiff from the defendants for such breach. If the defendants had paid McKenzie, the assignee in trust, they could have pleaded that payment as a fulfilment of their covenant, and by this conditional verdict they are given a benefit, not only not asserted on the record, but which could not be, and which in fact operates as a premium to them for committing the breach of covenant for which they are sued.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Malcolm C.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Taschereau, J. J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nInsurance\u2014Transfer of Insurable Interest\u2014Art. 2482 C. C. L. C,\nThe appellants granted a fire policy to one T. on divers buildings and their contents for $3,280. In his written application T. represented that he was the owner of the premises, while he had previously sold them to S., the respondent, subject to a right of redemption which right T., at the tim\u00e9 of the application, had availed himself of by paying back to S. a part of the money advanced, leaving still due to S. a sum of $1,510. Subsequent to the application, and after some correspondence, the respective interests of T. and S. in the property were fully explained to the appellants through their agents. Thereupon a transfer for\u2014(the amount being in blank) was made to S. by T. and accepted by the appellants. The action was for $3280, the amount of insurance on. the buildings and effects.\nHeld,\u2014That at the tim\u00e9 of the application for insurance T. had an insurable interest in the property, and as the appellants had accepted the transfer made by T. to S., which was intended by all parties to be for $1,510, the amount then due by T. to S., the latter was entitled to recover the said sum of $1,510.\n2. That S. having no insurable interest in the movables, the transfer made to him by T. was not sufficient to vest in him T.'s rights under the policy with regard to said movables ([1]).\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side). This was an action to recover $3,280 from the appellants, under a policy of insurance issued by them in favor of one Thomas Thomson.\nThe facts of the case, as set forth in the pleadings, are briefly as follows:\u2014\nThe plaintiff's (respondent) declaration sets forth, that on or about the 25th of April, 1876, Thomas Thomson, of the Parish of St. Brigide, in the County of Iberville, made a contract of insurance in the said Parish of St. Brigide, with the defendants (appellants) to insure against fire divers buildings and their contents for a total sum of $3,280; that a policy of insurance was issued by appellants to the said Thomas Thomson, which covered the said buildings and effects; that on the 23rd of August 1876, the said Thomas Thomson transferred to respondent the said policy of insurance and his interest therein; that the appellants accepted of this transfer; that the said buildings and effects were destroye by fire on the 27th September, 1876; that the loss suffered by the insured in consequence of the fire\u00bb amounted to $3,735; that respondent notified the appellants of the fire, and fyled with the company a sworn statement of the said loss.\nThe appellants fyled several pleas, but on this appeal relied on the third plea setting forth that Thomson obtained said policy of insurance on the representation that he was proprietor of the said immovable property insured, whereas, in truth, he was not the proprietor thereof, and said policy was void ab initio; that on or about the 25th of August 1876 said Thomson transfer-red said policy to respondent, whom said Thomson represented to be the mortgagee of said property for $1,000; but, inasmuch as said policy was void ab initio, no interest or title was transferred to respondent * that if said policy had any effect (which appellants denied) no interest or benefit could accrue or be transferred to respondent as regards the movables covered by said policy, inasmuch as respondent had no interest in said movables, respondent's mortgage, if any existed, applying only to the immovable\u2019s, and the cash value of the immovable\u2019s was not more than $900 and by the terms of said policy appellants would only be liable for two-thirds of that sum, viz. $600; that in any event respondent had no claim or right to recover from appellants the value of the contents of stables Nos one and two, and that of the sewing machine mentioned in said policy inasmuch as respondent had furnished no proofs of the contents of the said two stables nor of the value thereof; nor of the value of the sewing machine alleged to have been destroyed by the fire in question.\nThe respondent replied that Thomson, in stating in his application that he was proprietor of the buildings insured, and that they were mortgaged for $1,000, stated what was correct that although said Thomson had sold the property to respondent 5th Dec., 1871, he did so subject to redemption as appeared by a contre Iettre fyled; that he paid no rent therefore; that the transfer to respondent was made long before the fire, and with the consent of the company, and that appellants had no interest to plead that Thomson, was not proprietor at the time the insurance was effected; that a regular claim was made out in one of the company's blanks; that this claim was correct and made in good faith that respondent admitted that he had no right to claim for the contents of the two stables; that it was by error that a demand had been made for them in the present action and respondent made the same admission regarding the sewing machine, excepting $5 as part of the value of it.\nBy the judgment of the court in the first instance, the company was condemned to pay $140, the value of a part of the movables insured namely $60 for a reaper and mower, and $80 for a threshing machine; this court specially holding that the insurance on the immovable\u2019s was void. The reasons for so holding being \"that Thomson must be held under his application and the policy to have so warranted that he was possessor and proprietor of the buildings insured; that so far from that condition warranted being true he (Thomson) was not the owner of the property and buildings alluded to either at the date of the insurance or of the fire, and so the policy, as regards said buildings, was by its proper conditions void; and that the company never took Thomson to be other than proprietor of the buildings insured, and had no knowledge before the fire of Thomson sale to plaintiff\nThe Court of Queen's Bench, by its judgment, held that the plaintiff (Sheridan) should recover for the value of the immovable\u2019s, but that he had no right to recover the insurance on the movables, as he (Sheridan) had no insurable interest therein. It is from this judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench that the present appeal was taken.\nMr. Bethune, Q. C, and Mr. Hutchinson for appellants :\nBy the written application made and signed by S Thomson, and by the policy, any misrepresentation of facts in the application made by Thomson amounts to a breach of warranty and is fatal to any claim of the insured.\nThat Thomson, in his application, misrepresented the facts and made statements therein which were entirely untrue, is very evident. In his application he states that he is the owner of the property insured in fee simple, or in his own right and that the property in question was mortgaged for $1,000.\n[The learned counsel then contended upon the facts of the case that it was impossible to avoid the conclusion that Thomson was guilty of gross misrepresentation]\nThen it is contended that the sale to respondent was subject to a right of redemption, The law on this point is very clear and is laid down in Articles 1549 and 1550 C. C. L. C., which declare that the Court cannot extend the stipulated term for redemption.\nAs to the movables respondent had no insurable interest and cannot recover on the transfer. < See Art. 2172 C. C. L. C. The learned counsel also referred to Art. 2485 and 2487 C. C. L. C.; Hazard y. Agricultural Insurance Go. ([2]); Wood on Fire Insurance ([3]).\nMr. PagnueIo, for respondent :\nContended that there was no misrepresentation, and that the company was made aware of the real interest of both Sheridan and Thomson in the property and with this knowledge accepted the insurance and issued the policy in the form they adopted.\nAs to the transfer with regard to the movables, that the transfer was made as a collateral security for a debt and that in such a case the transferee had an insurable interest in the object of the policy, and cited White v. Western Insurance Co. ([4]); Troplong vo. Man-dat ([5]); and Fitzgerald v. The Gore Mutual insurance Co ([6]).\nMR. BETHUNE, Q. C., in reply.\nRITCHIE C J. concurred with Fournier, J.\nSTRONG, J.\u2014\nI am of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench ought to be affirmed for the reasons given by the Chief Justice of that Court, and also for those expressed by my brother Fournier, in whose judgment I concur.\nFOURNIER, J :\nLe 25 avril, 1876, l'appelante a \u00e9mis en faveur de Thomas Thomson une police d'assurance au montant de $3280 sur certaines b\u00e2tisses et leur contenu, d\u00e9truits par un incendie qui a eu lieu le 27 septembre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e.\nDu consentement de la compagnie, cette police fut ensuite transport\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 Sheridan, qui en a r\u00e9clame le montant par son action en cette cause.\nLa compagni lui oppose pour moyens de defense:\n10. Nullit\u00e9 de la police parce que le billet promissoire donn\u00e9 pour la prime n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9ch\u00e9ance.\n20. Que Thomson avait tromped la compagnie sur la valeur et le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des b\u00e2tisses assur\u00e9es. 30. Qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas proprietary des b\u00e2tisses assur\u00e9es en son nom.\n40. Que l'incendie des dites b\u00e2tisses avait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par sa n\u00e9gligence.\nLa compagnie peut, d'apr\u00e8s ses conditions, accepter un billet promissoire pour le paiement de la prime d'assurance, mais \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de payment de tel billet \u00e0 son enhance, il est stipul\u00e9 que la police devient caduque. Par une autre condition de la police il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il n'est pas permis aux agents de donner leur consentement \u00e0 aucun transport de police ni de dispenser (waive) de l'ex\u00e9cution d'aucune stipulation ou condition y contenue. Le billet que Thomson avait donn\u00e9 pour la prime \u00e9tait de depuis deux mois lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9. Patterson, l'agent de la compagnie \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, en a re\u00e7u le montant sans faire aucune observation sur l'expiration du d\u00e9lai ni sur la condition de d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance en pareil cas. L'argent ainsi pay\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 ensuite re\u00e7u par le bureau principal de la Compagnie \u00e0 Ottawa, La compagnie n'a jamais offert de rendre ces deniers, ils sont encod\u00e9e dans sa caisse. Sous ces circonstances il est impossible de ne pas consid\u00e9rer la compagnie comme ayant donn\u00e9 son consentement \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution d'un contrat qu'elle aurait p\u00fb consid\u00e9rer, il est vrai, comme ayant cess\u00e9 d'exister faute de paiement dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9. 'Mais pour se pr\u00e9valoir de ce d\u00e9faut, il \u00e9tait d'abord du devoir de son agent \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al de ne pas recevoir les deniers, puis lorsqu'ils furent plus tard transmis au bureau principal la compagnie elle-m\u00eame aurait d\u00fb. r\u00e9pudier l'acceptation qui en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par son agent. Rien de cela n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait C'est avec les deniers dans ses mains que la compagnie se pr\u00e9sente en cour pour se plaindre de n'en avoir pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e. Il n'est pas surprenant que cette objection alt \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e comme futile par les deux cours qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 se prononcer sur cette cause. Lors de l'argument, cette cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 du m\u00eame avis, et c'est mon opinion que le d\u00e9faut d'avoir offert de rendre les deniers aussit\u00f4t que le payment en est parvenu \u00e0 sa connaissance, doit n\u00e9cessairement faire pr\u00e9sumer le consentement de la compagnie \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du contrat d'assurance.\nQuant \u00e0 l'exag\u00e9ration de l'\u00e9valuation des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, il serait injuste d'en rendre Thomson responsable, car elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par lui, mais par Valois, l'agent de la compagnie. Il \u00e9tait tout naturel pour lui de croire qu'une \u00e9valuation ainsi faite serait de nature \u00e0 donner plus de satisfaction \u00e0 la compagnie celle qu'il pourrait faire lui-m\u00eame. Aussi, s'est il content\u00e9 d'adopter celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par Valois. Il y a eu erreur dans cette \u00e9valuation, mais 11 n'y a pas eu dessein de tromper. La Compagnie ne se plaint pas qu'il y a eu pour cela une entente frauduleuse entre Thomson et Valois et elle n'a pastent\u00e9 d'en faire la preuve.\nL'objection la plus s\u00e9rieuse est celle faite au sujet du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans les b\u00e2tisses assur\u00e9es. Ans son application pour obtenir une police d'assurance, Thomson s'est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le propri\u00e9taire des immeubles v d\u00e9sign\u00e9s, et il a ajout\u00e9 qu'ils \u00e9taient affect\u00e9s par hypoth\u00e8que au montant de $1,000. C'est sur ces d\u00e9clarations que Ia Compagnie consid\u00e8re fausses et comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 faites dans le but do la tromper, qu'elle s'appuie principalement pour refuser le paiement r\u00e9clam\u00e9.\nCes d\u00e9clarations ne sont certainement pas exactes \u00b0 mais l'explication que Thomson en a donn\u00e9e fait voir que s'il \u00e9tait en erreur sur la nature de ses droits concernant les immeubles en question, il n'agissait nullement avec l'intention de commettre une fraud au d\u00e9triment do la compagnie. Voici, d'apr\u00e8s les faits en preuve, quelle \u00e9tait sa position:\u2014\nEn 1871, Thomson, se trouvant endett\u00e9 envers plusieurs personnes, et, d\u00e9sirant les payer toutes pour n'avoir plus affaire qu'\u00e0 un seul cr\u00e9ancier, fit avec I' intim\u00e9 Sheridan un arrangement par lequel celui-ci s'engagea d'avancer les deniers n\u00e9cessaires pour l'ex\u00e9cution de ce project. Les parties donn\u00e8rent \u00e0 cette convention la forme d'un acte de vente par lequel Thomson vendait \u00e0 Sheridan (5 d\u00e9cembre 1878) sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de neuf arpents de front sur trente de profondeur pour $4000 que ce dernier devait dans le d\u00e9lai de trois ans employer \u00e0 payer les hypoth\u00e8ques affectant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue, \u2014tenir compte des paiements faits et remettre la balance au vendeur Sheridan ne devait prendre possession que d'une partie de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue, savoir : les deux arpents adjoignant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de F. X. Paquet. Le vendeur Thomson devait demeurer et est de fait toujours demeur\u00e9 en possession du reste de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 condition de payer un loyer de $400 par ann\u00e9e, et de remplir certaines autres charges.\nLe m\u00eame jour Sheridan signa une contre-lettre par laquelle, sur remboursement de ses avances, dans le d\u00e9lai de trois ans ii s'obligeait \u00e0 revendre \u00e0 Thomson la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9e comme obvient de le voir.\nLe loyer stipul\u00e9 n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9, et Thomson a continu\u00e9 de jouir de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 comme auparavant. Quelques jours seulement \u00e2pres cette vente, le 11 novembre 1871, Sheridan a revendu, pour $2,200, deux arpents sur trente, c'est-\u00e0-dire moins du quart de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour le total de laquelle ii avait promis de payer $4,000. Par cette vente, Sheridan touchait imm\u00e9diatement $1, 200 et devait recevoir la balance de $1000 dans un court d\u00e9lai. 11 rentrait ainsi tr\u00e8s promptement dans plus de la moiti\u00e9 des avances qu'il avait promises de faire. D'autres remboursements furent faits par Thomson qui, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de son application ne devait plus \u00e0 Sheridan que $1,500.\nBien que le d\u00e9lai de trois ans fix\u00e9 pour le rachat f\u00fbt alors expire, Sheridan n'ayant manifest\u00e9 aucune intention de s'en tenir \u00e0 la lettre du contrat de vente ayant au contraire laiss\u00e9 Thomson en jouissance comme auparavant, ii n'est pas surprenant que celui-ci se soit lors de son application, cru justifiable de se consid\u00e9rer comme le propri\u00e9taire. L'acceptation que Sheridan a F. faite plus tard d'un transport de partie de la police d'assurance o\u00f9 Thomson se d\u00e9clarait propri\u00e9taire, prouve bien que telle \u00e9tait aussi sa\" mani\u00e8re de voir \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Cependant Thomson et son fils d\u00e9clarent positivement dans leur t\u00e9moignage qu'ils ont inform\u00e9 l'agent Valois que le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait au nom de Sheridan, comme s\u00fbret\u00e9 du paiement d'une somme d'environ $1,000. Il parait d'apr\u00e8s la preuve qu'il y a en entre eux un malentendu \u00e0 ce sujet. Cela s'explique facilement par le fait que Thomson comprend peu le fran\u00e7ais et que Valois parle pen la langue anglaise. Ce dernier ayant demand\u00e9 le montant exact de la cr\u00e9ance de Sheridan, Thomson lui d\u00e9clara qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas alors en \u00e9tat de le lui dire exactement et demanda \u00e0 retarder l'assurance \u00e0 un autre jour afin de s'en assurer. Sur cette r\u00e9ponse Valois lui dit que ce n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire, et il compl\u00e9ta lui-m\u00eame l'application. C'est sous ces circonstances que la d\u00e9claration de Thomson a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite et que le montant d\u00fb \u00e0 Sheridan a \u00e9t\u00e9 porte \u00e0 $1,000, au lieu de $1,500 qu'il \u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement.\nSi los choses en \u00e9taient rest\u00e9es l\u00e0, on pourrait dire, sans toutefois pouvoir en rejeter la responsabilit\u00e9 morale sur Thomson quo la Compagnie a \u00e9t\u00e9 induite en erreur par ce malentendu et qu'elle n'est par cons\u00e9quent pas tenue d'ex\u00e9cuter un contrat fond\u00e9 sur l'erreur. Mais telle n'est pas sa position. L'erreur commise par l'entr\u00e9e du nom de Thomson au lieu de celui de Sheridan ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverte, elle fut rectifi\u00e9e lors du transport de la police que Thomson a fait \u00e0 Sheridan du consentement de la compagnie. La v\u00e9ritable position des parties concernant leurs droits respectifs dans la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question est expos\u00e9e dans tons ses d\u00e9tails dans la correspondance \u00e9chang\u00e9e entre Valois et Patterson, l'agent g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la compagnie, \u00e0 propos de ce transport Cette correspondance \u00e9tant de la plus haute importance pour la d\u00e9cision de cette cause, je crois devoir en donner l'analyse aussi correcte que concise qui se trouve dans les notes de Sir A. A. Dorion.\nAs regards the ownership of the property, it is true that in his original application, Thomson represented that he was the owner of the premises which he sought to insure, while he had previously sold them to the appellant subject to a right of redemption.\nThis was evidently the result of a misunderstanding, and the respective interests of Thomson and of the appellant in the property m question were fully explained to the Company through its agents, before the policy was transferred, and the transfer was accepted after all the circumstances had been fully disclosed. Valois in a letter of the 8th August, 1876, wrote to Patterson, the general agent of the Company at Montreal, that the property belonged to Sheridan and that Thomson wanted to know if, in case of fire he would be entitled to receive the insurance without this being mentioned in the policy.\nOn the 14th of the same month, he again writes to Patterson that Thomson was not the proprietor of the premises, at the time the insurance was effected: that in order to pay his debts Thomson had previously transferred his property to the appellant, on condition that he would get it back on payment of what he owed him \u2022 that he had already paid a large amount and expected to have his property returned to him. In this letter, Valois says : \" Now these two gentlemen \" (alluding to Thomson and to Sheridan) \" wish to have their property insured\u2013 s it necessary to make two policies, one for the buildings in the name of Sheridan, and one for the contents in the name of Thomson, or will one policy containing all the facts be sufficient? do what you think proper.\"\nPatterson answers on the 16th: \"If I understand well the position of this matter, Thomson is the owner of the real estate but he owes something to Mr. Sheridan; if it is so the policy is good as it is excepted that to enable Sheridan to claim the insurance the policy must be transferred to him by Thomson.\"\nAfter indicating how the transfer is to be made, Patterson adds \" This plan dispenses with the necessity of making two policies, it will save expenses. I believe it is all that is required.\"\nFinally, Valois writes to Patterson, on the 22nd August : \" I return the policy of Mr. Thomson after getting him to sign, and having signed myself; the sum which is to be transfer red is one thousand, five hundred and ten dollars ($1, 510), being the amount for which the buildings are insured.\"\nIt was after this correspondence had taken place that the transfer was made by Thomson and accepted by the Company. The intention of both Thomson and Sheridan on the one part and of Patter-son acting for the Company on the other, was unmistakably to insure Sheridan's interest in the property described, and if after the explicit statement made by Valois, that Sheridan owned the buildings, and Thomson the chattel property they contained, the agent of the Company made a mistake by causing a transfer to be made by Thomson to the appellant, instead of issuing a new policy to cover Sheridan's interest in the buildings, the latter should certainly not suffer, as the Company cannot take advantage of its own agent to resist the claim of the appellant. It is to be noticed that whether the property was insured in the name of Thomson or in that of Sheridan made no difference in the risk, since the property was all the time occupied by Thomson.\nIl est \u00e9vident d'apr\u00e8s cette correspondance que c'\u00e9tait l'intention des parties d'assurer les int\u00e9r\u00eats de Sheridan dans la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question. Si la chose n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite comme elle aurait d\u00fb l'\u00eatre au moyen de deux polices, une pour Thomson et une pour Sheridan, la faute n'en peut \u00eatre attribu\u00e9e qu'\u00e0 l'agent de la compagnie qui n'a pas donn\u00e9 aux faits qui lui out \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s leur veritable signification. Adoptant sur ce point le raisonnement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine, je crois qu'il serait injuste de rendre Sheridan responsable de l\u2019erreur de la compagnie. C'est \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 en supporter les cons\u00e9quences, puisque c'est apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement inform\u00e9e de tous ces faits qu'elle a accept\u00e9 un transport de la police dans laquelle Thomson est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme le propri\u00e9taire. Pour cette raison le jugement accordant \u00e0 line time $1510 balance qui lui \u00e9tait due lors du transport, devrait \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 Malheureusement pour Thomson ii s'est gliss\u00e9 dans le transport de la police une autre erreur qui, suivant le jugement de la Cour du Bane de la Reine, doit \u00eatre fatale \u00e0 ses pr\u00e9tentions de retirer sous le nom de Sheridan le surplus de la somme transport\u00e9e \u00e0 ce dernier, Cette erreur, aussi commise par l'agent de la companies, consiste dans l'oubli d'avoir ins\u00e9r\u00e9 dans le F transport la somme pour laquelle la Compagnie donnait son consentement, ce qui a l'effet de constituer Sheridan cessionnaire non seulement de l'assurance sur les b\u00e2tisses mais aussi de celle sur les meubles de Thomson. La correspondance cit\u00e9e plus haut d\u00e9montre \u00e0 l'\u00e9vidence que l'intention de toute les parties \u00e9tait de ne transporter \u00e0 Sheridan qu'un montant suffisant pour garantir sa cr\u00e9ance. En cons\u00e9quence de cette omission le transport se trouve \u00eatre de tous les int\u00e9r\u00eats de Thomson dans la police. Ce n'\u00e9tait certainement pas son intention.\nD'ailleurs Sheridan n'avait point dans les meubles assures qui \u00e9taient toujours rest\u00e9s la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Thomson d'autre int\u00e9r\u00eat que celui d'un cr\u00e9ancier ordinaire dans le cas o\u00f9 la balance qui lui \u00e9tait due n'aurait pu \u00eatre pay\u00e9e en vertu de son transport. Il pouvait dans ce cas exercer son action personnelle sur ces meubles comme sur tous les autres biens qui restaient encore \u00e0 Thomson ou faire saisir entre les mains de la Compagnie ce qu'elle aurait pu devoir \u00e0 Thomson en vertu de cette police. Mais cet int\u00e9r\u00eat n'est pas suffisant pour rendre l\u00e9gale l'acceptation d'un transport d'assurance. Il faut, d'apr\u00e8s l'art. 2432 C. C, pour qu'an transport soit valable que la personne \u00e0 qui il est fait ait un int\u00e9r\u00eat dans Ia chose assur\u00e9e c'est-\u00e0-dire que dans le cas actuel; pour la validit\u00e9 du transport ii aurait fallu faire voir que Sheridan avait un int\u00e9r\u00eat dans les meubles en question, comme propri\u00e9taire, gagiste ou usufruitier, etc. A d\u00e9faut d'un int\u00e9r\u00eat de ce genre, le transport se trouve nul d'apr\u00e8s l'article du code cite plus haut, et cette cour doit le consid\u00e9rer comme tel.\nLa derni\u00e8re objection, celle par laquelle Thomson a \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9 d'avoir cause l'incendie par sa n\u00e9gligence a \u00e9t\u00e9 unanimement rejet\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc de la Reine. J. La preuve \u00e9tablit que le 27 septembre, jour d\u00e9 l'incendie, Thomson et sa femme sont partis dans l'apr\u00e8s-midi pour aller dans une paroisse voisine visiter un de leurs enfants. Apr\u00e8s leur d\u00e9part les deux fils de Thomson et sa fille ont aussi laiss\u00e9 la maison vers 6 heures du soir pour aller passer la veill\u00e9e chez des amis. Au moment de leur d\u00e9part pour le retour ils s'aper\u00e7urent que la maison et les autres b\u00e2tisses \u00e9taient en feu. Lorsqu'ils arriv\u00e8rent, elles \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 d\u00e9truites.\nIl n'y avait certainement rien d'extraordinaire et d'inusit\u00e9 dans l'absence de Thomson et sa famille Ces courtes absences d'une famille enti\u00e8re, \u00e0 la campagne sont assez fr\u00e9quentes. Celle qui a eu lieu dans ce cas-ci ne peut \u00e9tablir contre Thomson le fait d'une n\u00e9gligence qui le rendrait responsable de l'incendie, et encore moins cr\u00e9er une pr\u00e9somption qu'il en soit l'auteur, puisque le plaidoyer n'a pas porte contre lui cette grave accusation.\nIl y a bien quelques circonstances qui portent \u00e0 croire que le feu est l'\u0153uvre d'un incendiaire, mais rien dans la preuve n'implique Thomson comme y ayant eu la moindre participation. Telle a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'opinion unanime de la Cour du Banc de la Reine et c'est aussi celle que j'ai adopt\u00e9e apr\u00e8s un examen s\u00e9rieux de la preuve.\nHENRY, J. :\u2014\nThis is an action on a Policy of insurance for loss and damage by fire to a dwelling house, a, barn and shed, with their contents, insured by a person named Thomson, who, subsequently, with the assent of the appellants company, assigned it to the respondent, be in as he was shown to have been interested in the real estate covered by it.\nBefore determining the legal questions involved, it is necessary to look at the facts as they existed before the H policy sued on issued.\nOn the 25th of April, 1876 Thomson signed a written application in which the property is described. A number of questions submitted by the company are printed in and form part of the application; but it is only necessary to refer specifically to two of them. One is : \" Does the applicant possess in fee simple, or in his own right, and if not, who possesses s The reply to it was \" Yes.\" The other is : \" State if is mortgaged or otherwise affected and if so how and for what amount?\" The answer is \" $1,000.\"\nIt thus appears that although the first answer was incorrect, the subsequent statement that the property was mortgaged or otherwise encumbered, effectually corrected the first and clearly showed the state of the title, and that the party intended no misrepresentation. He could not, therefore be said, as alleged in some of the pleas, to have falsely and frequently made the representations by which it is sought to avoid the policy.\nWe find, however, that Thomson, in August following, fearing that the transfer to the respondent might affect the insurance, applied to Valois, the local agent and, after giving him full knowledge of the transfer and its objects, got him to communicante the same, which he did, to Patterson, the general agent at Mon-treat. A correspondence commenced by a letter from Valois to Patterson, of the 8th August, and which terminated on the 29th of the same month shows that the relative position of the respondent and Thomson in regard to the property was fully made known to Patterson. On the 14th Valois wrote Patterson, fully explaining the matter. On the 16th Patterson acknowledged the receipt of the letter, and his letter shows he understood the nature of the transfer as it came out in evidence,- and says :\nIf that is the case then the policy is all right as it is, except that Mr. Sheridan may be able to claim the insurance the policy must be transferred and made over to him by Mr. Thomson. I return you the policy, having made up another because the other did not look right. Please destroy the old one so soon as you shall be satisfied that the new one is similar. You will make Mr. Thomson sign his name in the interior of the policy opposite and return it to me with fifty cents for the transport. I shall then enter it in my books, and I'll send it to you immediately. This plan will obviate the necessity of making two policies, and will save expense. I believe that is all that is required. Please collect the amount of Mr. Thomson's note, and I'll send him his.\nOn the 22nd Valois wrote Patterson:\nI return Mr. Thomson's policy, which we have both signed. The sum to be made over to Mr. Thomas Sheridan is fifteen hundred and ten dollars, that is to say, the amount for which the buildings are insured\nOn the 29th Patterson wrote again to Valois :\nI send you this day Mr. Thomson's policy transferred.\nThus then the old policy was cancelled in consequence of the correspondence just referred to, and a new one issued sometime between the 8th and 16th of August. It is, however, dated the same as the previous one the 25th of April, 1876. The issuing of that second policy is therefore the act, not merely of the two agents, but that of the company itself by the signatures of its president and secretary, countersigned by \"H. Patterson general agent at Montreal,\" and under the corporate seal. The consent of the company to the transfer, dated 25th August, is signed by the secretary of the company.\nThe insured in the early part of that month, through the local agent asked that \" General Manager,\" if under the circumstances two policies were necessary? (one for Thomson to cover the movables the other to Sheri-dan to cover the buildings.) He had paid for a full insurance on both and wished to have no doubt of all being in order. Patterson makes out a new policy and She tells him that by transferring the interest in the policy He which covered the buildings it would be all right; that Sheridan would then be insured as to the latter and Thomson as to the chattel property. A loss as to both takes place. The company refused to pay either, and charge Thomson with false and fraudulent representations, and invoke in their attempt to evade payment, a clause in the policy providing that a agents of the company are not permitted to give the consent of the company to assignments of policies, or to waive any stipulation or condition contained therein.\"\nThe general agent was fully informed of everything before the issue of the second policy and through his management and direction it was issued by the company, and intended by all parties to cover the buildings for Sheridan and the movables for Thomson The respondent does not, however, claim by virtue of an assignment of the policy made by an agent or through any waiver since the policy issued. The provision of the policy just noticed does not therefore apply.\nConditions in policies are intended to prevent injustice to companies by false and fraudulent representations, but not to enable them to act dishonestly, dishonorably, or fraudulently towards others whose money they have received and who are by the acts of their authorized agents lulled into security to find subsequently the company endeavor to repudiate the acts of those who are held out by them, not as mere local, but general agents. If any wrong was in this case done to the company by their general agent withholding the information he had obtained before the second Policy was issued, it certainly would be most unjust, and contrary to all legal and equitable principles, to make the insured to suffer It was the duty of those at the head office to know, and they must be presumed to have known, everything\", before They signed the second policy, and if, instead of which, they relied on the general agent and accepted his suggestions, they virtually adopted his acts and must be held bound by them.\nIn all cases except those to which I have referred as a condition of the policy, a general agent has implied authority to act for and hind his principal, so far as is necessary to the performance of his duties, and the principal is no less bound by his acts than those with whom on behalf of his principal he enters into agreements. Ills acts and knowledge are necessarily in such cases deemed to be the acts and knowledge of his principal. Patterson was fully authorized as the general agent of the company to receive applications and represent them in every respect at all events up to the issue of the policy. Notice to him in respect of the property and otherwise, is in law notice to the company. Local agents are considered to occupy a more subordinate position, and their powers are generally more limited. To bind a company for all the acts of local agents, often of little experience, in every hamlet or village, would be widely different from binding them for the acts and dealings of a general agent selected on account of his special business knowledge. The latter often act under powers of attorney and issue policies without consulting the head office and in other cases policies are issued to them in blank fully executed by officers of the company, and requiring only be filling up and counter-signing by the agent. In the latter cases, also, policies are issued without consulting the head office. In such cases the agent is virtually the company. I presume, as the policy in this case is countersigned by Patterson, as such general manager, he had authority to issue policies in that way. I draw this conclusion from his letters to Valois, in which he does not speak of referring the matter to the officers of the company but in such a way as to shew he alone could deal with the matter. S To contend, therefore, that a party dealing with the company through the agent, should duplicate his negotiations by directly communicating with the head office would, in my opinion, be simply absurd. The notice, then, to the general agent binds the company, and the policy being issued after that notice, no defence can be set up for any representation in the application. That under the circumstances the company should endeavor to evade responsibility for the loss by pleading as they have done in this respect is, I think not justifiable. To give legal effect to such pleading would be, I think, subversive of every legal principle. With a full knowledge of the transfer to the respondent the company not only admits Thomson's insurable interest, but with that same knowledge, suggesting and approving of the assignment of the interest in the policy which covered the buildings to \u00a1Sheridan, they would, I think, be estopped from setting up against Sheridan the absence of the insurable interest in Thomson if he had none. They substantially say to Sheridan: \"We know your relations with Thomson as to the property, and whether his right to insure was good or not which question we waive, if you get an assignment of his interest in the buildings, we will consent to it as provided in the policy, and in case of loss will pay you.\" The assignment was made and the company having consented to it, their compact was from that with Sheridan, and they are estopped from' setting up the absence of the insurable interest in Thomson\nIndependently, however, of that position, I think Thomson had all along an insurable interest. The transfer to Sheridan, although on its face absolute and final, was nevertheless agreed upon only as lien or mortgage, as by the declaration in writing of the latter, signed at the same time, appears. The time for redemption as stated in the latter was three years, and possibly Sheridan might at the end of that time have refused to per-mit redemption by Thomson, but it is plain that the transfer was intended by the parties to it to be only a security for monies to be subsequently paid and advanced for Thomson, which Thomson was to repay with interest. It appears that up to the time of the issuing of the second policy the same relations existed between Sheridan and Thomson as it is shown that the one had been paying off the advances and the other receiving them. The understanding when the assignment was \u2022 made, was that Sheridan was in case of loss to recover the insurance on the buildings as the assignee of Thomson, then acknowledged and understood to have the beneficial interest in the policy, and Sheridan, in accepting it admitted the position. He would therefore be held to receive the amount of the policy so assigned to the credit of Thomson in repayment of his advances. If by the receipt of direct payments by Sheridan, and the recovery of the amount of the policy so assigned to him he should be paid in full he would be held bound to recovery to Thomson. Thomson had therefore a good insurable interest as long as the relation I have stated remained understood and acknowledged by and between him and Sheridan and the absolute nature of the transfer could not be insisted on by outside parties. That relation existed when the application was made and has since continued. I am of the opinion that had the policy not been assigned, Thomson could himself have recovered for the loss on the buildings,\nThere is one feature in the case to which it is desir- able to refer Thomson became by lease the tenant of Sheridan, but the holding under it did not in my view in any way affect the nature of the transaction or the legal right of Thomson to redeem the property. The understanding, or rather agreement, was that Thomson was not to give up possession of the property, but to pay in S the shape of rent $400 a year. How that rent if paid, H would have been credited to him by Sheridan is not stated, but as I understand the agreement, he would be credited as against the advances and interest and costs, any sums paid by him on a final account between the parties. That would be in accordance with the memorandum or declaration of trust signed by Sheridan, in which, on payment of \"all moneys, interests and costs & c., \" by him a advanced or to be advanced and paid under the terms and conditions of a deed of sale passed between us this day,\" he engaged \" to remit, return and re-sell unto him the property by me purchased under said deed.\" The execution of the lease by which Thomson became for the time tenant to Sheridan did not affect the right of redemption of the former. His position as communicated to and considered by Patterson, was that of a mortgagor.\nAn objection to the whole action is taken under a clause of the policy which provides that \"in case of loss the assured shall give immediate notice thereof to the company, stating the number of the policy and name of the agent, and shall deliver to the company as particular an account or statement of such loss or damage as the nature of the case will admit and shall sign the same and verify by oath or affirmation, &c.\" The issue raised by the plea is not one applicable to the provision or condition of the policy just referred to It alleges \" that said Thomson has violated the terms and conditions contained in said policy inasmuch as he has not delivered to said defendant a particular account or statement of the loss or damage which he alleges he suffered.\" The plea therefore raises an issue not justified by the condition. He (Thomson) did not bind himself as a condition precedent to his right to recover, to furnish in any event or under all circumstances any \"particular account or statement\" of loss, but only such an one as the case admitted of, and the plea does not allege or aver that the case admitted of a more particular account. He made an account attested to in general terms, and, if objected to, the plea should have alleged that it was not as particular as the nature of the case admitted. Without such an allegation in the plea, no proof could be regularly admitted that a more particular account could have been given. It is not, however, contended that the plea applies to the buildings, or that, if it did, any more particular account was necessary. There are many cases in which anything more than a general estimate of loss could not be given and in others where only a partially particular account could be made out and therefore in such cases the party can be called upon to furnish only such information as is in his power. The plea for the reasons stated, in my opinion, is no defense to the action.\nThere are one or two minor points which I have not thought it necessary to refer to, further than to say that, in my judgment, they don't affect the right of the respondent to recover according to the judgment of the court appealed from to this court. I think the appeal should he dismissed and the judgment referred to affirmed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J., concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Hutchinson & Walker.\nSolicitors for respondent: Duhamel, Pagnuelo & Rainville.\n[1] Art. 2482 C.

J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR MANITOBA.\nEjectment\u2014Letters Patent\u2014Parliamentary title\u2014Equitable defence\u201438 Vic. c. 12 {Man.) 35 Vic, c. 23 (D.)\nL., in 1875, applied for a homestead entry for the S. W. \u00bc of sec. 30, township. 6, range 4 west, pre-empted by F., and paid $10 fee to a clerk at the office, but was subsequent^ informed by the officers of the Crown that his application could not be recognized, and was refunded the $10 he had paid. F. subsequently paid for the land by a military bounty warrant in pursuance of sec. 23 of 35 Vic, c. 23. L. entered upon the land and made improvements. In 1878, after the conflicting claims of F. and L. had been considered by the officers of the Crown, a patent for this land was granted by the Crown to F., who brought an action of ejectment against L. to recover possession of the said land. F., at the trial, put in, as proof of his title, the Letters Patent, and L. was allowed, against the objection of F's counsel, to set up an equitable defence and to go into evidence for the purpose of attacking the plaintiff's patent as having been issued to him in error, and by improvidence and fraud. The judge, who tried the case without a jury, rendered a verdict for the defendant.\nHeld, on appeal, reversing the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Man.), that L., not being in possession under the Statute, had no parliamentary title to the possession of the land, nor any title whatever which could prevail against the title of F. under the Letters Patent.\nPer Gwynne, J.:\u2014That under the practice which prevailed in England in 1870, which practice was in force in Manitoba under 38 Vic, c. 12, at the time of the bringing of this suit, an equitable defence could not be set up in an action of ejectment. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench of the province of Manitoba discharging a rule nisi obtained by the appellant to set aside a verdict rendered for the defendant.\nThe action was one of ejectment to recover possession of the south-west quarter of section thirty, in the sixth township, in the fourth range west of the principal meridian, in the province of Manitoba.\nThe case was tried before Wood, C. J., without a jury.\nThe plaintiff (appellant) at the trial put in as proof of his title, letters patent, under the Great Seal of Canada, granting the land in question to him in fee simple.\nThe defendant, in pursuance of an order made at the trial, filed an answer in which he maintained that the issue of the said patent to the plaintiff was, as against him, fraudulent and void, and that he is, as against the plaintiff, entitled to the possession of the lands in question, and in which he prayed by way of cross relief, that the said letters patent might be decreed to be void for having been issued through fraud, or in error or improvidence.\nThe learned Chief Justice found that the letters patent issued to the plaintiff were void as having been issued in error and mistake, and on that ground rendered a verdict for the defendant, and that the defendant was entitled to a decree declaring the said letters patent to be void.\nThe plaintiff in the following term moved to set aside the verdict and for a new trial on the grounds. 1. That the production by the plaintiff of the Crown patent was conclusive of his right to recover. 2. That it was not competent for the defendant to impeach the validity of the patent on the ground of fraud, error, improvidence, or otherwise. 3. That there was no evidence given at the trial of such fraud, error or improvidence in respect of the issuing of the said patent to the plaintiff. A rule nisi was granted accordingly.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench gave judgment in favour of the defendant, and discharged the rule nisi with costs.\nFrom that judgment the plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court.\nThe following are the material facts of the case:\u2014\nIn 1875; after the defendant had been some short time in the Boyne settlement, he conceived the idea of erecting a saw-mill on the Boyne; and, to carry out the design, he required the sw \u00bc of section 30, tp. 6, range 4 west.\nOn the 15th February, 1875, the plaintiff, who had entered an adjacent quarter section as a homestead, got from the Dominion Land Agent at Emerson the following pre-emption receipt:\n\"DOMINION LANDS OFFICE,\n\"Emerson, Feb. 15th, 1875.\n\" Wm. Alexander Farmer has entered to pre-empt the sw \u00bc of section 30, township 6, range 4 west.\n\"GEO NEWCOMB,\"\n\"In charge District No. 2.\"\nIn May, 1875, defendant filed certain affidavits to prove that plaintiff had abandoned his homestead, or had forfeited it by not making sufficient improvements upon it, and claimed the right to a homestead entry for the sw \u00bc of section 30, (plaintiff's pre-emption), and a pre-emption entry for plaintiff's homestead. Immediately after leaving the affidavits and signing the application and making the affidavit for a homestead entry of the lands in question and handing in the fee of $10, the defendant returned to the Boyne settlement, and went into actual possession and occupation of the lands.\nAbout the same time plaintiff applied to purchase his pre-emption claim, tendering a Military bounty warrant in payment.\nBoth these applications were made to the local agent at Emerson, within whose district the land in question is situated. The case being referred to the general agent he found that defendant had already been entered for two homesteads, and that this application, if granted, would make the third homestead he had obtained. He therefore instructed the local agent that defendant had forfeited all right to a homestead entry, and that his application was null and void, and that he would act regarding plaintiff's application precisely as though no conflicting application had been received.\nMr. New comb, the local agent, in consequence of this decision, sent the following letter to the defendant: \"\nOFFICE OF DOMINION LANDS,\n\"Emerson, June 2nd, 1875.\n\" SIR,\u2014I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your application to homestead sw 30, 6, 4 w., and affidavits in support of same, also your $10 fee and abandonment of previous claim, and to inform you that it is impossible for me to give you the entry applied for without special instructions, as my books show that you have already made two homestead entries, and that is all the law allows any person to make.\n\" Your $10 will be here awaiting instructions from you.\n\" I have the honor to be, Sir,\n\"Your obedient servant,\n\"GEO. NEWCOMB.\n\"W. G. LIVINGSTONE, Esq.,\nHeadingly.\"\nOn June 5th, 1875, defendant wrote as follows:\n\"WINNIPEG, June 5th, 1875.\n\"G. NEWCOMB, Esq.,\n\"Emerson.\n\"DEAR SIR:\u2014I received yours of June the 2nd, No. 473, and in reply would say, that I have not made more than one entry. The lot which was entered for me at High Bluff was taken away from me by the Department, and the other given in lieu of it; so I have only abandoned one lot. I spoke to Mr. Codd about the matter, and he told me I would be allowed to make the entry, so I hope this will be satisfactory, and that you will forward me receipt at once.\nAnd oblige,\n\" Yours,\n\" W. G-. LIVINGSTONE.\"\nThe agent then answered:\n\"OFFICE OF DOMINION LANDS,\n\" Emerson, June 7th, 1875.\n\"SIR,\u2014I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 5th June, and to inform you that your application to enter the s. w. \u00bc of 30, tp. 6, range 4 west, cannot he recognized.\"\nI therefore return your $10 enclosed.\n\" I have the honor to be, sir,\n\" Your obedient servant,\n\" GEO. NEWCOMB.\n\"To W. G. LIVINGSTONE, Esq., 44\n\u201cHeadingly.\"\nThereupon defendant proceeded immediately to Winnipeg to lay his case before the agent, D. Codd, at the same time placing in Mr. D. Codd's hands a letter, showing under what circumstances a lot had been withdrawn from him, and another given. This claim was forwarded to Ottawa to the honorable the Minister of the Interior about the same time, and a receipt was acknowledged of the same, bearing the date of the 25th June, signed by J. S. Dennis, Surveyor General.\nOn the 25th April, 1876, defendant was informed by a letter signed by the agent of the Dominion Lands Office, Winnipeg, that the title of the land in question was legally vested in the plaintiff.\nOn the 8th May, 1876, defendant forwarded a petition to the Minister of the Interior, alleging that he had occupied the said lot since the 7th May, 1875, to the present day ; that he had been living with his family on the said lot; that he had built a house, stables, &c, and had six acres under crop ; and that all these improvements were made by him bond fide, and considering all the time that his claim was legal, just, and could not be set aside upon any ground whatever; that the reason alleged by Mr. Newcomb was not supported by the facts ; that he never abandoned two homesteads ; that the plaintiff, at the time he made application for the said lot, had not complied with the law ; that he had no improvements whatever made upon the lots claimed by him (plaintiff) as homestead and pre-emption, and therefore had lost all claim upon the same and prayed that his entry for the said lot s. w. 1\/2 of 30, township 6, range 4 west, be confirmed, and that justice be done in the premises.\nThis petition was acknowledged on the J50th June, 1876.\nThe case was then considered by the Minister and the officers of the Department, and on the 10th July, 1878, the Surveyor General informed the defendant that the Minister could not sustain his action in the matter in deliberately settling upon the land after he had been notified by the agent of the prior claim thereto by the plaintiff, and on the 12th Sept, 1878, letters patent were issued by Crown for these lands in favor of the plaintiff.\nMr. Bethune, Q. C, for appellant:\nThe first point I will argue is, that the Chief Justice had no jurisdiction to entertain the equitable defence set up to this action. By the statute of the Legislature of the province of Manitoba, 34 Vic, c. 2, sec. 1, it is, amongst other things, enacted \" that the Court of Queen's Bench shall possess such powers and authorities in relation to matters of local or provincial jurisdiction as in England are distributed amongst the Superior Courts of Law and Equity and of Probate,\" and by section thirty of the same statute it is enacted \" that the Chief Justice shall make rules to regulate the practice of the court, and shall prescribe the forms of proceeding to be used, but until such rules are made, the practice and proceedings shall be regulated by the rules in force in England at the time of the transfer of this province to Canada, in so far as such rules can be applied to the circumstances of this province,\" but by a subsequent act the other judges must concur with the Chief Justice. And by the subsequent statute of the same Legislature, 38 Vic, c. 12, s. 1, it is in substance enacted that the forms and practice of the Queen's Bench in Manitoba are to be regulated by the rules of evidence and practice and procedure as the same were on the 15th July, 1870.\nThe practice therefore is the same as that which prevailed in England in 1870; by that practice no equitable defence could be set up to this action.\nThe letters patent remain valid until the pronouncing of a judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction made in a suit brought for the purpose of setting it aside. Such a decree or judgment could be pronounced only upon a bill in Equity or upon a scirefacias at the instance of the Attorney General, or some person having such an interest in the land as gave him a right to maintain such a suit.\nThen as to the Dominion statute 35 Vic, c. 23, s. 65, it was not intended to prescribe any mode of procedure in the provincial courts, and even by s. 69 of 35 Vic., c. 23, it is clear that a direct proceeding ought to be taken for the purpose of setting aside the patent. The terms \"upon action, bill or plaint,\" show that it is at the instance of a plaintiff that the jurisdiction is to be exercised and not by way of defence or cross-relief.\nThis brings me to the second point, that the respondent had no locus standi to impeach the issue of the patent to the appellant as he never acquired any interest in the land.\nThe learned counsel then contended upon the facts that the respondent's claim was merely on the bounty of the Crown, and could not have been enforced against the Crown even if no patent had been issued.\nThe respondent is a mere volunteer, having given no consideration, and could not therefore ask the interposition of the court against the Crown, and cannot now ask the aid of the court against the appellant, who is a purchaser from the Crown. Boulton v. Jeffrey ([1]) ; Proctor v. Grant ([2]) ; Stevens v. Cook ([3]) ; Cosgrave v. Corbett ([4]):\nMr. Boyd, Q. C, for respondent:\nI will first deal with the objection taken by the plaintiff at the trial, that it was not competent for the defendant in this form of action to introduce evidence impeaching the patent to the plaintiff under 35 Vic, c. 23, sec. 69. I contend that an appeal will not lie to this court in a matter of practice. The evidence was taken in accordance with precedent in the Court of Queen's Bench, Manitoba ; and in England an Appellate Court will not interfere in a matter of practice. Henderson v. Malcolm (5) ; Walcot v. Northern By. Co. (6). The court has only declared that the Crown has issued a patent in error. In Reese v. Attorney General ([5]) it was held that the Attorney General was not necessarily a party to a proceeding to set aside a patent. In Manitoba there is but one court, and the course of procedure sanctioned by the Chief Justice avoids circuity of action and multiplicity of suits.\nThe learned counsel then reviewed the facts of the case and contended that assuming the facts to be fully known to the Crown, there was manifest error in law ; assuming the facts not to be known, there was error as to facts ; in either case the patent was issued in error or improvidence, and relied on the following as authorities for setting aside patents issued under such circumstances: 35 Vic., c. 23, sec. 69; Dougall v. Laing ([6]) ; Attorney General v. McNulty ([7]) ; Lawrence v. Pomeroy ([8]); Attorney General v. Garbutt ([9]) ; Stevens v. Cook ([10]) ; Boulton v. Jeffrey ([11]).\nMr. Bethune, Q. C, in reply:\nThis case is not within Lawrence v. Pomeroy ([12]), because the actual settlement was within the knowledge of the Crown. The line of decisions in Ontario proceed upon statutes which are applicable to the province of Manitoba.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nI think it quite unimportant whether a defendant in Manitoba could or could not avail himself of an equitable defence in an ejectment suit, because the plaintiff made out a clear case under a Crown grant, and the defendant did not show that he had any legal or equitable defence to the action, he did not show any grant or conveyance from the Crown, nor any legal title or equitable interest in the land under any statutory provision; in other words, he showed no locus standi enabling him to attack the letters patent, even if they could be impeached in such a proceeding, j I think the defendant is not in possession under the statute, not having complied with its terms, and that he has therefore no parliamentary title to the possession of the land, nor any title whatever that can prevail against the title of the plaintiff under the letters patent. Therefore, the letters patent should have been received and acted on as conveying a good and valid title to the plaintiff ; on this simple ground, I think the judgment should be reversed.\nFOURNIER, HENRY and TASCHEREAU, J. J., concurred.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nI have read with the greatest attention the very able judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the province of Manitoba in this case, especially that accompanying his verdict rendered in favor of the defendant, which contains his criticism of the evidence as taken before him, as also the evidence so taken. Adopting, then, in this case the conclusions of facts arrived at by the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba, I am free to admit that, assuming the evidence before him to be all the evidence that could be offered affecting the points decided by him, he has made out a very strong case to justify the Dominion Government in taking proceedings to recall and avoid the letters patent under which the plaintiff claims, as issued improvidently and in error and mistake of facts, occasioned by wrong information as to the true state of the case communicated by the local officials to their superiors at Ottawa ; but I am at the same time unable to concur in the conclusions of law arrived at by the Court, that in this case the defendant is entitled to judgment, or that in this action the letters patent can be declared to be null and void.\nBy the statute law of the province of Manitoba it is enacted that the Chief Justice and Judges of the Court of Queen's Bench of the province shall make rules, to regulate the practice of the Court and shall prescribe the forms of proceeding to be used, but until such rules are made the practice and proceedings shall be regulated by the rules in force in England on the 15th July, 1870.\nIt was admitted in argument that no rules have been made by the Judges under this authority This case must therefore be governed by the rules prevailing in England in July, 1870, and as no such defence could be set up in ejectment in England, so neither can it in Manitoba. The evidence, as taken therefore cannot affect or prejudice the plaintiff's rights in this suit, nor until he shall be called upon under the Act to support the letters patent when assailed by action, bill, or plaint, under 35 Vic, c. \u00a33, sec. 69, can he be required to offer evidence in support of them. \"Whether the Courts in the province of Upper Canada (upon the authority of the judgments of which Courts the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba wholly rests his argument in the case before us, and in which province the statute law does authorize equitable defences in actions of ejectment,) would entertain, as an equity capable of enforcement by way of defence to an action of ejectment, a claim of the nature of that of the defendant in the case before us, we are not called upon to determine. I express no opinion upon that question, reserving all consideration of it until it shall arise. 1 may observe, however, that hitherto no such case has presented itself in the courts, that I am aware of. Moreover, it is to be observed that the language of the statute law of old Canada, which vested in a person interested in land under contract with the Crown, an estate in the land recognizable in the Courts both of law and equity, is very different from the language of the Dominion Lands Acts, which constitute the sole authority regulating the disposition j. of the Dominion Lands in the province of Manitoba. What, then, is meant in the learned Chief Justice's judgment by the expression \" the common law of the Crown Lands Department,\" \" by which law \" he says, \" it was incompetent for the Crown to sell or for the plaintiff to purchase these lands,\" I confess I do not very clearly apprehend. The application of the term \"squatter sovereignty,\" also made use of by the learned Chief Justice, does not appear to me to be more accurate. The claims of squatters in old Canada were recognized upon the principle of its having been a usage of the Crown for many years in disposing of its lands to give, purely ex gratia, a preference to persons who had actually cleared and cultivated land, in ignorance of any prior claim, although they had originally entered without title. But it is obvious that inasmuch as the disposition of the land in question was wholly governed by the Dominion Lands Act of 1872 and the practice and regulations of the Department under that Act, upon which alone the defendant must rely for any title he has, no usage can have yet grown up of the nature of that referred to in Cosgrove v. Corbett ([13]), and other like cases; moreover, the Courts have in no case that I am aware of recognized and enforced against a patentee of the Crown a claim set up by a squatter who had entered in direct opposition to the authority of the Department and with knowledge that the subsequent patentee set up a claim to the lot which the officials in the Department rightly or wrongly recognized, and recognizing subsequently granted him letters patent. In fine, whether the local officials acted rightly or wrongly in refusing to entertain the defendant's application and to enter him as a homestead claimant on the lot in question and to keep his money and to give him a receipt therefor under the provisions of the Act, it is plain upon the evidence that they did so refuse, and although that refusal may, under the circumstances, justify the Crown in taking proceedings under the Act to repeal the letters patent, I cannot see in the Dominion Lands Act of 1872 anything that can be said to justify the judgment that it has given to the defendant either at law or in equity a parliamentary title which the Courts can, in this action, pronounce to be preferable to the title vested in the plaintiff under his letters patent. In my opinion, therefore, the judgment of the Court below must be reversed, and a verdict and judgment in the action of ejectment be ordered to be entered for the plaintiff.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Ross and Killam.\nSolicitors for respondents: Frederick McKenzie\n[1] 1 Grant's E. & A.

On the face of the policy it appeared that there was \u201cfurther insurance, $8,000,\u201d and the policy had endorsed upon it the following condition, being statutory condition No. 8, R.S.O. ch. 162: \u201cThe company is not liable for loss if there is any prior insurance in any other company, unless the company\u2019s assent thereto appears herein or is endorsed hereon, nor if any subsequent insurance is effected in any other company, unless and until the company assent thereto by writing signed by a duly authorized agent.\u201d Among the insurances, which formed a portion of the \u201cfurther insurance\u201d for $8,000 mentioned in the policy, was one for $2,000 in the Western Insurance Company, which appellant allowed to expire, substituting a policy for the same amount in The Queen Insurance Company, without having obtained the consent of or notified the respondents.\nHeld,\u2014Reversing the judgment of the Court a quo, that the condition as to subsequent insurance must be construed to point to further insurance beyond the amount allowed by the policy, and not to a policy substituted for one of like amount allowed to lapse, and therefore the policy sued upon was not avoided by the non-communication of the $2,000 insurance in The Queen Insurance Company.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe action was brought in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, for Ontario, on a policy of insurance made by the defendants, dated 28th April, 1877, insuring plaintiff against loss or damage by fire to the amount of $2,000, on a general stock of hardware, &c.\nThe property was destroyed by fire on the 3rd August, 1877.\nThe case was tried at the Fall Assizes of 1878, at Guelph, before Mr. Justice Galt, without a jury, and a verdict entered for the plaintiff for $2,142.50.\nIn Michaelmas Term, 42nd Vic., Bethune, Q.C., obtained a rule nisi, calling upon the plaintiff to shew cause why the verdict for plaintiff obtained at the trial should not be set aside and a verdict rendered for the defendants, on the ground that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, and on the grounds that the defendants established the defence relied upon by the defen- dants at the trial; that is to say, that the plaintiff did not disclose, at the time of the making of the application, the existence of the policy in the Provincial Insurance Company, and that there was a breach of warranty in not disclosing buildings within one hundred feet of the risk, and that there was no notice to defendants of the subsequent insurance in the Queen Insurance Company.\nThe rule nisi was discharged by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench. The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal, and the appeal was allowed.\nThe principal point argued on this appeal was whether or not an insurance effected with the Queen Insurance Company subsequently to the granting of the policy sued upon, and which was in substitution only for a lapsed policy for the like amount which was in existence with the Western Insurance Company at the time of the policy sued upon being effected, was a subsequent insurance and within the meaning of statutory condition No. 8, R.S.O. c. 162.\nMr. McCarthy, Q.C., for appellant:\u2014\nThe only ground upon which the respondent\u2019s counsel can rely before this court is, that the Court of Appeal were right in their construction of the condition as regards subsequent insurance. Now what are the facts:\n1. The respondent company assented to other insurances on the property covered by their policy, to the extent of $8,000; 2. The appellant never had insurance on this property beyond that amount at one time, exclusive of respondent\u2019s policy; 3. The respondents make no pretence that the Queen Insurance Company was not as respectable and as well managed a company as any of the companies with whom the appellant was insured to their knowledge.\nCan it be fairly said that if one of these policies lapse, the re-insuring for the same amount in the same company, on precisely the same terms, is a \u201csubsequent insurance,\u201d within the meaning of the condition? It is the rule of insurance offices, when the insurance is for three years, not to renew, but to require a new application, and to issue a new policy; this is clearly a new contract of insurance, and in every such case, unless the consent of the other insuring companies be obtained, vitiates every other insurance.\nAnd if the making of a new contract of insurance in the same company cannot in reason be deemed a subsequent insurance, why should insuring in a different company be differently viewed?\nIn the construction of contracts, it is the spirit and not the letter that governs, and it is the business of courts to ascertain the spirit, or, in other words, what was intended by, or the intention of, the parties, and that being ascertained, it overrides every other consideration. Verba intentioni debent inservire. Per cur., Ford v. Beech (in error)[1], and, as observed by Lord Hale, the Judges ought to be anxious and subtle to invent reasons and means to make acts effectual, according to the just intent of the parties. Broom\u2019s legal maxims,[2].\nThe learned counsel also cited: Carpenter v. The Providence Washington Ins. Co.[3]; Prop., &c., in Dunstable v. Hillsborough Mut. Ins. Co.[4]; Lixom v. Boston Mut. F. Ins. Co.[5]\nMr. Bethune, Q.C., for respondent:\u2014\nAfter stating that he relied also on the construction put on the eighth statutory condition as varied in the case by the court below, contended that the insurance with the Queen Insurance Company was a subsequent insurance, and was within the meaning of the condition already referred to, and that its having been effected without the consent of the respondents having been obtained, made the policy void.\nThe respondents had an interest in knowing in what other companies insurances were effected, as the respondents were entitled to cancel the contract of insurance made by them, and might have done so if they had known that the insurance had been effected in a company with the management of which the respondents were not satisfied.\nIt seems quite clear that the respondents were entitled to withhold their assent to this subsequent insurance, and the simple withholding of such assent avoided the policy.\nThe learned counsel cited: McBride v. The Gore District Fire Ins. Co.[6]; Hatton v. The Beacon Ins. Co.[7]; Mason v. The Andes Ins. Co.[8]; Weinaugh, Administrator of Burgy v. The Provincial Ins. Co.[9]; Hendrikson v. Queen Ins. Co.[10]; Bruce v. Gore Dist. Mut. Ins. Co.[11]\nMr. McCarthy, Q.C., in reply.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThe argument before us became reduced to the question whether or not an insurance effected in the Queen Insurance Company subsequently to the granting of the policy sued upon, and which was in substitution only for a lapsed policy for the like amount which was in existence with the Western Insurance Company at the time of the policy sued upon being effected, avoided this latter policy? The policy sued upon in the body of it contained a recognition of $8,000 further insurance, (in addition to the amount secured thereby) being in existence and allowed. The contention of the respondents was, that the $8,000 thus allowed included the policy in the Western, which was for $2,000, and that the effecting a policy in the Queen for $2,000, although merely in substitution for this in the Western, which was allowed to lapse, without the consent of the respondents, was in breach of a condition on the policy to the effect that\nThe company is not liable for loss if there is any prior insurance in any other company, unless the company\u2019s assent appears herein or is endorsed hereon, nor if any subsequent insurance is effected in any other company, unless and until the company assent thereto in writing signed by a duly authorized agent.\nThe body of the policy must be read with the conditions endorsed, so as to give to the whole a rational construction; and, in my opinion, the construction put upon it by the Court of Common Pleas is the correct one.\nIn view of the fact that the policy on its face allows additional insurance to the amount of $8,000, over and above the amount covered by the policy sued on, the condition as to subsequent insurance must, I think, be construed to point to further insurance beyond the amount so allowed, and not to a policy substituted for one of like amount allowed to lapse.\nThe respondents, if they desired to avoid their policy in the event of such a substitutional policy being effected, should be more precise in the language used.\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed with costs, and the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas be re-affirmed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Maitland McCarthy.\nSolicitor for respondents: Thomas C.

In 1870, the lot in question, less two acres, was sold for taxes assessed and accrued due for the years 1864 to \u201869 to one D.K., who sold to defendant; and as to the said two acres, the defendant became purchaser thereof at a sale for taxes in 1873. The warrants for the sale of the lands were signed by the warden, had the seal of the county, and authorized the treasurer \u201cto levy upon the various parcels of land hereinafter mentioned for the arrears of taxes due thereon and set opposite to each parcel of land,\u201d and attached to these warrants were the lists of lands to be sold, including the lands claimed by plaintiff. The lists and the warrant were attached together by being pasted the whole length of the top, but the lists were not authenticated by the signature of the warden and the seal of the county.\nBy sec. 128 of the Assessment Act, 32 Vic., ch. 36, O., the warden is required to return one of the lists of the lands to be sold for taxes, transmitted to him, &c., to the treasurer, with a warrant thereto annexed under the hand of the warden and seal of the county, &c.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court below[1], that upon the lands in question being surrendered to the Crown, they became ordinary unpatented lands, and upon being granted became liable to assessment.\n2. That the list and warrant may be regarded as one entire instrument, and as the substantial requirements of the statute had been complied with, any irregularities had been cured by the 156th sec., ch. 180 Rev. Stats. Ont. (Fournier and Henry, J.J., dissenting.)\nTHIS was an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas[2], discharging, a rule nisi to set aside a verdict for the defendant, and to enter a verdict for the plaintiff.\nThe facts appear in the judgments.\nMr. Boyd, Q.C, for appellant:\u2014\nThe sales were not legal, there having been no proper authority to the treasurer to sell. Both sales were had under the Assessment Act of 1868-9. Sec. 128 of the Act requires the warden to authenticate the lists of lands in arrears with his signature and the seal of the corporation, &c. Here there was no authenticated list, and all the warrant directs is the sale of \u201cthe land hereinafter mentioned,\u201d and there is no lands in it; the warrant is a complete instrument in itself, it makes no reference to any list attached, and the list that is attached, which is without seal or signature, makes no reference to any warrant. You cannot prove by parol evidence that the statutory provisions have been complied with. Where the statute requires a particular thing to be done, you cannot deprive a man of his property until it is done. Hall v. Hill[3]; in re Monsell[4]; in re McDowell v. Wheatly[5].\nThe warrant was the foundation of the sale, and we contend that the authentication of the list as required by the statute is a condition precedent to and the foundation for the warrant. Kenney v. May[6]; Green-street v. Paris[7].\nThe English authorities with regard to the poor rates are also very applicable. Re Justices of North Staffordshire[8].\nThe 156th section of the Assessment Act is relied on as to the first deed. This section does not make valid all deeds. See Harrison\u2019s Manual 4 ed., p. 748, and authorities there collected.\nThen the lands in question were Indian lands, or lands held in trust for the Indians by the Crown, and were not liable to sale for taxes.\nIn Street v. The County of Kent[9] it was held that there was no law rendering liable to assessment Crown lands in Upper Canada, except such provisions as were contained in the Acts relative to the assessment of property. 16 Vic., ch. 159, sec. 24, Con. Stat. Can., ch. 22, sec. 27, and 23 Vic. ch. 2, sec. 27 only applied to Lower Canada, and crown, clergy and school lands, although sold or agreed to be sold, were not liable to taxation unless a lease or license of occupation had been issued to the purchaser, and the section of the Public Lands Act, authorizing the issue of leases and licenses of occupation, was mandatory and imperative; also see Austin v. Co. Simcoe[10].\nThe Act 27 Vic., ch. 19. upon which respondent relies, was passed to meet the case of Street v. Co. Kent.\nIt is admitted by the Courts below that, prior to this Act, Indian lands, whether sold or unsold, were not liable to taxation; but the learned judges were of opinion that the language of sec. 9 of this Act was broad and general enough to cover them. The appel- lant, however, contends that sec. 9 of the Act in question was only intended for public lands, and must be read in connection with the exemption clause of the Assessment Act, to which it is an exception, and this view is supported by sec. 11 of the same Act which amended sec. 108 of the Assessment Act (ch. 55 Con. Stat., U.C.) so as to include the lands made liable by the 9th sec.; and the 108th sec. of the Assessment Act refers only to the Commissioner of Crown Lands and not to the Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs.\nThe object was to make these lands free from taxation in order to get a larger amount when sold.\nI also contend that the land, by the Confederation Act, was in the Crown as represented by the Dominion Government, and was granted by the Crown after the alleged taxes accrued; the Crown therefore could disregard the taxes, and the patent from the Crown must, in a court of law, prevail against the tax title until the patent has been cancelled or vacated in a proceeding to which the Crown is made a party.\nThen my last point is that, as to the two acres, appellant has a statutory right to have a finding in his favor. Until the sheriff executes the conveyance and gives deed, the title remains in the patentee of the Crown.\nEvidence that he was purchaser at the tax sale is no title; he was bound to produce the certificate of sale. As a matter of law, our case was complete when we put in our patent from the Crown, and it is for him to prove title.\nMr. Reeves for respondent:\u2014\nAs to this last point, if the objection had been made at the trial, then the defendant would have been entitled to an equitable plea. Here we have a valid deed, and it must be presumed there was a certificate of sale. The deed can only be issued after the certificate has been issued. The principal point on which my learned friend relies is, that because the list of lands was not authenticated by the signature of the warden and the seal of the corporation, the sale is invalid, and they say sections 156 and 131, ch. 180 Rev. Stats, Ont., cannot cure an invalid warrant. The cases of Morgan v. Perry[11] and Fenton v. McWain[12] show such a defect or irregularity would be cured by sec. 156; but the manner in which the warrant and list of lands were incorporated made them, one instrument, and the list was, under the circumstances; authenticated, by the affixing of the seal to the warrant, and there has been a substantial compliance with the statute. The object of the legislature in requiring the seal of the corporation to be affixed to the list, was to identify the list as being the list of lands liable to be sold, and if it is established, either from the construction of the warrant or from other evidence, that the list in question was the list of lands liable to be sold which had been forwarded by the treasurer to the warden, and by him returned to the treasurer with the warrant, this will be sufficient.\nThe learned counsel also referred to Cooley Const. Limit.[13], and to Torrey v. Milbury[14].\nNow, as to the question raised, whether these lands, having been held in trust by the Crown, as Indian lands, should not be liable to taxation, it has been sought to limit the words public lands in the Act 27 Vic., ch. 19; but why not give a full meaning to these words? This Act was expressly passed for the purpose of doing away with all such distinctions. These Indian lands were present to the mind of the legislature when this Act was passed, and surely some limitation would have been made as to this interest, if they had intended it to be exempted. The argument based on the fact that the patent was issued by the Dominion Government after the accrual of the taxes, and, therefore, in a court of law, must prevail against the tax title until the patent has been cancelled in a proceeding to which the Crown is made a party, can have no weight, for the patent was issued more than a year before the sale. At the time the taxes were properly assessed, and there was no reason to suppose the land would be sold for the payment of taxes.\nMr. Boyd, Q.C., in reply.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nThis was an action of ejectment brought to recover possession of lot No. 22, in the 13th concession of the Township of Keppel in the County of Grey.\nThe writ issued on the 28th September, 1877, and was served 13th same month. Plaintiff claims title under letters patent issued by Dominion Government, dated 4th June, 1869.\nThe defendant appeared, 28th September, 1877, defended for the whole of the land, denied plaintiff\u2019s title, asserted title in himself, except as to two acres by virtue of a deed dated 26th September, 1873, from David Keltie, who claimed under a tax deed from Warden and Treasurer of the County of Grey, dated 10th February, 1872; and as to the two acres, as purchaser thereof at a sale for taxes by the treasurer of the County of Grey, on the 18th November, 1873.\nThe cause was tried on the 11th October, 1877, when verdict was rendered for the defendant. In Michaelmas Term, November 21, 1877, plaintiff obtained a rule nisi to set aside the verdict as being contrary to law and evidence, and to enter a verdict for plaintiff. In Hilary Term, February 4, 1878, the rule nisi was discharged.\nThe plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and on 22nd March, 1879, that court dismissed the appeal with costs. Against this judgment plaintiff now appeals.\nAs to the first sale, if it had been irregular for the cause assigned, I think the 155th section, 32 Vic., c. 36, Ont., applies and cures the irregularity. As to the second deed: as to the want of the corporate seal and signature of the warden, while it is much to be regretted that officers who have plain and explicit directions given them do not follow the terms of the statute and literally fulfil its injunctions, still I think, in the case where the statute has been unquestionably substantially complied with, I am not prepared to differ from the Court of Common Pleas and the Court of Appeal and to say that the warrant and list are not to be regarded as one entire instrument, and that the words \u201chereinafter mentioned\u201d is not such a reference to the list as to incorporate it in the warrant, and so make it form part of the warrant, and so be under the corporate seal and signature of the warden. For the reasons given by the Court below, I am of opinion that, although the lands in question had been Indian lands, they were in the hands of grantees liable to be sold for taxes.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\nLes faits de cette cause donnent lieu aux deux questions suivantes: 1. Le lot de terre en question en cette cause, faisant partie des terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es et d\u00e9tenues par la couronne en fid\u00e9icommis pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des sauvages, \u00e9tait-il sujet \u00e0 \u00eatre vendu pour taxes?\n2. La vente qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en cette cause \u00e9tait-elle l\u00e9gale et conforme aux dispositions du statut \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard?\nQuant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question je n\u2019h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer que je concours pleinement dans les raisons donn\u00e9es par l\u2019honnorable juge en chef Moss pour en arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que le terrain en question \u00e9tait cotisable et partant sujet \u00e0 \u00eatre vendu pour arr\u00e9rages de taxes. Sur la seconde question concernant la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s adopt\u00e9s pour effectuer cette vente, j\u2019ai le malheur de ne pas \u00eatre du m\u00eame avis.\nEn cas de vente pour arr\u00e9rages de taxes, les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s \u00e0 suivre sont indiqu\u00e9s par la sec. 128, 32 Vict., ch. 36[15]. Le tr\u00e9sorier doit d\u2019abord d\u2019apr\u00e8s cette section faire une liste en double de toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qui doivent \u00eatre vendues pour taxes, avec le montant d\u00fb par chaque lot mis en regard de tel lot.\nChaque double de cette liste doit \u00eatre authentiqu\u00e9e par la signature du pr\u00e9fet et le sceau de la corporation, l\u2019un doit \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au bureau du greffier du comt\u00e9 et l\u2019autre renvoy\u00e9 au tr\u00e9sorier avec un warrant y annex\u00e9; ce warrant doit aussi \u00eatre sous la signature du pr\u00e9fet et le sceau du comt\u00e9. Ainsi, deux conditions sont imp\u00e9rativement exig\u00e9es avant de pouvoir proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une vente pour taxe\u2014la l\u00e8re, la pr\u00e9paration de la liste qui doit \u00eatre authentiqu\u00e9e par la signature du pr\u00e9fet et le sceau de la corporation\u2014la 2me, la pr\u00e9paration d\u2019un warrant authentiqu\u00e9 de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re par la signature du pr\u00e9fet et le sceau de la corporation. Ce sont deux documents distincts et s\u00e9par\u00e9s qui apr\u00e8s leur compl\u00e8te confection doivent \u00eatre annex\u00e9s l\u2019un \u00e0 l\u2019autre pour \u00eatre remis au tr\u00e9sorier. Mais chacun d\u2019eux doit \u00eatre complet suivant la disposition du statut. Ces formalit\u00e9s sont essentielles pour la validit\u00e9 de chaque document, et elles ne sont pas moins importantes pour l\u2019un que pour l\u2019autre. Un warrant qui ne serait pas rev\u00eatu de la signature du pr\u00e9fet et du sceau du comt\u00e9 serait sans doute consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme absolument nul. Pourquoi n\u2019en serait-il pas de m\u00eame pour la liste qui doit \u00eatre faite absolument de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re et dont la confection doit pr\u00e9c\u00e9der la pr\u00e9paration du warrant? Il y a de fort bonnes raisons pour qu\u2019il en soit ainsi. C\u2019est afin sans doute qu\u2019il ne puisse \u00eatre fait aucune addition quelconque \u00e0 cette liste et pour prot\u00e9ger les contribuables contre la fraude que la loi exige cette formalit\u00e9 importante de l\u2019apposition de la signature du pr\u00e9fet et du sceau du comt\u00e9. La loi ayant impos\u00e9 la m\u00eame formalit\u00e9 \u00e0 ces deux documents, dans des termes pr\u00e9cis qui n\u2019admettent point de doute, je n\u2019ai pas le droit de faire une distinction et de dire, que n\u00e9cessaire pour le warrant elle ne l\u2019est pas pour la liste.\nDans le cas actuel la liste des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qui devaient \u00eatre vendues n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la sec. 128; elle n\u2019est ni sign\u00e9e par le pr\u00e9fet ni rev\u00eatue du sceau du comt\u00e9. Ces formalit\u00e9s n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accomplies que pour le warrant, la liste des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s n\u2019est ni sign\u00e9e ni scell\u00e9e comme le veut le statut,\u2014mais comme elle est annex\u00e9e au warrant on veut consid\u00e9rer les deux comme ne faisant qu\u2019un seul document. Cette annexion \u00e9tant aussi une formalit\u00e9 requise par le statut\u2014il m\u2019est impossible de comprendre comment son accomplissement peut dispenser de remplir une autre formalit\u00e9 plus importante exig\u00e9e par le langage imp\u00e9ratif de la loi. Lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019expropriation des individus toutes les formalit\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires pour constituer l\u2019autorisation de vendre doivent \u00eatre remplies. On ne peut y substituer des \u00e9quivalents. En vain argumenterait-on qu\u2019il arrive souvent que les tribunaux admettent comme valables des \u00e9crits priv\u00e9s dont les signatures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement appos\u00e9es,\u2014que m\u00eame des documents solennels, comme les commissions des plus hauts fonctionnaires publics, sont attest\u00e9s par la signature de Sa Majest\u00e9 ou du Gouverneur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral, mise le plus souvent au commencement de ces documents; la loi n\u2019ayant pas dans \u2018 ces cas prescrit un mode particulier, il n\u2019y a pas de raison pour d\u00e9clarer ill\u00e9gale ces sortes d\u2019attestations. Mais la pratique suivie dans ces cas ne saurait justifier une violation aussi manifeste de la loi que celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise dans la confection de la liste des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qui devaient \u00eatre vendues par la municipalit\u00e9 du comt\u00e9 de Grey.\nCette liste est la preuve exig\u00e9e par la loi de l\u2019existence d\u2019une taxe pour laquelle la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 peut \u00eatre vendue; elle tient lieu d\u2019un jugement, et avant de lui en donner l\u2019effet, la loi a voulu qu\u2019elle f\u00fbt non seulement pr\u00e9par\u00e9e par le tr\u00e9sorier, mais qu\u2019elle ne p\u00fbt \u00eatre mise \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution par warrant qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u l\u2019attestation du plus haut officier municipal, afin, sans doute, de mettre les int\u00e9r\u00eats des contribuables sous la protection de cet officier. Ce n\u2019est pas le tr\u00e9sorier qui est responsable de l\u2019exactitude de cette liste\u2014ce n\u2019est pas \u00e0 lui que le contribuable l\u00e9s\u00e9, parce que sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 y aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 mal \u00e0 propos ins\u00e9r\u00e9e, pourrait s\u2019adresser pour une r\u00e9paration, mais bien au pr\u00e9fet auquel la loi a impos\u00e9 ce devoir., C\u2019est lui qui serait tenu responsable des cons\u00e9quences de toute faute ou n\u00e9gligence \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. La liste en question, est suivant moi, la base de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 pour vendre, c\u2019est le jugement, et le warrant tient lieu du fi. fa. dans les cas ordinaires. Le warrant, bien que r\u00e9gulier dans sa forme, ne peut pas plus dispenser d\u2019une liste authentiqu\u00e9e comme le veut la loi, qu\u2019un bref de fi. fa. parfait dans sa forme ne pourrait dispenser d\u2019un jugement avant de pouvoir ex\u00e9cuter les biens d\u2019un d\u00e9fendeur.\nEn l\u2019absence de la liste exig\u00e9e, il n\u2019y a pas de preuve l\u00e9gale de l\u2019existence d\u2019une taxe, et par cons\u00e9quent point d\u2019autorit\u00e9 pour vendre. Cette cause de nullit\u00e9 se rencontre dans les deux ventes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites du lot No. 22. Dans la cause de McKay vs. Chrysler[16] cette cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019une vente pour taxe \u00e9tait nulle, parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de preuve que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cotis\u00e9e. Le principe de cette d\u00e9cision est applicable \u00e0 cette cause. Il n\u2019y a pas ici, non plus, de preuve de l\u2019existence d\u2019une dette pour taxe, parceque la seule preuve faite n\u2019est pas celle que la loi requiert pour autoriser une vente. Quant \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de faire cette preuve, je me borne \u00e0 r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es dans la cause mentionn\u00e9e plus haut de McKay vs. Chrysler comme parfaitement applicables \u00e0 celle-ci. Je me fonde aussi sur les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es dans la m\u00eame cause pour \u00e9tablir que la sec. 156 du ch. 180, R.S.O. ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e pour couvrir la nullit\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant du d\u00e9faut d\u2019autorisation de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la vente, autorisation qui ne peut r\u00e9sulter que de la pr\u00e9paration d\u2019une liste en la forme impos\u00e9e par la loi.\nPour ces raisons, je serais d\u2019opinion d\u2019admettre l\u2019appel, mais la majorit\u00e9 de cette cour est d\u2019un avis contraire.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nIn consequence of the conclusion which I have arrived at in regard to the warrants under which the lands of the appellant were sold, it is unnecessary for me to discuss the question whether, under the circumstances, they, having been at one time Indian lands, were, when in his possession before his patent, liable to be taxed. I have, however, considered the subject, and have discovered strong reasons why they were not so liable, but as to that part of the case I need give no opinion.\nWithout the operation of the validating acts the common law throws upon the claimant under a tax deed the onus of proving every link in the chain of legal provisions to divest the title of the owner. It is, however, necessary for me to refer but to some of them. The warrants for the sale of the lands were signed and sealed by the warden as prescribed; but they, to my mind, are void for a patent ambiguity on the face of them. They are both in the same form, and each, is written on a page of foolscap paper, and bears at the foot the signature of the warden and the seal of the corporation of the County, and\nAuthorize, require, empower and command you (the Treasurer) to levy upon the various parcels of land hereinafter mentioned for the arrears of taxes due thereon and set opposite to each parcel of land with your costs.\nThese documents in no other way point to the lands to be levied on, and are, therefore, imperfect. There is no reference in them to any other paper or writing by which the lands could be identified, and the warrants are therefore defective. No lawyer would claim that a warrant for the arrest of a criminal, so referring to the charge made against him, would be good merely by annexing the information to it. No oral testimony can be admitted to supply such a patent defect. The same rule is applicable to the warrants in this case, and the wardens could no more be permitted to say they meant, in them, to refer to the lands mentioned in the lists, than a justice to say he referred in his warrant to the charge made in the information annexed to the warrant. But even if such evidence were admissible, it was not given in this case. Neither of the wardens was examined, and there is no evidence that at the time the warrants were signed or issued the lists were annexed to them. The only persons who could satisfactorily state whether or not, are the wardens themselves\u2014all else is mere hearsay. The treasurers who were the only witnesses examined as to this point were incompetent to speak to it. There is, too, another fatal objection. No lists as required by the statute were authenticated, and therefore there was no authority at all to issue a warrant.\nSection 128 of the Assessment Act of Ontario, 32 Vic., ch. 36, required that the treasurer of the county should\nSubmit to the warden of such county a list in duplicate of all the lands liable under the provisions of this Act to be sold for taxes with the amount of arrears against each lot set opposite to the same, and the warden shall authenticate each of such lists by affixing thereto the seal of the corporation and his signature, and one of such lists shall be deposited with the town clerk, and the other shall be returned to the treasurer with a warrant thereto annexed under the hand of the warden and the seal of the county, commanding him to levy upon the land for the arrears due thereon with his costs.\nBefore, then, the warden had authority to issue a warrant, his duty was first to authenticate the lists. To give himself jurisdiction the statute provided that he should so authenticate them. He had no right to question the wisdom or necessity of the peremptory legislative direction, nor have we. Many good and sufficient reasons might be shown for the provision, but that is unnecessary, for we have no right to speculate as to the sufficiency of them. That was for the legislature to decide, and having done so, it is not permissible for any one to question the decision. To give life or vitality to the lists as records on which to found subsequent proceedings the legislature has provided for doing so in a particular manner, otherwise the lists are in themselves no better than waste paper. They may be correct, or grossly the opposite; and may be the production of an unauthorized person. They are not vouched by any responsible officer, and the legislature has wisely provided that before lands shall be sold the lists must be authenticated in a particular way and the highest official in the county held responsible for its correctness. This is necessary, and was intended for the due protection of property from the errors, negligence or frauds of municipal officers. The act of previous authentication of the lists by the warden is as necessary to give him jurisdiction to issue a warrant as if the statute had required that authentication by the act of another\u2014just as necessary as if the provision had been for it to have been by the treasurer, in which case without it the issue of a warrant by the warden would be wholly unauthorized and unjustifiable. Before authentication in the solemn manner prescribed, a duty was thrown upon the warden by a proper inquiry to ascertain the correctness of the list; but that legislative check was wholly withheld in regard to the warrants in this case. Did the legislature intend to leave it as a duty to be performed or not? If it was intended to leave it optional, why require it at all? Independently of the accepted construction of \u201cshall,\u201d when employed in a statute by which it is held to be imperative, we are in this case bound by the statutable provision. In sub\u2011sec. 2 of sec. 8 of ch. 1 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, the legislature plainly guides us. It provides that:\nThe word \u201cshall\u201d shall be construed as imperative; and the word \u201cmay\u201d as permissive.\nTo make a good and valid list it therefore became necessary to be authenticated as the imperative provision requires, and if not so authenticated a warrant might as legally be issued without any list at all. An execution extended on land without being founded on any judgment would be quite as effectual to sell and convey a man\u2019s property as the warrants in this case without the lists being authenticated, I feel bound to say that the warrants in this case gave no authority to sell. It is, however, urged that by sec. 155 of ch. 36 of 32 Vic. a title passes by the deed alone, or, at least, that the validity of the deed cannot be questioned after two years from the sale. That section provides that: Whenever lands are sold for arrears of taxes and the treasurer has given a deed for the same, such deed shall be to all intents and purposes valid and binding, except as against the Crown, if the same has not been questioned before some court of competent jurisdiction by some person interested in the land so sold within two years from the time of sale.\nIt has been judicially settled in Ontario and by this Court in McKay v. Chrysler[17], that arrears of taxes must be shown before the sale, and that the provision does not include a case wherein it is not shown such arrears existed. I refer particularly to the judgment of my learned brother Gwynne in that case, where in addition to his own views forcibly expressed he cites judgments from the appeal and other courts in Ontario. He cites approvingly at page 473 this language used by Draper, C.J., in a judgment delivered by him in reference to this statute.\nThe operation of this statute is to work a forfeiture. An accumulated penalty is imposed for an alleged default, and to satisfy the assessment charged, together with this penalty, the land of a proprietor may be sold, though he be in a distant part of the world and unconscious of the proceeding.\nTo support a sale under such circumstances it must he shown that those facts existed which are alleged to have created a forfeiture, and which are necessary to warrant the sale.\nI hold that the perfecting the lists by the authentication prescribed and a valid warrant are necessary. Blackwell, in his treatise on tax sales on the subject of similar validating statues, and after discussing the constitutionality of such statutes, says[18]:\u2014\nWhatever may be the decision upon the question of power, when it properly arises the moral injustice of such legislation cannot be denied, and it will be seen upon an examination of the authorities that when such arbitrary power has been exercised by the legislature, the courts have given a strict construction to the law and not extended its unjust operation beyond the very words of the statute[19]. See also Hughes v. Chester & Holyhead Railway[20]; and the remarks of Turner, L.J., in the same direction:\nThis is an act which interferes with private rights and private interests, and ought, therefore, according to all decisions on the subject, to receive a strict construction, so far as those rights and interests are concerned. This is so clearly the doctrine of the court that it is unnecessary to refer to cases on the subject. They might be cited almost without end.\nI shall hereafter apply this doctrine, and particularly when I come to refer to section 155, and the absence of evidence of a sale within the purview of that section.\nBy an Act of the Illinois Legislature it was declared that the deed should vest a perfect title in the purchaser, unless the land shall be redeemed according to law, or the former owner shall show that the taxes were paid, or that the land was not subject to taxation; but the Supreme Court of that state, in giving a construction to that statute, state the rule of the common law as to the burthen of proof and the strictness required in this class of cases, and that under that statute several preliminary facts to a legal sale are to be inferred by the deed, and the responsibility of proof shifted from the purchaser to the original owner, but the court deny that that statute will by any fair construction warrant the opinion that the auditor (here the Treasurer) selling land without authority, could by his conveyance transfer the title of the rightful owner.\nIn that case it was not shown that the land had been advertised as prescribed by the statute. The court held that \u201cthe publication of notice of sale as required by law was not one of those facts inferred from the deed, nor is the proof thereof thrown upon the former owner. Without proof of this fact, the auditor\u2019s deed was not evidence of the regularity and legality of the sale, and consequently conveyed no title to the purchaser.\u201d The case before us is a much stronger one, for, if my contention as to the warrant is right, there is not merely the absence of proof of some necessary fact, but a deed from a party without legal authority to convey. To conclude that a deed of land in the words of the section \u201csold for arrears of taxes\u201d is not to be questioned at all after two years is, to my mind, a monstrous proposition. I can imagine dozens of cases where the most unjust and improper results would necessarily flow from such a conclusion. It will be only necessary to state one case. It is largely the interests of non-resident owners that have been, or will be, affected. Without any knowledge of arrears existing a sale for (alleged) arrears of taxes takes place by no one authorized to make it, and the treasurer subsequently gives a deed. It would certainly be monstrous to hold that such a conveyance would pass the title, and still the clause in the statute, if literally construed, would make the conveyance available for that purpose. The clause must mean a sale as provided for, and it therefore becomes necessary to show by extrinsic evidence that a sale took place. To invoke the aid of the statute, such is necessary, but here we have no evidence at all that any sale took place. The only witness who refers to the sales says he was not treasurer in 1870, when the first is alleged to have taken place; does not say he was present; no date given or purchaser named, or who the land was sold by. There is no evidence to show the sale took place at the time and place named in the advertisements, and it is equally defective as to the second alleged sale. The newspapers to show the advertisements required by the statute were not put in evidence, except four numbers of the \u201cGazette\u201d in 1873. No paper or advertisement for the sale in 1870 was produced. No assessment rolls were put in to show the land was taxed, and, in fact, little but hearsay and improperly received evi- dence of any taxing at all. In my opinion, it would be a mockery of justice to deprive a man of his real estate by such evidence.\nIn addition to the objections I have suggested, I think it is necessary to show a legal sale by extrinsic evidence, that is, that, it was made by the proper officer at the time and place mentioned in the advertisements, and that the grantee or his assignee became the purchaser. The statute provides that the deed shall be made to the purchaser at the sale or his assigns. The conveyance of the 98 acres is to David Keltie, who is represented in the deed as the assignee of Fenton, who in it is alleged to have been the purchaser. To this there are two objections. If Fenton was the purchaser, that fact should have been proved, otherwise than by the mere statement of it in the deed, and secondly no assignment from him to Keltie was shown in compliance with the statute.\nIf, however, the appellant is considered as not entitled to recover for the 93 acres, I can see no reason why he should not recover for the remaining two acres. At the commencement of the suit he was entitled to recover for those two acres. Until the subsequent deed to the respondent, he had no defence for them. By the common law, as well as by the statute of Ontario, he was entitled to a judgment for his costs; and how he can be deprived of them I must say I have failed to discover.\nBy section 31, c. 51, of the Revised Statues of Ontario, it is provided that:\nIn case the title of the plaintiff, as alleged in the writ, existed at the time of service thereof, but had expired before the trial, the plaintiff shall notwithstanding be entitled to a verdict according to the fact, that he was entitled at the time of serving the writ and to judgment for his costs of suit.\nThis was adopted from C.S.U.C. c. 27, sec. 22. Clause 155 does not in any way affect his right to recover pro tanto, and as, I think, the necessary proof of the legality of the sale or of the rating was not given, and the warrant and list were defective, he is, under any circumstances, entitled to recover for the two acres.\nThe views I entertain and have expressed as to the operation of section 155 are in accordance with principles laid down by Blackwell on Tax Titles before alluded to in the third chapter, founded on and derived from judgments and decisions of the Supreme Courts in the States of New York, Illinois, Michigan, Tennessee and Ohio. Those judgments are cited as unanimous in every instance, and are recommended by the able manner in which the cases were considered and disposed of, and in the absence of authorities to the contrary I feel quite safe in following the decisions.\nAfter full and mature consideration I think the appellant is entitled to recover for his whole claim; that the appeal should be allowed and judgment given in his favor with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J., concurred in dismissing the appeal.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nI concur that the appeal should be dismissed, but I desire to add, that I am unable to perceive any bearing that my judgment in McKay v. Chrysler can have upon the present case. I should be very much surprised if anything could be found in that judgment in support of the position that it is competent for this court to suggest, and to act upon the suggestion, that the case of either a plaintiff or defendant was defective for insufficiency of evidence upon a point, not only not made a ground of appeal, but not suggested even in argument as an existing fact in any of the courts through which the case was passed, nor at the trial; if there had been any foundation for the suggestion, no doubt, counsel would have made the point. As to the quotation which has been made from my judgment in McKay v. Chrysler, those observations were applied by me to a point which did arise in that case, and obviously they can have no bearing upon this case, wherein no such point has been made.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Jackes & Galbraith.\nSolicitors for respondent: James Reeves.\n[1] 4 Ont.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, J.J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nConstruction of agreement\u2014Property in lumber\u2014Ownership and control of lumber until payment of draft given for stumpage under the agreement.\nThe respondents, owners of timber lands in New Brunswick, granted to C. & S. a license to cut lumber on 25 square miles. By the license it was agreed inter alia: \"Said stumpage to be paid in the following manner: Said company shall first deduct from the amount of stumpage on the timber or lumber cut by grantees on this license as aforesaid, an amount equal to the mileage paid by them as aforesaid, and the whole of the remainder, if any, shall, not later than the 15th April next, be secured by good endorsed notes, or other sufficient security, to be approved of by the said company, and payable on the 15th July next, and the lumber not to be removed from the brows or landings till the stumpage is secured as aforesaid.\n\"And said company reserves and retains full and complete ownership and control of all lumber which shall be cut from the aforementioned premises, wherever and however it may be situated, until all matters and things appertaining to or connected with this license shall be settled and adjusted, and all sums due or to become due for stumpage or otherwise, shall be fully paid, and any and all damages for non-performance of this agreement, or stipulations herein expressed, shall be liquidated and paid. \"And if any sum of money shall have become payable by any one of the stipulations or agreements herein expressed, and shall not be paid or secured in some of the modes herein expressed within ten days thereafter, then, in such case, said company shall have full power and authority to take all or any part of said lumber wherever or however situated, and to absolutely sell and dispose of the same either at private or public sale, for cash; and after deducting reasonable expenses, commissions, and all sums which may then be due or may become due from any cause whatever, as herein expressed, the balance, if any there may be, they shall pay over on demand to said grantees, after a reasonable time for ascertaining and liquidating all amounts due, or which may become due, either as stumpage or damages.\"\nFor securing the stumpage payable to respondents under this license C. & S. gave to the respondents a draft upon J. & Co., which was accepted by J. & Co., and approved of by the respondents, but which was not paid at maturity. After giving the draft C. & S. sold the lumber to J. & Co., who knew the lumber was cut on the plaintiff's land under the said agreement. J. & Co. failed, and appellant, their assignee, took possession of the lumber and sold it.\nHeld\u2014Per Strong, Taschereau and Gwynne, J. J., (affirming the judgment of the court below,) Ritchie, C. J., and Fournier and Henry, J.J., dissenting, that upon the case as submitted, and by mere force of the terms of the agreement, the absolute property in the lumber in question did not pass to C. & S. immediately upon the receipt by the company of the accepted draft of C. & S. on J. & Co., and that appellant was liable for the actual payment of the stumpage.\nThe court being equally divided, the judgment of the court below was affirmed.\nThis was an appeal from the Supreme Court of New Brunswick on a special case submitted to that Court, as follows:\u2014\n\"The New Brunswick Railway, plaintiffs, and Ezekiel McLeod, assignee under the Insolvent Acts of 1869 and 1875 of the estate of Edward D. Jewett and George K. Jewett, insolvents, defendant. The plaintiffs, being the owners in fee of certain lands in the County of Madawaska, granted to William H. Cunliffe and S. Walter Stephens a license to cut lumber thereon, of which license a copy is hereunto annexed, marked \"A.\"\n\"The said Cunliffe and Stephens under such license entered upon the lands of the said plaintiffs therein described, and cut thereon a large quantity of lumber, viz., 2,819,450 superficial feet of spruce logs, and 169,820 superficial feet of pine logs. That the quantity of such lumber was scaled by a person appointed by the said plaintiffs, and a return thereof duly made to them. That the correctness of such scaler's return was admitted by the said Cunliffe and Stephens. That the stumpage payable to the said plaintiffs for such lumber amounted to the sum of two thousand nine hundred and nine dollars and nine cents ($2,909 09), and for securing the payment of the same on the 15th day of July, 1875, in terms of the said license, the said Cunliffe and Stephens gave to the said plaintiffs a draft of date the 29th of April, 1875, in favor of Alfred Whitehead, Esq., the land agent of said plaintiffs, or order, upon the firm of E. D. Jewett & Co., of Saint John, for the said sum of $2,909.09, of which draft a copy is hereunto annexed, marked \"B.\" \"That the said E. D. Jewett & Co., upon whom the said draft was drawn, duly accepted the same. That the said Alfred Whitehead, land agent for the said plaintiffs, accepted and approved of the said security for the said plaintiffs, and endorsed the said draft to the Bank of British North America, Saint John, for the purpose of making collection of the amount of the said draft for the said plaintiffs. That on the 15th day of July, A.D. 1875, when the said draft became payable, it was duly presented for payment, and payment thereof was refused, the said draft dishonored, and notice of such dishonor duly given. That the said E. D. Jewett & Co. claim that, after their acceptance of the said draft of the 29th day of April, 1875, and prior to the 15th July, 1875, the said Cunliffe and Stephens made a sale and delivery to them, and the said E. D. Jewett & Co. paid for the same before the said draft (a copy of which is hereunto annexed, marked \"B.\") matured, the said E. D. Jewett & Co., both at the time they accepted the said draft and got such delivery, being fully cognizant that the said lumber had been cut on the lands of the said plaintiffs under the said license, marked \"A.\" That after the said sale and delivery of the said lumber to the said E. D. Jewett & Co., and before the said draft matured, the said lumber, cut under the said license, was driven into the Fredericton Boom, so called, and was held by the Fredericton Boom Company for the said E. D. Jewett & Co., until after the said 15th day of July, 1875, under an order given by the said Cunliffe and Stephens, dated the 18th day of June, 1875, a copy of which order is hereunto annexed, marked \"C.\" That on the 13th day of October, A. D. 1875, the estate of the said E. D. Jewett & Co. was placed in compulsory liquidation under the Insolvent Acts of 1869 and 1875, and the defendant, Ezekiel McLeod, was appointed by the creditors the assignee to the estate of the said insolvents. That the said lumber, cut under the said license, was taken possession of by the said defendant as part of the estate of the said insolvents, and has since been sold and disposed of absolutely by him as such assignee. That the proceeds of such sale are still in the hands of the said defendant, as such assignee, and amount to much more than will pay the said sum of $2,909.09 and interest. That the said plaintiffs have never been paid the said sum of $2,909.09, the amount of their said stumpage. That the said Edward D. Jewett and George K. Jewett constituted the members of the said firm of E. D. Jewett & Co.\n\"Upon the aforegoing facts the plaintiffs claim that the property and right of property in the said lumber has always remained in them the said plaintiffs, and that when the defendant, as such assignee, sold the said lumber, he converted the property of them the said plaintiffs. The defendant, as such assignee, denies, that under the aforegoing facts, the property in the said lumber remained in them the said plaintiffs, and contends that when the said draft of the 29th of April, 1875, was accepted by the said E. D. Jewett & Co., the plaintiffs right of property in the said lumber was divested.\n\"Should the Court be of opinion that the plaintiffs' right of property in the said lumber would continue until payment of the said draft, given to secure the said stumpage, their judgment to be entered for the said plaintiffs, with costs and damages to be assessed at $2,909.09, with interest thereon from the 15th July, 1875, should the court be of opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to the interest as damages. Should the Court be of opinion that, upon the acceptance of the said draft by the said E. D. Jewett & Co., the plaintiffs were thereby divested of their right of property in the said lumber, then judgment to be entered for the defendant with costs.\"\nThe parts of the license referred to in the case which bear particularly on the questions raised, are as follows: After providing for the landing of the lumber in a suitable place, for scaling part thereof, and for hauling it, it is then to be taken to market as early as practicable, the first stream-driving or rafting season after being cut. In cutting and managing said lumber while in their possession, grantees will not, directly or indirectly, conceal from the scaler, or dispose of any of the timber, logs or lumber, of any kind, until all dues, stumpage and damages are paid or secured, without the consent of the said company in writing, otherwise they shall forfeit the whole of the lumber cut under this contract.\n\"It is hereby agreed that the said grantees shall pay the said company, at the time of executing this license, a mileage rate of ten dollars per square mile of the entire area of the land hereby licensed. It is also further agreed that the said grantees shall pay the said company as stumpage one dollar per thousand superficial feet for all the spruce logs and $2 per thousand superficial feet for the pine logs, and at the said company's scale of rates of stumpage for the present season for all such other lumber as they may cut on the said lands hereby licensed or permitted, said stumpage to be paid in the following manner: Said company shall first deduct, from the amount of stumpage on the timber or lumber cut by grantees on this license as aforesaid, an amount equal to the mileage paid by him as aforesaid, and the whole of the remaider, if any, shall, not later than the 15th April next, be secured by good indorsed notes, or other sufficient security, to be approved of by the said company, and payable on the 15th July next, and the lumber not to be removed from the brows or landings till the stumpage is secured as aforesaid. And said company reserves and retains full and complete ownership and control of all lumber which shall be cut from the aforementioned premises, wherever and however it may be situated, until all matters and things appertaining to or connected with this license shall be settled and adjusted, and all sums due or to become due, for stumpage or otherwise, shall be fully paid, and any and all damages for non-performance of this agreement, or stipulations herein expressed, shall be liquidated and paid. And if any sum of money shall have become payable by any one of the stipulations or agreements herein expressed, and shall not be paid or secured in some of the modes herein expressed within ten days thereafter, then, in such case, said company shall have full power and authority to take all or any part of the said lumber, wherever or however situated, and to absolutely sell and dispose of the same, either at private or public sale, for cash, and after deducting reasonable expenses, commissions, and all sums which may then be due or may become due, from any cause whatever, as herein expressed, the balance, if any there may be, they shall pay over on demand to said grantees, after a reasonable time for ascertaining and liquidating all amounts due, or which may become due, either as stumpage or damages.\"\nThe paper marked B, which was annexed to the said special case, was as follows:\n\"Middle St. Francis, April 29th, 1875,\n\"$2,909.09.\n\"On twelfth day of July next, please pay Alfred Whitehead, or order, the sum of twenty-nine hundred and nine dollars and nine one-hundredths, and charge the same to account.\nYours truly,\n\"Cunliffe & Stephens.\"\n\"To Messrs.

C., for appellant:\nBy the agreement set out in the special case, the payment for stumpage is to be in cash, or by security in one of the modes expressed in the agreement.\nIt is not claimed by the respondents that all matters and things appertaining to or connected with the license had not been settled and adjusted by the draft of $2,909.09 on the 29th day of April, 1875, and it is admitted that this sum was secured in one of the modes expressed by the agreement, and the security was accepted and approved by the company. Now, the moment this sum was secured to the company, I contend the property in the logs passed to the grantees.\nThe clauses are all inconsistent when read separately, but if you read the whole agreement, it is clear the intention of the parties was that security approved was equivalent to payment. If stumpage is once secured it is immaterial to the company what became of the property, they got their security, and the jus disponendi was in the grantees. If otherwise, how inconsistent the agreement would be.\nThe plaintiffs having received in April security payable the fifteenth day of July passed that security beyond their control by endorsement to the Bank of British North America.\nThe grantees were to have power at any time after the dues were secured (i. e., after the fifteenth day of April), to dispose of the lumber. But to make an effectual sale the note or acceptance must be first paid. Say a sale was made the first of June. How could the purchaser pay the company? The grantees owed the company nothing; they, after the endorsement, owed the Bank of British North America.\nThe company could not receive the payment and release the grantees from the claim of the Bank of British North America. The latter could not be compelled to receive payment until the fifteenth of July. Was the purchaser not the owner of the property? If not the owner, could he sell? could he transfer? could he ship the lumber?\nIf the company continued owner after the security was given, or held the lumber, why was the security required?\nOr was it intended that if they got the logs to market early, they must remain idle till the 15th of July? No doubt there would be great force in the contention of the respondent if the clause retaining the ownership stood by itself, but by reading it in connection with the whole agreement there is no doubt the respondent's control over the property ceased after the 25th April, if the stumpage was then secured. The company had to approve of the security, and they could insist on undoubted security. The delay till July arises out of the fact of a note being taken, and cannot affect the jus disponendi.\nMr. Thomson, Q. C., followed:\nThis agreement must be read as a whole. Cunliffe & Stephens would have no object in moving this lumber before July if they had no power to dispose. At that time the acceptance of Jewett & Co. was equivalent to gold. What was the necessity of approving of the security, if it was not to be synonymous with payment. If they could not refuse the note then there would be force in arguing it was not a payment.\nMoreover, the circumstances under which the company are to have power to take and sell, are expressly stated, and, upon the principle of expressio unius exclusio alterius, the express excludes an implied power, the express power is given only when the sums payable are not paid or secured, and this applies only to a time and as to such sums for which the licensee could require the company to accept security, but the licensee could not, when the endorsed note fell due, require the company to accept security for it, and therefore the express power could not be exercised on default of the payment of the said note.\nAnother point also is that the agreement set out in the special case, so far as it gives the exclusive right to cut, operates as a license; so far as trees are cut under the agreement it operates as a grant of and passes the property in the trees to the grantees, so soon as all matters and things appertaining to or connected with the license are settled and adjusted, and all sums due for stumpage are fully paid, and any and all damages for non-performance of the agreement or stipulations therein expressed, are liquidated and paid.\nMr. Wetmore for respondents:\nIn construing this agreement we must bear this in mind, that the trees belonged to the company, the right of property could only be divested by their own consent, and whatever agreement they choose to make is a good agreement. Now, the right of property in any lumber cut under this license was to remain in the respondents, who were to retain full and complete ownership and control of the same wherever and however such lumber might be situated, until all matters and things appertaining to or connected with the license should be settled and adjusted, and all sums due or to become due for stumpage or otherwise should be fully paid, and any and all damages for non-performance of the agreements in the license or stipulations therein expressed should be liquidated and paid.\nThe draft upon E. D. Jewett & Co. was taken as security only: the license provided that it might be so taken: how then can the appellants, under the facts, claim that it was either given by Cunliffe & Stephens or accepted by the respondents as payment for the stumpage? There is nothing to support their contention in this respect.\nThe words are due or become due. Surely the money does not become due for stumpage until the 15th July, and is not the reservation of the right of property clear and unequivocal as words can make it? Until it is removed from the brows the right of property is held by virtue of a prior clause in the agreement. What is the sense of this clause, then, if, when the lumber is removed from the landings, which is only when the security is given, the absolute property vests in the licensees? Does it not clearly intend they shall hold their property until the security is paid?\nThe words \"paid or secured\" relied on by appellant in the first part of the contract are not to govern the rest of the contract, but are rather to be governed by the rest of the contract. The whole scope and intention of the license is this: If before either paying or giving security the lumber is disposed of, a forfeiture is worked. If the party instead of giving security, chooses to pay and the company to accept, there is an end to company's right of property. If security is given the company retains the right of property until it is paid, and any disposal that the licensee makes after that must be subject to such right of property. It cannot be successfully denied but that on reading the whole agreement this is the intention of the parties.\nThe special case, as Judge Duff puts it, recognizes that the note was given as security and not as payment, viz.: \"That the stumpage shall be paid in the following manner, namely, by deducting a sum equal to the mileage already paid; and the whole of the remainder shall not, later than the 15th day of April, be secured by good endorsed notes or other sufficient security, payable on the 15th July next; and until the stumpage is so secured as aforesaid, the lumber cannot be removed from the brows.\nThe respondents also contend that the appellant, who must stand in the same, but who cannot stand in any better, situation than E. D. Jewett & Co., of whose estate he is assignee, is bound by their knowledge that the draft accepted by them was for the stumpage of the lumber cut under the said license, of the terms of which license they were fully cognizant, and therefore, unless the taking of such draft as security was a virtual release of the respondents right of property in the lumber, they cannot set up that they were purchasers without knowledge that under the license the respondents ownership of the lumber could not be divested until all sums to become due for stumpage should be fully paid, for they well knew that, until the draft for the amount of the stumpage accepted by them was paid, all sums to become due for stumpage could not be paid.\nMr. Thomson, Q. C., in reply,\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\n[After stating the special case, and reading the parts of the license above given, proceeded as follows:]\nThese provisions, which in the license are not in immediate consecutive order, but respectively at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of the contract, must be read and reconciled as if in immediate connection one with the other, and from the whole read together, and not from either separately, must the intention of the parties be sought and discovered in respect to the settlement for and payment of the stumpage. Thus, immediately preceding the first reference to any satisfaction of the stumpage, we find that the lumber having been \"cut and landed in a suitable place for scaling,\" and marked as provided, it is to be taken to market as early as practicable the first stream driving or rafting season after being cut, and we naturally ask why that provision should be made for getting it to market as early as practicable if it was not contemplated that when it reached the market it might, under the subsequent provisions of the license, be in a position to be disposed of when at the markets? That this was so, the provisions as to the \"managing\" or dealing with the lumber, while in the grantees' possession, would seem very distinctly to indicate, for they are not directly or indirectly to conceal from the scaler, or dispose of any of the timber, logs, or lumber of any kind, until all dues, stumpage and damages are paid or secured, without the consent of the company \"in writing.\" Is not the irresistible inference from this language that if all dues, stumpage or damages are paid or secured they then might, without consent of the company, dispose of any of the property? If the right of the grantees to deal with the property rested on this clause of the contract, is there room for any, the slightest, doubt that when the dues, stumpage, or damages were either paid or secured, the disposing powers of the grantees accrued; let us then see if the exercise of their apparent right to dispose is controlled by the subsequent provisions of the license. The next reference to the stumpage is preceded by a provision for a payment of $10 per square mile at the time of the execution of the license, and as to stumpage, $1 per 1,000 superficial feet for spruce and $2 for pine, said stumpage to be paid in the following manner; the company to deduct from the amount of stumpage an amount equal to the mileage paid:\u2014\nAnd the whole of the remainder, if any, shall be secured by good endorsed notes or other sufficient security to be approved of by the said company, and payable on the 15th July next, and the lumber is not to be removed from the brows or landings till the stumpage is secured as aforesaid.\nNow, if this is read in connection with the clause before referred to, must not the words, \"to be paid in the following manner,\" mean that the good approved endorsed notes are to be in payment and satisfaction of the stumpage? Otherwise, why would the words \"secured in the following manner,\" not have been used instead of \"paid in the following manner;\" and if this is to be construed as a security only and not as vesting the property in the grantees, how can such a construction be reconciled with the provision, which, as we have seen so clearly contemplates a disposing power in the grantees on the stumpage being \"paid or secured.\" But it is contended that the subsequent provision for the reservation and retention of the ownership of the lumber, \"until all matters and things appertaining to or connected with the license shall be settled and adjusted, and all sums due or to become due for stumpage or otherwise shall be fully paid, and any and all damages for nonperformance of this agreement or stipulations herein expressed shall be liquidated and paid, prevents the property passing.\" To construe the whole agreement consistently, and give effect to every stipulation, the latter part of this provision must, I think, be read as nothing more than an elaboration of the first part and means substantially \"until all matters appertaining to or connected with the license were settled and adjusted;\" and this is, to my mind, very evident from the language which immediately follows, and which is, that \"if any sum of money shall have become payable by any one of the stipulations or agreements herein expressed, and shall not be paid or secured in some of the modes herein expressed within 10 days thereafter, then, in such case, said company shall have full power and authority to take all or any part of said lumber wheresoever and howsoever situate, and to absolutely sell and dispose of the same,\" &c. Does not this clearly imply that if the stumpage has been paid or secured then there is no right to take possession or sell? and this brings us to just where we started from, and is consistent with the provision first referred to, which gives the disposing power over the lumber to the grantees when all dues, stumpage and damages are paid or secured, and to the second provision referred to, which provides how the stumpage shall be \"paid,\" viz., by deducting the mileage, and the remainder being secured not later than 15th April by good approved indorsed notes, or other sufficient security, payable on 15th July. Read in this way, the different clauses appear to me quite reconcilable and consistent. I cannot think it was ever intended that the plaintiffs should have their stumpage secured to their satisfaction and approval apart from the logs, and at the same time hold the logs also. I think the giving the approved indorsed notes was to enable the grantees to avail themselves of the earliest market by dealing with and disposing of the logs so soon as they could be got to market to enable them to meet the notes when they should fall due on the 15th July, and respondents be enabled at any time after the 15th April, and before the 15th July, to realize on the notes, and so to make the lumber in the hands of the one, and the proceeds of the notes in the hands of the other, immediately available, and that it could not have been intended to place the grantors in a position to realize the stumpage while the lumber should be kept in the hands, and at the expense and risk of the grantees, locked up, entirely useless, for the time being, for any purpose.\nMr. Justice Fisher in the court below takes very much the same view, for he says:\nBy the device of taking a negotiable note, when the logs were removed from the immediate control of the plaintiffs, the stumpage was secured. The license requires that the stumpage should be secured by the 15th of April, and before the lumber was removed from the brows, and in computing the stumpage to be secured the mileage already paid was to be deducted. The licensees, Cunliffe & Stephens, were enabled to carry the lumber into the market and have it in course of manufacture or sale before any actual payment was made. The plaintiffs, the grantors, by the acceptance of the negotiable note would be enabled, if they required, to make it available for the purpose of their business before the 15th of July, the period fixed for the final payment of the stumpage.\nThough it is true the same learned Judge decided in favor of the respondents, holding that \"no change of property took place\" until the stumpage was actually paid. How this could be and the grantees at the same time, on giving the notes, be enabled to carry their lumber into the market and have it in course of manufacture or sale before any actual payment was made, I am at a loss to conjecture; if no change of property took place, what possible right could the grantees have to manufacture or sell the property; therefore while I appreciate the reasoning of the learned judge, it leads me to a conclusion the exact opposite of that at which he arrived[1].\nThere can be no doubt that in many cases the effect of giving a bill of exchange on account of a debt is only that of a conditional payment, and that the word payment as applicable to many transactions, even when used in a plea, does not mean payment in satisfaction, for, as said by Mr. Justice Maule[2]:\nPayment is not a technical word, it has been imported into law proceedings from the exchange and not from law treatises. When you speak of paying in cash, that means in satisfaction, but when by bill that does not import satisfaction, unless the bill is ultimately taken up.\nAnd as said by Lord Campbell in Turner v. Dodwell[3]:\u2014\nIn mercantile transactions nothing is more usual than to stipulate for a payment by bills where there is no intention of their being taken in absolute satisfaction.\nOn the other hand it is equally well established that a bill of exchange may be given and accepted as an absolute payment in satisfaction, so as to be a discharge if the bill were dishonored. Thus on the counsel in Turner v. Dodwell, saying \"anything taken in reduction of the debt is payment,\" and citing Hooper v. Stevens[4], and Hart v. Nash[5], Erle, J., replies:\nThere can be no doubt of that, if the bill was taken in payment in the sense that it was accepted by the creditor as equivalent to so much money.\nMr. Chitty in his work on contracts[6], thus enunciates the principle:\u2014\nWhere a debtor delivers a negotiable bill or note to his creditor, and the latter at the time of receiving the same agrees to take it in payment of the debt, and to take upon himself the risk of the bill or note being paid, or if from the conduct of the creditor, or the special circumstances of the case, such an agreement is to be implied, the effect of it will be to destroy the right of action for the debt, and to leave the creditor without remedy except upon the instrument[7].\nWe must put the best construction upon this contract that we can to ascertain what the intention of the parties was, and I have, after a very careful consideration of this case, arrived at the conclusion that the words of the instrument import that on the giving of the approved bill the plaintiff was to look to it as constituting his remedy; that the approved bill was not taken simply on account of the stumpage, but so far as the stumpage was due under the contract in satisfaction and discharge thereof; that it was substituted in lieu of the security of the logs themselves, and all future liability rested on the bill, to which alone the grantors could look for actual payment; that the interest of the grantors in the logs thereupon ceased and the property vested in the licensees, and on their insolvency passed to the appellant, the assignee of their estate, for the benefit of their creditors generally; and I cannot avoid being strongly impressed with the conviction that the plaintiffs themselves, in the first instance, took this view of the contract. Otherwise, I cannot think they would, if they really believed they were the true owners of the property, have allowed their claim to have lain dormant from the 15th July till the 13th October, and, on the failure of Jewett & Co., permitted defendant, their assignee, to take possession of this lumber as the property of the estate of these insolvents, and to sell and dispose of the same absolutely as such assignee, as the case alleges, without apparently any claim or remonstrance, and without any attempt to assert or enforce their rights till the bringing of this action.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and judgment entered for the appellant, the defendant in the court below, with costs, and with the costs of this appeal.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nWas of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed, and read a written judgment stating his reasons for that conclusion.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nLa question soulev\u00e9e par les faits expos\u00e9s dans le cas sp\u00e9cial soumis par les parties en cette cause, est, de savoir si le bois coup\u00e9 par Cunliffe et Stevens, conform\u00e9ment aux conditions de la licence ou concession que l'intim\u00e9e leur a consentie, en date du 15 octobre 1874, doit demeurer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de cette derni\u00e8re jusqu'au paiement de la traite tir\u00e9e par Cunliffe et Stevens sur E. D. Jewett et Cie en faveur de l'intim\u00e9e et accept\u00e9e par elle pour assurer le paiement de ses droits de coupe de bois, ou bien si le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le bois coup\u00e9 et manufactur\u00e9 a cess\u00e9 du moment de l'acceptation de cette traite.\nLa solution de cette question repose enti\u00e8rement sur l'interpr\u00e9tation \u00e0 donner aux stipulations contenues dans la licence afin de consid\u00e9rer la r\u00e9serve du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e avec le pouvoir de Cunliffe et Stevens de disposer du bois fait dans les limites comprises dans leur \"license\" ou concession. Les principales stipulations concernant la question dont il s'agit, sont:\n1o. Said stumpage to be paid in the following manner: Said Company shall first deduct from the amount of stumpage on the timber or lumber cut by Grantees on this license as aforesaid, an amount equal to the mileage paid by him as aforesaid, and the whole of the remainder, if any, shall, not later than the 15th April next, be secured by good indorsed Notes, or other sufficient security, to be approved of by the said Company, and payable on the 15th July next, and the lumber not to be removed from the brows or landings till the stumpage is secured as aforesaid.\n2o. And the said Company reserves and retains full and complete ownership and control of all lumber which shall be cut from the aforementioned premises, wherever and however it may be situated, until all matters and things appertaining to or connected with this License shall be settled and adjusted, and all sums due or to become due for stumpage or otherwise, shall be fully paid, and any and all damages for non-performance of this Agreement, or stipulations herein expressed, shall be liquidated and paid.\n3o. And if any sum of money shall have become payable by any one of the stipulations or agreements herein expressed, and shall not be paid or secured in some of the modes herein expressed within ten days thereafter, then, in such case, said Company shall have full power and authority to take all or any part of said lumber wherever or however situated, and to absolutely sell and dispose of the same either at private or public sale, for cash.\nD'apr\u00e8s ces conditions il est \u00e9vident que les licensees \"concessionnaires\" n'ont jusqu'au r\u00e8glement de compte avec la compagnie du chemin de fer et le gouvernement fait en la mani\u00e8re convenue, que le droit de faire le bois dans l'\u00e9tendue des limites conc\u00e9d\u00e9es, en se conformant \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard aux conditions de la licence. Jusque-l\u00e0 ils n'ont pas m\u00eame le droit d'enlever des jet\u00e9es et de mettre \u00e0 l'eau le bois manufactur\u00e9 par eux. La cons\u00e9quence logique de cette condition n'est-elle pas que, du moment que les droits de coupe ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s et les dommages pouvant r\u00e9sulter de l'inex\u00e9cution de quelqu'une des conditions, liquid\u00e9s et pay\u00e9s par l'un des modes convenus, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 cesse d'appartenir \u00e0 la compagnie et que les licensees (concessionnaires) en peuvent alors disposer.\nD'apr\u00e8s les faits du special case la traite tir\u00e9e sur E. D. Jewett et Cie para\u00eet avoir compris tout ce qui pourrait \u00eatre d\u00fb \u00e0 la compagnie pour les op\u00e9rations de Cunliffe et Stevens pendant l'hiver\nAinsi dans ce r\u00e8glement se trouverait compris le compte des droits de coupe de bois, d\u00e9duction faite de la rente par chaque mille en superficie de l'\u00e9tendue des limites, compte dont le paiement d'apr\u00e8s la 1re condition doit \u00eatre pas plus tard que le 15 avril, assur\u00e9 par de bons billets avec endossement, ou par d'autres garanties suffisantes, le tout sujet \u00e0 l'approbation de la compagnie.\nDans le montant de cette traite doit \u00e9galement se trouver compris le r\u00e8glement de tous les dommages que la compagnie pourrait avoir \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer pour l'inex\u00e9cution de quelques-unes des conditions de la licence. C'est un r\u00e8glement complet et final, du moins la compagnie n'\u00e9l\u00e8ve aucune pr\u00e9tention au contraire. Si l'acceptation de cette traite peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme l'un des modes de paiement \u00e9tablis par la convention des parties, il s'en suivrait que Cunliffe et Stevens pouvaient disposer de ce bois comme ils ont fait, en le vendant \u00e0 Jewett et Cie.\nSi l'intention de la compagnie e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de ne se d\u00e9partir de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que sur paiement comptant de ses droits de coupe de bois, elle n'aurait certainement pas donn\u00e9 \u00e0 ses concessionnaires (licensees) l'alternative de payer ou d'offrir un billet n\u00e9gociable sujet \u00e0 son approbation comme \u00e9tant pour elle l'\u00e9quivalent d'un paiement en esp\u00e8ces. Cette facilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9gler par billets \u00e9tait sans doute pour l'avantage commun des parties, et a d\u00fb \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration dans la d\u00e9termination du prix de la concession. La compagnie, certaine de n'accepter que des billets qui \u00e9quivaudraient \u00e0 un paiement en esp\u00e8ces, devait n\u00e9cessairement comprendre que l'accomplissement de cette condition mettrait Cunliffe et Stevens non-seulement en position de transporter le bois au march\u00e9, mais qu'ils acqu\u00e9raient aussi par ce moyen la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du bois et le pouvoir d'en disposer. Elle ne pouvait alors avoir l'id\u00e9e qu'elle conserverait sur ce bois, achet\u00e9 pour le commerce et qui devait en cons\u00e9quence passer par un grand nombre de mains, un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui lui permettrait d'aller le revendiquer jusque sur le march\u00e9 d'Angleterre. L'intention \u00e9vidente des parties \u00e9tait de faire d\u00e9pendre le transport de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'une des deux conditions arr\u00eat\u00e9es entre elles, le paiement ou la remise d'effets n\u00e9gociables accept\u00e9s par la compagnie.\nLa 3\u00e8me condition confirme cette interpr\u00e9tation en stipulant dans quel cas la Cie exercera le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'elle s'est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 par la seconde. Il y est formellement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que dans le cas o\u00f9 les r\u00e9clamations de la Cie n'auront pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es suivant l'un des modes convenus \"shall not be paid or secured in some of the modes herein expressed\" alors elle aura le pouvoir de s'emparer du bois, et elle pourra le vendre et en disposer par vente publique ou priv\u00e9e. Mais pour qu'elle puisse exercer ce droit, il faut n\u00e9cessairement qu'il y ait eu n\u00e9gligence de r\u00e9gler de la mani\u00e8re convenue dans les dix jours qui suivent l'\u00e9poque de l'exigibilit\u00e9 d'une r\u00e9clamation. Cette clause exclut toute id\u00e9e de l'exercice d'un semblable pouvoir dans le cas de r\u00e8glement par billets approuv\u00e9s. Elle est faite dans la vue de pourvoir au cas o\u00f9 la Cie n'a pas re\u00e7u les garanties qu'elle a stipul\u00e9es. Ce serait certainement enfreindre la lettre et l'esprit de cette convention que de reconna\u00eetre \u00e0 la Cie le droit d'en faire l'application lorsque les garanties convenues lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es \u00e0 sa satisfaction comme dans le cas actuel.\nD'apr\u00e8s le genre d'affaire dont il s'agit et la nature des conventions au sujet du paiement, la Cie me para\u00eet \u00eatre convenue d'adopter comme un des modes de paiement la remise de bons billets endoss\u00e9s dont l'acceptation ou le rejet \u00e9tait laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 son enti\u00e8re discr\u00e9tion. Lorsqu'elle a accept\u00e9 la traite en question, la solvabilit\u00e9 de Jewett et Cie \u00e9tait notoire et consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9gale \u00e0 celle des banques. Personne n'avait de doute \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. On doit consid\u00e9rer que dans les circonstances de cette cause, il y a eu, d'apr\u00e8s le mode convenu, un paiement suffisant pour transf\u00e9rer le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nC'est en consid\u00e9rant ces diverses stipulations s\u00e9par\u00e9ment et dans leur ensemble, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle qui veut que \"toutes les clauses des conventions s'in-\"terpr\u00e8tent les unes par les autres, en donnant \u00e0 chacune \"le sens qui r\u00e9sulte de l'acte entier,\" que j'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'Intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Cunliffe et Stevens par l'acceptation de la traite de Jewett et Cie.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThe issue in this case turns upon the construction of the license to cut the timber given by the respondents to Cunliffe & Stephens, taken in connection with the subsequent acts and dealings of the parties.\nThe respondents, owners of wilderness or timber lands in New Brunswick, agreed to sell to Cunliffe & Stephens all the pine and spruce logs they might cut on certain lots of the respondents' lands up to the first of April next following the date of an agreement entered into between them, dated the 15th of October, 1874. The document calls itself a \"memorandum of agreement and conditional license.\" By its terms the grantees were to pay at the rate of one dollar for every thousand superficial feet of spruce logs, and two dollars for every thousand feet of pine logs. By it the grantees (for such they are called in the agreement) were required to pay the respondents at the date of the agreement at the rate of $10 for each square mile, amounting to $250 on account; but which sum was to be forfeited if the grantees failed to cut any of the logs. The agreement contained a clause by which the grantees were prohibited from moving the logs from the property upon which they were to be cut, or in any way disposing of them, without first paying or securing the payment of the stumpage as agreed upon. The legal result would be that the grantees became the owners of the logs subject to the lien of the respondents. The grantees were not to cut the logs for the respondents as their contractors or employees but for themselves. On the execution of the agreement and the payment of the $250, the grantees acquired a vested interest in the sole right of cutting and appropriating to their own use all the logs on the 25 square miles during the prescribed time. As each log was cut and deposited at the place for scaling it became, if not previously, the property of the grantees subject to the lien before mentioned, and the other conditions and provisions of the contract. It is not contended that any of the other conditions were broken or unfulfilled by the grantees. It appears to me that a different view has been taken of the rights as to the logs in question, and it has been considered that the respondents did not convey anything more than a naked right to cut the logs, and that the whole property always remained in the respondents. I cannot so consider it. The logs were to all intents and purposes purchased, and the property in them passed to the grantees subject to the respondents' lien. If the grantees, then, paid the balance due that lien was discharged, and the logs, relieved from it, would become the unencumbered property of the grantees.\nThe agreement contains three or four provisions necessary to be considered. The first is:\nThe grantees will not directly or indirectly conceal from the scaler, or dispose of, any of the timber, logs, or lumber of any kind until all dues, stumpage, and damages are paid or secured, without the consent of the said company in writing. Otherwise they shall forfeit the whole lumber cut under this contract.\nThe second is:\nIt is hereby agreed that the said grantees shall pay to the said company at the time of executing this license, a mileage rate of ten dollars per square mile of the entire area of the land hereby licensed. It is also further agreed that the said grantees shall pay the said company as stumpage, one dollar per thousand superficial feet for all the spruce logs, and two dollars per thousand superficial feet for the pine logs, and at the company's scale of rates of stumpage for the present season for all such other lumber as they may cut on the said lands, hereby licensed or permitted, said stumpage to be paid in the following manner: Said company shall first deduct from the amount of stumpage on the timber or lumber cut by grantees on this license as aforesaid, an amount equal to the mileage paid by him as aforesaid, and the whole of the remainder, if any, shall, not later than the 15th April next, be secured by good endorsed notes or other sufficient security to be approved of by the said company and payable on the 15th of July next, and the lumber not to be removed from the brows or landings till the stumpage is secured as aforesaid.\nHad these been the only provisions for a lien, the grantees' logs would have been relieved from it, on one or other of the two things being done by the grantees\u2014the one, making payment\u2014the other, by securing the payment. On the 29th of April a draft was given by the grantees to the respondents through their agent, upon Jewett & Co. for the amount due, and accepted by the latter. Was this a payment or merely security? As to the clauses of the agreement under consideration, I consider it unimportant to decide that question, as, in either case, the lien was removed permanently. The grantees by the first clause were not (amongst other things) \"to dispose of\" the logs until the amount was paid or secured. If the respondents did not receive the draft in payment, they at least took it as security and abandoned their lien by giving up possession of the property. The result necessarily was that the grantees became the owners of the logs unencumbered, and might, in the terms of the clause, dispose of them. To be in a position to \"dispose\" of them they must have had the whole unencumbered property in them. The logs were taken possession of by the grantees on the acceptance of the draft, with the assent of the respondents, and a large sum, no doubt, expended in taking them to the boom, where they were subsequently sold and delivered to Jewett & Co., and held by Estey for them. The rights of third parties here come up, and one of the learned judges in New Brunswick would have felt disposed, I think, from what he says, to have validated the transfer to Jewett & Co. as such third parties, but for the fact, that they must be presumed to have known the agreement under which the logs were obtained and the nature of the subsequent dealings as to the draft, &c. With every deference to the opinion of the learned judge I cannot see where the evidence is that would produce the conclusion that Jewett & Co. knew anything more than that the draft was given and accepted, and the logs delivered up to the grantees. They may or may not have known the peculiar terms of the agreement. I can see nothing according to the evidence to have prevented them from purchasing, any more than any other third party who would purchase in ignorance of the source from which the logs were obtained, and of the whole transaction. I take, however, the ground that a lien cannot exist contemporaneously with a security payable at a future day, whether such lien be implied or one created by express agreement, unless such continuing lien be expressly agreed for. If, when the draft was accepted, and before the logs were delivered or permitted to be taken from the \"brows,\" a further agreement was entered into, that in consideration of the respondents giving up the logs the lien should continue until payment of the draft, or if that result is plainly provided for in the agreement, and that the draft is not to be considered a payment, I will not say that such lien would not continue to attach to the logs in the meantime. I will hereafter consider both of these propositions.\nIt is elementary in the doctrine of liens, that the continuance of possession is indispensable to the exercise of the right of lien.\nAn abandonment of the custody of matters over which the right extends, necessarily frustrates any power to retain them and operates as an absolute waiver of the lien. The holder is in such case deemed to yield up the security he has upon the goods and trust to the responsibility of the owner[8].\nAt page 43, the same author says:\nIt has been well established by numerous authorities, that if security be taken for a debt for which the party has a lien upon the property of the debtor, such security being payable at a distant day, the lien is gone[9].\nHe proceeds:\nThis principle as to waiver of lien is not regulated by the usage of trade, nor consists in a mere rule of law that the special contract determines the implied one, but in the inconveniences which would result (the necessities of mankind requiring that the goods should be delivered for consumption) from the extension of the lien for the whole period which the security has to run, for it must be presumed, either that the lien is to continue with, and accompany, the security until payment, or that it is relinquished by the substitution of the security[10].\nReference to that case will show that the security was a note of hand of the party on whose goods the lien rested for a part of his debt and a judgment against him for the balance. The subject matter of the lien still remained with the party who held it, but it was held that by taking the note and judgment the lien was removed. His lordship said:\u2014\nThe proposition that the lien can exist after such a special contract (referring to the note,) necessarily involves a contradiction to that contract. My opinion, therefore, is that where these special agreements are taken, the Hen does not remain. And whether the securities are due or not, makes no difference.\nThis case is much stronger. There the subject matter of the lien was not given up, and still it was held the taking of the securities destroyed the lien. Here the subject matter was given up to the grantees, and they, as I think they had a right to do, disposed of it as their own property. In this case there was a special reason why the grantees should get, not only the possession, but the exclusive right to the logs, so that they might make sale of them, and I have no doubt that was what the respondents fully intended and expected when they, on the acceptance of the draft, gave up the possession of the logs to the grantees. It was stated without contradiction at the argument that, at the time they did so, Jewett & Co. were generally considered a wealthy firm and their paper considered equal to that of a bank. Theirs was not considered a doubtful security, and the feeling of confidence in them may possibly account for the unconditional surrender of the logs to the grantees. Whether that was, or was not, the reason, all that is necessary for us to consider is that there was no agreement for a continuing lien. The lien created by those clauses, (and so far they are only what I am dealing with,) was to be operative up to a certain point. That is the respondents were to retain possession of and control over the logs until the balance of the stumpage, &c., was secured to their approval. That being done, by the acceptance of the draft, their right of stoppage ceased and the grantees became entitled to the possession. If, after they received the acceptance of the draft they had refused to permit the grantees to take the logs, it would have raised the question of the right of the grantees to compel them to do so, or to submit to the legal consequences of their refusal, and, in that case, according to the ruling of Lord Eldon, in the case before mentioned, and since confirmed by numerous decisions, they would have had the law against them. But they themselves have by their own act of surrendering the logs settled the point, and virtually and effectually construed their own agreement and abandoned any lien they held.\nIt is, however, contended that by the provisions contained in subsequent clauses of the agreement, the delivery of the logs by the respondents was only to enable the grantees to remove them to a point where a market could be obtained for them, and not with the intention of cancelling their lien, but the only evidence adduced to establish that position is from those clauses themselves. It is necessary to consider them carefully and ascertain whether that is the result\u2014taking those clauses in connection with those I have before referred to and the acts and dealings of the parties themselves.\nFollowing two other clauses wherein the grantees undertook \"to go upon the said premises in due and proper season and cut and remove lumber and pay the stumpage as aforesaid;\" to faithfully perform the conditions and stipulations expressed in the license; to pay the company damages for violation or neglect of the same; to exercise diligence and precaution to prevent damages by fire, and to pay for any resulting from carelessness,\u2014we find the clauses as follows:\nAnd the company reserves and retains full and complete ownership and control of all lumber which shall be cut from the aforementioned premises wherever and however it may be situated, until all matters and things appertaining to or connected with this license shall be settled and adjusted, and all sums due or to become due for stumpage or otherwise shall be fully paid, and any and all damages for non-performance of this agreement or stipulations herein expressed shall be liquidated and paid. And if any sum of money shall have become payable by anyone of the stipulations or agreements herein expressed, and shall not be paid or secured in some of the modes herein expressed within ten days thereafter, then, in such case, said company shall have full power and authority to take all or any of the said lumber, wherever or however situated, and to absolutely sell and dispose of the same, &c.\nHere, then, are general provisions of the contract, and operating from the time of its execution. That they were intended to operate in connection with the previous clauses for the protection of the company's interest only up to a certain point, I have no doubt. If, indeed, the clause should be construed as giving the company a right to retain any \"ownership\" or \"control\" after all things had been \"settled and adjusted,\" and the amount or balance due paid or secured, as mentioned in previous clause which provides for the lien, then the two clauses are antagonistic, and, if so, that which is the most favorable to the grantees is the one by which we must be governed. The provisions are those of the respondents, and if, by one of two antagonistic ones, the grantees are justified in doing an act, or entitled to retain the property, the other party cannot be permitted to set up the other. On the principle, too, that they are the words of the respondents, and taking the whole agreement together, if an ambiguity arises they, and not the grantees, are to take the consequences. By the two clauses first cited the grantees were to have possession of the property relieved from any lien on giving the required security, which was given and accepted and the logs given up. The agreement contains no provision that, under such circumstances, the lien should continue or remain upon the logs. It is true that in the former of the two last cited clauses we find it provided that the respondents reserved and retained the ownership and control until (amongst other things) all sums due for stumpage, &c., should be fully paid. Independently of this antagonistic and, therefore, ambiguous provision, I have no difficulty in concluding that it could only consistently apply to circumstances and transactions up to the time of a settlement and adjustment of all matters and things connected with the license. The last clause cited shows clearly that such was the intention of the parties, for it provides that if any money shall have become payable \"by any of the stipulations or agreements herein expressed\" (which covers the whole ground), \"and shall not be paid or secured in some of the modes herein expressed, the company shall have full power and authority to take all or any of the said lumber, &c.\" The plain and simple meaning of this latter clause is, that if the grantees either paid or secured the respondents, their power and authority to take or interfere in any way with the logs or timber was at an end. Here, then, we have another provision in opposition to that under which the respondents claim. In the license we have three several provisions against that one. The respondents claim, however they so intended. If so, why was not something said or done in regard to it when they gave up possession of the property. If they really so intended, their failure to communicate it to the grantees when acting in a manner to lead them to assume the opposite, was, under all the circumstances, I take it, a fraud, not only on the grantees, but a still greater one upon a third party who might purchase and pay for the logs. The property was given up in April, and the respondents did nothing to assert any claim to it until October. During the intervening seven months the logs might have been sold, changed owners several times and been converted into lumber or other manufactured articles. It might in the ordinary course of business in the hands of innocent purchasers have been shipped and sold in a foreign or domestic market, and we are asked to put a construction on that one antagonistic clause which would result in giving a right to the respondents to follow the property, it might be to England, or the United States, and take it from the innocent purchasers there. It is possible an agreement to produce such a result might have been secretly entered into between, and bind the immediate parties, but to have any effect, it should be in language the most plain and unmistakable and essentially different from that under consideration. Besides, had such an agreement been entered into privately, the fact that it is of that private and unusual character throws upon the party for whose security the provision was made the responsibility of acting consistently with the fact of his holding such a right. He must not act in a way to induce outsiders to believe he has no such secret claim. The respondents, by giving up the property unreservedly and enabling the grantees to act with the logs as if under no lien, put them in a position to hold themselves out as the unencumbered owners. I have no doubt that Jewett & Co., when purchasing, and the grantees, when selling to them, considered the latter had full authority to sell and convey. It would be, I think, a serious question in such a case to say, whether or not the respondents would in the case of a third party not be estopped from setting up such a secret claim, when their overt acts and dealings were so inconsistent with it. What are the facts in the knowledge of Jewett & Co.? Why, that the grantees had settled with and secured the respondents, and thereupon that the latter gave up the possession to the former, who, brought the logs at much expense to the boom where they were when purchased. They had, then, every right to assume, as they did, that the grantees had the property and the right to dispose of it. How could they be presumed to know of this ambiguous clause, and be expected to construe it as it has been since then, I think, erroneously done? Suppose another person had bought, knowing what Jewett & Co knew, or are presumed to have known, would it be right to permit the respondents to say: \"True, we held on to the property till we got satisfactory security, upon which we surrendered it unconditionally at the time; true, we allowed the grantees to take possession and put them in a position to hold themselves out as the owners of the property, but still we had a clause in the private agreement with them which perhaps no one could have expected, but there it is; and although you have been induced in a great measure by our mode of dealing to feel yourself perfectly safe we will nevertheless take the property from you and hold it?\" I think there would be neither law or equity in permitting them to do so.\nAlthough not necessary I may refer to the question of the draft as payment. I am free to admit that if a debt existed, the mere taking of a bill or note, even of a third party, would not necessarily amount to a payment, if nothing more was done, and that the result of taking such would but postpone the payment. If, however, it was taken as payment, it is otherwise. Here something more was done. The possession and control of the property was given up, and the legal conclusion, I think, is that in the absence of any special agreement to the contrary, the acceptance was received as payment. A mere security could have been given in a variety of ways by bond or otherwise, amounting to a guarantee. The words paid or secured are those used in the first clause. Those in the second are \"secured by good endorsed notes or other sufficient security to be approved of by the said company.\" The latter clause, it is true, refers only to security, but the first and one of the two letter clauses uses the word \"paid.\" The rule of law applicable to such cases was laid down by Lord Langdale in Sayer v. Wagstaff[11], and cited with approval in re The London. Birmingham and South Stafford Bank[12]. His lordship said: \u2014\nThe debt may be considered as actually paid if the creditor at the time of receiving the note has agreed to take it in payment of the debt, and to take upon himself the risk of the note being paid, or if from the conduct of the creditor, or the special circumstances of the case, such an agreement is legally to be implied.\nThe point would, therefore, be one to be submitted to a jury under the evidence of the conduct of the respondents at the time, and the special circumstances of the case. As we are now dealing with a case prepared by the parties themselves, and in which we are not aided by the finding of a jury, we must necessarily place ourselves in the same position a jury would have occupied. Assuming that duty, I have no difficulty, from the whole evidence, in arriving at the conclusion that in taking the acceptance and handing over the property, the respondents received that acceptance as payment and relinquished all the lien they held upon the property in question.\nFor the reasons given (which on account of a difference of views entertained by my learned brethren, I have elaborated more than I would have otherwise considered necessary,) I think the appeal should be allowed and judgment given for the appellant with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion to dismiss this appeal.\nIt seems to me clear that by the license under which Cunliffe & Co. cut this lumber, they never thought for a moment, and it never came to the mind of any of the parties thereto, that they could pay the company the amount of the stumpage on the 15th of April. Indeed, it appears to me plain by the said license that not one of the contracting parties ever thought it possible that Cunliffe & Co. could pay the stumpage before the lumber was taken down to market. But as it was expressly stipulated and agreed, and made obligatory upon Cunliffe & Co., that the lumber should be taken down to market as early as practicable, the first stream driving or rafting season after being cut, that being about the fifteenth of April then next, it was agreed and stipulated that, not later than the said fifteenth of April, Cunliffe & Co. were to give sufficient security, by good indorsed notes or otherwise, that the amount due for stumpage would be paid on the 15th of July, the said lumber not to be removed from the brows or landing till the stumpage was so secured. And if the said security was not so given by Cunliffe & Co., then the said company could, ten days after the 15th of April, take possession of the said lumber and absolutely dispose of the same; and if the stumpage was not duly paid on the 15th July, or within ten days after, then also the said company could take the said lumber, wherever it was, and dispose of the same. It was also agreed and stipulated as follows:\nAnd the said company reserves and retains full and complete ownership and control of all lumber which shall be cut from the aforementioned premises, wherever and however it may be situated, until all matters or things appertaining to or connected with this license shall be settled and adjusted, and all sums due or to become due, for stumpage or otherwise, shall be fully paid, and any and all damages for non-performance of this agreement, or stipulations herein expressed, shall be liquidated and paid.\nI am at a loss to know what language could more clearly say that the company retained the ownership of this lumber till the stumpage was actually paid. The security given on the 15th of April was so given for one purpose only, that of allowing the taking down of the lumber to market, the ownership remaining in the company till actual payment of the stumpage, and delay being given for such payment till the 15th of July. If, on the 15th of July, stumpage was not paid, or within ten days, the company was authorized to take the lumber and sell it. Surely, all this means that the ownership could never pass to Cunliffe & Co. till actual payment of the stumpage.\nI think that the judgment entered for the plaintiffs in the court below is right, and that the defendant must fail in his appeal.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nThe sole question, as it appears to me, which is presented to us upon this special case, is one of the construction of the instrument marked A, annexed to the special case, and is, whether, by force of the terms of that instrument, the absolute property in the logs in question did or not pass to Cunliffe & Stephens immediately upon the acceptance by Jewett & Co. of the draft of Cunliffe & Stephens of the 29th April, 1875?\nWe are not placed in the position of a jury, nor are we authorized to draw inferences of fact as they might. No question of fact is raised before us, whether the plaintiffs as against Jewett & Co., and their assignee, by reason of their conduct in suffering the logs to remain in the possession of Cunliffe & Stephens, or rather of their assignees, Jewell & Co., after the draft became due; or by the manner in which they dealt with the acceptance; or by any admission or conduct of theirs whatever subsequently to the receipt by them of the acceptance, should be held, as a matter of fact, to have adopted and taken, or to have agreed to adopt and take, the acceptance, notwithstanding the terms of the instrument? and whether they should or not, by reason of such or any circumstances, be estopped in pais from asserting now that the property is theirs, is a question upon which we are not called upon, nor is it proper for us, to express an opinion.\nThe question before us being, as I have said, in my opinion, limited to the mere legal construction of the terms of the instrument, our judgment must, I think, be to dismiss the appeal, for otherwise we must, as it appears to me, eliminate from the contract of the parties that part wherein it is declared that their intention is that the plaintiffs' full and complete ownership of the timber shall be and is reserved and retained, wherever and however it may be situated, until all matters and things appertaining to or connected with the license shall be settled and adjusted, and all sums due, or to become due, for stumpage or otherwise, shall be fully paid, and any and all damages for non-performance of this agreement, or the stipulations therein expressed, shall be liquidated and paid. The clause seems to be inserted for the express purpose of reserving the ownership until actual payment. Upon a view of the whole instrument the parties, as it seems to me, have shewn that they understood, when entering into the contract, the difference between security for money to be paid at a future day and actual payment of such money, and that, however unreasonable the terms imposed by the vendor may have been, the parties agreed that the property should remain the property of the vendors until actual payment, notwithstanding that for a limited purpose the vendees might have possession before payment.\nIf I could see that the doctrine of lien applied to the case I should have no difficulty in holding that the plaintiffs, by parting with the possession, had lost any lien they may have had, but I cannot see that the doctrine of lien at all affects the case. The question is, in my opinion, one of property, not of lien, namely, whether, in virtue of the provisions of the instrument, the property in the timber had passed from the plaintiffs to Cunliffe & Stephens, eo instanti of the draft being accepted?\nSo viewing the case stated and the question submitted, I cannot hold that the property did pass then, without ignoring this clause.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Ezekiel McLeod.\nSolicitors for respondents: Fraser, Wetmore & Winslow.\n[1] See Turner v.

V., a brother of respondents, had obtained from appellant a fourth share in the vessel, the purchase being effected by one of the respondents; and it was also shown that the agreement between the parties was as alleged in the declaration. On the arrival of the vessel at Liverpool, respondents went to a large expense in coppering her, contrary to directions, and sent her on a voyage to Liverpool, of which he disapproved.\nAppellant wrote to respondents, complaining of their conduct and protesting against the expense incurred. They replied, that appellant could have no cause of complaint against them in their management of the vessel, and alleged they would not have purchased a fourth interest in the vessel, if they had not understood that they were to have the management and control of the vessel when on the other side of the Atlantic. A correspondence ensued, and finally, on the 17th Nov., 1869, appellant wrote to them, referring to the fact that respondents complained of the \"eternal bickerings,\" and that it was not their fault. He then reasserted his right to control the vessel, stated, in detail, his grounds of complaint against them, and closed with the words: \"To end the matter, if your brother will dispose of his quarter, I will purchase it, say for $4,200, in cash.\" This amount was about the same price for the share as appellant had sold it for some years before. Respondents accepted the offer, and the transfer was made to appellant.\nHeld, on appeal, reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, that the expression \"to end the matter\" should be construed as applying to the bickerings referred to, and there had not been an accord and satisfaction.\nThe contract having been made between appellant and respondents only, and being a contract of agency apart from any question of ownership, the action was properly brought by appellant in his own name.\n(Taschereau and Gwynne, J.J., dissenting.)\nAppeal from the decision of the Supreme Court of the Province of New Brunswick, discharging a rule nisi obtained by the above named appellant, calling on the respondents to show cause why a non-suit granted in the above cause should not be set aside.\nThe facts of the case, as stated by the Hon. Mr. Justice Duff in the court below[1], are as follows\n\"This is an action of special assumpsit, brought by the plaintiff against the defendants, who are merchants and ship brokers in Liverpool, England. The declaration contains but one count, in which it is alleged that the defendants, at the time of the making of the promise, &c., were merchants in Liverpool, England, to wit, &c., under the name, style and firm of \"Vaughan Brothers & Co.,\" that the plaintiff was interested in and part owner of a certain barque called the \"Ansel,\" and had the entire charge thereof as ship's husband; and also had the sole management of the business of the said barque or vessel, and the direction of the voyages thereof; that the said barque was then lying in the port of Saint John, about to sail for Liverpool aforesaid; and thereupon, in consideration that the plaintiff would consign her to the defendants on her arrival in Liverpool, and would retain and employ the defendants to act as his agents and brokers in England, for and in regard to the said barque, and the business connected thereunto, for certain commissions, &c., to be paid to them by the said plaintiff, they, the said defendants, undertook and promised the plaintiff, that whilst they, the said defendants, should be such agents and brokers, they would obey and follow the directions and orders of the plaintiff in regard to the said barque or vessel, and also as to what voyages she should go; and they would not charter or send the said barque on any voyage except as thereto directed and ordered by the said plaintiff, and with his consent and approbation, to wit, &c.\n\"Averment\u2014That the plaintiff, trusting and confiding, &c., did afterwards, to wit, &c., consign the said barque to the defendants on her arrival at Liverpool, aforesaid, and did retain and employ them as her agents and brokers as aforesaid, in regard to the said barque, and the business connected therewith, for certain commissions, &c., to be paid to them by the said plaintiff; that on the arrival of the said barque at Liverpool, aforesaid, the plaintiff did direct and order the defendants not to copper or sheath her, but as soon as she should have discharged her inward cargo, to charter her on the best terms for a voyage for any port or ports on the Continent of America, north of Baltimore.\n\"Breach\u2014That defendants, against the directions and orders of the plaintiff, and without his consent and approbation, coppered and sheathed the barque, and thereby and therefor expended a large sum of money, to wit, &c., which the plaintiff was forced and obliged to pay; and further that against the plaintiff's orders and directions, and without his consent or approbation. the defendants chartered and sent the said barque on a voyage to New Orleans, in the Gulf of Mexico, a port not north of Baltimore, but a great distance south of it; and in the course of the said voyage, and in consequence thereof, the plaintiff not only had to expend a large sum of money, to wit, &c., in and about the said barque and her disbursements, which otherwise he would not have done; but he also thereby sustained great loss and damage, and was deprived of great gains and profits, amounting to a large sum of money, to wit, &c.\n\"To this declaration the defendants pleaded (before \"the Common Law Procedure Act, 1873,\" came into force) the general issue.\n\"On the trial before the learned Chief Justice, at the Saint John Circuit in August, 1876, the following facts appeared in evidence:\n\"On the 1st June, 1868, the plaintiff was registered owner of 48-64 shares in the barque \"Ansel,\" then lying in the harbor of Saint John; and Richard S. DeVeber and James S. Boies DeVeber were registered owners of the remaining 16-64 shares.\nJames Vaughan, one of the defendants, being then in Saint John, called on the plaintiff and suggested to him the expediency of his having an agent in Liverpool to look after the vessel there. He spoke of purchasing an interest in her himself; and the plaintiff, after consulting with his co-owners, finally agreed to sell him one-fourth interest in her for $4,000. And on the part of the plaintiff it also appeared that he then employed the defendants as his agents in connection with the vessel in Liverpool, but upon the express and distinct understanding and agreement that he should retain the entire control and management of her; and thereupon by Mr. James Vaughan's directions, the plaintiff transferred one fourth of the barque unto the name of Edwin Vaughan, on the 26th June, 1868. \"Mr. James Vaughan had been informed by the plaintiff, in the course of these negotiations, that there was a leak in the vessel, which the latter had been unable to discover; that he did not intend to have her coppered until it was found out, and that, therefore, she must be kept in the North-Atlantic in the meantime.\n\"She was despatched from Saint John about the 29th June, 1868, consigned to the defendants at Liverpool, with a letter of instructions from the plaintiff to send an onward freight to Saint John or Boston, or some port not south of the latter place. On the arrival of the vessel at Liverpool, the defendants proceeded to copper her; and against the plaintiff's instructions they sent her to New Orleans. An angry correspondence between the plaintiff and defendants ensued, which was continued for about fifteen months; and in the course of which the plaintiff claimed to represent three-fourths of the vessel\u2014that is to say, his own shares and those of Messrs. DeVebers. He asserted his right to manage and control her, and charged the defendants with disobedience to his orders. In a letter under date of 31st Aug., 1868, addressed to the defendants, he enumerated a variety of grounds of complaint against them; and amongst others that they had improperly discharged Capt. Graham, the master who had taken her to Liverpool, and substituted for him a relative of their own\u2014Captain Thomas Vaughan; that they had, without any authority, coppered the vessel in Liverpool at a heavy expense; and that, contrary to his express instructions, they had sent her to a southern port, viz., New Orleans. And against all these things, especially the coppering of the vessel, as well on his own behalf, as for the Messrs. De Vebers, he protested, as having been wholly unnecessary and unauthorized. In a subsequent letter, of date 28th Sept., 1868, he informed the defendants that the Messrs. DeVebers concurred with him in the view which he had taken of their conduct in relation to the vessel. Again on the 2nd of Nov., 1868, he wrote to them as follows: 'I must reiterate what I have already stated\u2014that in coppering her you did so without the consent of the other owners, incurred a heavy expense without consulting their wishes; and also, in sending her to New Orleans, you acted contrary to the instructions contained in my letter, which, to my mind, expressed very clearly, upon what voyage I wished the vessel to proceed; and which, I consider as representing three-fourths of the vessel, I had a right to direct.' He also told them in that letter that Messrs. DeVebers concurred with him in thinking the extra expense, incurred by the dismissal of Captain Graham, was unauthorized and was improperly incurred.\n\"The defendants, on the other hand, denied the existence of any agreement or understanding, whereby the plaintiff was to have the management and control of the vessel. They allege, on the contrary, that they were to manage her in Liverpool; and that it was upon that understanding only that they became purchasers of a share in her; and having the management of her in Liverpool, they say that they acted for the best interest of all concerned in coppering her and sending her to a southern port. They assert that they never would have purchased an interest in the vessel at all, but with a view to their having the management of her in England. Finally, on the 17th of Nov., 1869, the plaintiff wrote to defendants a letter, of which the following is an extract:\n\"'You are well aware that there are other owners who are equally dissatisfied with the conduct of the matters by you, and the loss the barque has sustained by your assuming the responsibility.' 'You complain both in your letter to me, as in that to Cudlip & Snider, of the eternal bickerings; and you say it is not your fault. In reply: 'had I not reason to find fault when my instructions were not only disregarded, but what I requested not to be done was done, and at owners' expense, and the property treated as if neither Mr. DeVeber or I had any interest?' 'You were only my agents; and if you acted this way I had a right to complain, and you gave me every occasion.' 'To end the matter; if your brother wishes to dispose of his quarter, I will purchase it, say for $4,200 in cash, on proper transfer, after discharge at Woolwich.'\n\"The defendants accepted this offer, and they procured a transfer to be made by Edwin Vaughan, to the plaintiff, of the quarter of the vessel which stood in his name, upon payment by the plaintiff of the sum of $4,200.\n\"The learned Chief Justice, on the trial, held that this letter, coupled with the acceptance of it by the defendants, and the transfer of his share in the vessel by Edwin Vaughan to the plaintiff, operated as an accord and satisfaction of the plaintiff's cause of action; and he thereupon non-suited the plaintiff.\"\nMr. Thomson, Q. C., and Mr. McLeod appeared for the appellant and referred to Taylor on evidence[2]; Smith v. Thompson[3]; Hussey v. Horne-Payne[4]; Hardman v. Bellhouse[5]; Bolckow v. Seymour[6], and Thomas v. Lewis[7].\nMr. Tuck, Q. C., appeared for the respondents and referred to Taylor on evidence[8]; Giffard v. Whittaker[9]; Furness v. Meek[10].\nRITCHIE, C.J.: [After reading the statement of facts hereinbefore given proceeded as follows:]\nAs the plaintiff was non-suited solely on the ground that an accord and satisfaction had been established, it is not necessary on this point to consider the evidence, because in determining this question we must assume that the contract as alleged was proved, and the learned Chief Justice thought there was in connection with the question of accord and satisfaction nothing to leave to the jury, but rested his ruling entirely on a letter addressed by Mr. Weldon to the defendants, dated 17th Nov., 1869, containing an offer by plaintiff to purchase back from Edwin Vaughan the share transferred by him, holding that when that offer was accepted there was an accord, and when the shares were transferred to the plaintiff, there was a complete satisfaction of this matter. When the case was moved before the full bench, the Chief Justice adhered to the opinion that the non-suit was right, but, he says, \"with some doubts, I admit.\"\nAs the burthen is on the defendant of establishing an allegation of accord and satisfaction, he is bound to establish it beyond all reasonable doubt, and if the evidence was verbal, and had to be submitted to a jury, it would be the duty of the jury to find against the defendant on an issue of accord and satisfaction, unless defendant's evidence established it to their satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt. So, if he relies on documents, which the court have to construe, as establishing his defence of accord and satisfaction, and they are so ambiguously worded as to be fairly capable of a construction inconsistent with his contention, I think the court, unless satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that what is put forward as an accord and satisfaction was intended by both parties as such, and that there was an acceptance in satisfaction as an act of the will of party receiving, should not, by a doubtful construction, deprive a plaintiff of an unquestionable legal right which accord and satisfaction assumes he has.\nThe only accord that can be set up in this case is that Weldon agreed to accept an agreement that Edwin Vaughan should sell his shares in the vessel at their full value, in full satisfaction of all damages sustained by him by reason of defendants' alleged breach of contract, but I cannot bring my mind to the conclusion that the letters clearly establish this.\nI take it to be clear that there must be a sufficient satisfaction, and that it must appear to be of some value or advantage to plaintiff, and I question very much whether the unexpressed idea of getting rid of a troublesome partner (which has been suggested) could be considered a sufficient and full satisfaction.\nI think that the offer was for the purchase of the defendants' shares in the vessel only. That the consideration paid was for the price and value of the vessel; that the matter \"to be put an end to\" was the matter which the sale of the vessel would put an end to, viz., bickerings as to her future management. That there was no satisfaction for the breaches of the contract; that the burthen of showing a full satisfaction for the breach of the contract was on the defendants, and that the acceptance in satisfaction must be an act of the will of the party receiving. That the letters show nothing given in satisfaction for the unliquidated damages accruing from a breach of defendants' agreement with plaintiff. Defendants get the value of their shares in the ship and their connection with her ceases, and in their letter of Dec. 9th, 1869, accepting the offer, they do not treat or suggest even that the transaction is in satisfaction of damages, that they designed it as such, or that they considered plaintiff in purchasing the vessel received it as such,\u2014they say\nWe accept your offer for the fourth we are interested in, being $4,200, after completion of her voyage to Woolwich. The transfer and bill of sale will go out by next mail, on receipt of which please hand to our agent, Mr. Lockhart, the cash in cash. There is not the slightest allusion to any claim of Weldon against them, still less to the satisfaction of any such claim, or that the transfer of the vessel was to be accepted in satisfaction of anything but in consideration of the price paid for the shares sold. In effect, we are asked to read the words \"to end the matter,\" not as referring to the \"bickerings,\" but as if they were equivalent to end the matter of the bickerings, and in full satisfaction of all claims and demands that I have against you for all damages, for all breaches of your agreement with me.\nIn McDowall v. Boyd[11], an averment that a bill of exchange was given \"for and on account of and in payment and discharge\" of a debt, is held not equivalent to an averment that the bill was given in satisfaction of such debt. In that case Wightman, J., said:\nIt is contended that the words express not merely a suspension, but a satisfaction of the debt: that is, that the words \"in payment and discharge\" are equivalent to satisfaction. I cannot attribute this meaning to these words. I always distrust the use of supposed equivalents, and the effect of the two cases referred to is this: in Maillard v. The Duke of Argyle[12] \"payment\" was considered not equivalent to \"satisfaction\"; and in Emblin v. Dartnell[13] \"discharge\" was decided not to mean \"satisfaction.\"\nThe learned Chief Justice of the court below says:\nI will not say that the plaintiff's letter will not bear the construction which my learned brother Duff has put upon it, but I think that is not the natural meaning of the language, nor such a construction as the defendants would probably put and were justified in putting on it.\nBut notwithstanding this, it was not without some doubts that the learned Chief Justice, as he tells us, came to the conclusion he did. On the other hand, Mr. Justice Duff thinks that although the words \"to end the matter\" may certainly bear the construction which the learned Chief Justice has put upon them, he thinks it a somewhat forced and constrained one.\nThis is not, he says, the most appropriate language to express the satisfaction of a debt or the release of a cause of action.\nAnd in a very able judgment, I think he very forcibly shows that the more consistent and reasonable construction, is to apply the expression \"to end the matter\" to the bickerings referred to, giving those words \"to end the matter\" their exact literal meaning rather than construing them as figurative, and as equivalent to the terms \"satisfying and discharging.\" The very able and exhaustive manner in which Judge Duff has treated this question leaves nothing more to be said.\nThis was the only point discussed in the judgments delivered in the court below, but as one of the points taken on the motion for a non-suit was that there was \"no contract with the plaintiff alone, but with the owners of the ship,\" and though this is not put forward in the respondents' factum, and, in fact, was not argued before us, still, as I understand one of my brother judges thinks that if the accord and satisfaction was not an answer still plaintiff could not recover in this action in his own name against the defendants, I do not think it right to discuss the question as to whether plaintiff or defendants supported their respective contentions as to the agreement alleged, in the declaration, nor as to whether plaintiff could, or could not, recover damages for all the matters he alleges he is entitled to. These questions must be tried out before a jury, if the appeal is allowed, but I feel it right to say a few words as to plaintiff's right to bring the action, supposing the allegations in the declaration shall be sustained on another trial.\nIf this vessel was by the owners placed in the possession and under the sole control of plaintiff, one of the part owners and the largest part owner, for the purpose of running and managing the vessel and all business connected with her, as he, in his judgment and discretion, should consider best for the interests of all concerned, which I understand from the case was the position of matters when plaintiff sold by bill of sale to Edwin Vaughan, not a member of Vaughan Bros., a small interest in the vessel, 16\/64 shares, and which arrangement appears to have been communicated to James Vaughan, a member of the firm of Vaughan Bros., who negotiated the purchase and directed the transfer to be made to Edwin Vaughan, and was acquiesced in by the new part owner as well as by Vaughan Bros., as plaintiff alleges, the plaintiff, having the vessel in his possession and under his sole control, and the sole right, by himself and those it should be necessary for him to employ, at home or abroad, to manage and control the movements of the said vessel, and to do and transact all things necessary to the preservation and employment of the vessel, and he did enter into a contract with the plaintiffs such as is set out in the declaration in this case, whereby the vessel was by plaintiff consigned to them and placed under their control, not as part owners if they were interested in her, but as his (plaintiff's) agents and brokers for commission and reward to be paid them by plaintiff, as alleged, and if they broke the agreement, and in defiance of its terms acted in direct opposition thereto, and to the directions of plaintiff, I can see no reason why the plaintiff, the only party to that express agreement on the one side, should not bring an action at law in his own name for such a breach by the defendants; the parties on the other side, to the agreement, in like manner, as defendants, might sue Weldon for their commission and reward on their fulfilling their part of the agreement and so earning such commission and reward[14].\nNor can I understand how they can justify such a breach as is alleged by any authority they may claim to have as claiming to be interested in the vessel, or which they may have received from Edwin Vaughan, a registered part-owner, holding a minority of shares in the vessel; having accepted the consignment of the vessel from plaintiff and agreed to act as his agent and broker, they were bound to obey his instructions and deal with the property he had so placed in their hands as his agent and broker, and as he directed them, or have given up the agency and restored the vessel to the possession and control of the plaintiff.\nThe only privity of contract that existed, as put forward by plaintiff, was with him and the defendants, and the contract was a contract of agency apart from any question of ownership. Mr. McLachlan, on the Law of Merchant Shipping[15], thus speaks of the position of the agent of a ship's husband and his non-accountability to the owners:\nThe owners cannot reach the earnings of the ship if in the hands of the banker or other agent of the ship's husband, although a separate account of them is headed with the name of the ship; there being no privity of contract with the owners, and the banker being accountable only to his customer, or the customer's assignee, if bankrupt, or his executors, if dead.\"\nAnd the case of Sims v. Brittain[16], fully sustains this doctrine; the marginal note of that case is this:\nA. B. and others were owners of a ship in the service of the East India Company. B. was managing owner, and employed C. as his agent for general purposes, and amongst others to receive and pay monies on account of the ship; and C. kept an account in his books with B., as such managing owner. To obtain payment of a sum of money due from the East India Company on account of the ship, it was necessary that the receipt should be signed by one or more of the owners, besides the managing owner, and upon a receipt signed by B. and one of the other owners, C. received on account of the ship \u00a32,000 from the East India Company, and placed it to B's credit in his books, as managing owner. The part-owners having brought an action for money had and received, to recover the balance of that account: Held, that C. had received the money as agent of B., and was accountable to him for it; that there was no privity between the other part-owners and C., and consequently that the action was not maintainable.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThere are but two leading questions to be disposed of in this case: 1st. Whether the letter of the appellant to the respondent of the 19th November, 1869, and the acceptance of the offer contained in it, amounted to accord and satisfaction for the damages claimed in the declaration; and 2nd. Whether the appellant, being a part owner and agent of the other owners at the time of the alleged agreement for the consignment of the ship to the respondent's firm, can maintain the suit. It does not clearly appear that the latter objection was taken on the trial, but the consideration of it formed no part of the reason given by the learned Chief Justice, before whom the case was tried, for the non-suit he ordered. His decision was solely on the ground that the letter in question was, when its terms were accepted, evidence of accord and satisfaction. After full consideration of it and the whole of the previous circumstances, and the correspondence between the parties, I am of opinion that the decision was wrong.\nTo say the least, the expression referred to, \"to end the matter,\" was of very doubtful meaning. It is, and must be, admitted that the words may be read in at least two ways. They may have been meant to be applied to putting an end to the \"bickerings\" complained of by the respondents' firm, and to prevent disagreements likely to arise from the relative positions the parties occupied in regard to the management and employment of the ship, each differing from the other as to the control of her, both in England and in St. John. The appellant may be assumed to have felt that the only practical way to prevent the recurrence of such disagreements was by acquiring his former position; to do which, it would be necessary to purchase back the share of the ship he had sold and transferred to the brother of the respondents. As early as August, 1868, and before any claim for damage had arisen, the appellant wrote to the respondents' company that \"being desirous of avoiding difficulties in the management of the ship,\" he and Mr. DeVeber, the other owner, would sell out to respondents' company their shares on the same terms the appellant had sold the quarter, and for the same reason repeats the offer in a subsequent letter in November of the same year. When, then, the offer was not accepted, he, it may, I think, fairly be assumed, for the same and no other reason, offered to purchase at a higher rate. In his letter of the 19th Nov., 1869, after referring to letters of the respondents' firm to himself and Cudlip complaining \"of the eternal bickerings, &c.,\" of the appellant, he at first justifies himself against the charge, and winds up thus:\nYou were only my agents, and if you acted in this way I had a right to complain and you gave every occasion. To end the matter, if your brother wishes to dispose of his quarter I will purchase it for say four thousand two hundred dollars in cash on proper transfer, after discharge at Woolwich.\nFrom this it is contended the words in question contain an offer to receive, in accord satisfaction of his present claim, the re-transfer of the ship on the terms stated. Not only so, but that that is the only construction to be put upon them, because, to sustain the non-suit, that position is necessary. If such were, at the time, in the mind of the appellant, he, I think, failed to say so, or at all events to use language necessarily conveying that idea. It must not be forgotten that up to the date of that letter not a word had passed between the parties as to any claim for damages on the part of the appellant, except for the costs caused by the alleged improper dismissal of the master. No reference is made to the subject in the letter itself. There is no evidence even that, at that time, the appellant had determined to make any such claim for damages, except as I before stated. No disagreement in reference thereto then existed, and if not, how can the respondents now contend that they so understood the words? How could the respondents' firm think, when getting their brother to resell the vessel\u2014and for her full value too\u2014to the appellant, they were doing so in accord and satisfaction of a demand and claim that had never been made against them? If the appellant paid, as the evidence shows, the full value for the quarter he repurchased, what consideration had he for the accord and satisfaction of his claim, amounting to as much at least as the value of the shares he got back, and if he got nothing but considered his claim well founded, how can it be presumed or concluded he intended it to be included in his offer? His offer may fairly be said to have been made \"to end the matter\" in respect of the bickerings he referred to, and nothing more, and I cannot see how the respondents' firm could have understood it as referring to or including anything further. It is shown that when that letter was written, the appellant and the respondent had never had any settlement of accounts in respect of the ship. The appellant wanted further statements and more information, and some charges in the accounts of the respondents' firm he disputed, and at that time the latter claimed a large balance from him. The respondents' firm took legal proceedings to recover that balance. If, then, the words in question be construed to cover the appellant's claim, why not the counter one? If the expression really meant \"to end the matter\" as between them\u2014that is, the dealing with the ship-why should it not include the claim on one side as well as the other? It must be construed as a final and full settlement of all their dealings, or it must have a restricted construction. Did the respondents' firm accept it as a final settlement? The evidence shows they did not. I am inclined to conclude there is but one reasonable construction to be put on the offer of the appellant, and that is the very opposite of that put upon it by the majority of the court below. The issue is raised by the respondent; his defence depends on proving it. If his evidence is unsatisfactory the result must be against him. The defence here rests, at the best, upon an ambiguous expression. It is the duty of the respondents, by evidence, to explain that ambiguity before it is sufficient evidence of their plea or defence. They have not done so, and the reasonable conclusions in my mind are against the construction they contend for. It is quite true that every one's language is to be construed against him, but there are limits to that rule, and it can never be applied to force one into a position which the context and surrounding circumstances do not warrant.\nWhether the conclusion I have reached be the correct one or not, I fail to see how the non-suit can be sustained. The judge, on a trial, would no doubt have the right to decide upon the legal questions arising, but I can find no authority to warrant a judgment of non-suit in this case. The construction of the letter was, according to all governing authorities, for the jury and not for the judge. If the letter furnished explicit evidence to sustain the defence, the case would be essentially different. Here the meaning is to be gathered from the general terms of the letter, and the whole of the surrounding circumstances. If a judge had also to assume the functions of a jury, his decision would be a verdict founded on facts as well as law; but when a jury is sworn it is solely their province to resolve as to doubtful evidence and decide upon doubtful circumstances; and a judge has no power or right to usurp their peculiar functions. The authorities are, I think, too clear and decided upon the point to leave any doubt about it.\nThe second question is as to the right of the appellant to bring the present suit, he being a part owner and ship's husband, and the agent of the other owners. This position was shown by evidence for the appellant on the trial, which, if affected by negative proof, should have been submitted to the jury.\nStory in his work on agency[17] says:\u2014\nIt may be laid down as a general rule that whenever an agent, although known to be such, has a special property in the subject matter of the contract and not a bare custody thereof, or when he has acquired an interest in it, or has a hen upon it, he may, in all such cases, sue upon the contract.\nThe authorities he cites, and others, fully sustain the position[18]. The agreement set up is an oral one, and for a breach of it an action lies as well in the name of the agent having an interest as part owner, as in the name of the owners. In relation to the rights of agents against third persons; Story, after giving two positions in which agents may sue on contracts made with them, says[19]:\u2014\nThirdly, where by the usage of trade or the general course of business, the agent is authorized to act as the owner or as a principal contracting party, although his character of agent is known. Fourthly, when the agent has made a contract in the subject matter of which he has a special interest or property, whether he professed at the time to be acting for himself or not. In all these cases the agent acquires personal rights, and may maintain an action upon the contract in his own name without any distinction whether his principal is or is not entitled also to similar rights and remedies on the same contract.\nI think the appeal should be allowed, the judgment below reversed, the non-suit set aside, and a new trial granted with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion this appeal should be dismissed. That the construction of the letters between the parties belonged to the court alone admits of no doubt. That the Chief Justice, at the trial, and the court, in giving judgment upon the appellant's motion to set aside the non-suit granted by the Chief Justice, have properly construed these letters, seems to me also clear. The appellant, in the face of his letter of the 17th November, 1869, and the respondent's answer thereto of the 9th December, 1869, cannot now be allowed to say that he did not accept Edwin Vaughan's share in the vessel in accord and satisfaction. He proposed to \"end the matter\" by the purchase of this share. Now, the matter to be ended consisted in the various causes of complaint set forth in the appellant's letter of the 17th November; and the respondents could reasonably expect, when accepting the appellant's offer, that all matters in dispute between them were settled.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nIt is an invariable rule of law that the construction of all written documents is for the court and not for the jury, unless there are any mercantile terms introduced having a meaning different from what they ordinarily bear[20]; or, unless it be shewn by extrinsic evidence that the terms are so ambiguous as to require explanation, in which case, parol evidence being admissible to explain the ambiguity and to shew what was really meant, the whole becomes open for the jury.\nIn Hussey v. Horne-Payne[21], it was held that no contract ought to be held established by letters which would otherwise be sufficient for the purpose, if it is clear upon the facts that there were other conditions of the intended contract, beyond and beside those expressed in the letters, which were still in a state of negotiation only, and without the settlement of which the parties had no intention of concluding any agreement; but if the question is, whether or not certain documents produced in evidence contain any, and, if any, what contract; and it is admitted that the documents contain all the terms of such contract, if there be any, and there are no mercantile terms introduced, and there is no extrinsic evidence bearing on the question, beyond and beside what is contained in the written documents, it is not competent for a judge to ask the assistance of a jury in construing the documents[22]. Here there was no extrinsic evidence given or offered to shew that any expression in the written documents was used in a particular sense different from what would be its natural meaning\u2014nothing controlling the meaning of the words used\u2014there was no suggestion that the letters did not contain the whole contract, if any there was contained in them. The question was one of construction wholly, namely, did, or not, the letters contain, as the defendants insisted that they did, an agreement for the accord and satisfaction of all claim of the plaintiff in respect of the matters which formed the subject of the action; and that was, in my judgment, a question wholly for the court and not for the jury to deter- mine; and as to the construction put upon the letters by the court below, I am not prepared to pronounce it to be erroneous. It was contended that it is erroneous, upon the ground that, as the claim sued for is one in which other co-owners of a ship were interested as well as the plaintiff, it could not reasonably be supposed that the plaintiff was effecting to bind the interests of such other co-owners in the arrangement he was making with the defendants; but assuming this to be so, there could be no doubt that he could bind his own interests, and that is all the defendants insist upon, in so far as regards their contention upon this point. The fact, however, which is involved in this argument, a fact which does not admit of dispute, namely, that the cause of action, in respect of which recovery is sought in this suit, is one in which all co-owners are alike interested, is, to my mind conclusive that this action cannot be maintained, and that the non-suit is supportable upon the other grounds taken at the trial, although the court below has proceeded upon the ground of accord and satisfaction only.\nThese objections were\u2014that there was no evidence of the contract alleged in the declaration; that the only agreement between plaintiff and the defendants was in writing, and it contained no such terms as those declared upon; that the contract, if any, was not with the plaintiff alone, but with the owners of the ship, and that plaintiff could not sue in his own name only; that the plaintiff proved no damage; that there was no evidence of payment by the plaintiff of any money, as alleged in the declaration, as a consequence of the alleged breach of contract therein stated; and as to coppering the vessel that there was no evidence of that having been done, as alleged, after the plaintiff had given his directions that it should not be done. The evidence was that it was done before these directions were given. Now, the declaration is, that whereas the defendants were merchants doing business in Liverpool, England, under the name and style of Vaughan Brothers & Co.; and whereas, to-wit, on the 1st day of June, 1868, the plaintiff was interested in and part-owner of a certain barque or vessel called the \"Ansel,\" then lying in the port of St. John, and about to sail for Liverpool, and had the entire charge and control thereof as ship's husband, and also had the sole management of the business of the said barque or vessel, and direction of the voyages thereof, and thereupon, in consideration that the plaintiff would consign the said barque or vessel to the said defendants on her arrival in Liverpool, and would retain and employ the defendants to act as his agents and brokers in England, for certain reward and commission to be paid to the defendants by the plaintiff, they the defendants then and there undertook, and faithfully promised the plaintiff, that while they the defendants were such agents and brokers they would obey and follow the directions and orders of the plaintiff in regard to the said barque or vessel, and also as to what voyage or voyages she might go, and that they would not charter or send the said barque or vessel for or on any voyage or voyages, except as thereto directed and ordered by the said plaintiff, and with his consent and approbation; and the plaintiff averred that, confiding in said promise of the defendants, he did afterwards consign the said vessel to the defendants on her arrival at Liverpool, and did retain and employ the defendants as his agents and brokers in regard to the said vessel, and the business connected therewith, for certain reward and commission to be paid to the defendants by the plaintiff; and the plaintiff further saith that on the arrival of the said vessel at Liverpool, to wit, &c., the plaintiff did direct and order the defendants not to copper or sheath the said vessel, but as soon as she discharged her inward cargo to charter the said vessel at the best terms for a voyage to any port or ports on the Continent of America, north of Baltimore and not south of the said port of Baltimore. Yet the defendants, not regarding the said promise and undertaking, and against the directions and orders of the plaintiff, and without his consent and approbation, did copper and sheath the said barque or vessel, and thereby and therefor expended a large sum of money to wit, the sum of $5,000 which the plaintiff was obliged and forced to pay; and further, against the directions and orders of the plaintiff, and without his consent and approbation, chartered and sent the said vessel on a voyage to New Orleans, a port on the Continent of America, not north of Baltimore, but a great distance south of that port, and that in the course of the said voyage, and in consequence thereof, the said plaintiff not only had to pay and expend a large sum of money, to wit, the sum of $5,000, in and about the said vessel, and the disbursments thereof, which otherwise he would not have done, but also thereby sustained great loss and damage, and was deprived of great gains and profits amounting to a large sum of money, to wit: the sum of $10,000, which he otherwise would have made, to the plaintiff's damage of $20,000, and therefore he brings his suit.\nIt will be observed that the cause of action here stated is rested upon a special agreement alleged to have been made with the plaintiff, a co-owner and ship's husband of the vessel, whereby, in consideration merely of the defendants being appointed agents and brokers in England of the plaintiff, as such ship's husband, and in consideration of certain commission and reward to be paid by the plaintiff to them as such his agents and brokers, they (not being otherwise interested in the vessel than as such agents and brokers of the plaintiff) promised as alleged, and that the damage occasioned by the breach of the defendants alleged promise is damage alleged to have been sustained by the plaintiff in his character of co-owner of the vessel, and not as ship's husband. This is the gist and substance of the declaration and of the plaintiff's claim as therein stated.\nTo this claim the defendants' defence is, that no such contract or promise as is alleged in the declaration was ever entered into or made by the defendants, and that they did the acts which are complained of in right of their being co-owners also of the vessel with the plaintiff, and under the authority also of Edwin Vaughan, who, as their nominee, appeared upon the registry as owner of sixteen shares owned by them in the vessel, and in virtue also of their having been, as they claim to have been, ship's husband in England of the vessel. Upon the discussion, however, of this question of non-suit we must proceed upon the plaintiff's evidence of the transaction out of which the alleged promise stated in the declaration arose, and the question will simply be: does that evidence, taken in connection with other undisputed evidence which was given by the defendants, support or displace the cause of action set out in the declaration?\nThe plaintiff's evidence is that on the 1st of June, 1868, he owned 48 shares of the vessel, one Richard S. DeVeber owning eight shares, and one J. S. Boies DeVeber owning the other eight shares; that on that day the defendant James Vaughan came to his office and talked about purchasing an interest in the vessel, and about the advisability of having a person in Liverpool to look after her. That he told Vaughan that he, plaintiff, was ship's husband, and that if he, Vaughan, would take one-fourth he could be plaintiff's agent of the vessel in England. That James Vaughan said he would purchase the one-fourth share, and would let the plaintiff know into whose name the transfer should be made, and he afterwards told plaintiff that it should be in the name of Edwin Vaughan. That he, plaintiff, drew up a memorandum of the agreement, which was signed by himself and James Vaughan, and which he produced, and is as follows:\u2014\nBought of Charles W. Weldon sixteen sixty-fourth shares of the ship Ansel, 818 tons register, for the sum of $4,000 currency, payable on the proper transfer being duly executed, and the vessel to be taken on discharge of her present cargo in St. John, in as good order as she left Philadelphia.\nSt. John, June 1, 1868.\nI accept the above terms.\n(Signed,) Charles W. Weldon.\nJames Vaughan.\nThe plaintiff also produced a transcript from the registry, by which it appeared that on the 26th June, 1868, there was registered a bill of sale, dated the 4th June, 1868, whereby the plaintiff assigned and transferred to Edwin Vaughan sixteen shares in the vessel. The plaintiff further says that the vessel was to be sent to Vaughan Brothers and not to James Vaughan, to which James Vaughan assented. There was no evidence whatever to the effect that Vaughan had agreed, or that it was proposed to him, as part of the terms of purchase of the sixteen shares, that such purchase should be in any respect qualified, or that the transfer of those shares should not carry with it all the rights and incidents of ownership without any qualification, nor was any evidence given to the effect that, nor was it suggested that, James Vaughan had in terms expressly made any such undertaking and promise as in the declaration alleged. Such promise, therefore, can be established only as arising by implication from the circumstances attending the consignment of the vessel to the defendants and the information given by plaintiff to James Vaughan that the plaintiff was ship's husband when on the 1st June, 1868, Vaughan was negotiating with him for the purchase of an interest in the vessel.\nNow, in so far as this case is concerned, the transfer of the sixteen shares to Edwin Vanghan, by the direction of James Vaughan, in pursuance of the agreement for the purchase of those sixteen shares by James Vaughan upon behalf of Vaughan Brothers & Co., must be regarded as a purchase of those shares by Vaughan Brothers, who are, as between them and the plaintiff, to be treated as the owners thereof. That this was the view of the transaction taken by the plaintiff himself at the time of the purchase appears from certain letters from the plaintiff to the defendants, which were produced in evidence, dated respectively the 29th June, and the 18th and 25th July, and 2nd Nov., 1868, and the 20th Jan., 1869. In that of the 29th June, after mentioning the despatch of the vessel to them, he says:\nI have made up her accounts to the 10th instant, when she had finished discharging her inward cargo, including seamens' wages, of which I have made a statement, so that all her expenses up to that date will be charged three-fourths to me and the balance to Messrs. DeVeber; and in paying the men in Liverpool, on her arrival, the amount will be distributed in that way. The mortgage I had given when I purchased Glasgow and Black out I could not get discharged until Wednesday last, when the transfer to Mr. Edwin Vaughan was completed and the money paid over. I hope you will have secured an outward freight for her before her arrival either for this port or Boston, as I think for the present she should not go south of the latter port, and I trust you may be able to secure a freight of railway iron for this place. I send you the account of her cargo, and hoping that you will be fully satisfied with the ship.\nI am, yours truly,\nCharles W. Weldon.\nIn the letter of the 13th July he says:\nI had the pleasure, on the 29th ult., of informing you of the \"Ansel\" having left, and as we heard of her two days after she left, clear of the Bay, I trust she will be in Liverpool before this letter reaches you. I now enclose you an account of her disbursements for loading here, including repairs; also a memorandum of moneys received by Capt. Graham. You will see in the disbursements I only charge him with the balance after settling up his wages to the 10th June, the day the vessel began her outward voyage and discharged her cargo inwards. In paying off the men, in the like manner, the wages up to that date will be charged by you, three-fourths to me, and one quarter to Messrs. DeVeber, and after that one-half to me and one-quarter to Messrs. DeVeber, and same to yourself.\nIn the letter of the 25th July he says:\nI am in receipt of yours of last mail and note its contents. I sent you by last mail an account of disbursements outward, as I thought you would not care for the inward account, you not being liable for it. I, however, now enclose it as you wish it.\nIn the letter of the 2nd Nov., he says:\nWhile I am ready to admit that you were fully satisfied you were acting best for the owners, and the expenses certainly do not appear large, yet I must reiterate what I have already stated, that in coppering her you did it without the consent of the other owners, and incurred a heavy expense without consulting their wishes; and also in sending her to New Orleans you acted contrary to the instructions contained in my letters, which, to my mind, expressed very clearly upon what voyage I wished the \"Ansel\" to proceed, and which I consider, as representing three-fourths of the vessel, I had a right to direct.\nIt may be observed in passing that the plaintiff's right of controlling the defendants as owners of one-fourth only of the vessel is claimed only in right of the plaintiff representing the other three-fourths. Again, in the same letter he says:\nAs we certainly differ very much in our views in reference to the barque and her employment, a matter always to be avoided between part owners, and as you seem perfectly satisfied as to her success,\n* * * * * * * *\nand he repeats an offer previously made that the defendants should purchase the three-fourth parts represented by plaintiff, and he concludes:\nTrusting we shall soon hear of her safe arrival at New Orleans, I am, yours truly \u2014\u2014\u2014\nAnd in his letter of the 20th Jan., 1869, he says: I enclose my account against the ship to the beginning of the year. Trusting she will have a speedy voyage, I am yours, &c.\nIn this account is a charge of \"allowance for half year, acting as ship's husband, $50.00,\" and the total amount of plaintiff's charge against the ship for the half year ending 1st Jan., 1869, amounting to $158.68 is distributed by him as follows:\nCharles W. Weldon\n$79.34 = 1\/2 or 32\/64\nL. H. DeVeber & Sons\n39.67 = 1\/4 \" 16\/64\nVaughan Brothers & Co.\n39.67 = 1\/4 \" 16\/64\nIt appears, then, from the plaintiff's own evidence, that the consideration of the vessel being consigned to Vaughan Brothers was not that laid in the declaration, but that the vessel was consigned to them in consideration of their having become co-owners of the vessel by the purchase from the plaintiff of sixteen shares therein, the agreement for which purchase was produced and contained no terms qualifying the rights incident to co-ownership in a vessel, nor was there any evidence that the defendants, or James Vaughan on their behalf, had ever consented that the purchase should be qualified or restricted as to the exercise of any of the rights and priviliges by law incident to co-ownership and vested in a co-owner.\nThe defendants then, being regarded as the unqualified purchasers of sixteen shares sold to them by the plaintiff, the promise laid in the declaration could not be established without an express agreement made by the defendants in restraint of their claim to exercise the rights and privileges incident to co-ownership, and as no evidence of any such agreement was offered, it follows that the evidence wholly failed to support the cause of action stated in the declaration, and it is unnecessary to enquire to what extent such a promise, if made and proved, would be binding upon a co-owner.\nIt was proved by the evidence of James and Edwin Vaughan, which evidence was not contradicted, that the vessel was coppered and sheathed, and despatched to New Orleans, by the authority of the defendants as beneficial owners, and of Edwin Vaughan as registered owner of the sixteen shares purchased by the defendants from the plaintiff, and the plaintiff in his letter of the 2nd Nov., 1868, admits this, and that in doing so the defendants were satisfied they were acting best for all the owners, and however much the plaintiff may have been originally opposed to the voyage to New Orleans, there are passages in his letters of the 22nd Sept. and Nov. 2nd, 1868, and the 20th Jan., 1869, which seem to show that, however strong that objection may have originally been, he adopted the adventure, and was willing to share in the profits resulting from its proving successful, as the defendants represented they anticipated it would prove. But I do not dwell upon this seeming acquiescence, as the question under discussion is, does this action lie, acquiescence or no acquiescence?\nThe plaintiff's letters, however, and his evidence clearly show that the defendants, through Edwin Vaughan as registered owner, were the real beneficial owners of the one-fourth part of the vessel. Now, as to the coppering the vessel, the expense of which forms one item in the plaintiff's claim, the averment in the declaration is, that the defendants \"thereby and therefor expended a large sum of money.\" By the light of the undisputed evidence, we see that this expenditure was incurred by the defendants in virtue of their authority as co-owners of the vessel, backed by the authority (if that were necessary) of Edwin Vaughan as registered owner. The expenditure was, however, that of the defendants. It is not pretended that the plaintiff had ever any demand made upon him for that expenditure, or any part thereof, by the persons who did the work; the expense, therefore, alleged to have been incurred by the defendants in coppering the vessel, is either unpaid to them, and still remains part of the account to betaken between the co-owners, to be adjusted upon the taking of such accounts, or the plaintiff has already paid his proportion to the defendants and is now suing to recover it back.\nThe allegation in the declaration is that he has been obliged and forced to pay the monies expended by the defendants in coppering the vessel. It is part of the plaintiff's case, that the defendants incurred that expenditure without any authority whatever or consent of the plaintiff. Now as ship's husband, it is plain that he could not be obliged and forced to pay to any one, much less to the defendants, a sum of money expended upon the vessel by the defendants as co-owners without the authority of and against the will of the ship's husband, and the plaintiff, as a co-owner, could not be obliged and forced to pay, or to contribute to the payment of, expenditure authorized by another co-owner in coppering the vessel which is the subject of co-ownership, unless he was legally liable so to pay or contribute; if therefore he was, as is alleged in the declaration, obliged and forced to pay the expenses incurred by them in coppering the vessel, no action at plaintiff's suit will lie to recover back from the defendants that which he was legally obliged and forced to pay to them. As to the coppering, therefore, the plaintiff is by the evidence placed in this predicament: that he either has as yet paid nothing, and the subject is still matter of account yet to be taken between himself and his co-owners, or, if he has paid anything, he must be taken, upon the allegation in the declaration, to have been legally liable to pay the defendants whatever he did pay them, and so cannot recover back money so paid. The evidence, however, fails to shew any payment whatever made by the plaintiff of the expense of coppering, and upon the taking of the accounts, if any there be still to be taken, between the co-owners, in respect of the defendant's dealings with the vessel, the plaintiff must assert, if he can, his claim of exemption from liability to contribute to the expenditure attending the coppering and sheathing of the vessel.\nThen, as to the loss of profits and alleged expenditure upon the voyage to New Orleans. As to the alleged expenditure, the same observations will apply; and as to the loss of profits, it is clear, upon the authority of Holderness v. Schackles[23], and Green v. Briggs[24], that, although part owners are but tenants-in-common of a ship, yet they are jointly interested in her use and employment, and the law as to the earnings of a ship, whether as freight, cargo or otherwise, follows the general law of partnership. The question as to the plaintiff's rights in respect of the profit or loss upon the voyage, being one relating to a partnership matter in which all the co-owners are interested as partners, must be alone discussed in a proper suit instituted for adjusting the rights and interests of all parties interested. It is difficult to understand how the plaintiff can claim any damages for the loss of this adventure, without an account being taken of the profits of the adventure, which account can only be taken between the partners; and neither for this cause of action, any more than for the coppering of the vessel, can the plaintiff as ship's husband maintain this action.\nFor the above reasons, I am of opinion that this action clearly is not maintainable, and that the non-suit must be upheld, and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: E.

J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau, and Gwynne, J.J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nThe Fisheries Act, 31 Vic., c. 60\u2014Jurisdiction of Dominion Parliament over Bay of Chaleurs\u201414 and 15 Vic., c. 63 (Imp.)\u2014Justification, plea of\u2014Fishery Officer, right of, to seize \"on view.\"\nUnder the Imperial Statute, 14 and 15 Vic., c. 63, regulating the boundary line between Old Canada and New-Brunswick, the whole of the Bay of Chaleurs is within the present boundaries of the Provinces of Quebec and New-Brunswick, and within the Dominion of Canada and the operation of The Fisheries Act, 31 Vict., c. 60. Therefore the act of drifting for salmon in the Bay of Chaleurs, although that drifting may have been more than three miles from either shore of New-Brunswick or of Quebec abutting on the Bay, is a drifting in Canadian waters and within the prohibition of the last mentioned Act and of the regulations made in virtue thereof.\n2. The term \"on view\" in sub-sec. 4 of sec. 16 of The Fisheries Act[1] is not to be limited to seeing the net in the water while in the very act of drifting. If the party acting \"on view\" sees what, if testified to by him, would be sufficient to convict of the offence charged, that is sufficient for the purposes of the Act. Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[2], discharging a rule nisi to set aside the verdict and to enter a verdict for the defendant (appellant), and for a new trial.\nThis was an action of trespass for seizing and carrying away plaintiff's (respondent's) boat and nets.\nThe facts and pleadings sufficiently appear in the judgment of the Court hereinafter given.\nMr. Lash, Q. C., for appellant:\nThe first and most important question which arises in this case is, whether or not the Bay of Chaleurs is a part of the territory or territorial waters of Canada, and thereby comes within the operation and prohibition of The Fisheries Act. I claim the whole Bay is subject to the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe Bay of Chaleurs is wholly within the jaws of the land, and is a long bay or gulf, running up between the provinces of Quebec and New Brunswick, and emptying into the Gulf of St. Lawrence, which Gulf is the boundary, on the north, of both provinces. The Court will take judicial notice of the configuration and dimensions of the Bay. The Bay of Chaleurs then, by the law of nations, is not a part of the high seas, but a part of the territory or territorial waters of Canada, and subject to the laws enacted by the Canadian Parliament. Direct United States Cable Co. v. Anglo American Telegraph Co.[3]; The Queen v. Keyn[4].\nMoreover, by an Act of the Imperial Parliament, 14 and 15 Vic., c. 63, entitled \"An Act for the settlement of the Boundaries between the Provinces of Canada and New Brunswick,\" Parliament, confirming the award of the Right Honorable Stephen Lushington, and Travers Twiss, Doctor of Laws, defined the boundaries between Canada and New Brunswick (in that respect) as \"follows: \"thence \"down the centre of the stream of the Restigouche to \"its mouth in the Bay of Chaleurs, and thence through \"the middle of that Bay to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, \"etc.\"\nThen, if by the British North America Act, the whole of the Bay of Chaleurs became part of the territory of the Dominion, The Fisheries Act must be held to apply to this particular bay.\nThe next point is whether the defendant had a right to take the boat and nets for delivery to a magistrate. I claim that the effect of the statute is to confiscate to Her Majesty, immediately at the time of the committing of the illegal act, the materials illegally in use. See The \"Annandale\"[5].\nThe same principle is established in the U. S.[6]. This is a forfeiture under a statute, and therefore distinguishable from forfeiture at common law, which does not vest ipso facto.\nBut here the boat and nets were afterwards, and after due hearing of the matter, adjudged to be confiscated, and it was while the goods were in Her Majesty's possession, declared by the judgment to be Her property, that the respondent obtained a verdict for $900 for this same property, and for being prevented from carrying on an illegal business.\nI will now refer shortly to the appeal from the judgment on the demurrer.\nThe second plea alleges that the fishing boats and nets being implements and materials which were being illegally used, &c., were taken by the defendant, the fishery officer, which would mean that they were seized on view.\nThe Court below have evidently overlooked that part of sec. 16, sub-sec. 4, which authorizes any person, whether a fishery officer or not, to take and remove for delivery to any magistrate, fishing materials used in contravention of the Act or regulations made under it, without any limitation as to doing it on view.\nIt is clearly alleged in the second plea that defendant did take and remove the boat and nets to be delivered to a magistrate, and did deliver the same to James S. Morse, Esq., a magistrate, &c., and it makes no difference that in the plea the defendant is described as a fishery officer. That may be treated as description or surplusage. His rights and powers are none the less as an individual because he has special rights and powers as a fishery officer.\nThe third plea not only alleges in this respect all that the second plea alleges, but states in addition that a trial was had, and that the magistrate adjudged the boat and nets to be confiscated to Her Majesty.\nThe plaintiff relies on the fact that the action was brought before the conviction, overlooking the fact that the conviction relates back to the time of the committing of the illegal act. Robert qui tam v. Witherhead[7], Wilkins v. Despard[8].\nMr. Hannington, for respondent:\nMy first point is, that drifting for salmon is not an illegal act in places not provided for by the Act. By sub-sec. 7 of sec. 7 of The Fisheries Act, power is given to the Minister, or any fishery officer, to define the tidal boundary of estuary fishing, and it is only when this has been done that drifting for salmon in that place is illegal. The regulations made under the 19th section only apply to the County of Restigouche, and they cannot have force outside of the actual boundaries laid down. It was for the appellant to show the act was committed within the limits of the county covered by these regulations.\nOutside of his jurisdiction he had no right to act as fishery officer, and still he sued before the magistrate in his capacity of a fishery officer. The act must be construed strictly, and I say appellant was bound to prove that he was acting as a private subject, and on view of the offence took and removed respondents materials for delivery to the magistrate to obtain a conviction.\nThe law is, that where a limited tribunal takes upon itself to exercise a jurisdiction that does not belong to it, its proceedings are a nullity. The jurisdiction of the fishery officer being limited, to justify any acts as such officer, he should have alleged that they were done within his jurisdiction, and, therefore, the second plea is bad.\nThen the plea was not proved.\nI contend, also, that the third plea is bad, in not alleging that defendant seized the nets within his jurisdiction; if good, it is not proved.\nThe materials were not being used illegally at the time of the seizure, but were confiscated on a pretended view.\nThe fishing took place more than three miles from the shore, and there was an important point of law in the case that might have been raised if the Government had defined the limits of a district and professed to give jurisdiction to a fishery officer out into the deep sea, beyond the three mile limit from the shore.\nIt is contended, on the part of the appellant, that proceedings were had on the delivery to the magistrate. But this has not been proved, for they never were delivered to the Justice, and the proceedings that did take place were on the complaint of the appellant, after he had confiscated the goods himself. The allegation is, in effect, that the conviction was had before the suit was commenced, whilst the evidence shows the conviction was had after action brought. The appellant having taken and confiscated the respondent's property on a pretended view, he is clearly liable. Regina v. Jones[9]. With reference to forfeiture, all I want to establish is, there was no forfeiture until the seizure. The word confiscated does not mean forfeited. Forfeiture from the time of the offence cannot arise in this case. Tomlin's Law Dic. Vo. Confiscation, and Vo. Forfeiture; Bouvier's Law Dic., 1 Vol., 268; 4 Comyn's Dig., 404, Title Forfeiture note to B. 7.\nMr. Lash, Q.C., in reply:\nThe conviction shifted the onus, and respondent was bound to prove that his property was not liable to seizure.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by GWYNNE, J.:\nThe respondent sued the appellant in trespass for taking respondent's goods, namely: a fishing boat and fishing nets, and carrying away the same and disposing of them to the appellant's own use.\nTo this declaration the appellant pleaded three special pleas, viz.:\nAnd for a second plea the defendant says, that at the time of the defendant's seizing and taking the plaintiff's goods, that is to say, the fishing boat and the ten fishing nets stated in the declaration, the said plaintiff was illegally and wrongfully using, and had been using the same for the purpose of drifting for salmon in the waters of the Dominion of Canada, and the said defendant, being a fishery officer duly appointed under the provisions of the Fisheries Act, did remove and detain the said fishing boat and fishing nets, being then materials illegally in use, for the purpose of drifting for salmon, which is the seizing, taking, carrying away and conversion in the said declaration alleged.\nThe plaintiff joined issue on this plea.\nNow it is to be observed, that this issue does not dispute the allegation in the plea that the taking therein admitted and justified is the taking and conversion complained of in the declaration. If the plaintiff intended to dispute that averment, the only way in which he could have done so was by new assigning specially what other act or acts he relied upon as the trespass and conversion complained of. So, neither by joining issue did the plaintiff dispute the fact that the defendant acted in virtue of the authority under which he justified. The only issue, in fact, raised by the joinder in issue to the plea, was whether or not the plaintiff was and had been illegally and wrongfully using the boat and nets for the purpose of drifting for salmon in the waters of the Dominion of Canada; whether, under such circumstances, The Fisheries Act did, or not, authorize the taking of the boat and nets which was admitted by the plea, was a question of law.\nThe defendant further pleaded:\nThat the said fishing boat and fishing nets, in the said declaration mentioned, being materials, implements and appliances that had been and were being illegally used, and in contravention of The Fisheries Act, for the purpose of drifting for salmon, the said defendant, being a fishery officer duly appointed under the said Act, did take and remove the said fishing boat and fishing nets to be delivered to a magistrate, pursuant to the provisions of the said Act, and the said defendant did afterwards deliver the same to James S. Morse, Esq., a justice of the peace in and for the County of Restigouche, being the county in which the said materials, implements and appliances had been and were being used, which is the taking, seizing, carrying away, and conversion in the said declaration alleged.\nUpon this plea also the plaintiff joined issue. Now, joinder in issue upon this plea raised no question as to any of the matters admitted in the plea as coming within the averment of \"quae sunt eadem.\" If the plaintiff intended to raise any issue as to any of these matters, as, for example, that the taking and conversion complained of was not that admitted in the plea; that it was not a taking for the purpose of being delivered to a magistrate under the provisions of the Act; that, as matter of fact, the things taken were not delivered to a magistrate of the County of Restigouche, as alleged; or that the illegal uses alleged in the plea was not at all within the County of Restigouche, if that was material; or that the defendant, instead of dealing with the things taken as authorised by the Act, had converted and disposed thereof to his own use; the only way in which he could have raised an issue as to any of those matters admitted in the plea, and averred to be the taking and conversion complained of, would be by new assignment. The only issue in fact raised by joinder in issue to this plea was, whether or not the boat and nets had been and were being illegally used in contravention of The Fisheries Act for the purpose of drifting for salmon. Whether or not the Act authorised the taking and disposition of them, admitted in the plea, was a question of law.\nThe defendant further pleaded:\nThat the said plaintiff having used and was using the said fishing boat and fishing nets as materials, implements and appliances for drifting for salmon in certain waters within the County of Restigouche, or in the waters forming the boundary between the County of Bonaventure, in the Province of Quebec, and the said County of Restigouche, illegally, and in contravention of The Fisheries Act, the said defendant took and removed the same for delivery to a magistrate, in pursuance of the provisions of the said Act, and did deliver the same to one James S. Morse, Esq., then being a justice of the peace or magistrate of the said County of Restigouche, and such proceedings under the said Act were thereupon had that the said magistrate, upon hearing the matter and the evidence, and what was alleged in his defence on behalf of the said plaintiff, adjudged the said plaintiff to be guilty of an infraction of the said Fisheries Act, and that the said fishing boat and fishing nets had been materials, implements and appliances used for drifting for salmon in the said waters and in contravention of the said Fisheries Act, and did adjudge the same to be confiscated to Her Majesty in pursuance of the provisions of the said Act, and which taking and removal and delivery to the said magistrate and the confiscation thereof is the taking, seizing, carrying away and conversion in the said declaration alleged.\nThe observations addressed to the joinder in issue upon the other pleas apply, but with additional force, to this plea, when we observe the peculiar frame of the plea and its difference from the others. It alleges, as did the other pleas, the illegal drifting for salmon in contravention of the Fisheries Act, and it admits the taking and delivery to a magistrate under the provisions of the Act as in the last preceding plea, but proceeds to allege new matter consequential upon these acts, namely, that the plaintiff was convicted before the magistrate of the above offence, and that the boat and fishing nets of the plaintiff, for the alleged wrongful taking and conversion of which this action was brought, were adjudicated to be, and became, confiscated to Her Majesty, in pursuance of the provisions of The Fisheries Act. The short substance of the plea is that it confesses the taking the property as property by law liable to forfeiture to Her Majesty for the illegal act of drifting for salmon, but avoids all liability of the defendant to the plaintiff for such taking, for that the plaintiff, by due process of law, was found guilty of the illegal act, and that the property was in due form of law adjudicated to be, and became, for such illegal act confiscated to Her Majesty: and the gist of the plea is, that under such circumstances no action lies at suit of the plaintiff. By merely joining issue upon this plea, the plaintiff has placed himself in this position: that he must be concluded by such conviction and adjudication upon its being produced. Not having by replication pleaded anything in avoidance of the conviction and adjudication\u2014as that it had been quashed\u2014he could not, even if it had been quashed, have availed himself of that answer, upon joinder in issue to the plea.\nBesides joining in issue on the pleas, the plaintiff, also by leave of the Court, demurred thereto, but the issues in fact went down to trial before argument of the issues in law. At the trial the sole question upon the issues joined was as to the legality of the drifting for salmon at the place where it took place, for the fact was not denied, but was admitted to have taken place in the Bay of Chaleurs opposite to the River Charlo, but, as was contended by plaintiff, at a greater distance than three miles from either shore of New Brunswick, or of Quebec\u2014the whole defence being, that in such case, as was contended by the plaintiff, The Fisheries Act had no operation; the contention being, that if more than three miles from either shore the drifting took place in the open sea, and not within the Dominion of Canada, or the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament. Attention does not appear to have been drawn at the trial to the issue upon the third special plea, which set up the conviction of the plaintiff for having committed the offence charged at or near the River Charlo, in the Parish of Colborne, in the County of Restigouche, in the Bay of Chaleurs in contravention of The Fisheries Act, and whereby the plaintiff was adjudged to forfeit the net, fixings and apparatus thereto connected, and also the boat as forfeited under The Fisheries Act, to be applied according to law\u2014which conviction, not having been quashed or impeached, remained in full force and conclusive upon the plaintiff as to the facts thereby adjudicated.\nThe parties seem to have been willing to stand upon the ground which was the real substantial matter in contest, namely: whether, assuming the drifting to have taken place more than three miles from either shore, if the jury should find that to be the fact, such drifting would come within the operation and prohibition of The Fisheries Act?\nMuch evidence was entered into to establish at what distance from shore the drifting did take place, and at the close of the evidence it was agreed between the parties that the following questions should be submitted to the jury, namely:\n1st. Was the fishing by the plaintiff within three miles of any shore of the Dominion of Canada?\n2nd. What do the jury assess the damages at?\nand that a verdict should be entered for the plaintiff upon all the issues, with liberty to the defendant to move the Court to alter the verdict and to enter a verdict for the defendant upon all or any of the issues, and to enter the verdict or judgment for either party, as well upon the finding at the trial and the results of the demurrer, or both, or either, as the Court may think proper.\nThe jury found that the fishing by the plaintiff was not within three miles of any shore of the Dominion of Canada, and they rendered a verdict for the plaintiff with $900 damages.\nUpon a rule being obtained in the ensuing term to set aside this verdict and to enter a verdict for the defendant in accordance with the agreement in that behalf entered into at the trial, and the demurrers being argued at the same time, the Court held the second and third of the above special pleas to be bad in law, and that the first was good in law but was not proved in fact, and they discharged the rule for setting aside the verdict, holding that,\nWithout considering whether the provisions of the Act apply to persons who may be fishing more than three miles from the shore, the defendant had no power of seizure and detention, unless the offence was committed in his view, which it clearly was not in the present case; and they held that therefore the defendant had entirely failed to prove his justification, and that there is no ground for disturbing the verdict.\nThese observations apply plainly only to the first of the above special pleas, which the Court held to be sufficient in law, for, as to the others, which they pronounced to be insufficient, they wholly disregarded the issues in fact raised thereon.\nFrom this judgment, both upon the rule nisi and upon the demurrers to the above second and third special pleas, the defendant appeals; the plaintiff raises no cross appeal.\nThat there has been a miscarriage of justice by this judgment will be apparent when we consider its effect to be, that it wholly sets at nought the material point which the parties went down to try, and the issues in fact raised upon the record, namely, whether drifting for salmon in the Bay of Chaleurs, at the place in question, opposite the mouth of the River Charlo, was an illegal act within the prohibition and operation of The Fisheries Act, and damages, which were assessed by the jury at $900, upon the assumption that the act of drifting complained of was not illegal, and that therefore the seizure was wholly unjustified, are sustained by the court, wholly regardless of the fact whether the act was illegal or not, and in the face of a conviction for its illegality not complained of as bad on its face, whereby the plaintiff has been convicted of the offence charged, and the property, for the taking of which this action has been brought, has been adjudicated to be confiscated to Her Majesty by a conviction and adjudication of confiscation which has not been reversed or quashed.\nThe fourth plea on the record, that is, the third of the above special pleas, is unobjectionable in point of law, and shows, if true, a clear defence to the action by way of confession and avoidance. Robert, qui tarn v. Witherhead[10], and Wilkins v. Despard[11], were cited as authorities for the contention, that inasmuch as the Act declares all materials, implements and appliances used in contravention of the Act, or of any regulation under it, shall be confiscated to Her Majesty, and may be seized and confiscated on view by any fishery officer, or taken and removed by any person for delivery to any magistrate, the plaintiff could not maintain trespass against the defendant, although no conviction of the plaintiff for the offence charged, or condemnation of the property, had ensued upon the seizure; but where, as is pleaded in this plea, the conviction and condemnation did, in due process of law, ensue upon the seizure, there can be no doubt that these judicial proceedings enure to protect the person justifying the taking for the purpose stated, and to defeat the plaintiff's action, the facts alleged in the plea being then admitted by the demurrer, judgment should be for the defendant upon the sufficiency of the plea inlaw. The case of Jones v. Owen[12], relied upon by the Court below, was a very different case. There, to an action of trespass, the defendant pleaded, confessing the alleged trespass, but justifying it as authorized by an Act of Parliament, but alleging the act of trespass admitted to have been committed for a purpose which was not warranted by the Act, and it was held bad upon demurrer, the Court, however, holding that the plea well alleged two offences committed against the Act, for either of which the defendant might have convicted the plaintiff on his own view as a magistrate, or might, as a private individual, have apprehended the plaintiff for the purpose of being dealt with according to law, but that instead of doing either of those things, which the Act authorized, his plea attempted to justify the trespass as done under the Act, although alleged to have been done for a purpose not warranted by the Act.\nNow, as to the issue in fact joined upon this plea: there being no new assignment disputing any of the matters averred under the quae sunt eadem, nor any replication avoiding the conviction and condemnation pleaded, all that remained to be proved was the allegation of the committal of the offence of illegal drifting for salmon in contravention of The Fisheries Act, and the plea was proved by the record of the conviction and condemnation of the property which was produced. Independently, however, of the conviction still remaining in force and unreversed, it is clear that the act of drifting for salmon, which was proved, and indeed throughout admitted, although that drifting may have been more than three miles from either shore of New Brunswick or of Quebec abutting on the Bay of Chaleurs, was a drifting in Canadian waters, and was within the prohibition of The Fisheries Act, and of the regulations made in virtue thereof, produced in evidence; for the Imperial Statute, 14 and 15 Vic., c. 63, makes the boundary line between old Canada and New Brunswick proceed from the mouth of the Mistouche River, at its confluence with the Restigouche, down the centre of the stream of the Restigouche to its mouth in the Bay of Chaleurs, and thence through the middle of that Bay to the Gulf of St. Lawrence; so that the whole of the Bay is within the present boundaries of the Provinces of Quebec and New Brunswick, and within the Dominion of Canada, and the operation of The Fisheries Act.\nThe second special plea also appears to me to be sufficient in law, even if it be necessary to make it good (which I do not feel called upon here to decide), that it should be averred that the things seized were, at the time of the seizure, in the actual illegal use which exposed them to seizure; for that averment is substantially involved in the allegation, which is, not only that they had been, but were being used illegally, in contravention of The Fisheries Act, for the purpose of drifting for salmon; and the plea avers that the property was taken for the purpose of being delivered to a magistrate, and was delivered to Jas. S. Morse; a magistrate of the County of Restigouche, in which county, as the plea alleged, the property had been and was being so illegally used, and the plea shows a delivery of the property seized to a magistrate having jurisdiction over the offence charged, and the plea avers that this taking and disposition of the property is the taking and conversion alleged in the declaration; the demurrer admitting all this, the plea, in my opinion, is a sufficient answer to the declaration, and as to the issue in fact joined upon this plea, there being, as before observed, no new assignment, the only question was as to the fact of the committal of the offence alleged as the justification of the taking. Upon the issues in fact, therefore, joined upon both of these pleas, the verdict should have been for the defendant.\nWe are not called upon to pronounce upon the sufficiency or insufficiency in law of the first of the above special pleas. It has been pronounced by the court below to be sufficient in law, and the plaintiff has not appealed or given notice of a cross appeal from this judgment, so that this is the appeal of the defendant only. At any rate, as it only involves a question of costs we are not bound to interefere, even though it might be open to us to pronounce judgment upon this demurrer. And as to the issue in fact joined upon the plea, there being no new assignment, the joinder in issue raised only a question as to the fact of the committal of the offence which was pleaded as the justification of the taking admitted, and that fact was clearly established as already shown.\nI confess, however, that even if the fact of the offence having been committed on view of the defendant had been a matter in issue under the joinder in issue to the plea, the evidence given upon that subject was, in my opinion, sufficient, otherwise a most beneficial Act will be stripped of much of its efficiency. I do not think that the term \"on view\" in the Act is to be limited to seeing the net in the water while in the very act of drifting; it appears to me if the party acting \"on view\" himself sees what if testified to by him would be sufficient to convict of the offence charged, that is sufficient for the purposes of the Act. Now the defendant's evidence is that, having been informed by the plaintiff that he intended to drift for salmon three miles out in the Bay of Chaleurs, and having heard that he was doing so, and having informed the plaintiff if he should do so he would seize his net and appliances, he came down to look after the plaintiff. The defendant says:\nI went twice to Charlo before I got the boat and nets; the time I went the boat did not go out. On the night of the 5th July, 1876, I landed below the station, found the boat had gone out, and I went down the Charlo River, got a boat and two men and rowed out from Charlo up along the coast, \u2014could not find the boat; in the morning about day break I saw the boat coming ashore at Charlo Station. I waited until the boat came ashore, and then I seized the boat and nets. The net was piled upon the boat, wet; they had one fish. I took the nets and boat, the net was between three and four hundred fathoms, and about twenty feet deep, meshes 6 or 6 1\/4 inches\u2014it was a drifting salmon net.\nThe men also informed him that they had been drifting for salmon. The fish, it is true, was a shad\u2014not a salmon; but the net was wet, and it was sufficiently apparent that the fish was caught with the net. The defendant had therefore ocular demonstration that the net, which was a drifting salmon net, had been just recently used in that bay, and that the boat with the net had but reached the shore on return from such use when he seized; this evidence appears to me to have been quite sufficient to come within the provisions of the 4th sub-sec. of the \"16th sec. of The Fisheries Act to justify the defendant to seize the materials, implements and appliances so used.\nOur judgment, upon the whole, will be to allow the appeal with costs, and to order that judgment upon the demurrers to the second and third of the above special pleas, being the third and fourth pleas upon the record, be entered for the defendant, and that the rule nisi in the Court below be made absolute to enter a verdict for the defendant upon all the issues in fact joined, with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Harrison & Burbridge.\nSolicitor for respondent: C. A.

A fire occurred on the 21st May, 1877. On the next morning J.F. advised the insurance company by telegraph. On the 29th June, 1877, the secretary of the company wrote to J.F\u2019s. attorneys, that if he had any claim he had better send in the papers, so that they might be submitted to the board. On the 3rd July, 1877, J.F. furnished the company with the claim papers, or proofs of loss, and on the 13th July he was advised that, after an examination of the papers at the board meeting, it was resolved that the claim should not be paid. On the 23rd August, 1877, J.F. brought this action upon the policy. The appellants pleaded inter alia that the policy was made and issued subject to a condition that the loss should not be payable until three months after the receipt by the defendants of the proofs of such loss, to be furnished by the plaintiff to the defendants; and averred the delivery of the proofs on the 3rd of July, 1877, and that less than three months elapsed before the commencement of this suit.\nHeld,\u2014On appeal, 1st. That a policy issued by a mutual insurance company is not subject to the Uniform Conditions Act, R.S.O., c. 162.\n2nd. That the appellant company under the policy were entitled to three months from the date of the furnishing of claim papers before being subject to an action, and that therefore respondent\u2019s action had been prematurely brought.\nBallagh v. The Royal Mutual Fire Insurance Company[1] approved.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] affirming a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench[3].\nThe action was commenced on the 23rd August, 1877, and was brought upon a fire insurance policy issued by appellants. The policy is dated the eleventh day of October one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six. By it the company promise \u201caccording to the provisions of said Act, to settle and pay unto the said assured, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, all losses or damage, not exceeding in the whole the said sum of two thousand dollars, which shall or may happen to the aforesaid property by reason or by means of fire during the time this policy shall remain in force; the said losses or damage to be estimated according to the true actual value of the property at the time the same shall happen, and to be paid within three months after due notice is given by the insured, according to the provisions of the said Act.\u201d The fire occurred the 21st of May, 1877. The respondent stated his loss at thirteen hundred dollars. The subject of insurance was a general stock of goods in a country store.\nThe declaration alleged a loss by fire on 21st May, 1877, and set up, that the policy having been issued after 1st July, 1876, and not having thereon endorsed the statutory conditions provided by Ont. Stat. 39 Vic., c. 24 (R.S.O., c. 162), was a policy without conditions as against the respondent. The appellants pleaded nine pleas, the purport of them being as follows:\n1st. Denial of policy; 2nd. Denial of loss; 3rd. Denial of proof of loss; 4th. Denial of particular account of loss; 5th. That policy was made and issued subject to a condition that loss not payable till three months after proof of loss; that proofs of loss were furnished 3rd July, 1877, and that 3 months did not elapse before action brought; 6th. Alleged that the appellants were a mutual insurance company, incorporated under the laws of the province relating to such companies, and set out conditions endorsed on policy, and among others the condition as to three months for payment after proof of loss; and concludes by averring that the three months had not elapsed; 7th. Non-payment of assessment due on premium note; 8th. Arson; 9th. That more than five gallons of coal oil were kept on premises, contrary to a condition printed on policy, pursuant to the statute in that behalf.\nThe case was tried before Mr. Justice Morrison and a jury on 26th September, 1877, when a verdict was rendered for the respondent on the first six and the eighth issues, and for the appellants on the seventh and ninth issues. Damages were assessed at $700.\nAt the trial it was proved that on the next morning after the fire, the respondent advised the appellants by telegraph of the fire, and their secretary visited the scene of the fire the same afternoon, when he was informed of the particulars. On the 29th June the secretary wrote to the respondent\u2019s attorney, that if he had any claim he had better send in the papers, so that they might be submitted to the board. On the 3rd July, 1877, the respondent sent in his claim papers or proofs of loss, and on the 13th July, 1877, the secretary wrote, stating, that after an examination of the papers at the board meeting, it was resolved that the claim should not be paid.\nIn Michaelmas Term, 1877, cross rules were obtained, and on the 15th March, 1878, the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench gave judgment affirming the respondent\u2019s verdict on the seven issues found for him, and entering a verdict for respondent on the two issues found against him.\nFrom this judgment the appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal of Ontario, and on the 27th May, 1879, judgment was given dismissing the appeal, and affirming the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench.\nFrom this latter judgment the present appeal was brought. Mr. Robinson, Q.C., for appellants:\nIn the case of Ballagh v. The Royal Mutual Fire Insurance Company[4], it was held that the statutory conditions set forth in the schedule to the Fire Insurance Policy Act, 1876, Rev. Stats. Ont., c. 162, are not applicable to policies issued by mutual insurance companies. If this decision is not overruled, under the terms of the policy, and by statute, c. 161 Rev. St. Ont., the appellants are entitled to succeed under the fifth and sixth pleas.\nThe plaintiff furnished proofs on 3rd July, 1877, as being proofs called for by his policy. The loss was not payable until three months thereafter. The policy on its face promises payment only according to provisions of the Act.\nThe policy also provides that the loss or damage should be \u201cestimated according to the true actual value of the property at the time the same shall happen, and to be paid within three months after due notice is given by the insured according to the provisions of the said act.\u201d\nThe action having been brought in August, and the proof papers having been furnished in July, I contend that the action is prematurely brought under the agreement contained in the body of the policy.\nMr. McCarthy, Q.C., and Mr. Clement for respondent:\nThe case is narrowed down to the question whether the action has been prematurely brought, and also as to the question of coal oil. Although the conditions are endorsed on the contract, there is no reference made to them in the body of the policy.\nThen, what is our contract with regard to time? It is to settle and pay, not after proof but after due notice is given, unless the words \u201caccording to the provisions of the Act\u201d qualify the promise. Now, notice was given three months prior to the bringing of the action, then come the words in the 56th sec.: \u201cAnd the proofs shall, &c., and such amount shall be payable in three months after receipt by the company of such proofs.\u201d This refers to the proofs required by the policy; now, if the conditions are not on the policy, then there are none. This section cannot help the appellants, because that section directs the directors to ascertain and determine the amount of loss, and then goes on to say that the amount shall be payable in three months, &c. The directors having refused to ascertain and determine an amount, that section does not apply. Supposing the insured were dissatisfied with the determination of the directors, there is nothing in that section to say that such insured shall delay action for three months.\nSurely this section does not mean that in all cases they shall have three months. The next section shows clearly that the object is to give time to determine what the loss shall be, and not the time to make an assessment. Then, also, by this Act a condition unjust can be declared null.\nI further contend that the appellants have waived their claim (if any) to the three months delay, by expressly refusing to pay the claims on the 13th July, 1871.\nThen I go further, and say the Uniform Conditions Act c. 162 does apply. This court is not bound by the decision in Ballagh v. The Royal Ins. Co.\n\u201cThe Fire Insurance Policy Act, 1876,\u201d was passed after the 36 Vic., c. 44, s. 52, and being inconsistent therewith, the latter section is superseded. See remarks of Harrison, C.J., at p. 120, of 43 U.C.Q.B.\nThe conditions in the body of the policy and those pleaded in the 5th and 6th pleas, as to three months delay, differ from and are variations of the statutory conditions, and being so, are not binding on respondent, not being indicated and set forth in the manner prescribed by \u201cThe Fire Insurance Policy Act, 1876.\u201d\nThere is no difficulty in reading sections 53 and 55 together, leaving out section 52. Was not the object of the whole act to give three months to pay after notice and to collect three months after judgment? The amount which is postponed for payment is the amount to be determined, but not the amount of the loss.\nHaving refused to arbitrate or to ascertain the amount, we submit we had a right of action for refusal to ascertain.\nThe only object of sec. 56 is to fix some way of ascertaining the amount. The learned counsel relied upon the judgment of the Court appealed from delivered by Moss, C.J.[5], and the judgment of Harrison, C.J., in this case[6]; and on the judgments of Harrison, C.J., and Wilson, J., in Ulrich v. National Ins. Co.[7] See also Parsons v. Citizens\u2019 Ins. Co.[8]; Parsons v. Queen Ins. Co.[9]\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\nThe only point we have now to determine is whether the Act to secure uniform policies applies to mutual insurance companies. I have carefully read the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of Ballagh v. The Royal Mutual Fire Ins. Co.[10] decided in March last, and which has been just reported, in which case that court held that policies issued by mutual insurance companies were not governed by the Act to secure uniform policies, and after consideration of the reason there given, I am not prepared to dissent. I agree that the appeal should be allowed, and the rule made absolute.\nFOURNIER, J. concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\nI concur in that judgment. I am certainly convinced that the Legislature did not intend to include mutual insurance companies.\nTASCHEREAU, J. concurred.\nGWYNNE, J:\nFor the reasons given at large in my judgment in The Citizens Insurance Company v. Parsons, I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed. I am of opinion, for the reasons already given in the case above referred to, that the Fire Insurance Act of 1876, Ontario, was ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature. I entirely agree, however, with the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Ballagh v. The Royal Mutual Insurance Company to the effect that (assuming the Local Legislature to have had jurisdiction to pass that Act) it is difficult to conceive it possible that the Legislature intended by the language used in the Act to repeal or annul the plain provisions respecting mutual insurance companies, so precisely enacted in the Mutual Fire Insurance Companies Acts, and that therefore the Courts should not construe the Act of 1876 as repealing or annulling any of such provisions. But I confess that, to my mind, it is easier to construe the Act of 1876 as intended to apply to mutual insurance companies conducting the business of fire insurance purely upon the mutual principle of indemnifying each other by contributions among themselves, over which companies the Local Legislatures might assert jurisdic- tion equally as to proprietory or stock insurance companies insuring for cash premiums paid to them, as a matter of business and for profit, over which species of insurance being a branch of trade, they had, in my opinion, no jurisdiction whatever, than it is to give to the language of the Act of 1876 the effect of wholly perverting the operation of a contract to the terms of which the respective parties thereto had mutually agreed, so as to enable one of the parties thereto, who had violated all the terms of the contract, to recover against the other who had violated none of them, and although it was the express agreement of the party violating the terms that in such case he should have no claim whatever against the other, but that such other should in that case be released from all liability. But quot homines tot sententi\u0153.\nUpon the settlement of the minutes of the order in appeal the question arose as to whether the court had held the action prematurely brought, and the court intimated that they were of opinion that the appellants under the policy were entitled to three months from the date of the furnishing of the claim papers before being subject to an action, and that therefore the action had been prematurely brought.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Guthrie, Watt & Cutten.\nSolicitors for respondent: Bowlby, Colquhoun & Clement.\n[1] 5 Ont.

The company granted M. a lease for a year of a portion of their premises, upon which the wheels and iron were situate, in consideration of $5. The Consolidated Bank then gave him a written guarantee that the goods should be forthcoming when required, and he therefore issued a warehouse receipt to the company for the property, which they endorsed to the Standard Bank and obtained an advance thereon, which they paid to the Consolidated Bank.\nIt appeared that M. was a warehouseman carrying on business in another part of the city; that he acquired the lease for the purpose of giving warehouse receipts to enable the company to obtain an advance from the Consolidated Bank; and that he had not seen the property himself, but had sent his foreman to examine it before giving the receipt,\nIn February, 1877, an attachment in insolvency issued against the company, and K. et al., as their assignees in insolvency, took possession of the goods covered by this receipt, claiming them as part of the assets of the estate. M. then sued K, et al. in trespass and trover for the taking.\nHeld, per Strong, Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ., (affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal, and that of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench,) that M. never had any actual possession, control over, or property in, the goods in question, so as to make the receipt given by M., under the circumstances in this case, a valid warehouse receipt within the meaning of the clauses in that behalf in the Banking Act.\n[Per Ritchie, C.J., and Fournier and Henry, JJ., contra, that M. quoad these goods was a warehouseman within the meaning of 34 Vic., ch. 5 D, so as to make his receipt endorsed effectual to pass the property to the Standard Bank for the security of the loan made to the company in the usual course of its banking business][1].\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, making absolute a rule nisi to set aside a verdict for the plaintiff. The pleadings and facts fully appear in the reports of the case in 43 U.C.Q.B. 78, and 3 Ont. App. R. 350 and in the judgments hereinafter given. Dr. McMichael, Q.C., and Mr. J.K.

RITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nThis was an action in which plaintiff alleges that defendants broke and entered certain lands of the plaintiff and took and carried away and converted to their own use goods, railway car wheels and pig iron, &c. of plaintiffs. The defendants claim the property in dispute as joint official assignee of the estate of the Toronto Car Wheel Company.\nThese goods originally belonged to that company, and plaintiff\u2019s contention is, that he being a warehouseman, and the said company wishing to have the said goods warehoused with him, and not wishing to incur the expense and inconvenience of transferring the goods from where they then were, on the company\u2019s property, to plaintiff\u2019s usual place of business on Front street, at the foot of Yonge street, in the city of Toronto, by indenture made on the 15th Dec., made and executed under the seal of the company, in consideration of the rents and covenants therein contained, demised and leased to the plaintiff, his executors and administrators and assigns, all that certain parcel or tract of land forming part of the premises presently occupied by the said lessors, and situate at the north-west corner of Front and Cherry streets, in said city, and which may be described as follows: \u201cCommencing at the south-east corner of the premises of one Huggard, thence easterly along the north side of Front street eighty feet, thence northerly and parallel with the east limit of said Huggard\u2019s premises one hundred and fifty-four feet three inches, thence westerly parallel with Front street eighty feet to premises of said Huggard, thence southerly along the east limit of said Huggard\u2019s premises to Front street;\u201d for the term of one year, from the 15th December, 1876, paying therefore yearly $5 at the expiration of the term with certain covenants not material to be noticed; upon which property the goods in question were. This property was staked off, and plaintiff entered into the possession thereof and of these goods, and granted to the said company a warehouse receipt as follows:\nReceived in store in the yard or place near the corner of Front and Cherry street, Toronto, fourteen hundred car wheels and three hundred and fifty tons pig iron from the Toronto Car Wheel Company of Toronto, to be delivered pursuant to the order of the said Toronto Car Wheel Company to be endorsed thereon.\nThis is to be regarded as a receipt under the provisions of statute 34 Vic., ch. 5 of the Statutes of Canada, intituled \u201cAn Act relating to Banks and Banking.\u201d The said car wheels and pig iron are separate from, and will be kept separate and distinguishable from other grain, wares, manufactures or merchandize,\nDonald Milloy.\nDated Toronto, Dec. 20th, 1876.\nThe object of giving this lease and getting the warehouse receipts, the manager of the company says, was to raise money.\nIt was for the purpose of raising money to take up our paper as it became due with the Consolidated Bank. This receipt was endorsed over to the Standard Bank of Canada.\nThe evidence of plaintiff\u2019s foreman shows that he went down to see that the iron was there, and he says:\nThere were stakes put there, and a place squared off; I went down to see that the iron was there; I went down also when I had an order to deliver any; I was disposing of it, or some of it, the same as I would at our own place when I got an order; I was aware that a lease had been granted to Mr. Milloy, and from it I exercised control over the place; I know the quantities delivered to the Toronto Car Wheel Company; 30, 10, 20, and 10; and two loads of iron, 5 tons in each lot; the first order is dated the 27th December, and was for 30 car wheels; January 10th, 10 car wheels; January 15th, 20 wheels; February 20, 10 wheels; and 5 tons of iron on same date; the day I delivered the stuff, I put the figures down in my book; on the 27th, 5 tons of iron were delivered; these were all the deliveries; I never counted them; I went to count them twice but there was so much on the wheels, I could not see them; there was a large quantity there; all that was there was taken away by the defendants; I don\u2019t know the number myself;\nCross-Examined.\u2014I am in the employ of Mr. Milloy; where I am principally, is Yonge street wharf; this place he had; I don\u2019t know that he had any other place leased for that purpose that I am aware of; I have been with him I suppose about nine years; I went down many times there; I was down early in December, about the time the lease was made; the first entry is a delivery of iron; that is my book, in which, when the orders were given, through my hands, I put an entry when I delivered; I asked Mr. Milloy if I would keep an account of my time going down there; that is wholly my writing there; that across the page was all put there on the second of January; I had been down several times before that; our deliveries are before that; I have put in ink over that\u20141876; on January 25th I went and measured the yard of the Toronto Car Wheel Company leased by Milloy\u201483 by 132 feet, and found it correct; that was the first time I measured it and the last; I did not measure it when I first went down; I went down by Mr. Milloy\u2019s orders; it might be the day previous he ordered me to go down; it was about January 25th, 1877, I measured the piece of the yard that was leased; I went down previously, but I had no memorandum; I was down, on Mr. Milloy\u2019s instructions; I did not think of keeping any time until I was losing time delivering car wheels; I had to stop there while they were taking the loads away; he first told me about measuring the land about the time it is entered there, I went and did that; I could go out and in then at all times; I went into the office or in at the gate if it was open; I was in the office at all times when I went there, except when I went down to move the wheels; we had to go in at the gate; that part of the property is embraced exactly in the lease.\nDonald Milloy\u2014I am plaintiff in this case; I am a wharfinger and steamboat agent, carry on business on Front street, and at the foot of Yonge street; I have carried on my business on Front street for a number of years; that is the only place I have been carrying on my business as a warehouseman outside of this transaction; Mr. Turnbull came to me first and spoke to me; I do not remember his christian name; he was in the Consolidated Bank at that time; I think he was cashier, but I am not certain.\nExamination resumed\u2014In consequence of what Mr. Turnbull said to me I got this lease; I think he came himself first, and then afterwards Mr. Gartshore came with him; that lease was then taken; I don\u2019t know who drew the lease out; I don\u2019t remember who brought it to my office; I never saw the lease until left in my office all ready prepared and executed; I was never asked to sign that lease; I forgot the time the lease was left; at my office; it was some time in December, I think, of the year 1876; I think the lease will show the date; I do not remember any discussion with Gartshore or Turnbull as to the terms of the lease; I understood a part of the property was to be staked out; it was to be the part this property was stored on; there was no particular discussion as to the land to be leased; I think it was $5.00 rent I paid; the land is described in the lease; I got it for $5.00\u201480 by 154; I don\u2019t know that that was a very cheap lease; it depends on what you can do with the property; I paid them that $5,00 by cheque; that is the cheque that I gave, payable to John Gartshore, dated 19th December; I charged that $5.00 in the books; I have got my book here; I produce it; I have my ledger here also; I turn up the account of the Toronto Car Wheel Company; the book-keeper charged the Consolidated on December 19th with $5.00; on the day after I got cash, $50.00; it was a cheque; he was at the office when I came in; I really forget who gave the cheque; I suppose it came from the Toronto Car Wheel Company; I see the book-keeper has balanced it by profit and loss; he never asked me what to charge; that is an entry of his own; that is the only ledger account I have with the Car Wheel Company; March 31st, profit and loss, $45; when I took that lease I got a letter of guarantee from the Consolidated Bank, guaranteeing the property being there, and being forthcoming; that is the letter I got, dated 20th December, 1876 (Exhibit 5); as a warehouseman, I do not remember ever taking such a guarantee before as that; the property was so far away; this was a special transaction; Mr. Turnbull told me the Car Wheel Company wanted to raise some money; I don\u2019t know who got the warehouse receipt; I signed it, left it with the book-keeper in the office, and some one called and got it; perhaps the book-keeper took it to the bank; I don\u2019t know; my man went down at the time I got the lease, to see that the car wheels and the pig iron was there; I do not know whether I got the letters the same day that I gave the warehouse receipts or not.\nCross-examined by Mr. Cameron\u2014I really do not remember who suggested the lease in the first place, whether Mr. Turnbull or myself, I cannot say; when I was applied to for a warehouse receipt I told them the property was too far, and suggested the removal of the property up to Yonge street, but they preferred doing it in this way, to save double handling and the costs that would be incurred; the lease was suggested at this time 5 I know I would not have granted a warehouse receipt unless I had the lease; when it was so far away, I desired something more than the goods guaranteed, we generally receive ten cents a ton a month for storing iron; I had no commission other than the $50; that was all I received.\nI think the plaintiff had the legal title to and was legally in possession of the land under this lease, and had a right to carry on his business of a warehouseman on these premises so leased to him, and having, by his foreman, entered and taken actual possession of the goods on the land, the land and the goods were in fact and in law under his control as a warehouseman; he was in a position to give the warehouse receipt, and, when he so gave it, he became responsible for the property to those to whom he gave the receipt, or to whomsoever the same might be duly indorsed, and that he was not limited to carry on his business of a warehouseman to one place of business more than another; that he had a right to carry on his business in the place or places most suitable and convenient therefor, so long as the premises on which such business was carried on were in his possession and the goods in his custody and under his control, and I can see nothing in the fact of his having a guarantee from a third party for the safety of the goods in the place in which they were stored, and for their being forthcoming, that can in any way invalidate his liability as a warehouseman to the bon\u00e2 fide holder of the receipt.\nThe point of this case then, it seems to me, turns simply upon the question: was there such an indebtedness of the Toronto Car Wheel Co\u2019y to the Standard Bank as could be secured by the indorsement of a warehouse receipt? I may say at the outset, that I can discover nothing whatever in the evidence to show that, so far as the Standard Bank is concerned, there was any infringement of any of the provisions of the Insolvent Act, or that the security was in any way invalidated or injuriously affected by that Act, or that there was anything collusive or fraudulent, illegal or improper in the transaction, either with reference to the Toronto Car Wheel Company or their creditors. As I read the evidence, the Car Company were indebted to the Consolidated Bank, who held what they, for a time, considered a valid warehouse receipt for these goods, but which was either not a valid security, or the party giving it would not continue to hold the goods, or both. That the position of the dealings between the Consolidated Bank and the company was such that the company could not give a good security to the bank by means of a warehouse receipt, by reason of the past indebtedness of the claim of the bank against the company; that the bank was desirous of obtaining a settlement, and payment of all claims due or not due from the company to the bank, and, for the accomplishment of this, was anxious they (the company) should obtain a new loan from other parties to whom they might be able to give a valid security. I can see no impropriety in the bank rendering the company assistance by advice, or recommendation, or by asking another bank to make a loan to the company to enable them to obtain means to discharge their indebtedness, So far as the Standard Bank is concerned, I cannot discover from the evidence that they were in any way informed or knew the nature and particulars or state of the transaction between the Consolidated Bank and the company, or had any information to lead them to suppose the company were in insolvent circumstances; on the contrary, they seem to me to have accepted in good faith the recommendation of the Consolidated Bank; and on estimating the value of the securities and finding the security ample, and believing the transaction was a safe and good one, took it up in the usual and orderly course of banking business. The evidence on this point seems very clear and conclusive.\nThe indebtedness, for the security of which the ware-house receipt was indorsed over to the Standard Bank, Stevens the discount clerk of the Standard Bank says, was on a note dated 20th December, same day as the warehouse receipt for $21,400, which he says was discounted by the Standard Bank in the ordinary course of business on the credit of that receipt.\nCross-examined\u2014My duty in the bank is discount clerk; that note was brought to me and discounted; Mr. Brodie, the cashier of the bank, brought me the note; I discounted it for the Toronto Car Wheel Company; I gave $20,999.27; I gave the money to the manager of the Toronto Car Wheel Company, Mr. Gartshore; I know nothing at all about it, beyond the handing of the note to me by Mr. Brodie; I know nothing about the warehouse receipts; all I know is the note was handed to me, and I discounted it; the money was paid in bills; I don\u2019t know where the money went after that; I don\u2019t know if the Consolidated Bank had discounted any paper with us.\nThe cashier of the Standard Bank, says:\nJohn L. Brodie\u2014I am cashier of the Standard Bank; it was Mr. Turnbull called to see me; he asked if I was open to take up a transaction which they would recommend; I said I would see; he stated the nature of the security; as our Vice-President, W.F. Cowan, would know something about the value of these things, I asked to leave it until I would see him; after seeing him, and estimating the value of the securities, as we had a friendly feeling to the Consolidated Bank, and they asked us to take it up, we, finding the security ample, took it up; I did not take it up without consulting the Vice-President and the President also, I do not know anything but that they recommended the transaction as safe and good; when a bank recommends to another, there would be an honourable understanding, I think, to the effect not to allow them to suffer loss; the securities were recommended as perfectly good, by the Consolidated Bank; we loaned the money in the usual way.\nQ. You knew that the Toronto Car Wheel Company kept their account with the Consolidated Bank? A. Very likely I knew that.\nQ. Did they tell you their solicitors had recommended them to get through you? A. They did not tell me anything of the kind.\nHis Lordship: Was any representation made to you by Mr. Turnbull he would wish you to do this as a convenience to them? A. He never made any such representation, but I may have inferred so.\nQ. Were you to stand in the place of the Car Company that the Consolidated Bank stood in? A. I don\u2019t know that; I did it at the request of the Consolidated Bank, but I did it only because I was satisfied the security was good.\nMr. Turnbull, of the Consolidated Bank:\nQ. State what the arrangement was between you and the bank? A. We went to Mr. Brodie, and told him the Car Company wanted to raise money; we did not tell him for what purpose; they would be prepared to give Mr. Milloy\u2019s warehouse receipts; we told him the security would be good, to our own knowledge, and there was ample margin, and requested him to make the discount, which he did.\nQ. Did you tell Mr. Brodie anything further? A. I don\u2019t know that I did; I do not think it; there was nothing further, to my recollection; we told him he was to advance upon the security of the stuff; we did not say anything about seeing them harmless; that was not understood between us.\nQ. When one bank comes to another, and recommends them to make a discount, is it not understood between them the one will see the other all right? A. It would be certainly understood, after the representation I made as to the nature of the security, that we should see they did not lose by it; I have not considered this as a matter of our own all along; I think Mr. Gartshore himself asked me to go with him to the Standard Bank, seeing I had been with him previously, to ask them to authorize Mr. Milloy to deliver certain wheels to the Northern Railway Company, on getting the Northern Railway Company\u2019s acknowledgment to pay the Standard Bank; I do not recollect any instruction; it was a matter for Mr. Brodie\u2019s consideration; Mr. Brodie was getting value for all his money; I may have gone on a second occasion; I am sure as to one occasion, but not as to two; I am not sure I went a second time.\nThe Consolidated Bank certainly had a perfect right to close their transaction with the Car Company and to render the Car Company assistance to raise the necessary funds to enable them to discharge their indebtedness. If the Standard Bank made the loan to the Car Company, as Brodie says, in the usual way (\u201cwe loaned the money in the usual way\u201d), and because they found the security ample, though done on the recommendation and at the request of the Consolidated Bank, but as Brodie says: \u201conly because he was satisfied the security was good,\u201d and as Mr. Turnbull says \u201cnothing was said and it was not understood between us as to the Consolidated Bank seeing the Standard Bank harmless, and the discount clerk says the note was discounted by the Standard Bank in the ordinary course of business on the credit of that receipt,\u201d I cannot see how it can be considered otherwise than a pure bon\u00e2 fide independent dealing of the Standard Bank with the Car Company in the course of their business, even though the transaction was accomplished, through the instrumentality of the Consolidated Bank, and there may, in consequence of the representation and recommendation made by that bank to the Standard, be a sentimental or honourable feeling that the Consolidated Bank should see they did not lose by it. No doubt the Consolidated Bank were deeply interested in the Car Company getting the money from the Standard, because it was to discharge their indebtedness to them, and very possibly they were the more anxious because the Car Company could not secure them as they had been heretofore secured, or thought themselves secured. But as it does not appear that the dealings or the transactions of the Consolidated Bank and the Car Company were communicated to the Standard Bank, or that they were in any way cognizant of them, why should the Standard Bank be affected thereby? I think it may fairly be inferred, that but for the intervention of the Consolidated Bank, the Standard Bank would not have advanced the money to the Car Company, but if it was a fair loan in the usual course of business made on the security of this warehouse receipt offered by the Car Company, I cannot see why the Standard Bank should be injuriously affected because the Consolidated Bank were benefited by their debtors being placed in a position to discharge their indebtedness, nor can I discover upon what pretence the Car Company could repudiate their lease to the plaintiff or the validity of this warehouse receipt. If there has been nothing in this transaction at variance with the provisions of the Insolvent Act and no collusive or fraudulent conduct on the part of the Standard with a view to defeat or defraud creditors, I cannot discover upon what principle the defendants as the assignees of the Car Company can assail the lease or security so given by those they represent in good faith to the bank, which lease or transaction the Car Company could not infringe. As then I think there is no evidence to establish that this transaction was a fraudulent preference to or had any legal connection with the Consolidated Bank, but was an entirely new and distinct transaction between the Standard Bank and the company, the question in my opinion, in the case is:\u2014was the plaintiff, quoad these goods, a warehouseman within the letter and spirit of the Banking Act, so as to make his receipt indorsed effectual to pass the property to the Standard Bank for the security of a loan made to the company in the usual course of banking business? and as I think he was, I think the appeal should be allowed, and judgment given for plaintiff.\nSTRONG, J., gave a written judgment in favor of affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal[31].\nFOURNIER, J., concurred with the Chief Justice.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThis is an appeal from the judgment of the Appeal Court of Ontario. A verdict was found for the appellant, but set aside, and an order was made for one to be entered for the respondents by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench. From that order the plaintiff appealed to the Appeal Court of Ontario who sustained the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, and hence his appeal to this court.\nThere are three counts in the declaration:\u2014\n1st. In trespass, for seizing and taking away the plaintiff\u2019s goods and converting them to their own use. 2nd. For trespass to lands of plaintiff and for asportavit and conversion of plaintiff\u2019s goods.\n3rd. For conversion of plaintiff\u2019s goods,\nThe defendants pleaded thereto:\u2014\n1st. A denial of the trespass and conversion.\n2nd. To the first count denying the plaintiff\u2019s property in the goods.\n3rd. To the second count denying the plaintiff\u2019s property in the land and goods.\n4th. That the land was the freehold and the goods the property of the defendants as joint official assignee of the Toronto Car Wheel Company, insolvents, under the provisions of the Insolvent Act of 1875.\n5th. That the plaintiffs right to the land and goods was only under a lease from the Toronto Car Wheel Company, and by a pretended delivery to him by that company of the goods as a warehouseman or agent of the company. That the plaintiff subsequently gave to the company certain paper writings purporting to be warehouse receipts for the goods to be delivered pursuant to the order of the company, and the company thereupon endorsed the same to the Standard Bank of Canada as agents and trustees of the Consolidated Bank of Canada, merely for the purpose of securing a large amount of indebtedness of long standing of the company to the last mentioned bank. It then alleges the then insolvency of the company, and that the plaintiff and the Consolidated Bank knew or had probably cause for believing such to exist, and that the inability of the company to meet its engagements was for a long time theretofore public and notorious. The plea then alleges that the solvency of the company was attacked by a notice from some of the creditors to the company of an application for an attachment under the Insolvent Debtors Act served over thirty days from the endorsement of the warehouse receipts to the company, and that about a month after, a writ of attachment against the company was issued and delivered for execution to the defendants, and in about a month thereafter, at a meeting of the creditors, defendants were appointed joint assignee of the company\u2019s estate in insolvency. That at the time of the issue and delivery to the defendants of the writ of attachment, the company was not in possession of the goods and land, and that such possession was transferred to the defendants, who thereupon took possession of the same as part of the property and estate of the company, and that as such joint assignee, they, the defendants, were entitled to retain the said lands and goods.\n6th. The sixth plea is pretty much like the fifth, but is varied by an allegation, \u201cthat the said lease was executed and the said goods so delivered to the plaintiffs, and the said receipts so indorsed to the said Consolidated Bank, with intent fraudulently to impede, obstruct, and delay the creditors of the said company in their remedies against it, with intent to defraud its creditors or some of them, and the same was so done and intended with the knowledge of the plaintiff and the said Consolidated Bank of Canada.\u201d\n7th. The seventh varies from the preceding two pleas by an allegation, \u201cthat the deposit, pledge, or transfer of the said premises by lease, and the delivery of the said goods and the endorsation of the said receipts to the Standard Bank were made by the said company in contemplation of insolvency by way of security for payment to the Consolidated Bank of Canada for a debt then and for a long time due and owing to the said last mentioned bank, * * * the same being at the time of the issue and delivery of the writ of attachment to the defendants in the possession of the company. That the defendants were in March, 1877, appointed assignees of the said company\u2019s estate and effects, and under the provision of the Insolvent Act, 1875, were then entitled to retain the said lands and goods for the benefit of the company\u2019s estate.\u201d\nThe plaintiff by replication, first took issue on all the pleas. By a second replication to that part of the fourth plea which alleges that the time of the committing of the alleged trespasses, the said land was the freehold of the defendants as joint assignee of the company\u2019s estate and effects, the plaintiff says, \u201cthat before the time when, etc., and before any proceedings in insolvency had been taken against the company,\u201d the company \u201cby an indenture of lease duly executed under their corporate seal demised the land to the plaintiff\u201d for one year from the fifteenth day of December, 1876, which demise was \u201cat the said time when, etc., in full force and effect and undetermined,\u201d and that \u201cthe said plaintiff was in the actual possession of the said land under and by virtue of the said demise.\u201d\nTo the latter replication there were three rejoinders to which it is necessary also to refer.\n1st. The first alleges there was only a nominal consideration for the lease, which is alleged to be dated the fifteenth of December, 1876. That the company was then a debtor, subject to the provisions of the Insolvent Act of 1875. That on the 20th of January, 1877, a notice of an application to be made for a writ of attachment was served on the company and the writ issued on the 21st of February, 1877. That at a meeting of the creditors in March following, the defendants were appointed joint assignee of the estate; that at the time of the issue and delivery of the writ of attachment to the defendants, the company were in possession of the lands and that such possession was transferred to the defendants, who therefore took possession of the same as part of the property and estate of the company, and as such joint assignee were then (at the time of the pleading) entitled to retain the said lands for the benefit of the company\u2019s estate.\n2nd. The second rejoinder, with the same descriptive averments as in the first, alleges that the lease was executed to secure a debt due to the Consolidated Bank. That the lease was made with intent fraudulently to impede, obstruct, and delay the creditors of the company in their remedies, or with intent to defraud its creditors, and that the same was so made, done, and intended with the knowledge of the plaintiff and the said bank (the Consolidated).\n3rd. The third rejoinder, with the same descriptive averments as in the other two, alleges that the lease was made in contemplation of insolvency by way of security for payment to the Consolidated Bank of a previous debt whereby the bank obtained an unjust preference. That the land at the time of the issue and delivery of the writ of attachment to the defendants was in possession of the company, that the defendants were subsequently appointed joint assignee of the estate, and as such entitled to retain the said lands and goods for the benefit of the estate.\nIn order that my views should be the more readily understood in regard to the special pleas, the second replication and the three rejoinders thereto, I have felt it necessary to recite them at the risk of the charge of unnecessary prolixity.\nI must now see how far they are founded on the Insolvent Act referred to.\nSection 131 provides that:\nA contract or conveyance for consideration respecting either real or personal estate by which creditors are injured, made by a debtor unable to meet his engagements with a person ignorant of such inability, whether such person be his creditor or not, and before such inability has become notorious, but within thirty days next before a demand of an assignment or the issue of a writ of attachment under this act or at any time afterwards, whenever such demand shall have been followed by an assignment or by the issue of such writ of attachment, is voidable, and may be set aside by any court of competent jurisdiction upon such terms as to the protection of such person from actual loss or liability by reason of such contract, as the court may order.\nIt is obvious the pleas in question as far as they relate to the lease and warehouse receipts are not under that section, nor could they be under the circumstances in evidence for many reasons which are so palpable that I need not state them.\nSection 132:\nAll contracts or conveyances made and acts done by a debtor respecting either real or personal estate with intent fraudulently to impede, obstruct or delay his creditors in their remedies against him, or with intent to defraud his creditors, or any of them, and so made, done, and intended with the knowledge of the person contracting or acting with the debtor, whether such person be his creditor or not, and which have the effect of impeding, obstructing, or delaying the creditors of their remedies, or of injuring them or any of them, are prohibited and are null and void, &c.\nI need not refer specifically to the special pleas before mentioned, or to the subsequent pleadings as to them, but may say that I think they contain substantially allegations sufficient to justify the reception of evidence under the provisions of the last recited section.\nSection 133 is, I think, also applicable:\nIf any sale, deposit, pledge, or transfer be made of any property real or personal by any person in contemplation of insolvency by way of security for payment to any creditor, or if any property real or personal, moveable or immoveable, goods, effects, or valuable security be given by way of payment by such person to any creditor, whereby such creditor obtains or will obtain an unjust preference over the other creditors, such sale, deposit, pledge, transfer, or payment shall be null and void, and the subject thereof may be recovered back for the benefit of the estate by the assignee in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nWith the addition that if within the prescribed thirty days or afterwards:\nIt shall be presumed to have been made in contemplation of insolvency. The seventh plea is the only one alleging a defence under this latter section. It alleges in substance that the deposit, pledge, or transfer of the premises by the lease, the delivery of the goods and the endorsation of the receipts, were made and given by the company in contemplation of insolvency, and that the warehouse receipts were assigned to the Standard Bank as the agents and trustees of the Consolidated Bank. These allegations bring the plea, in my opinion, within the provisions of the act; for if it were all done to make payment of a previous debt or liability to the Consolidated Bank, or to secure the payment of it by having it made to the Standard Bank as mere agents or trustees of the Consolidated Bank, it would in law be the same as if the transfer were direct to the latter. No other provision of the act is, in my opinion, applicable. Section 130 refers to gratuitous contracts or conveyances, but in none of the special pleas is the ground broadly taken that the lease and transfer of the goods were gratuitous and without consideration. The sixth and seventh pleas do not in any way refer to the matter of the consideration for the lease. The fifth, however, alleges that the lease was given \u201cfor a merely nominal consideration,\u201d but another part of the plea shews there was a consideration by plaintiff agreeing to take possession of and safely keep goods of the company, and to give therefor accountable receipts to deliver the same to the company or their order. The lease could not be held to have been a \u201cgratuitous conveyance\u201d and \u201cwithout consideration within the meaning of that section.\u201d I will now consider the substance of the two sections and will then turn to the evidence to see how far the issues on both sides have been sustained. To set aside a conveyance under section 132 requires proof;\n1st. Of a fraudulent intent to impede, &c., a creditor in his remedies, or to defraud his creditors. 2nd. That the conveyance was so made and that the fraudulent intent was known to the party to whom the conveyance was made.\nI have read over the evidence repeatedly with much care and such evidence is conspicuous only by its entire absence. The proof of the two issues was on the defendants, and proof of both were necessary to constitute a defence. On the contrary the evidence clearly negatives both allegations. The history of the whole transaction shows an honest debt due to the Consolidated Bank. That that institution had previously held the same goods as collateral security, but difficulties having arisen which prevented a renewal of their security under the Warehousing Act, through Conger who had acted as warehouseman, it decided to renew that security by the means adopted and now complained of. The Consolidated Bank under the circumstances of its advances on the security of the goods had, in my opinion, such an equitable lien on the goods as collateral security for its advances, as might have been enforced in equity, as between it and the company, although the security by means of the warehouse receipts given by Conger had failed. I cannot, therefore, conclude that even had the transfer of the receipt from the plaintiff been directly to the Consolidated Bank, it would have been within either of the fraudulent intents referred to in the section under consideration. The evidence as to the advances in question is not, it is true, very satisfactory as shewing they had been originally made on the security of the goods, but if not, the onus of shewing that the security was not given for a then subsisting debt, and that at the time the company was in such an embarrassed position as to have made the transfers ab initio void was upon the Respondents. There is no pretence, from the evidence, that such was the case, and in the absence of proof to the contrary we are bound to presume nothing against the validity of the original security so often renewed by the warehouse receipt of Conger. The company would be estopped both at law and in equity from questioning the validity of those receipts signed by Conger; and if they were valid when given the subsequent insolvency a year after could not affect the right of the bank. Admitting, however, my conclusions thus expressed are wholly wrong, where is the evidence of the other requirement of the section? What is there to show the guilty knowledge of the plaintiff when he took the lease and gave the warehouse receipt? I may answer emphatically nothing. We have no evidence on the point at all, except his own, and he distinctly and positively swears to the contrary, and no jury would be justified in finding in opposition to his statement in the absence of proof of circumstances inconsistent with it; and none such are in evidence here. The learned judge who found the verdict for the plaintiff has so far thereby shown credence in the evidence of the plaintiff, and I cannot but approve his having done so.\nI will now consider the issues under the provisions of section 133.\nA defence under that section requires, first, proof that the transfer was made in contemplation of insolvency to a creditor, and with the addition of one or other of two objects, either to secure payment for a debt then and previously existing or in actual payment of that debt. It must be to a creditor, or, what is the same thing, to his agent or trustees, as in the special pleas in this case is alleged.\nTo arrive at the true meaning of this section, it is necessary to define in the first place the term \u201cin contemplation of insolvency.\u201d A variety of definitions of the term have been given, but from the researches I have been enabled to make, I am inclined to the opinion that the decision must, to a great extent, be affected by the circumstances of each case. It is often a question of great uncertainty, so far as the evidence of the fact goes. The abstract meaning of the term is what, however, I am now more particularly considering; the construction I feel disposed to adopt is this: In contemplation of insolvency, I take to apply to the case of a man who reflectively considers himself in such a position financially that he cannot meet his engagements and must bring his business to an early close\u2014that his assets are insufficient to meet his liabilities. The \u201ccontemplation\u201d is, no doubt, intended to be personal to the party making a transfer in such a case to one of his creditors; but it might in some cases be a question of evidence whether his contemplation, although not so, should have resulted in the conviction that he occupied such a position, as by law, prevented him from securing or paying one or more of his creditors to the injury of the others. The policy of the law is, no doubt, to require every one placed in circumstances of reasonable doubt of being able to pay all his creditors not to make any preference. I take It, therefore, that a preference so given is void. There are, however, cases where a person fairly and reasonably believes himself well able to pay all his liabilities, and has assets more than enough to pay all his debts and anticipates no immediate interruption of his business; and if to enable him to discharge debts due to others and to keep his business going, he obtains further time for payment of a debt due to one or more creditors by giving them security on his real or personal estate, it cannot, in my opinion, be said he did so \u201cin contemplation of insolvency\u201d within the provisions of the section. The question is, to my mind, a mixed one of law and fact.\nIn the report of the trial, I find the learned judge decided, that when the note was given to the Standard Bank the company was insolvent, but that the bank was not aware of that fact. I presume he meant in view of the act, and although he does not distinctly say that the transfer was made in contemplation of insolvency, I think that was what he meant. Having seen the witnesses and heard their evidence, he was better able to decide that point, and apart from any view I might from the evidence be otherwise inclined to adopt, I will adopt his finding as the correct one, although I think the evidence hardly sustains it. I am, however, decidedly of the opinion that the defendants wholly failed to established the fact that the transfer was made to the Standard Bank as the agents and trustees of the Consolidated Bank, and that, therefore, the pleas not having in that respect been proved, the defence must fail.\nWhen the trespasses and conversion took place, the appellant was in the lawful possession of the land and goods. That possession was given to him by the then owners of both. He had a title by lease to the land, and his possession of the goods was uncontrollable by any one except the Standard Bank\u2014to whose order he held the goods. His man had immediate charge of them and he, the appellant, exercised acts of possession and control over them inconsistent with any right of the company to interfere with them or control him in regard to them. He had become answerable for their safe keeping to the Standard Bank, and was in a position to bring trespass or trover for any injury to conversion of them against any person but one having a superior right or title. His position as bailee threw upon him responsibility which he could only relieve himself from by keeping his contract, and to enable him to do so the law gave him a remedy to protect him from loss and injury. He is, therefore, entitled to recover in this action unless the defendants can avoid the transfer to him on the grounds taken in the pleas. Bearing in mind the allegations in all of the three special pleas, dispute the validity of the transfer of the lands and goods on the ground that the transfer was made to the Standard Bank as the agents and trustees of the Consolidated Bank, let us consider the evidence referring to that transfer.\nThe appellant alleges that he signed and delivered the warehouse receipt to the company ignorant as to what bank it would be endorsed. Witnesses from the directing and managing staff of both banks were examined, and they all swear positively the discount of the company\u2019s note was solely on the collateral security of the goods, It is true it was done at the request of the cashier or manager of the Consolidated Bank, with which institution the Standard Bank was on terms of friendly commercial relations, but that is nothing, as all the other evidence sustains this position and there is nothing to contradict it. It is the evidence given by the respondents and brought out of their own witnesses by their own counsel. How could any court or jury reject it in toto, and set up in opposition to it some fanciful ideas that the case was otherwise. The respondents, by producing such evidence on the trial, and substantiating the testimony of one witness by others to corroborate it, I maintain, are completely estopped from taking a position founded on the presumption that such evidence was unreliable or untrue. Courts and juries cannot make evidence\u2014their duty is to decide according to the evidence produced\u2014to reconcile conflicting evidence if possible, and, if not, to decide according to the weight of it, but certainly, where the evidence is all in one direction, not to allow their imaginations to furnish antagonistic conclusions. Nothing in the administration of justice would be more dangerous than the admission of such a rule. Once leave the controlling and guiding cardinal point, and the chances are a hun- dred to one that injustice would be done in the great majority of cases. It is true that injustice results from false and improper relations of facts, but the main object is to secure the greatest amount of success in dealing judicially with existing legal controversies.\nTaking then the whole evidence, it would be an unnecessary waste of time and words to point out in detail how essentially and effectually it negatives the allegation that the Standard Bank took the transfer as the agents and trustees of the Consolidated Bank. When the whole transaction between the company and the Standard Bank was concluded by the discount of the note and the payment over of the proceeds to the company, what relation of agency or trusteeship, I would like to be told, existed between the two banks? The discount was obtained through the aid of the representative of the Consolidated Bank, but that was all. No, even verbal, promise of indemnity is pretended to have been given and the only relation remaining between the two banks was that of a supposed honorable, but not binding, implication of liability not to allow one bank to lose who discounted for a third party on the recommendation of the other. No such position was spoken of or relied on in making the discount, and if it were it would be unavailable in case of loss Suppose, however, a binding contract for indemnity had been given, would that destroy the lien on the goods? Would it in the slightest degree legally affect it? If a man on a mortgage as security on another man\u2019s land lend him money, and takes at the same time a bond for further security from a third party, no one would contend the taking of the latter would avoid the mortgage. Suppose the money went to pay a debt to the party to the bond, could it in such a case be said that the mortgagee was the agent or trustee of such party? No authority would sustain such a doctrine, and still the respondents rest their defence on that, to my mind, absurd proposition. Admitting, however, as correct the construction of the evidence, as the defendants counsel suggest, I must differ from those who conclude thereupon in favor of the defendants. If one man owes another a debt for the payment of which he is pressing, but from pressure for funds himself, or from any other cause, no matter what, he cannot give further indulgence, or take such security as the debtor could offer him, and he, for the purpose of recovering his debt, induces another to advance the required funds on such security, I can conceive no law or principle which would invalidate the security, or make one party a trustee for the other. There is no one provision or principle contained in the Insolvent Act that in the slightest degree refers to such a transfer bon\u00e2 fide made, which I, in this case, have no reason to doubt was the case; but on the contrary, am bound by the evidence to decide was the case. There is no doubt that the Consolidated Bank was anxious for the settlement of its claim, and took the measures the evidence shows for the purpose of getting in the debt, but why should their anxiety and measures affect the bona fides of the transaction on the part of the Standard Bank? I cannot see upon any principle why such should be the decision.\nI have, therefore, only to add that in my deliberate judgment the defence under the special pleas has wholly failed.\nFor the same reasons I must decide in favor of the appellant on the other issues.\nI have attentively considered all the judgments delivered in the Queen\u2019s Bench and the Court of Appeal, and was struck with the divergence as to the controlling points which they relatively exhibit.\nMr. Justice Wilson, the learned present Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench, in his judgment says: The lease cannot be said to have been a gratuitous lease or contract. It was a beneficial one to and for the company; and if it cannot be impeached on other grounds it cannot, in my opinion, be held to be invalid because it is gratuitous.\nFor the reasons already given, as well as for those given by him, I entirely approve of his ruling on that point.\nHe says, too, he can see no reason for avoiding the lease on account of the purpose for which it was given\u2014\u201deven although it was made to meet or effectuate a single transaction.\u201d This, of course, not to touch any question of fraud or improper dealing, \u201cand as honestly meant as it was honestly acted upon.\u201d\nI have considered the legal question involved and the statutes applicable to it, and I have no difficulty in arriving at the same conclusion; and I feel justified in adopting his reasoning as to those parts of the case. His lordship also approves as legal the endorsement of the warehouse receipt; and also decides that the plaintiff was properly in court and not bound to seek relief by a petition to the judge of the Insolvency Court I concur with his decision of these two points. His lordship\u2019s judgment was therefore in favor of the plaintiff upon all the points, except that in reference to the relative position of the two banks. He assumed the position that, had the receipt been transferred to the Consolidated Bank it would have been void, and from. the evidence he held, that the Standard Bank was acting solely in the interest and as the mere instruments of the other bank as a cover.\nFor the reasons I have already given I differ from the first of these two latter conclusions, and I think the evidence as wholly against the latter one.\nAfter the argument of the appeal at Toronto judgments at length were given by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario and Mr. Justice Patterson. The former says:\u2014\nUpon this statement of facts I am of opinion that the plaintiff was not a warehouseman of these goods within the meaning of the acts and (consequently) that the endorsement of the receipt given by him did not transfer any property to the bank. In coming to this conclusion I disregard the circumstances which are effectively dealt with by Mr. Justice Wilson for the purpose of showing that the Standard Bank was really the Consolidated Bank in the whole affair. 1 should have much difficulty in holding, if the warehouse receipt had been given by a warehouseman in the ordinary course of business, that the transaction was proved to be in its essence a frauds lent preference to the Consolidated Bank. I might not have been able to free my mind from grave suspicions that this was its true character; but I should have thought that this was a question upon which there ought to be a finding by the judge or jury who had the opportunity of hearing the witnesses. But I cannot bring myself to the conclusion that the plaintiff was in this transaction a warehouseman or that his receipts come within the fair meaning of the acts which enabled this mode of dealing with property to be equivalent under certain circumstances to a chattel mortgage.\nUpon all the other points there is a concurrence of opinion in favor of the plaintiff, but as regards the two questions the one judgment is opposed diametrically to the other.\nMr. Justice Patterson rules against the finding that the transfer to the plaintiff was made \u201cin contemplation of insolvency.\u201d He says:\u2014\nThe first fact, therefore, viz: the contemplation of insolvency has to be established and no such fact is found.\nI think, however, it was found by the judge on the trial, and, therefore, am led to believe that what was meant was that it had not been proved.\nHe is of opinion also that under the circumstances the alleged preference to the Consolidated Bank was not unjust. After referring to the previous warehouse receipts held by the Consolidated Bank, and upon which they depended for security, he says:\nThat the change from one warehouseman to another which an accident made necessary, while it restored the property for an instant to the control of the car company, might not touch the justice of the bank\u2019s claim to be secured in preference to creditors the dates or particulars of whose debts we know nothing of. We have not the materials for a decision, even if it was properly our province to decide, that the preference was unjust. The onus of establishing these facts was upon the defendants, and therefore the uncertainty in which they are left affords no ground for setting aside the plaintiff\u2019s verdict.\nReferring to 34 Vic., ch. 5, sec. 47, he says:\nUpon this it is argued that as the transfer to the Standard Bank was, in reality, to secure an antecedent debt of the Consolidated Bank, it was forbidden by the statute. I do not take that view of it. I think that, although the two Banks were so identified, that the interest of the one might, under the provisions of the Insolvent Act, vitiate a transaction which, in form, was affected by the other, yet the Standard Bank, having really advanced its money, had a right to take the security in question, under the terms of the Banking Act, even though the money was to go to pay the old debt of the other Bank: and I do not perceive that this is affected by the circumstance that the bank which was benefited agreed to save the other harmless.\nI. entirely agree with this view of the law.\nHe therefore concurs with Chief Justice Moss in reversing the judgment of Chief Justice Wilson upon the only point on which the judgment of the latter was against the appellant, and as the learned justices Burton and Morrison concurred in the two judgments so delivered, the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench was on that point overruled.\nApart then from any question of fraud or unjust preference, the decision of Mr. Justice Patterson was based on the want of legal title of the plaintiff. He says:\u2014\nI am unable to hold that the Insolvent Act avoids the transaction without drawing inferences of fact which should properly have been drawn by the judge at the trial, and he has not drawn them.\nAs affecting the legal title and possession of the plaintiff, the learned judge thinks the evidence is insufficient \u201cthat he had no actual possession or control of the goods, but that it was not in contemplation that he should have it. The guarantee he required from the bank for the forthcoming of the goods, while sufficient evidence of this, is only one fact in a consistent series.\u201d I have read and considered the evidence as to this point very carefully, and I feel bound to decide in the opposite direction. The goods were in an open yard some distance removed from the ordinary warehouse of the plaintiff, and in the absence of some guarantee of their safety would entail extra loss of time and more vigilance than he might have felt he should incur. His taking an indemnity would or could not affect his liability to the owner or his endorsee. His liability to them would be the same, and as a merely legal proposition I cannot see how the fact of the indemnity can in any way affect the question of possession. On the contrary taking the whole transaction together, it is rather evidence of the possession being in him. That his possession and control should be complete, the right to hold the land was given him by the company. His right to take possession of the goods was also given him by the company. They substantially said to him: We will make you, for the time, the legal owner of the land upon which the goods are deposited, and you shall have them in your possession and under your control as warehouseman on your giving us a warehouse receipt for them. He accepted the offer, and in pursuance of its terms assumed the necessary responsibility and gave the required receipt. By the terms of it he became responsible for the safety of the goods. To enable him to perform his part of the contract the possession and control of the goods was absolutely necessary.\nThe company would be estopped from disputing his right to that possession, and as soon as the company endorsed that receipt over to another party, their right to the property in, and the possession of, the goods ceased subject, however, to any right of redemption of them, if any, as between them and their endorsee. Independently, however, of this legal proposition there is abundant evidence that the plaintiff had the actual possession and manual control of the goods. After the transfer of the warehouse receipt to the Standard Bank; which took place immediately after it was signed, the plaintiff received and executed orders from that bank for several lots of the goods. His man went to the yard on each occasion and delivered the goods so ordered and kept a detailed account of what he delivered. The company never interfered with his possession or disposal of them under the orders of the bank or otherwise. They were not on land then in possession of the company and how could it be contended that the goods were actually or constructively in the possession of the company? If not, then, they were not only actually but in contemplation of law in possession of the plaintiff.\nIt may however be contended that although the company could not have claimed or taken possession of them the right of the assignees is different. If the transfer was not affected by the provisions of the Insolvent Act the right and title of the assignee is identical with those of the insolvent. His legal engagements and contracts are those which the assignee is bound by, and estoppels against the insolvent are equally so against his assignee. By operation of the Insolvent Act the assignee is put in the place of the insolvent with power in certain cases to avoid contracts, made in violation of the act. It was very properly decided by Chief Justice Wilson in re Coleman[32] that the assignment does not, however, \u201cpass to the assignee any property which was not the property of the insolvent nor any greater estate or interest in his property than he himself had in it. An equitable mortgage good as against the insolvent would be good against his assignee in insolvency, and so also would an equitable assignment of a debt or other appropriation of his estate good against him be good also against his assignee.\u201d If such be the law, and I have no doubt of it, the assignee of the company occupied no higher ground than the company itself did, and he is equally with them estopped from disputing the legal title and possession of the plaintiff of the land and goods. The respondents admit having entered upon the land and taken the goods. If their act was not a justifiable one they were trespassers on the land of the appellant held and possessed under his lease and for taking and converting his goods.\nIn the judgments delivered by Chief Justice Moss and Mr. Justice Patterson, they appear to have been grounded principally or wholly upon the conclusion that the plaintiff was not a warehouseman of the goods in question within the meaning of the acts; and the latter quotes my learned brother Gwynne in a judgment of his in Ontario Bank v. Newton[33]. I have read that judgment, and with all deference, I must contend the principle there decided does not touch this case. In that case, the party who signed the receipt had never been a warehouseman, and his only act as such was in signing the receipt, then the subject of consideration, and it was decided that he could not by such an act make himself a, warehouseman for the purpose of or under the acts. How that decision can affect this case, where the fact of the plaintiff having been a regular warehouseman is not only not denied, but admitted, I confess myself unable to discover. A distinction, however, is attempted to be drawn in this case from ordinary ones, because the goods were not stored in the usual warehouse or yard of the plaintiff I have considered the point and cannot sustain that distinction. Is a warehouse keeper to be limited to one warehouse or yard, or would a warehouse keeper be disqualified to open a warehouse yard apart and at a distance from his warehouse, or would he be limited to one warehouse or one yard? I can see no restriction in the acts. The act does not require the warehouseman to be the keeper of any particular kind of warehouse, but provides for the giving effect by endorsement to the receipt of any person who is a warehouseman. The acts give effect to the receipt of a warehouseman \u201cfor cereal grains, goods, wares or merchandise stored or deposited * * * in any warehouse, mill cove or other place within the province, and from the date of the endorsement vests all the right and title of the indorser to or in such cereal grains, goods, wares or merchandise, subject to the right of the indorser to have the same retransferred to him if such bill, note, or debt be paid to him when due\u201d A warehouseman, or yard keeper, is not the less so because he has more than one warehouse or yard, and as the acts only require the receipt to be from a warehouseman, a receipt given by one having more than one warehouse satisfies the requirement of the act certainly as fully as, if not more fully, than if he had but one. A man could hardly be the less called a hotel keeper if he kept two or three hotels instead of but one. Nor are the means he takes to obtain one or more of the warehouses a necessary inquiry to validate the receipts of a warehouseman or yard keeper. Suppose a warehouseman becomes the tenant of a warehouse in which goods of a third party are stored, and he, after taking a lease from the owner with the understanding that thereby he is to have possession of the goods to hold them for the owner, and he subsequently signs a warehouse receipt for them, which is endorsed to a bank, would it not be monstrous to hold that in case of any informality in the lease or otherwise, the bank should lose its advances. The only enquiry the acts require is to ascertain that the party is a warehouseman, and that he has signed the receipt. To require such an inquisitorial and often impracticable inquiry as would be otherwise necessary, would defeat the whole object and purposes of the act. In a great many cases goods are deposited hundreds of miles from the banks making the advances, and the time and trouble necessary to make such inquiries would paralyze the beneficial operation of the Acts. Such I claim could not have been intended, and I feel bound to say such is not the true construction of them.\nWe are told, however, that attention should be given to the Chattel Mortgage Acts which require registry. The object of those Acts is not altogether to give publicity to transfers, but to secure titles to parties for debts existing or for advances by which the owners would be accommodated and benefited. The object was, to prevent frauds from secret transfers, and whilst such were allowed to prevail, no one felt safe in advancing upon chattel security any more than he would be inclined to do in case of land security in the absence of registry regulations The main object I take as to both was to enable a man as well with regard to personal as real estate to go to the registry office and satisfy himself in respect of either that there was no previous assignment or incumbrance in his way. Subsequent to the enactment in question Parliament, which is invested with the power to legislate in regard to the regulation of Trade and Commerce, thought proper to provide that a party might obtain a lien on goods in another way, and prescribed the mode by which it could be so obtained. Under the latter the plaintiff, as a warehouseman, received the goods, signed a warehouse receipt for them, which was endorsed to the Standard Bank. If the proceeding throughout was according to the late enactments (which virtually repealed the former Acts to that extent) what right have we to consider at all the previous Chattel Mortgage Acts? If they at all conflict we must give weight to the later enactments. The later Acts provide for no registry; and the beneficial operation of them would have been frustrated if they had done so. Parliament, for wise commercial considerations, has dispensed with any registry in cases provided for, and it is not the province of courts to set themselves up against the policy of acts\u2014a jurisdiction the constitution has not given to them. In reference to the case before us Parliament has spoken in amply plain and binding terms, and it is not for us to say it did not mean what those terms explicitly express. After making the necessary provisions and conditions, the legislature has plainly said that if those provisions and conditions are complied with and fulfilled, the endorsement of the warehouse receipt shall convey to the endorsee a good title or lien. The appellant has brought himself within such provisions by complying with them. Within the terms of the statute he was in possession lawfully of the goods, and I cannot conceive how, under the circumstances the alleged policy of the Chattel Mortgage Acts can be invoked as a set-off to rights legally acquired under the other acts. As the principles involved are commercially so important and affect trade throughout the whole Dominion, I have gone more into detail than might have been necessary for the decision of the present case.\nHaving fully given my views upon the legal questions involved and the evidence adduced on the trial, I have now only to add that I think the judgment against the appellant should be reversed, that the appeal should be allowed and judgment given for him with costs. TASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion to dismiss this appeal. That Conger\u2019s warehouse receipts were utterly illegal and void in law seems undenied. That Milloy\u2019s receipts were but the continuation of transactions of the same nature as those with Conger appears to me plain and evident. The parties attempted to give Milloy\u2019s receipts more of an appearance of legality, but the whole transaction was as fictitious and colourable as the one with Conger. Milloy was never in the actual possession required by law of the goods in question to authorize him to give a warehouse receipt on them. The shadow of a lease which the Car Company granted to him was not even signed by him and the nominal rent of five dollars was paid by the bank; even in the present suit, Milloy is only a nominal plaintiff. He so little had the possession of the goods, that he required from the bank a guarantee that they would be forthcoming when required. For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the unanimous judgments of the two Ontario courts in this case should be confirmed and this appeal dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nI have been unable to read the evidence in this case without arriving at the conclusion that the transaction, in virtue of which the plaintiff had executed to him by the car company the instrument called a lease, and in virtue of which the plaintiff signed the document which has been called \u201ca receipt under the provisions of statute 34 Vict., ch 5 of the statutes of Canada, intituled \u2018An Act relating to Banks and Banking,\u2019\u201d was devised and contrived wholly by the Consolidated Bank.\nThe evidence also satisfies my mind that (if it were necessary for the determination of this case to establish this, which I do not think it is), the object of the Consolidated Bank in designing this contrivance was to endeavour to secure payment to themselves of a large debt due to them by the car company (which company the bank well knew to be in insolvent circumstances) in preference to the other creditors of the company, and that this contrivance was devised in preference to a chattel mortgage, because it was well known, both to the car company and to the bank, that a chattel mortgage would be publicly known and would precipitate the impending insolvency.\nBut, whatever may have been the motive of the bank, it is quite apparent to my mind that, to carry out the transaction devised, the plaintiff was introduced into it wholly as the agent of the bank, and that he only consented to act in it by their procurement, in their interest, upon their guarantee, and in short as their agent; that in this character it was that he accepted the document called \u201cthe lease,\u201d and that he signed the document called \u201ca warehouse receipt.\u201d Personally, he never had possession of the property mentioned in the receipt and in his character of warehouseman he never in reality contemplated assuming possession of the property, or any control over it, or responsibility for it. The fair conclusion from all the evidence appears to me to be that he took no part in the transaction whatever, otherwise than by the direction of, upon the guarantee of, and as the agent of, the bank, in which latter character also the fair conclusion is, that the present action is brought. Under the circumstances appearing in evidence it is, in my judgment, an abuse of terms to call the receipt given by the plaintiff a receipt within the meaning of the clauses in that behalf in the Banking Act, or to say that the plaintiff ever had any actual possession, control over, or property in, the goods mentioned in the receipt, or in fact, to regard him in the transaction in any other capacity than that of an agent of the Consolidated Bank. To decide otherwise would, as it appears to me, open the door to a ready mode of nullifying the Chattel Mortgage Act, and of successfully perpetrating those transactions which the Insolvent Act pronounced to be frauds upon creditors. If it were necessary (but for the reasons already given I do not think it is) to trace the connection of the Standard Bank with the transaction, I think the fair inference warranted by the evidence is that they also interfered only in the interest of and at the request of the Consolidated Bank, and upon the implied undertaking of the latter bank to indemnify them against loss in the event of their advancing the money which they did advance, an undertaking which most probably has been fulfilled or the Standard Bank would naturally be the plaintiffs here, and that they knew or had sufficient information from which they could and should have known, and may, therefore, be inferred to have known, the infirmity attached to the receipt upon which they were asked to advance the money. But whatever may have been the conduct of the Standard Bank in the transaction, whether they were the dupes or the coadjutors of the Consolidated Bank in endeavoring to perfect the contrivance of the latter, it is plain, to my mind, that for the reasons given above and in the Court of Appeal from whose judgment this appeal comes that plaintiff cannot succeed in this action.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: McMichael, Hoskin & Ogden.\nSolicitors for respondents: Kerr & Akers.\n[1] The Court being equally divided the appeal was dismissed without costs.\n[2] 40 U.C.Q.B. 466; 34 Vic., ch. 5, s. 46 & 47.\n[3] 20 U.C.C.P. 313.\n[4] 35 U.C.Q.B. 1.\n[5] 25 U.C.C.P. 562.\n[6] L.R. 6 P.C. 31.\n[7] P. 90.\n[8] 7 T.R. 667.\n[9] 6th Ed. 2nd vol. 362.\n[10] 16 East 372.\n[11] 36 U.C.Q.B. 559.\n[12] Pp. 808-810, 814-817, 831-834.\n[13] P. 312.\n[14] 4 Bankruptcy Register, 303.\n[15] 2 Dillon 383.\n[16] 12 Grant 524.\n[17] 27 U.C.Q.B. 244.\n[18] 15 Grant 283.\n[19] 24 Grant 22.\n[20] 7 T.R. 9.\n[21] 4 Bing.
