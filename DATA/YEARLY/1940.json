In 1883, the Canadian Fire Underwriters' Association, an unincorporated body, was formed by the association of a number of fire insurance companies carrying on business in Ontario and Quebec, all the members of that Association at the date of the action being added as plaintiffs to the Underwriters' Survey Bureau Limited, a Canadian corporation incor\u00adporated in 1917. Prior to 1901, the fire insurance business in Canada was carried on under the minimum tariff system of rating. In 1900, or shortly afterwards, the Association decided to adopt the system of \"rating schedules\" for all buildings in protected areas, with the exception of residential risks, which remained subject to the minimum tariff system. In this system, formula known as rating schedules, which are applied to individual buildings, must be arrived at and expressed with precision. These specific rates are recorded on cards or books, which are issued to members and members' agents only. From the beginning, 'the Rates Committees of the Association had charge of all matters connected with rates. According to the consti\u00adtution of the Association of 1914, it was provided, inter alia, that all then existing members of the Association and companies there-after becoming members were binding themselves, by signing a copy of constitution and by-laws, to observe same; and that the member, who may withdraw, was bound to release, or \"forfeit,\" \" any right or claim to any portion of the property or assets of the Association\" and return to it all card ratings and specific tariffs received from the Association, rating schedules and manuals not being placed in the hands of the agents but remaining in the hands of the officers of the Association. The affairs of the Association are administered by officers elected annually by the members, and the expenses are met by an annual assessment upon all the members proportioned in each case to the premium income of the member for the year. At the end of 1917, or the beginning of 1918, the Plans Department of the Association was taken over by the appel\u00adlant, the Underwriters' Survey Bureau Ltd., a company incorporated for that purpose whose shares were held in trust for the members\nof the Association and its directors were officers of the Association. The plan committee of the Association, constituted in 1917, was charged with the duty of transacting the common business in respect of plans and with conducting the business of the Bureau. Consider-able sums of money derived from the contributions of the members of the Association to the common fund were spent in obtaining the necessary information for constituting the rating schedules and other material and in the actual production of the material itself, which material was intended for the exclusive use of the members of the Association. As to the plans, those produced by the plan committee prior to the incorporation of the Bureau and those made afterwards by the Association up to the 1st January, 1924, were delivered to the Bureau with the intention that they should be the property of the Bureau, i.e., the legal ownership should be vested in the Bureau. There were also two classes of plans other than that made by the Bureau after the 1st of January, 1924: first, plans, the copyright to which were registered in the name of Charles Edward Goad, who died in 1910; and, second, plans, the copyright to which was registered in the name of Charles E. Goad Company; and the respondents claim title to these plans under assignment by the Toronto General Trusts Corporation, executors and trustees of the will of Charles Edward Goad, through the members of the firm Charles E. Goad Company and under a further assignment in 1931 from the Charles E. Goad Company to the Bureau. A large number of the Goad plans were partially or completely revised and reprinted by the salaried employees of the Survey Bureau, some prior to the assignment of the Goad copyrights in 1931 and some subsequent to that. The respondents alleged that the appellant, not a member of the Canadian Fire Underwriters' Association, authorized others to make copies or reproductions of the plans and rating schedules and converted such to its own use. The appellant denied respondents' title to copyright to the plans produced by C. E. Goad and claimed by respondents to have been acquired by assignment from the C. E. Goad Company in 1931. The appellant further pleaded that the acts of the respondents in withholding from the appellant and others. copies of the works in question constituted a combine and conspiracy within the meaning of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 36, and the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1927, c. 36, s. 498; that the respondents acquiesced in the alleged infringement and conversion and are guilty of laches, and that the period of limitation applicable to such actions is a bar to relief.\nHeld that the appeal should be allowed in respect of the rating material brought into existence after the first of January, 1924, and in other respects dismissed[1].\nThe \"rating material,\" designating what were known as rating schedules or manuals and rate books, minimum tariffs and specific ratings but excluding the plans, was the property of the members of the Association at the date when the Copyright Act of 1921 came into force on the 1st of January, 1924. These members were the owners, not only of the material itself, but of the common law, incorporeal, exclusive right of reproduction and became, by force of the statute (section 42 in the schedule), the owners of copyright in that material. Material of that character was subject-matter for copyright and, not being published, the exclusive right of multiplying copies of it, or of publishing it, was a right which the common law, prior to the statute of 1921, gave primarily to the authors of it. As to such material produced after the statute came into force, the respondents have not adduced sufficient evidence to establish a title to copyright in it. The members of the Association are all incorporated companies and they or any one of them cannot be an author within the meaning of the Copyright Act. Any one or all of them, that is to say, all the members of the Association at any given time, could be the owner or joint owners of copyright, but they could acquire copyright only in one of two ways,-either by assignment by some person having a title to the copyright or by one of the ways mentioned in. the proviso to section 12 of the Act. As to the ground that the present case comes within subsection (b), the respondents must, in order to succeed, show that the material in respect of which the question arises was made \"in the course of his employment\" by a person or persons \"under a contract of service or apprenticeship \" with the respondents or some of them, But from the evidence it must be inferred that this material was produced by employees in the course of their employment under a contract of service with the members of the Association for the time being. And there is no evidence as to the practice in relation to the contracts under which the employees of the Association were engaged or in relation to the terms of their engagement. It is not a mere abstract possibility, but a practical possibility, that for convenience some form of arrangement was resorted to by which there was no direct contractual bond between the members of the Association and the employees, or that in. any case the work was done by persons who were independent contractors. As to plans: The plans copyrighted by Charles Edward Goad in his lifetime and those copyrighted by the Charles Edward Goad Company passed to the Underwriters Survey Bureau Ltd. by the deeds of transfer and assignment produced at the trial. As to nine plans made by the plan department of the Association in 1911 and 1917, copyright was vested by force of the Copyright Act of 1921, s. 42, in the members of the Association at the date when the Act came into force, i.e., on the first of January, 1924.-Copyright in the revisions of the Goad plans vested in the Bureau in virtue of the fact that these revisions were executed by the salaried employees of the Bureau in exercise of their functions as such. As to plans and revisions of plans made by the Bureau after the statute of 1921 came into force on the 1st of January, 1924, these having been made by the salaried employees of the Bureau, the title vested in the Bureau in virtue of section 12 (b)-As regards the copyright in the plans produced by the Bureau, including the revisions of the Goad plans, section 20 (3) (b) (ii) applies. Prima facie the legend \"Made in Canada by the Underwriters' Survey Bureau Ltd.\" implies proprietorship and such legend is found on these plans: the prima facie case has not been met.\nHeld, also, as to companies which had ceased to be members of the Association and were not parties plaintiffs at the commencement of the action, their interest in the copyrights was a bare legal interest since, on ceasing to be members of the Association, they ceased to have any beneficial interest in such copyrights and the plaintiffs, as part owners, were entitled to protect their rights by suing for an injunction and for damages. Lauri v. Renad ([1892] 3 Ch. 402); Cescinski v. Routledge ([1916] 2 K.B. 325) and Dent v. Turpin (2 J. & H. 139) ref.\nHeld, also, as to tangible chattels including infringing copies, companies on ceasing to be members ceased to have any joint or several right of possession in. any of the common property and the plaintiffs were, therefore, entitled 'to maintain trover or detinue in respect of such chattels.\nHeld, also, as to the question of the Statute of Limitations, that that was ample evidence in support of the conclusion of the trial judge that there had been fraudulent concealment within the meaning of the rule; with the consequence that the limitation period began to run only on the discovery of the fraud, or at the time when, with reasonable diligence, it would have been discovered. Therefore, the period of limitation established by the Copyright Act is not a bar to the relief claimed by the respondents.\nHeld, further, on the question of criminal conspiracy: if the plaintiffs in an action for the infringement of copyright are obliged, for the purpose of establishing the existence of, and their title to, the copy-right to rely upon an agreement and that agreement constitutes a criminal conspiracy, and their title rests upon such agreement and upon acts which are criminal acts by reason of their connection with such an. agreement, then it would be difficult, on general principles to understand how such an action could succeed; but, in the present case, the conclusion of the trial judge, negativing the existence in fact .of a criminal conspiracy is right.\nHeld, further, as to the appellant's contention that the authorship of the work cannot in. the case either of the plans or of the rating materials be ascertained; that, according to the provisions of section 20 (3) of the Copyright Act, the statute does not contemplate disclosure of authorship as a necessary condition of success in. an action for infringement; but the provisions of that section do not go as far as creating a presumption that the name of the Association on the rating material should be regarded as the name of the publisher. As already stated, all the members of the Association being bodies corporate, none of them could be an author within the contempla\u00adtion of the statute; and it cannot be found as a fact that the name Canadian Fire Underwriters' Association in these manuals, rate-books and other rating material is a name which answers the description of the statute, namely, that \" a name purporting to be that of the * * * proprietor of the work is printed thereon in the usual manner.\"\nHeld, also, that, in the case of unpublished works (where the pro\u00adprietor is shewn to have acquired a common law right prior to the Copyright Act of 1921 by evidence establishing facts requiring an inference that the work was done for the plaintiff and that the intention of all parties concerned in the production of the work was that the common law right should vest in him) the statute plainly contemplates the protection of that right; and the only possible protection is the recognition of the substituted copyright given by the statute. It would be then merely a matter of evidence: the ownership of the common law right must rest upon established facts and these facts can be proved by inference as well as by direct evidence.\nHeld, further, as to the duration of the copyright where that comes in question, that, if the owner of it cannot identify the author, the duration of it must be restricted to the period of fifty years from the date when the copyright or common law right, as the case may be, came into existence.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1938) Ex. CR. 103) varied.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2], maintaining with costs an action for infringement of copyright by the appellant against the respondents in respect of certain works known as fire insurance rating material and fire insurance plans.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judg\u00adment now reported.\nW. N. Tilley K.C., O. M. Biggar K.C. and Christopher Robinson for the appellant.\nJ. A. Mann K.C., W. D. Herridge K.C. and A. M. Boulton for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE: In 1883 the Canadian Fire Underwriters' Association was formed by the association of a number of fire insurance companies carrying on business in Ontario and Quebec.\nPrior to 1901, the fire insurance business in Canada was carried on under the minimum tariff system of rating. Territory in which the companies were carrying on business was divided into districts. For each district a minimum tariff of rates was drawn up in which the premiums for various defined classes of risks were quoted. These were placed in the hands of the agents and of the member companies.\nIn 1900, ,or shortly afterwards, the Association decided to adopt the system of \" rating schedules \" for all buildings in protected areas with the exception of residential risks, which remained subject to the minimum tariff sys\u00adtem. In this system, formulae known as rating schedules, which are applied to individual buildings, must be arrived at and expressed with precision. Speaking generally, in large cities, and many lesser communities, a specific rate is separately worked out for each building and is tabulated in anticipation of applications for insurance in respect of that building.\nThese specific rates are recorded on cards, in the case of a large city, and in books in the case of smaller municipali\u00adties. The rate cards and books are issued to members and members' agents only. The specific rates are kept up to date by new cards or slips pasted in the rate books.\nFrom the beginning, the Rates Committees of the Association had charge of all matters connected with rates.\nThe operation of the system of rating schedules is explained by the witness Dixon:\nQ. Just explain to the court how towns, cities and villages became specifically rated?\nA. We will take, say a town A.\u2011it does not matter whether we call it a village, town or city. They put in some fire protection\u2011it may be fire pumps and mains and hydrants, and provide a certain amount of hose\u2011a fire station, and some firemen. It may be a gravity or pumping system. They notify us that 'they have carried out these improvements and that they now have some protection.\nThe first thing we do is send down our water works inspector. He visits the place and checks over all the protection that is provided. He also checks over street widths and congestion, and construction condi\u00adtions generally. He 'comes back to the office and writes a very elaborate report of that, so that we can tell exactly what that municipality has.\nThat report is sent to the municipality, by the way, said it has in it recommendations for further improvements and how to expand the system that they have.\nHis report comes, or it did, from the C.F.U.A. to the rates committee again, and they went over it very carefully and would decide that in view of the protection provided there we would effect a certain basic rate or key rate for the beginning of our schedule rating in that municipality. They would also say to the plans committee, \"We desire to specifically rate town A. Kindly see to it that a plan of town A is made and working sheets sent to the C.F.U.A. as soon as possible.\"\nWe could not start in to make the inspection until that plan was made, because our whole schedule rating system depends upon our plans. We have in. that specific tariff our black numbers, and our numbers in the specific tariff must absolutely correspond to the numbers that the agent and the company have; otherwise they would not know what rate to apply. So that either Goad or ourselves or the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, as the ease may be\u2011depending upon the time that the work was done\u2011would send their surveyors to the municipality and build up a plan.\nAnd while they were collating that to send out to the company members they would send us what we call a working sheet. That has just a cheaper binding on it, so that our inspectors can roll it under their arm and fold it up and take it to the municipality with them. And they go into each one of those risks, in the municipality. They go down one street and up the next, and make a report of every risk of a mer\u00adcantile nature in that place. That survey consists of all the details of construction, occupancy, exposure and private protection that the assured may have. He may have extinguishers, fire pumps and hose, and so on, for all .of which he would be entitled to a credit off his rate.\nThey come back and they have a plan and spread it out in front of them, and they see on each one of these risks-each building is called a risk in the fire insurance business-they identify that survey with the marking on the plan. In other words, let us say it would be block 5, sheet 2, No. 62 Main Street, town A. And when a tariff goes out to the companies the agent writes in and says that\nmy assured, Number so and so, 62 Main Street, block 5, sheet 2, of the town of A, desires so much insurance on his household furniture,\nor his barber shop stock, or whatever it is he wants to insure; and the company simply goes to work and takes their tariff, and looks up block 5, 62 Main Street, and there it is. And they see it is a candy store, let us say, so they know the occupancy must have changed. Then they take it up with the agent. But if it is a barbershop when the inspection is made and is still a barbershop, they know the rate that is to apply. So that the plan and the rate identify one another.\nHis Lordship: But the rate is never put on the plan?\nA. No, sir.\nQ. That would be in the rate book?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. But there is a means of identifying all the particular properties on the plan?\nA. Yes.\nIt will be convenient to use the term \"rating material,\" which was employed on the argument, as designating what are known as rating schedules or manuals and rate books, minimum tariffs and specific ratings. Except in the case of minimum tariffs, plans are an essential part of the rating machinery but, for the purpose of convenient discussion, the term \" rating material\" will embrace the matters just mentioned and then only.\nBefore proceeding to consider the rights in controversy, it is convenient to explain the constitution of the Cana\u00addian Fire Underwriters' Association.\nIn the constitution of 1914 the names of the existing members of the Association are set out and it is prescribed, by one of its provisions, that all existing members of the Association and companies thereafter becoming members, shall sign a copy of the constitution and by-laws; and it is declared that by this signature a member binds itself to observe the constitution and by-laws.\nThe constitution also provides that a member may with-draw on giving notice to that effect but that such withdrawal shall not take effect or release the member from his agreement to observe the constitution and the by-laws until the expiration of three months from the date of the notice.\nUpon withdrawal, the withdrawing member releases, or \"forfeits,\" as the word is, \" any right or claim to any portion of the property or assets of the Association,\" and returns to the Association of all card ratings and specific tariffs received by it from the Association. Rating schedules and manuals are not placed in the hands of the agents. They remain in the hands of the officers of the Association. Plans, as we shall see, are dealt with as the property of the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, an incor\u00adporated company, which performs the functions of the. plan department of the Association under the control and supervision of the Plan Committee.\nThe members of the Association meet annually, semi-annually and at special meetings called at the discretion of the president or the executive committee, or upon requisi\u00adtion by a specified proportion of members.\nAt annual meetings the members elect a president and two vice-presidents, one for each branch, Ontario and Quebec. They also name certain committees, including an executive committee, a plan committee and rates com\u00admittees. The members of the executive committee are elected for two years and retire in rotation yearly.\nThis committee has a general authority to transact any business which the members of the Association can trans-act, excepting the amendment of the constitution and by-laws and the forfeiture of membership; and the consti\u00adtution declares the intention that the committee shall dispose of all matters except those which the committee may consider it desirable to reserve for submission to the Association.\nOne of the secretaries is required to attend the meeting of the committee and keep the minutes which are printed and distributed to all the members of the Association.\nThe constitution formally declares that the members of the Association in general meeting are superior to all committees and constitute a final court of appeal.\nThe constitution also provides for the election by the members in general meeting of certain salaried officers, \u2011a permanent chairman of the executive committee and two secretaries, one of whom has an office in Montreal and the other in Toronto, where the business of the respective branches (Quebec and Ontario) is transacted. One of these secretaries is named as treasurer.\nThe secretaries are \"in their respective jurisdictions\" the chief executive officers of the Association, have the general supervision of its work and of all its employees and are directly responsible for the management of their respective offices.\nThe current expenses of the Association are met by an annual assessment upon all the members proportioned in each case to the premium income of the member for the year. Interim assessments are made quarterly based upon the income of the previous year, an adjustment being made when the amount payable by each member has been accurately ascertained. Each member, in addition, pays for the revision of any rating material and for the revision of tariffs made for it at the cost of the labour involved.\nThe assessment is made under the authority of the members of the Association in general meeting by the treasurer and is paid to the treasurer who submits to the annual meeting a printed statement of the previous year's expenditure and its apportionment audited by a chartered accountant appointed by the Association. There is a bank account at each of the branches, Montreal and Toronto, and all monies received are deposited in that account and it is the duty of each of the secretaries to defray the expenses of his branch. It is the duty of the secretary, who is the treasurer, to transfer to the account of the other branch sufficient funds to enable this to be done. All payments are made by cheque on one of these accounts, signed by the president, or a vice-president, and the treasurer or the other secretary, according to the account upon which the cheque is drawn.\nAt the end of 1917, or the beginning of 1918, the Plans Department of the Association was taken over by a com\u00adpany incorporated for that purpose under the Dominion Companies Act, the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, Ltd., the shares being held in-trust for the members of the Association. The plan committee of the Association, which was constituted in December, 1917, under an amendment to the constitution, was charged with the duty of transacting the common business in respect of plans and with conducting the business of the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, Ltd. We shall have to discuss in greater detail the business of the Bureau later.\nI put aside the consideration of the plans for a moment and discuss the rating material so-called.\nConsiderable sums of money derived from the contribu\u00adtions of the members of the Association to the common fund were spent in obtaining the necessary information for constituting the rating schedules and the other material mentioned and in the actual production of the material itself. This material was intended for the exclusive use of the members of the Association. There can be no doubt, I think, that, subject to the provisions of the constitution, the property in it was (as was all the common property) vested in such members for the time being. I think there can be no doubt that material of that character was subject matter for copyright and, not being published, the exclu\u00adsive right of multiplying copies of it, or of publishing it, was a right which the common law, prior to the statute of 1921, gave primarily to the authors of it. The principle laid down by Lord Brougham in Jefferys v. Boosey[3] applies.\nThe right of the author before publication we *may take to be unquestioned, and we may even assume that it never was, when accurately defined, denied. He has the undis\u00adputed right to his manuscript; he may withhold, or he may communicate it, and, communicating, he may limit the number of persons to whom it is imparted, and impose such restrictions as he pleases upon their use of it. The fulfilment of the annexed conditions he may proceed to enforce, and for their breach he may claim compensation. I do not think section 22 of the statute of 1875, which relates only to printing and publishing, supersedes the common law right to prohibit other dealings with unpub\u00adlished documents.\nAs regards the particular material with which we are concerned, that produced for the Association prior to the date when the Copyright Act of 1921 came into force, it was, as has been said, produced for the exclusive use of the members of the Association who considered it of fundamental importance that this right of exclusive user should be jealously guarded and, it must have been well understood that, not only the property in the material itself, but the ownership of the incorporeal right described by Lord Brougham should be vested exclusively in the mem\u00adbers of the Association.\nIt is important to notice that at this moment we are considering only the common law right of the author, the author's employer and the author's assigns, to control the use of unpublished documents, the right so vividly described by Lord Brougham in the words just quoted.\nIt is the contention of the respondents that this right in respect of this rating material is vested, as to the legal property in it, in the members of the Association for the time being and it is said that, on the 1st of January, 1924, when the Copyright Act of 1921 came into force, the property, not only in the rating materials themselves as physical things was vested in the members of the Associa\u00adtion at that moment, but also this incorporeal right in relation to these materials.\nIt is not necessary, I think, to go further back than the constitution of 1914 because, as we have seen, the mem\u00adbers of the Association at that time contracted with one another in the terms of the constitution and by-laws, and the Association proceeded from that time on to work under that constitution and those by-laws as amended from time to time; the power to amend being vested by the constitu\u00adtion in the members of the Association in general meeting acting by a two-thirds majority.\nNow, I think the only fair implication from the pro-visions of the constitution is that the legal title to the common property is vested in the members of the Asso\u00adciation for the time being. The fluctuating body for which the name was a description in fact was not a entity known to the law and not capable of legal ownership of such property. There is no express provision for a board of trustees; and although the shares of the Survey Bureau are held by trustees for the Association, we have no infor\u00admation who these trustees are or how they are appointed.\nThe phrases used are \"the property of the Association \"and\" the assets of the Association \" and I think the reasonable meaning of these phrases is that which I have indicated. The treasurer and the secretary who is not the treasurer, as well, perhaps, as the president and vice-president who are authorized to sign cheques with one of the secretaries have, no doubt, a special property in the funds of the Association and that may be so also with regard to the executive committee which possesses almost unlimited powers of administration. But the general property of the common assets is, I think, in the members for the time being, subject, of course, to the provisions of the contract under which they are associated together.\nPrimarily, the incorporeal right we are considering is the right of the author and, while I do not suppose a cor\u00adporation could be an author in the sense of the rule, still these incorporated companies, who were the members of the Association during the period with which we are con\u00adcerned, could acquire title to the incorporeal right by assignment from the author and I think also through the authorship of an agent or servant or of an independent contractor, employed to produce a work in respect of which, in ordinary circumstances, the author would be invested with the right.\nIt is clearly settled now, by the authority of In re Dickens[4] that the author, in transferring the property in his manuscript, does not thereby necessarily assign the incorporeal right.\nBut I think, having regard to the considerations just mentioned, it is a legitimate inference that it was well understood by everybody that this rating material was produced for the exclusive use of the members of the Association and, consequently, that in the members of the Association vested the sole and exclusive right of multi-plying copies. The evidence does not disclose the practice of the Association in respect of the terms under which the persons, inspectors and others, were employed for the pro\u00adduction of these materials. Under the constitution I have no doubt it was competent to the executive committee, if not to the secretaries, to authorize the employment of persons for such purposes under a contract which would be a contract of service between the members of the Association for the time being and an employee, or a contract of agency, or a contract under which the employee would be an independent contractor. Whether the execu\u00adtive committee could pledge the personal credit of the members of the Association is really immaterial. In practice such a question could hardly arise and, at all events, it is of no importance here.\nThese materials were produced and the cost of their production was paid for out of the common fund and whether the persons, who, if they had produced them for themselves, would have been the authors, were employees under a contract of service with the members for the time being, or agents under a contract of agency for the mem\u00adbers for the time being, or engaged as independent con-tractors under a contract with the members for the time being, or whether the practice of the Association was to contract through one or more of its permanent officials, the treasurer for example, in such a manner as not to give rise to contractual relations with the members themselves, is really of no importance because, whatever was done, was done for the members and paid for with their money.\nThe materials themselves when produced and in the possession of their officers were in the possession of the members and any rights acquired by any permanent official as the result of work done under contracts with third persons, the fruits of such contracts, would be acquired for the members and would be the rights of the members. I think this results from an application of the reasoning of Maule J. in Sweet v. Benning[5] in his judgment at page 484 and arguendo at pp. 468 and 475, as well as from the reasoning of Lord Halsbury in Lawrence v. Aflalo[6] and the judgment of Bowen L.J. in Lamb v. Evans[7]. The immediate question under consideration in these cases was the application of section 18 of the Copyright Act of 1842, but the reasoning seems to me to be applicable to the common law right.\nMr. McGillivray, in his book published in 1902, on the Law of Copyright, at pp. 73 and 74, expresses the opinion where the author was a servant or agent the property in the work, as well as the copyright in it, under the statute of 1842, would vest in the employer ab initio independ\u00adently of section 18 of that statute; and, in the case of an independent contractor, independently of the statute also, the copyright would not vest ab initio in the contractor but would pass to the employer upon the delivery of the work with the intention of conveying the right. I have no doubt that the delivery of completed materials by an independent contractor to an official of the Association for the Association as such or the completion of the work by a servant or agent and delivery into the custody of the proper official of the Association with the intention, express or implied from the circumstances, of transferring the common law incorporeal right, would have the effect of vesting this in the members. The official acquiring the incorporeal right could only hold it as agent and if there were a trust, he would be a bare trustee for the members of the Association for the time being. The entire bene\u00adficial property in the incorporeal right would, I think, in respect of such right, come within the schedule of section 42 under the statute of 1921.\nThis discussion will, probably, appear to be superfluous; but in my view it has a direct bearing upon a question that is one of the cardinal questions on the appeal to which we shall come to presently. Before leaving the subject, how ever, I think it is convenient at this point to make this observation. We have, as I have said, no evidence as to-the actual practice pursued in respect of contracts with the persons employed by the Association for the prepara\u00adtion .of these materials. Now, it is a fact that must be taken into account in endeavouring to consider these ques\u00adtions in a practical way that this Association was a body of fluctuating membership which could not, as such, be- a party to a contract of service or any other contract. Between 1914 and 1924, from seventy to eighty companies were added to the membership of the Association. The membership was more than doubled. It was, no doubt, open under the constitution, as already observed, to the executive committee to authorize the officials of the Asso\u00adciation to enter into contracts with third persons to which the members of the Association for the time being would be contracting parties. This principle would be attended by the inconvenient necessity of having in the case of employees an assent to a change of parties whenever a change in membership of the Association took place. I do not think we are entitled to speculate upon the subject and I do not think on the evidence before us we can justly infer that this course was pursued in respect of contracts of employment, but, for the reasons just given, I think, as regards these incorporeal rights existing when the statute of 1921 came into force that is of no importance.\nSuch was the position when the statute of 1921 came into force on the 1st of January, 1924; the property in the rating material of the Association, as well as any incor\u00adporeal rights connected with it, were vested in the mem\u00adbers of the Association at that time. It follows, by force of section 42 and the schedule thereto, that these members of the Association acquired copyright in this material under the statute.\nAfter the Act came into force new rating material was produced by the Association and this material still remained unpublished. It was, I have no doubt, subject matter for copyright under the statute and one of the cardinal questions for determination is whether the plaintiffs, or some ,of them, acquired such copyright in this material in respect of the alleged infringement of which the action is brought.\nThe members of the Association are all incorporated companies and I am unable to convince myself that they or any one of them could be an author within the meaning of the Copyright Act. Any one or all of them, that is to say, all the members of the Association at any given time, could be the owner or joint owners of copyright, but they could acquire copyright, as far as I know, only in one of two ways,\u2011either by assignment by some person having a title to the copyright or by one of the ways mentioned in the proviso to section 12 which is in these words:\n12. Subject to the provisions of this Act, the author of a work shall be the first owner of the copyright therein Provided that\n(a) where, in the ease of an engraving, photograph, or portrait, the plate,or other original was ordered by some other person and was made for valuable consideration in pursuance of that order, then in the absence of any agreement to the .contrary, the person by whom such plate or other original was ordered shall be the first owner of the copyright; and\n(b) where the author was in the employment of some other person under a contract of service or apprenticeship and the work was made in the course of his employment by that person, the person by whom the author was employed shall, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, be the first owner of the copyright; but where the work is an article or other contribution to a newspaper, magazine, or similar periodical, there shall, in the ,absence of any agreement to the contrary, be deemed to be reserved to the author a right to restrain the publica\u00adtion of the work, otherwise than as part of a newspaper, magazine, or similar periodical.\nIt is argued that the present case comes within sub-section (b). The respondents must, in order to succeed upon that ground, show that the material in respect of which the question arises was made \" in the course of his employment \" by a person or persons \" under a contract of service or apprenticeship \" with the respondents or some of them.\nI have already in effect expressed my opinion upon this question. It has given me a good deal of concern but I do not think from the evidence before us I can infer that this material was produced by employees in the course of their employment under a contract of service with the members of the Association for the time being. As already observed, there is no evidence as to the practice in relation to the contracts under which the employees of the Asso\u00adciation were engaged or in relation to the terms of their engagement. It is not a mere abstract possibility, but -a practical possibility, that for convenience some form of arrangement was resorted to by which there was no direct contractual bond between the members of the Association and the employees, .or that in any case the work was done by persons who were independent contractors.\nI turn now to the point chiefly relied upon by counsel for the respondents in support of their claim to copyright in this material. It is based on section 20 (3) (The Copy-right Act, 1921, R.S.C. 1927, ch. 32, as amended by Stats. of Can. 1931, ch. 8) which is in these terms:\n(3) In an action for infringement of copyright in any work in which the defendant puts in issue ,either the existence of the copyright, or the title of the plaintiff thereto, then, in any such ease:\u2011\n(a) The work shall, unless the contrary is proved, be presumed to be a. work in which copyright subsists; and (b) The author of the work shall, unless the contrary is proved, be presumed to be the owner of the copyright;\nProvided that where any such question is at issue, and no grant of the copyright or of an interest in the copyright, either by assignment or licence, has been registered under this Act, then, in any such case:\u2011\n(i) if a name purporting to be that of the author of the work is printed or 'otherwise indicated thereon in the usual manner, the person whose name is so printed or indicated shall, unless the contrary is proved, be presumed to be the author of the work; (ii) if no name is so printed or indicated, or if the name so printed or indicated is not the author's true name, or the name by which he is commonly known, and a name purporting to be that of the publisher or proprietor of the work is printed or otherwise indicated thereon in the usual manner, the person whose name is so printed, or indicated shall, unless the contrary is proved, be presumed to be the owner of the copy-right in the work for the purpose of proceedings in respect of the infringement of copyright therein.\nThis subsection establishes, first, the presumption that copyright subsists in this material. As to clause b (1) that seems obviously inapplicable for the reason already indicated, namely, that all the members of the Associa\u00adtion being bodies corporate, none of them could be an author within the contemplation of the statute.\nI come now to 3 (b) (ii). I am unable to find as a fact that the conditions of this enactment are fulfilled. The action is brought by a number of incorporated com\u00adpanies, including the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, Ltd. The Canadian Fire Underwriters' Association is not a party to the action and could not be so under its group name. The Association is not a partnership. Its name is not a trade name. It designates sufficiently for practical business purposes a group of companies bound together by an agreement embodied in a constitution and by-laws, the identity of which changes from time to time. The name of the Association, if read as denoting the members of the group, would have one denotation at the time of the trial and, in fact, another at the date of the commencement of the action, another at the date when the material said to be the subject of copyright came into existence and the copyright also was constituted; another, perhaps, when the first alleged infringement occurred and, it may be, another and different one at the date of each successive infringement. In these circumstances I cannot find as a fact that the name Canadian Fire Underwriters' Association on these manuals, rate books and other rating material is a name which answers the description of the statute, namely, that\na name purporting to be that of the * * * proprietor .of the work is printed thereon in the usual manner.\nI now turn to the plans.\nIn October, 1917, the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, Ltd., was incorporated. The shares were held entirely in trust for the Association, that is to say, for the members for the time being of the Association. The directors were officers of the Association. On the 4th of December, 1917, an amendment of the constitution was adopted by the Executive Committee and duly passed which provided as follows:\nPlan Committee.\u2011This Committee shall have charge of all work in connection with the making or obtaining of plans, and shall have the control and direction of the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, Limited, and shall make all arrangements for supplying plans and revisions to Members and others, and for the prices to be charged for them, subject to the following general regulations:\u2011\nThe clause further provided that:\nAll copies of plans in Agents' hands shall remain the property of the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, Limited.\nBy the by-laws,\nall plans and revisions delivered to a member should be by way of loan only and be and remain the property of the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, Limited;\nand in the event of a member ceasing to be such, all such plans and revisions should be returned to the Under-writers' Survey Bureau, Ltd.\nCopies were put in evidence of receipts required from agents and of the labels pasted upon the plans which show that a plan is to be used solely for the business of the members of the Association and that it is to be returned to the Bureau on request. The receipt is in the following form:\nUnderwriters' Survey Bureau, Limited\nToronto and Montreal\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..19\nI hereby acknowledge having this day received from the Under-writers' Survey Bureau, Limited, copy of Plan of\nI bind myself to use same solely for the business of the Canadian Fire Underwriters' Association, Companies, and to return it to the Bureau on demand.\nSignature\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\nand the label reads as follows:\nInsurance Plan of\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\nUnderwriters' Survey Bureau, Limited and is loaned to\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.on the following conditions: That the Plan is to be kept in good order, that it is to be used only in connection with business of Companies, Members of the Canadian Fire Underwriters' Association, and to be returned on request to the\nUnderwriters' Survey Bureau, Limited,\nToronto and Montreal. Some nine plans in all had been made by officers of the Association, seven in 1917, between March and December, and two in the year 1911. The rest of them were all made by the Bureau.\nAlthough the Bureau was not incorporated until October, 1917, an office was opened in its name on the 1st of April, 1917, and some time later it opened an office in Montreal for the transaction of Quebec business. In the minutes of the first annual meeting of July, 1918, it is stated that new plans and revisions had been made and distributed to the Companies in certain places\nduring the fourteen months from the 1st of April, 1917, to the 31st of May, 1918, that the Bureau has been in operation.\nThe plans produced by the plan committee of the Association prior to the incorporation of the Bureau seem to have been treated as the property of the Bureau and this would appear to be in conformity with the provisions of the constitution and by-laws above mentioned by which all copies of plans in agents' hands were to remain the property of the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, Limited, and the provisions of the by-laws that all plans and revisions issued to a member should be by way of loan only and be and remain the property of the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, Ltd.\nIt seems probable that all the plans made by the Asso\u00adciation were delivered to the Bureau and delivered, more-over, with the intention that they should be the property of the Bureau, that is to say, the legal ownership should be vested in the Bureau. There can be no doubt, at all events, that after the incorporation of the Bureau, plans made by the employees of the Bureau became the prop\u00aderty of the Bureau and, I think, the only inference is that the exclusive right of reproduction and publication vested in the Bureau also. The Bureau was under the control and direction of the plan committee and the business of the Bureau was conducted by that department, but the form of the resolution of the Bureau, by which the management of its affairs was placed in the hands of the plan committee shows that the committee was acting as the agent of the Bureau and that, in engaging and dismissing and controlling employees, in entering into con-tracts for supplies and work, in renting premises and otherwise acting in the conduct of the business, the committee was to act on behalf of and in the name of the Bureau. That this was the practice appears from the evidence of Long and Brown.\nAs regards plans then produced by the Bureau down to and including the 31st of December, 1923, after its incor\u00adporation, the proper conclusion appears to be that the exclusive common law right of reproducing and publish\u00ading these plans was vested in the Bureau, an incorporated company. As regards the nine plans produced prior to the incorporation of the Bureau, if they were not the property of the Bureau they were the property of the members of the Association and the rights of the members of the Association as of the 31st of December, 1923, in respect of them would be the same as their rights in respect of the rating material. It follows that, by force of section 42 and the schedule thereto, of the statute of 1921, the Bureau or the members of the Association acquired copy-right in all these plans.\nIt does not appear to me to be strictly necessary to decide whether the Bureau was the agent of the members of the Association or held these plans and the rights in relation to them in trust for the members of the Asso\u00adciation, or was merely a corporate body under the control of the Association by virtue of the ownership of its shares and the composition of its governing body. But I think the proper conclusion is that the Bureau was the agent of the Association and governed by the constitution.\nWe are concerned also with two other classes of plans before we come to the plans made by the Bureau after the 1st of January, 1924: first, plans, the copyright in which was registered in the name of Charles Edward Goad, who died in 1910; and, second, plans, the copyright in which was registered in the name of the Charles E. Goad Com\u00adpany. The respondents claim title to these plans under assignment by the Toronto General Trusts Corporation, Executors and Trustees of the will of Charles Edward Goad, through the members of the firm Charles E. Goad Company, ,and under a further assignment of March 3rd, 1931, from the Charles E. Goad Company to the Under-writers' Survey Bureau, Ltd. I think the transfer from the Toronto General Trusts Corporation to the persons who became members of the firm Charles E. Goad Com\u00adpany, which was a transfer of the business of Charles Edward Goad as a going concern, and a list of assets including (inter alia) good will and advances made to sur\u00adveyors, by necessary implication had the effect of vesting in the transferees the title to the copyrights which had been acquired by Charles Edward Goad. The construction contended for on behalf of the appellants would really defeat the transaction as contemplated by all parties. The document may properly be construed with reference to the known circumstances in which it was made. In any case, a three-eighths interest in the plans was vested in the transferees under the will and passed to the Bureau by the transfer of 1931.\nCertificates of registration have been produced for these plans which, under sections 36 (2) and 37 (6), constitute prima facie evidence that copyright subsists in the work and that the persons registered were the owners of such copyright. This prima facie case has not been met.\nThe property in all plans belonging to the Goads in possession of agents of the Association passed to the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, Ltd., for the consideration of $22,000 as the result of an agreement of the 21st of September, 1917. An agreement was made on December 27th, 1917, between the Charles E. Goad Company and the Survey Bureau that, for a certain price, when the Association or the Bureau\ndesires to revise one of Goad's plans' he plans or sheets needed are to be placed at the disposal of the Association or the Bureau and to be used as required in the preparation of the revision\nand the right to revise copies in possession of the Associa\u00adtion or member Companies, or their agents, was admitted.\nA large number of the Goad plans were completely reprinted by the Survey Bureau; some prior to the assignment of the Goad copyrights in March, 1931, and some subsequent to that. There were also complete revisions by the Bureau of other plans of which, however, all the sheets were not necessarily reprinted.\nI do not think it is doubtful that the intention of the members of the Association and of the Bureau and the plan committee was that the legal property in all the plans and revisions produced after the incorporation of the Bureau, and revisions of these plans acquired from the Goads, should vest in the Bureau although no formal, explicit agreement to that effect is proved. The members of the Association conceived that the plan department of the Association was being incorporated. The business of the plan department was to be conducted by the plan committee but, as already observed, as agents for the incor\u00adporated Bureau. I see no reason why, as respects any of the revisions of Goad plans made prior to the 1st of January, 1924, for the Bureau, the exclusive right of repro\u00adduction should not be considered to be vested in the Bureau. And this, I think, would apply equally to com\u00adplete reprints and to revisions effectuated by stickers where the sheet was not reprinted. These revisions were made for the exclusive use of the members of the Associa\u00adtion and their agents and they had the authority of the Goad Company for making use of their original sheets for such purposes. Of the revisions, whether expressed in a complete reprint or by stickers, the salaried employees of the Bureau were the authors; and I can see no reason why, on the principles above explained, they had not the right to prevent anybody else publishing them or making copies of them, including the Goad Company.\nOn the 1st of January, 1924, then, the Bureau were the legal holders of the incorporeal, exclusive right of repro\u00adduction in all plans made by themselves as well as in the revisions of the Goad plans made by their salaried employees.\nWe 'arrive now at the important question which con\u00adcerns the revisions of these plans after that date and the new plans made by the Bureau after that date.\nFirst, as to the new plans. The method of plan making is explained by Mr. Long in his evidence very fully and, I think, it results from the. evidence that all plans and revisions were made by the salaried employees of the-Bureau, subject, of course, to instructions received from the plan committee (acting as agents and in the name of the Bureau) or emanating from a general meeting of the Association, or from the executive committee. These plans, of course, were only a part of the machinery for arriving at rates and were essential in the process of rate making. The plans constituted an essential part of the process, apparently, in every case except those cases in which the principle .of \"minimum\" rates was applied. They were intended, as everybody understood, for the sole and exclusive use of the members of the Association and their agents acting in the course of their duties as such agents. They were really confidential documents in the sense that the information contained in them was not to be disclosed to rival insurance companies, or employed in the business of such companies. The information given by a plan, besides the general setting of streets and general conditions such as information with regard to hydrants and water supply generally, public buildings and so on, and dimensions of areas and buildings, is conveyed by symbols the meaning of which is given in every case in a key plan.\nThe foundation of the plan is a field sheet made by the surveyor in the field, which is uncoloured. The office staff, comprising surveyors, draughtsmen, colourists, by the use of the surveyor's field notes complete the plan, inserting such additional symbols as do not appear in the surveyor's field sheet. But the whole process from begin\u00adning to end differs very little to-day from the method perfected by Mr. Long when he became in March, 1917, the Manager of the Association's plan department. There can be no doubt that the plan committee, subject to direc\u00adtions by a general meeting of the members, or the execu\u00adtive committee, had full authority, acting as agents for and in the name of the Bureau, to prescribe the manner in which this work was to be carried on. The persons concerned in the actual production of a plan could not in the ordinary course be fairly described as independent contractors and there is, I think, sufficient evidence to support the inference that they were persons performing services under contracts of service. And that is, I think, the proper inference. (Massine v. de Basil[8]; Ware v. Anglo-Italian Commercial Agency[9]; Drabble v. Hycolite[10]).\nThen, as to the revisions of the Goad plans, the salaried servants of the Bureau were the authors of these revisions, and, as the work produced constituted in each case a new work, I do not know why they are not proper subjects for copyright, or why such copyright did not vest in the Bureau.\nAs regards the nine plans produced by the plan department of the Association before the incorporation of the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, Ltd., in October, 1917, copy-right in these plans would appear to have vested in the members of the Association at the date when the Act of 1921 came into force. This point would appear to be governed by the considerations above mentioned as affect\u00ading the rating material produced by the Association before the Act came into force.\nTo sum up\u2011\nThe rating material, using the words in the sense indi\u00adcated above as excluding the plans, was the property of the members of the Association at the date when the statute of 1921 came into force on the 1st of January, 1924. These members were the owners, not only of the material itself, but of the common law, incorporeal, exclusive right of reproduction and became, by force of the statute (sec\u00adtion 42 and the schedule), the owners of copyright in that material. As to such material produced after the statute came into force, the respondents have not adduced sufficient evidence to establish a title to copyright in it.\nAs regards plans.-The first group of plans with which we are concerned consists of plans copyrighted by Charles Edward Goad in his life time. These copyrights passed to the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, Limited, by the transfer, first, from the Trustees and Executors of Charles Edward Goad to the sons of Charles Edward Goad, who afterwards carried on his business as partners under the firm name of Charles E. Goad Company, by a transfer dated the 21st of September, 1911, and by a transfer from the partners in the Charles E. Goad Company to the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, Ltd., dated the 3rd of March, 1931;\nSecond, the plans copyrighted by the Charles E. Goad Company. These copyrights passed from the Charles E. Goad Company to the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, Ltd., by the last-mentioned assignment;\nThird, the nine plans made by the plan department of the Canadian Fire Underwriters' Association in 1911 and 1917. With respect to these copyright was vested, by force of the Act of 1921, s. 42, in the members of the Asso\u00adciation at the date when the Act came into force, thE 1st of January, 1924.\nFourth, revisions of the Goad plans (plans of Charles Edward Goad and Charles E. Goad Company) effected by the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, Ltd. The copyright in the original plans passed under the agreements above mentioned to the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, Ltd., and the copyright in the revisions vested in the Bureau in virtue of the fact that these revisions were executed by the salaried employees of the Bureau in exercise of their functions as such;\nFifth, as to plans and revisions of plans made by the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, Ltd., after the statute of 1921 came into force on the 1st of January, 1924. These plans having been made by the salaried employees of the Bureau the title vested in the Bureau in virtue of section 12 (b);\nSixth, as regards the copyright in the plans produced by the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, Ltd., including the revisions of the Goad plans, although the question is doubtful, I have come to the conclusion that section 20 (3) (b) (ii) applies. Prima facie the legend \" Made in Canada by the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, Ltd.,\" I am disposed to think, implies proprietorship and this legend is found on these plans. The prima facie case has not been met.\nIn this view of the case, the point that attracted con\u00adsiderable attention on the argument as to the rights of part owners .can be briefly disposed of. The point has no application to the plans except the nine plans made by the Association before the incorporation of the Bureau. As regards the copyright in these plans, and in the rating material, owned by the members of the Association on the 1st of January, 1924, the copyright vested in these mem\u00adbers when the Act came into force.\nIf any companies which were members on that date were not plaintiffs in the action because they are no longer members, there is no evidence to show that such com\u00adpanies are still in existence. Their right, in respect of the copyrights, if any, would be a bare legal right because, by the terms of the constitution, they released all their rights and claims in the common property on ceasing to be members.\nAs to the personal chattels, the rating material itself and the plans, they abandoned possession of them on ceasing to be members and from this abandonment of possession, and the terms of the, constitution which embodied their contract with the continuing members, it resulted, I think, that they never acquired either posses\u00adsion or right to possession in any of the personal chattels that became part of the common property of the members of the Association after their withdrawal.\nAs to the copyrights, the agreement embodied in the constitution was executed by them before the copyrights came into existence and I assume, therefore, that even after withdrawal they retained a bare legal title to some interest in the copyrights but I do not think that applies to personal chattels, even such , personal chattels as the infringing copies. A company ceasing to be a member could, I think, thereafter have no joint or several right to possession in any of the common property and, therefore, would not be a proper party to an action in trover or detinue in respect of such property. Further, I cannot accept the proposition that one joint owner, or owner in common, of personal chattels is not entitled to maintain trover or detinue against a mere wrongdoer.\nIt is not, of course, disputed that the plaintiffs are entitled to protect their rights by suing for an injunction and for damages. (Lauri v. Renad[11]; Cescinsky v. Routledge[12]. As to their rights in respect of the infring\u00ading copies, attention may be called to Dent v. Turpin[13] in which it was held that one of several companies of a name used as a trade mark may, on infringement, sue alone for an injunction or delivery up of articles bearing the pirated trade mark, or for an account of the profits made by the infringers, and for payment of such part of the profits as the plaintiff may be entitled to.\nThere is a further point as regards the nine plans pro\u00adduced by the Association. All- these plans were under the control of the plan committee. The reasonable inference from the facts appears to be that the plan committee treated them as in the same category as plans produced by the Bureau; the property of the Bureau to be lent to the agents of members and to be returned on the retirement of a member. They bear the legend above mentioned. I am disposed to think it to be a legitimate inference that these plans, with the consent of the plan committee repre\u00adsenting the members of the Association, became the property of the Underwriters' Survey Bureau, Ltd., together with the incorporeal right of reproduction, and that when the Act of 1921 came into force the Bureau was invested with the copyright in these plans.\nThere remains the question of the Statute of Limitations. The point which has concerned me most as to this feature of the appeal is whether, in view of the fact that the rights the respondents seek to enforce are the creature of the statute, you can go beyond the statute for the purpose of ascertaining the statutory limitation.\nI have come to the conclusion, however, that the prin\u00adciple applied in Bulli Coal Mining Co. v. Osborne[14] cannot be limited to underground trespasses, that it covers this case and that there was ample evidence in support of the conclusion of the learned trial judge that there had been fraudulent concealment within the meaning of the rule; with the consequence that the limitation period began to run only on the discovery of the fraud, or at the time when, with reasonable diligence, it would have been discovered.\nI think the conclusion of the learned trial judge nega\u00adtiving the existence in fact of a criminal conspiracy is right and I think it unnecessary to discuss the subject further except to say this: If the plaintiffs in an action for the infringement of copyright are obliged, for the purpose of establishing the existence of, and their title to, the copyright to rely upon an agreement, and that agreement constitutes a criminal conspiracy, and their title rests upon such agreement and upon acts which are criminal acts by reason of their connection with such an agreement, then I have on general principles great diffi\u00adculty in understanding how such an action could succeed. In what I have said, I have not adverted to some points raised by Mr. Tilley and Mr. Biggar which should be noticed. The first is the contention that the authorship of the work cannot in the case either of the plans or of the rating materials be ascertained. It is clear from section 20 (3) of the Act that the statute does not contemplate disclosure of authorship as a necessary condition of success. in an action for infringement.\nThen in the case of unpublished works (where the proprietor is shewn to have acquired a common law right prior to the statute of 1921 by evidence establishing facts requiring an inference that the work was done for the plaintiff and that the intention of all parties concerned in the production of the work was that the common law right should vest in him) the statute plainly contemplates the protection of that right; and the only possible protection is the recognition of the substituted copyright given by the statute. It appears to me to be merely a matter of evidence: the ownership of the common law right must rest upon established facts and these facts can be proved by inference as well as by direct evidence.\nAs to the duration of the copyright when that comes in question, if the owner of it cannot identify the author, the duration of it must be restricted to the period of fifty years from the date when the copyright or common law right, as the case may be, came into existence.\nAs to the point of res judicata, I can perceive no reason for disagreeing with the decision of the Court of Appeal in Ash v. Hutchison[15] which, it is quite freely conceded, is conclusive if rightly decided.\nThere is a further point, in respect of the presumption under section 20 (3). Mr. Mann argued that the name of the Association on the rating material should be regarded as the name of the publisher. I am afraid the considerations already explained are conclusive against him on this. point. Publishers in the copyright sense they could not be because the respondents' case in effect involves the proposition that the material was in that sense unpublished. In any other sense the word would seem to imply proprietorship.\nIn the result, the appeal is allowed in respect of the rating material brought into existence after the 1st of January, 1924, and in other respects dismissed. The appellants should have two-fifths of the costs of the appeal. The respondents should have the general costs of the action and the appellants the costs exclusively attributable to the issue on which they have succeeded.\nAppeal allowed in part and in other respects dismissed, appellant to have two-fifths of costs of appeal.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cassels, Brock & Kelley.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Mann, Lafleur & Brown.\n[ScanLII Collection]\n[1] Reporter's note.-Petition for special leave to appeal to the Privy Council dismissed with costs on March 15th, 1940.\n[2] [1938] Ex.

Sask., 1930, c. 75, by the appellant, widow of one John S. Danley, acting as executrix of his estate. Danley, an experienced railway trainman in the employ of the respondent company, was killed while engaged in his work of coupling and uncoupling of cars during switching operations on the night of October 8th, 1937. On that night, he was seen to approach the point where two cars were about to be coupled; and, a very short time later, his dead body was discovered badly crushed partly beneath one of the cars. There was no eye-witness of the accident, and therefore no direct evidence as to what the deceased actually did at the very moment he met his death or as to exactly how the accident happened; but counsel for both the appellant and the defendant exposed to the jury their respective theory as to the cause of the accident, according to the evidence. There was no exception taken to the charge to the jury by the trial judge. The jury found in favour of the appellant and awarded her $8,000 damages, bringing a verdict that Danley came to his death through the negligence of the respondent. The appellate court, setting aside the verdict, dismissed the appellant's action. The majority of the court, for the purpose of their determination of the appeal, assumed but did not hold that there was negligence on the part of the respondent company, Gordon J. being of opinion that there was no evidence of negligence; but the appellate court unanimously held that on the evidence the way in which Danley met his death was a matter of pure conjecture or speculation. On appeal to this Court,\nHeld, Rinfret and Kerwin JJ. dissenting, that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nPer Davis J.\u2014A reasonable view, consistent with the appellant's right to recover, could be taken by the jury on the evidence; and their verdict, a verdict which reasonable men acting judicially could arrive at, ought not to have been disturbed. As Viscount Dunedin said in Simpson v. L.M. & S. Ry. Co. ([1931] A.C. 351, at 364), \"the \"question will always be whether the proved facts will reasonably \"support the conclusion which has rested upon them.\"\nPer Hudson J.\u2014There was evidence before the jury upon which they could reasonably have arrived at the conclusion that there was negligence on the part of the respondent. Per Rinfret and Kerwin JJ. dissenting.\u2014Assuming negligence of the respondent and assuming Danley did not know that a coupling apparatus was in a defective condition, there was not evidence from which it might be reasonably inferred that the death of Danley was caused by such negligence of respondent. Upon the evidence the jury had before them, they could do no more than guess at the cause of the accident.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Maclean J. with a jury, and dismissing the appellant's action.\nW. G. Currie K.C. and S. R. Broadfoot K.C. for the appellant.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and H. A. V. Green K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice\u2014I should allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge with costs throughout.\nDavis J.\u2014This is a Fatal Accidents action from the province of Saskatchewan. The appellant's husband Danley was a railway trainman in the employ of the respondent company and about midnight on October 8th, 1937, was found dead, with his body badly crushed, in the respondent's railway yards in the town of Lanigan, Saskatchewan. A moment or two before his body was found he was engaged in the ordinary course of his employment in switching operations of the railway in the said yard. A train had come in with some forty freight cars; many of them were to be left in the yards in Lanigan and other cars taken out. A new train was being made up; the crew consisted of a locomotive engineer, a fireman, a conductor and two brakemen. Danley's duties required him to operate the switches and make the necessary moves for coupling up the different cars. In making up a train the practice appears to be to have the long haul cars at the back of the train and the short haul cars at the front. Switching operations had proceeded at Lanigan for about an hour and a half when the accident happened. At that time the engine had started pushing the tender, the water car, a long haul car and, what is for convenience called, car 65, in that order. When a little speed had been acquired it was intended that the pin between the last named two cars should be pulled. The engine and tender and cars attached to it would then stop and car 65 would go down on what was known as track 4. When this operation was being performed, Underwood, the rear-end brakeman, attempted to disconnect the cars by using the uncoupling lever. He found the lever on car 65 was disconnected. He signalled the engineer to stop, which the engineer did. Underwood asked Danley to give signals to the conductor, which resulted in car 65 being thrown down on track 4 and the long haul cars which were ahead of car 65 were put on track 1. The locomotive, tender and water car were now detached from all the other cars. The locomotive was facing east. The water car was the most westerly of the three units.\nIt was now desired to connect the west end of the water car to the east end of car 65. The engine, pushing the tender and water car, backed up slowly. Danley's job was to make the connection. He was walking west on the south side of the water car and about opposite to its west end. He had his lantern in his right hand and was giving a slow back-up signal. The engineer was taking the signals from Danley. Just before the cars (that is, the water car and car 65) actually came together, Danley, who was still walking just at the west end of the water car, gave a signal for a still slower movement. Then the light of his lantern disappeared. The engineer said it just disappeared \"quietly and naturally as if it was carried out of sight.\" The cars had come together, the lantern disappeared, and the brakes were applied at about the same moment. The engine stopped. The connection did not make\u2014the engine moved westerly approximately eight feet after the water car struck car 65; car 65 moved westerly about twelve feet. The conductor was at that time standing opposite the back of the tender. Danley had passed him only a few seconds before while walking beside the car giving the slow backup signals. The engineer not seeing Danley or the light of his lantern after the engine stopped, asked the conductor where Danley was and said that he would not make any further move until he knew where the man was from whom he had been taking the signals. No shout or scream had been heard by either the engineer or the conductor. The conductor looked and saw Danley's body lying under and about the centre of the water car., He was lying on his face, dead. His body was badly crushed from the left shoulder down to the belt region of his body. His left arm was practically severed below the elbow; the spine was completely severed in one place; all the ribs on the left side below the third rib were fractured; and the chest completely collapsed. The very severe crushing was such as to show that the body had been subjected to a great deal of force or pressure. Dr. Hindson, who made an autopsy, said he could state definitely that Danley was never caught between the couplings of the two cars. The lantern was found on the ground, still lighted under the water car near the body.\nThere was no direct evidence as to what the deceased actually did at the very moment he met his death or as to exactly how the tragic accident happened. The appellant's theory of the accident, as it was put on the evidence to the jury, was that Danley was attempting in the ordinary course of his employment to operate the lever to effect a coupling, not being aware of the fact (as Underwood, the rear brakeman, was) that the lever was not working; that with his lantern in his right hand, he had reached for the lever with his left hand, and as the cars came together, had pulled forward with his left hand on the lever; that had the lever been in working condition considerable resistance would have been met with, which Danley would anticipate and would therefore pull heavily on the lever to operate the mechanism; that the lever coming suddenly up without any resistance, Danley's left hand would slip from the lever and the weight he had intended to throw on the lever to operate the mechanism would cause him to lose his balance and fall in the direction in which he was pulling, which would be toward the trucks of the advancing water car; that his right hand being occupied with the lantern, it would be natural for him to thrust out his left hand to break his fall; that such a fall would place him on his face on the track beside the advancing car; with his left arm caught, the over-hanging of the arch bars would crush him down against the ties; and as the car drifted forward would push his body out at right angles to the tracks, and as the trucks advanced and stopped, would leave the body exactly where it was found. The respondent sought to meet the case made against it by saying that there was no evidence to reasonably support it and the respondent advanced a theory of its own that the deceased went between the cars when in motion for the purpose of operating the lever, a thing he knew was prohibited by his employer, and, alternatively, that if the deceased did fall in operating the lever as alleged, he had been warned by Underwood that the lever was not working and that it was therefore negligence in himself to attempt to pull it at the time in question.\nBy sec. 298, ss. 1 (c) of the Railway Act, R.S.C., 1927, ch. 170, it is provided as follows:\n298. Every railway company shall provide and cause to be used on all trains modern and efficient apparatus, appliances and means\u2014\n(c) to securely couple and connect the cars composing the train, and to attach the engine to such train, with couplers which couple automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going in between the ends of the cars.\nThere was a good deal of evidence directed to the nature and extent, or lack, of inspection of the coupling lever by the respondent prior to the time Underwood discovered its defective condition. That was a question of fact on the evidence for the jury. It was open to the jury, as the trial judge told them, to find the inspection was not an efficient and proper inspection. The construction of the statutory provision by the trial judge\u2014that \"the defendant employer is bound in law to furnish to his employee reasonably safe equipment with which to work\"\u2014was not objected to at the trial and the respondent ought not now to be entitled to put a different construction upon it.\nThere is really no dispute about the fact that Underwood, the rear brakeman, knew that the lever was not working. The common law doctrine of common employment does not exist in Saskatchewan. But Underwood said at the trial that he had told Danley five minutes before the accident occurred that the lever on the particular car was not working. Asked if Danley could hear what he had said, his answer was \"I could not say. He never said anything about it.\" The jury obviously disbelieved Underwood's statement that he had told Danley. It is hardly reasonable to assume that Danley would have proceeded in the ordinary course to attempt to couple the cars if he had been warned that the coupling was defective. It is, of course, possible that he would have done so, but, on the other hand, it is more probable that he would not. Counsel for the respondent several times during the argument repeated the phrase \"a man who knows that a lever is not working.\" But the jury plainly did not believe that Danley had been told.\nAll these matters were questions of fact for the jury. The jury found in favour of the appellant and awarded her $8,000 damages. The questions and answers were as follows:\n1. Did John Steelman Danley, while in the employ of the defendant company as a trainman come to his death on the 8th day of October, 1937, through the negligence of the defendant?\nAns.\u2014Yes.\n2. If your answer to no. 1 is in the affirmative, state particulars of that negligence and in what did that negligence consist?\nAns\u2014The defendant company failed to provide the deceased with safe and proper equipment and that the rear end brakeman when on duty and acting for the defendant company upon noticing the. detective coupling did not inform the deceased that a certain box car number C.P. 212665 had the defective coupling and thereby did not exercise the utmost precaution to avoid injury to his fellow workman.\n3. Was there contributory negligence on the part of the late John Steelman Danley, and if so in what did such contributory negligence consist?\nAns.\u2014No.\n4. If your answer to no. 1 is in the affirmative and your answer to no. 3 in the negative, what damages do you allow?\nAns.\u2014$8,000. Eight thousand dollars.\nOn this verdict the trial judge directed judgment to be entered for the appellant.\nThe use by the jury of the words \"utmost precaution\" in their answer to question no. 2 no doubt arose out of their reading of exhibit D. 3\u2014the instructions from the general manager of the company to all employees, dated February 1st, 1930 (put in by the respondent), no. 2 of which instructions reading\nEvery employee is required to exercise the utmost caution to avoid injury to himself or his fellows, and especially in switching or other movements of trains.\nUpon an appeal by the present respondent to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan the verdict was set aside and the action dismissed with costs. Three of the learned judges of that Court did not examine the question of negligence on the part of the company but for the purpose of their determination of the appeal assumed that there was negligence. Gordon, J.A., alone examined the evidence as to negligence and came to the conclusion that it was not open to the jury upon the facts to say that the deceased came to his death due to any negligence of the respondent. All four judges who heard the appeal took the view that there was no evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that the defendant's negligence was the cause of Danley's death. In their view it was pure speculation to conclude that Danley fell and was crushed because he had lost his balance when pulling the defective lever; that any such theory was not only highly improbable but lay in the region of mere conjecture.\nThe appellant appealed to this Court, asking us to restore the judgment at the trial upon the jury's verdict.\nAfter a careful reading of the evidence and the charge to the jury of Mr. Justice Maclean, the learned trial judge (to which charge no objection was taken) and the jury's answers to the several questions submitted to them (with which answers the trial judge expressed no dissatisfaction), I put to myself the question put by Lord Herschel in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Peart v. Grand Trunk Railway Company[1]:\n* * * the question is, is there ground for saying that in this case there was no evidence upon which the jury could properly have so found; or rather is the evidence such, or so scanty, that the jury ought not to have so found, and that the verdict ought at least to be set aside on the ground that it was against the weight of evidence.\nI am satisfied that a reasonable view consistent with the appellant's right to recover could be taken by the jury on the evidence and that the verdict ought not to have been disturbed. As Viscount Dunedin said in the House of Lords in Simpson v. L.M. & S. Ry. Co.[2] (repeating what he had said in Mackinnon v. Miller[3]):\n* * * each case must be dealt with and decided on its own circumstances, and inferences may be drawn from circumstances just as much as results may be arrived at from direct testimony.\nAnd again at p. 364:\nThe question will always be whether the proved facts will reasonably support the conclusion which has rested upon them.\nThe case before us was tried with a jury and it is not for an appellate court to treat the case as one for a fresh decision even though the jury's verdict may not commend itself to the judgment of the Court. This consideration, as Lord Tomlin said in the Simpson case[4], at p. 367, dealing with the conclusion of the arbitrator, \"necessarily determines the angle of approach to the problem.\"\nIt is neither our duty nor our right, in this appeal to draw any inference\u2014that was for the tribunal of fact, the jury in this case. \"Our duty,\" as Lord Shaw said in Kerr or Lendrum, v. Ayr Steam Shipping Co. Ltd.[5].\nis a very different, a strikingly different, one. It is to consider whether the arbitrator appointed to be the judge of the facts, and having the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses, has come to a conclusion, which conclusion could not have been reached by a reasonable man.\nI am far from saying that the verdict of the jury in this case does not commend itself to me; I think I should have arrived at the same conclusion. But that is not the point. To set aside the verdict an appellate court must be satisfied that it was a verdict which reasonable men acting judicially could not arrive at.\nIt is hardly necessary for me to say that I have not overlooked a careful consideration of such authorities as McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Company[6], Richard Evans & Co. Ltd. v. Astley[7], Grand Trunk Railway v. Griffith[8], Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Pyne[9] and Jones v. Great Western Railway Co.[10].\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial with costs throughout.\nHudson J.\u2014Danley, the deceased, was an experienced railway trainman in the employ of the defendant company and came to his death while engaged in his work for the company, towards midnight on October 8, 1937. It was the duty of Danley to attend to the coupling and uncoupling of cars during switching operations. On the night in question he was seen to approach, if not arrive at, the point where two cars were about to be coupled. A very short time later his dead body was discovered badly crushed partly beneath one of the cars. No one witnessed the intervening events and what happened can be inferred only from the surrounding circumstances. It appears that the knuckles of the couplings on the two cars were closed and the cars could not be coupled by merely coming in contact. By law the railway company is obliged to provide a lever to open couplings in such an event. There was a lever on the car in question but it had become disconnected from the coupling.\nThe explanation advanced by the plaintiff in the case for Danley's death was that when he pulled the lever, it being disconnected, he lost his balance and fell on the track toward and alongside the approaching water-car and was caught and crushed to death thereunder.\nThe defendant's contention was that Danley, in violation of his instructions and consequently of his duty, went in between the cars in order to adjust the couplings with his hands and that he was caught between the couplings and crushed.\nEvidence was given to show the movement of the cars, the position and condition of the body when found, the description of the cars and of the equipment, particularly of the lever and coupling mechanism and other similar matters. Apparently the jury were not fully satisfied with the evidence given by the witnesses and asked permission to take a view of the cars in question or similar cars with similar equipment. This was arranged and two cars of the defendant with similar equipment were placed on a track and made available for inspection and were inspected by the jury and counsel for the two parties.\nNo exception is taken to the charge to the jury by the learned trial judge. In dealing with the question of negligence of the defendant, he adverted to the fact that the jury had had the advantage of making a personal inspection of the lever. He also said:\nIf you come to the conclusion on reasonable inferences that Danley did go in there in violation of that rule, even to further his work and help things along, then he was doing something which he was absolutely forbidden to do and he is not entitled to any compensation for doing that. That in itself is contributory negligence on his part and no matter what amount of sympathy or sentiment you may have it is absolutely forbidden and the plaintiff is not entitled to damages if you find that is the way he received his injury. Now is that the way he came to his death? You have heard the doctor describe where the injuries started, at a point up on the left shoulder, then the ribs beginning to be pressed in and so on down to the belt line. You have the evidence as to his height. You have the evidence he was holding a lantern in his right hand, that he was leaving his left hand free to work. You have the position where he was found with his head on one rail, one arm nearly off. It is a question for you gentlemen. Can you account for that position and those injuries by coming between those couplings? If you find he went in to these couplings, and he was an experienced trainman, then he violated the rules of the company and is not entitled to damages. If on the other hand you come by reasonable deduction to the conclusion that he did not have proper information, did not understand or hear, did not have definite enough information from Underwood, went along, reached for the lever, that it moved more freely than he expected and as a result of the freer movement he was thrown, stumbled or got into or under the car, got his injuries that way, then there was no contributory negligence on his part. It is a matter for you, gentlemen, as I have said. There is no little evidence, there has to be a certain amount, not guess work but reasoning from undisputed facts and reasoning in such a way that you are satisfied as to the reasonable probabilities.\nThe jury brought in a verdict holding that Danley came to his death through the negligence of the defendant, such negligence consisting in that:\nThe defendant company failed to provide the deceased with safe and proper equipment and that the rear end brakeman when on duty and acting for the defendant company upon noticing the defective coupling did not inform the deceased that a certain box car number C.P. 212665 had the defective coupling and thereby did not exercise the utmost precaution to avoid injury to his fellow workman;\nand that there was no contributory negligence on the part of Danley.\nFrom this verdict the defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan and in that court the verdict was set aside and judgment entered for the defendant, dismissing the plaintiff's action. The majority of the court assumed but did not hold that there was negligence on the part of the defendant company, but held that on the evidence the way in which Danley met his death was a matter of pure conjecture. Mr. Justice Gordon agreed with the majority on the last point and further held that there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant.\nIn my opinion, on the authorities, the question to be answered by the appellate court is this: Was there no evidence before the jury upon which such jury acting reasonably could infer that Danley probably came to his death in the way suggested by the plaintiff?\nThe line between mere conjecture and reasonable inference in this case is particularly difficult to draw. The evidence of the witnesses as appearing on the record in regard to the circumstances surrounding the accident was, in the opinion of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal, insufficient to say more than that what happened must necessarily be a matter of pure conjecture. The jury after proper instructions by the trial judge took a different view. Their personal inspection of the cars and equipment probably added to their knowledge and certainly did add to their appreciation of the oral evidence. Their visit to these cars might well have changed what theretofore seemed \"possible\" to what appeared \"probable.\"\nWe in this Court have not had the advantages of the jury and I do not feel justified in holding that there was no evidence before the jury upon which they could reasonably have arrived at the conclusion which they did. The jury found negligence on the part of the defendants and I think there was evidence to support that finding. I would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Kerwin JJ. (dissenting) was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014After going over the entire record, I have concluded that the appeal should be dismissed, as, generally speaking, I agree with the reasons for judgment of Chief Justice Turgeon. Assuming negligence, and assuming that Danley did not know that the coupling apparatus on car 212665 was in a defective condition, was there any evidence from which it might be reasonably inferred that the death of Danley was caused by negligence, or is that matter one of pure conjecture?\nThe latest decision in the House of Lords, on the subject, would appear to be Caswell v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, Ltd.[11], where upon the facts it was found that if it had not been for the defendants' breach of a statutory duty the accident there in question would not have happened. In the later case of Stimson v. Standard Telephones[12], the Court of Appeal referred to the same matter and found in favour of the plaintiff. Sir Wilfrid Greene extracted the following from the opinion of Lord MacMillan in the Caswell case (1):\u2014 The mere fact that at the time of an accident to a miner his employers can be shown to have been in breach of a statutory duty is clearly not enough in itself to impose liability on the employers. It must be shown that the accident was causally associated with the breach of statutory duty.\nSir Wilfrid Greene then continued:\u2014\nI take that to mean this. To adopt an example put by MacKinnon, L.J., in the course of the argument, it would not be sufficient to show that a workman was found in the neighbourhood of a dangerous machine unconscious, with a wound upon him which might have been caused by the dangerous part of the machine, or might have been caused in some other way by the use of, for instance, a hand tool which the workman had to use. If that were all that appeared, then it would not be shown\u2014although the breach of statutory duty would be established owing to the failure to fence the machine\u2014that that accident was causally associated with the breach of the statutory duty, because the facts would be equally consistent with its having been due to some other cause.\nIn each case the circumstances must be examined. Having examined the proof in the present appeal and considered the able argument of counsel for the appellant, I am unable to find that the jury had before them any evidence upon which they could do more than guess at the cause of the unfortunate accident. I agree with the learned Chief Justice of Saskatchewan that the matter is one of pure conjecture and I would dismiss the appeal, with costs.\nAppeal allowed and judgment of trial judge restored with costs throughout.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

On January 7, appellant having been examined as to his mental condition, an information was sworn, under the Ontario Mental Hospitals Act (now R.S.O., 1937, c. 392), alleging that appellant was mentally ill, and on examination and inquiry by a magistrate he was committed as mentally ill. The warrant of the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario, for appellant\u2019s conveyance to and detention in a specified hospital, was dated January 12, and on January 15 appellant was conveyed from the gaol to the hospital. The form of the warrant was that attached to the regulations issued under said Ontario Act and to be used where s. 32 (1) of that Act (R.S.O., 1937, c. 392) would apply; but the Court was told that the same form was used in Ontario when it was intended to proceed under s. 970 (as enacted in 1935, c. 56) of the Criminal Code. Appellant applied for his release from the hospital on habeas corpus. His application was dismissed by Hogg J., ([1939] 3 D.L.R. 627), his appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed, and he appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Rinfret and Crocket JJ. dissenting on the ground of want of jurisdiction): The appeal should be allowed, and an order should go for appellant\u2019s release (the order not to issue until after a time fixed).\nPer the Chief Justice and Davis and Kerwin JJ.: Said s. 32 (1) of the Ontario Mental Hospitals Act could have no application, as appellant was not imprisoned \u201cfor an offence under the authority of any of the statutes of Ontario\u201d or \u201cfor safe custody charged with an offence\u201d under the authority of any such statutes; moreover, the proceedings (discussed) indicated that the warrant was not issued as a result of proceedings commenced under said Ontario Act. The warrant could not be said to be legally issued under said s. 970 of the Criminal Code, as at the time of its issue the remand on the criminal charge had expired and appellant was not then \u201cimprisoned in safe custody charged with an offence\u201d within the meaning of s. 970 (1) (s. 680, Criminal Code, also referred to by Davis J.). There was therefore no authority for appellant\u2019s detention. This Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal. The objection to jurisdiction on the ground that the proceedings were \u201ccriminal causes\u201d or \u201cproceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus * * * arising out of a criminal charge \u201c within the exception to this Court\u2019s jurisdiction in s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act was answered by the fact that after the expiry of the remand there was no criminal cause or charge in existence, and therefore the application for appellant\u2019s discharge could not arise thereout; it arose out of his detention in the hospital under the invalid warrant issued without any legal authority.\nPer Rinfret and Crocket JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be quashed for want of jurisdiction. It falls within the clause of s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act which excepts from this Court\u2019s jurisdiction appeals \u201cin criminal causes and in proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus * * * arising out of a criminal charge.\u201d The warrant, and the affidavits produced on the return of the habeas corpus order, shewed that the proceedings before Hogg J. and the custody from which appellant sought his discharge arose out of a criminal charge within the meaning of said excepting clause, and this in itself is conclusive against this Court\u2019s jurisdiction; the point now taken that, the period of remand having expired when the warrant was issued, the warrant was void and of no effect, while a point to be determined by Hogg J. (had it been discovered and suggested before him) in considering the question of the legality of appellant\u2019s custody, is not one which this Court has a right to consider, as it involves a decision upon the merits of the habeas corpus application; the only point for this Court to determine upon the question of its jurisdiction is, not whether the question of the legality of appellant\u2019s custody at the time was rightly or wrongly determined, but simply whether the habeas corpus proceedings arose out of a criminal charge. (It would have been quite another matter, had the question come before this Court by way of appeal from the decision of a judge of this Court in the exercise of his concurrent original jurisdiction, as to issue of a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, under s. 57 of the Supreme Court Act).\nAPPEAL from the order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing (without written reasons) the present appellant\u2019s appeal from the order of Hogg J.[1] dismissing his application for his release from the Ontario Hospital, Toronto, on habeas corpus.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported. The appeal to this Court was allowed with costs throughout; appellant to be discharged from custody; the order not to issue until after the expiration of two weeks. Rinfret and Crocket JJ. dissented, being of opinion that this Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\nNo one appeared for appellant.\nK.G. Gray K.C. for respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014This is an appeal by John Trenholm from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an appeal from an order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Hogg which dismissed the application of the appellant for his discharge from the Ontario Hospital, Toronto. The original application was \u201cfor an order for a writ of habeas corpus for the release of the said John Trenholm from the Ontario Hospital at Toronto; or for such further or other order as may seem just.\u201d An affidavit of the Superintendent of the Ontario Hospital was filed, stating:\u2014\n2. John Trenholm is at present a patient in the Ontario Hospital, Toronto, having been admitted to the said hospital on the 15th day of January, 1938, pursuant to The Mental Hospitals Act, R.S.O., 1937, chap. 392, on a warrant of the Lieutenant-Governor, dated the 12th day of January, 1938, copy of which is attached and marked Exhibit A to this my affidavit.\nParagraphs 9, 10 and 11 of the affidavit state:\u2014\n9. The said John Trenholm was brought before Magistrate A.L. Tinker on January the 7th, 1938, and the said Magistrate Tinker conducted an inquiry into the mental condition of the said John Trenholm.\n10. For the purposes of the inquiry, the said John Trenholm was examined by Dr. G.A. McLarty and Dr. John Chassels, and both of the said medical practitioners certified that the said John Trenholm was mentally ill. Copy of the certificate of Dr. McLarty is attached and marked Exhibit B to this my affidavit and copy of the certificate of Dr. John Chassels is attached and marked Exhibit C to this my affidavit.\n11. The said Magistrate A.L. Tinker issued his certificate based on the aforesaid inquiry, copy of which is attached and marked Exhibit D to this my affidavit.\nFrom the very outset the position taken on behalf of the respondent was that an error had been made in the Superintendent\u2019s affidavit and that Trenholm was not in the institution as a result of any proceedings taken under The Mental Hospitals Act but that the Lieutenant\u2011Governor\u2019s warrant referred to was issued in pursuance of section 970 of the Criminal Code as enacted by section 15 of chapter 56 of the Statutes of 1935. Apparently the matter was treated as if a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum had been issued and a return made thereto because the Court then examined into the truth of the facts set forth in what was treated as a return.\nFrom this examination it appears that Trenholm, in 1932, was charged with attempted murder and in August of that year was admitted to the Psychiatric Hospital, whence he was transferred to the Ontario Hospital, Toronto. He escaped from that hospital on November 13th, 1935, was later apprehended, placed in the Psychiatric Hospital on January 26th, 1936, and again transferred to the Ontario Hospital, Toronto. While he was in the hospital, the original information charging him with attempted murder was resworn on December 15th, 1936, asking for the issue of a warrant instead of a summons, and a warrant was accordingly issued on the same day. He escaped on June 18th, 1937, and was arrested on December 31st, 1937, under the warrant of December 15th, 1936. He was brought before Magistrate Jones on January 3rd, 1938, and remanded to the Toronto gaol until January 10th, 1938.\nOn January 6th, 1938, the Assistant Crown Attorney, by a letter written on the instructions of the magistrate, requested the surgeon at the Toronto gaol to conduct an examination into the mental condition of Trenholm and to report. On the same day the gaol surgeon and another doctor, by separate documents, certified that Trenholm was mentally ill and a proper person to be confined in an Ontario hospital. These certificates follow the form prescribed by the regulations under The Mental Hospitals Act, R.S.O., 1937, chapter 392, and reference is made in each certificate to section 20 of that Act. The Revised Statutes of 1937 were not then in force but section 20 of the present Act is the same as section 21 of the statute then in force, chapter 39 of the Statutes of 1935.\nOn the same day, January 6th, these certificates were directed to be sent from the Toronto gaol to the office of the Magistrates\u2019 Clerk at the City Hall, Toronto. It is not shown whether they were received there January 6th or 7th but on the latter date an information was sworn before Magistrate Tinker under the Ontario Act alleging that Trenholm was mentally ill. No warrant under the Ontario Act for Trenholm\u2019s apprehension was issued as he was then in custody but at the end of the information appears a notation \u201ccommitted mentally ill,\u201d signed by the magistrate. On the same day, the magistrate issued a certificate, under the Ontario Act, that he had personally examined Trenholm and \u201cI do hereby further certify that from such personal examination, and from the evidence adduced thereon, I am of opinion that he is mentally ill, and pending his transfer to an institution, I have committed him into the care and custody of The Governor of Toronto Gaol.\u201d This certificate and the doctors\u2019 certificates were sent on the same day to the office of the Deputy Minister of Health for Ontario. It is not clear how they were sent or the exact date they were received, as the Deputy Minister of Health can only state that they were received early in January. They were sent, however, by him by mail to the Superintendent of the Ontario Hospital, Toronto, and received by the latter on January 10th. The Lieutenant-Governor\u2019s warrant dated January 12th, 1938, which is produced as being the justification for Trenholm\u2019s detention at the Ontario Hospital, prepared by the Deputy Minister of Health and signed by him, is as follows:\u2014\nAlbert Matthews\n(Seal) Ontario\nBy the Honourable\nAlbert Matthews\nLieutenant-Governor of the Province of Ontario\nTo the Superintendent, Common Gaol, Toronto\nAnd to the Superintendent of the Ontario Hospital, Toronto,\nAnd to the Provincial Bailiff,\nGreeting:\nWhereas the mental illness of John Trenholm at present confined in the Common Gaol, Toronto, has been duly certified pursuant to and in accordance with the statute in that behalf,\nNow by this warrant I do hereby command and authorize you the said Superintendent of the said Common Gaol, Toronto to deliver such person into the custody of the Provincial Bailiff who shall receive and convey such person to the said Ontario Hospital: Toronto.\nAnd I do hereby command and authorize you the said Provincial Bailiff to convey such person from the said Common Gaol, Toronto to the said Ontario Hospital: Toronto.\nAnd I do hereby command and authorize you the said Superintendent of the said Ontario Hospital, to receive such person into your custody in the said Ontario Hospital, there to safely keep him until I order such person back to imprisonment, or until his discharge is directed by me or other lawful authority:\nGiven under my Hand and Seal, in the City of Toronto, in the County of York, this Twelfth day of January in the year of our Lord, one thousand nine hundred and thirty\u2011eight and in the Second year of His Majesty\u2019s Reign.\nBy Command\nB.T. McGhie, F.V. Johns,\nDeputy Minister of Health. Assistant Provincial Secretary\nThis warrant was sent to the Assistant Provincial Secretary who signed it and in due course it was submitted to and signed by the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario. The form of warrant is that attached to the regulations issued under the Ontario Act and to be used where subsection 1 of section 32 of the present Act would apply. That sub-section reads:\u2014\n(1) The Lieutenant-Governor, upon evidence satisfactory to him that any person imprisoned in any prison, reformatory, reformatory prison, reformatory school, industrial school or industrial refuge for an offence under the authority of any of the statutes of Ontario, or imprisoned for safe custody charged with an offence, or imprisoned for not finding bail for good behaviour or to keep the peace, is mentally ill, mentally deficient or epileptic, may order the removal of such person to a place of safe keeping, and such person shall remain there, or in such other place of safe keeping as the Lieutenant-Governor from time to time may order, until his complete or partial recovery is certified to the satisfaction of the Lieutenant-Governor, who may then order such person back to imprisonment if then liable thereto, or otherwise to be discharged, provided that where such person is confined in an institution he shall, if and when he is not liable to imprisonment, be subject to the direction of the Minister, or such other person as the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may designate, who may make such orders or directions in respect of such person as he may deem proper.\nThat subsection could have no application to the circumstances of this case as Trenholm was not imprisoned for an offence under the authority of any of the statutes of Ontario, or imprisoned for safe custody charged with an offence under the authority of any such statutes.\nWe are told, however, that the same form is used in Ontario when it is intended to proceed under section 970 of the Criminal Code as enacted in 1935. Subsection 1 of that section reads as follows:\u2014\nThe Lieutenant-Governor, upon evidence satisfactory to him that any person imprisoned in any prison other than a penitentiary for an offence, or imprisoned in safe custody charged with an offence, or imprisoned for not finding bail for good behaviour, or to keep the peace, is insane, mentally ill, or mentally deficient, may order the removal of such person to a place of safe keeping; and such person shall remain there, or in such other place of safe keeping as the Lieutenant-Governor from time to time orders, until his complete or partial recovery is certified to the satisfaction of the Lieutenant-Governor, who may then order such person back to imprisonment, if then liable thereto, or otherwise to be discharged; provided that where such person is confined in a mental hospital or other provincial institution, he shall, if and when he is not liable to be returned to imprisonment, be subject to the direction of the provincial Minister of Health, or such other person as the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may designate, who may make such orders or directions in respect of such insane person as he may deem proper.\nIt is contended that the warrant was legally issued under this section but in our view that is not so. The warrant is dated January 12th and it is shown that it was not until January 15th that it was handed by the Deputy Minister of Health to the Provincial Bailiff who, upon the same day, took Trenholm from the Toronto gaol to the Ontario Hospital, Toronto. The remand on the criminal charge had expired January 10th, and it cannot be said, therefore, that at the time of the issue of the warrant, Trenholm was \u201cimprisoned in safe custody charged with an offence\u201d within the meaning of section 970; it follows that there was no authority for the issue of the warrant.\nAs already explained, it is not suggested on behalf of the respondent\u2014in fact it was disclaimed\u2014that the warrant was issued as a result of proceedings commenced under the Ontario Act by the information of January 7th, 1938. That this is so is borne out by the fact that the certificates of the two doctors were issued before the swearing of the information, and furthermore, if it was intended to proceed under the Ontario Act, the only warrant that would be required thereunder, if all proper preliminary steps had been taken, would be a warrant signed by the Deputy Minister of Health (present section 29, subsection 2, and Form 11 attached to the Regulations).\nThere is therefore no authority for the appellant\u2019s detention. It was argued that this Court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal because of the provisions of section 36 of the Supreme Court Act.\n36. Subject to sections thirty-eight and thirty-nine hereof, an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment of the highest court of final resort now or hereafter established in any province of Canada pronounced in a judicial proceeding, whether such court is a court of appeal or of original jurisdiction (except in criminal causes and in proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari or prohibition arising out of a criminal charge, or in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus arising out of any claim for extradition made under any treaty) where such judgment is,\n(a) a final judgment; or\n(b) a judgment granting a motion for a nonsuit or directing a new trial.\nSection 39 has no application as section 42 enacts:\u2014\nNothing in the three sections last preceding shall affect appeals in cases of mandamus and habeas corpus.\nWe are not concerned with section 38.\nIt is contended that these proceedings are \u201ccriminal causes\u201d or \u201cproceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus * * * arising out of a criminal charge.\u201d The short answer to this contention is that after the expiry of the remand there was no criminal cause or charge in existence, and the application for the appellant\u2019s discharge from the Ontario Hospital could not, therefore, arise thereout. It arises out of his detention in the institution under an invalid warrant issued without any legal authority. The Court is not sitting in judgment upon the action of the Lieutenant-Governor in determining that the appellant was at the time mentally ill. All that we are determining is that the Lieutenant-Governor had no jurisdiction to direct the Superintendent of the Ontario Hospital to receive and keep Trenholm and that an order should go for the appellant\u2019s release.\nIn the course of these proceedings an affidavit, however, has been made by the Superintendent of the Ontario Hospital stating that at a conference of the medical staff of the institution held on December 22nd, 1938, the following conclusions were reached:\u2014\n(a) that the said John Trenholm is mentally ill\n(b) that the judgment of the said John Trenholm is obviously impaired\n(c) that the said John Trenholm is potentially dangerous as a result of the mental illness from which he suffers\n(d) that the said John Trenholm should be confined in a mental hospital.\nAs against this, one of the doctors who signed a certificate on January 6th, 1938, that Trenholm was mentally ill and a proper person to be confined in an Ontario Hospital re\u2011examined Trenholm on December 2nd, 1938, and on December 7th, 1938, reported in writing the result of the examination and concluded his letter as follows:\u2014\nI would consider this patient, while suffering from a mental condition, might be discharged from the Ontario Hospital, if some responsible party would assume some supervision over him, and that he be kept entirely away from the environment of 227 Kenilworth avenue. If some arrangement were made to carry out these two provisions, I feel the patient might be allowed out on probation.\nSince then the appellant\u2019s wife has made an affidavit in which she states her intention, if her husband were released, to remove with him to some other city and to keep him removed from the environment of their present home in Toronto. Under these circumstances and in view of the lapse of time since the latest medical examination of the appellant, the order will not issue until after the expiration of two weeks, to give the proper authorities an opportunity to take such proceedings, if any, as they may deem advisable from the point of view of the public and of the appellant. The judgment of Rinfret and Crocket JJ. (dissenting on the ground of want of jurisdiction) was delivered by\nCROCKET J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal, which comes to us from a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal, confirming the decision of Mr. Justice Hogg, refusing to discharge the applicant from the custody of the Superintendent of the Ontario Mental Hospital, falls within the clause of s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act, which expressly excepts appeals \u201cin criminal causes and in proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari or prohibition arising out of a criminal charge\u201d from the appellate jurisdiction of this Court.\nThe applicant had the right on the return of the habeas corpus order to have the legality of his imprisonment enquired into and determined by the Judge, who granted the order, whether his imprisonment was under a warrant which charged him with a criminal offence or not. The learned Judge, on perusing the affidavit of the Superintendent of the Ontario Hospital, in which he alleged the applicant was confined on a warrant of the Lieutenant-Governor, dated the 12th day of January, 1938, and a copy of such warrant which was annexed to the Superintendent\u2019s affidavit, and other affidavits then produced before him, and considering the whole question of the validity of the applicant\u2019s custody, held that the applicant was legally confined in that hospital under the warrant of the Lieutenant-Governor, as authorized by s. 970 of the Criminal Code. The relevant language of that section of the Criminal Code is as follows:\nThe Lieutenant-Governor, upon evidence satisfactory to him that any person imprisoned in any prison * * * for an offence, or imprisoned in safe custody charged with an offence, * * * is insane, mentally ill, or mentally deficient, may order the removal of such person to a place of safe keeping; and such person shall remain there, or in such other place of safe keeping as the Lieutenant-Governor from time to time orders, until his complete or partial recovery is certified to the satisfaction of the Lieutenant-Governor, who may then order such person back to imprisonment, if then liable thereto, or otherwise to be discharged; * * *\nThe original warrant of the Lieutenant-Governor and the original affidavits, which were produced before the learned Judge on the return of the habeas corpus order, have been sent to the Registrar of this Court since the hearing of this appeal. I think they shew that the proceedings before Mr. Justice Hogg and the custody, from which the applicant sought his discharge, arose out of a criminal charge within the meaning of the stated exception in s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act and that this Court has, therefore, no jurisdiction to hear the appeal as it has come before us.\nMr. Justice Hogg on the hearing of the habeas corpus application distinctly held that Trenholm was then confined in the Ontario Hospital by authority of the Lieutenant-Governor\u2019s warrant, issued in accordance with the terms of the above quoted section of the Criminal Code, \u201cas a step in the proceedings arising out of the charge against Trenholm of attempted murder.\u201d\nIt is now sought to take the appeal out of the exception of s. 36 upon the ground that Trenholm, who had been brought before a magistrate on January 3rd, 1938, under a warrant issued on the original information in the criminal case, had been remanded by the magistrate upon that charge until January 10th, and thereupon committed to the Toronto gaol, and that, the period of remand having expired when the Lieutenant-Governor\u2019s warrant was issued, under which he was transferred from the common gaol to the Ontario Hospital, the Lieutenant-Governor\u2019s warrant was void and of no effect.\nThis ground, which was not called to the attention of Mr. Justice Hogg on the habeas corpus hearing before him, and seems to have been discovered for the first time on the hearing of the appeal before this Court, obviously goes to the question of the authority of the Lieutenant\u2011Governor to issue the warrant under which Trenholm was held at the time of the habeas corpus hearing. With all respect, the very statement of the ground itself to my mind demonstrates that this appeal is an appeal in proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, which has arisen out of a criminal charge within the meaning of the clause of s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act above quoted, which expressly excepts such a case from the jurisdiction of this Court. While the point is one which, had it been discovered and suggested on the habeas corpus hearing before Mr. Justice Hogg, sitting as a Supreme Court Judge having original habeas corpus jurisdiction in the Province of Ontario, it would clearly have been his duty to determine in considering the question of the legality of the appli- cant\u2019s custody at that time, it is to my mind not one which we have any right to consider upon the present appeal, if the habeas corpus proceedings now before us arose out of a criminal charge.\nThe only point we have now to determine upon the question of this Court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear an appeal from the judgment of the highest court of final resort in Ontario under s. 36, is, not whether the learned Judge below rightly or wrongly determined the question of the legality of Trenholm\u2019s present custody, but simply whether the habeas corpus proceedings before him arose out of a criminal charge.\nTo hold that we have jurisdiction to hear the appeal on the ground above mentioned plainly to my mind itself involves a decision upon the merits of the habeas corpus application, which was solely directed to the validity of Trenholm\u2019s present custody. Such a decision would make the merits of the habeas corpus application the test of the jurisdiction of the Court to hear an appeal under s. 36 instead of what that section so unequivocally prescribes as the test thereof, viz.: whether the application itself and the proceedings thereupon have arisen out of a criminal charge. Such a decision, it seems to me, with the greatest possible respect, would be to fly directly in the face of the express, unambiguous and unconditional words of the exception to this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, which Parliament has placed in s. 36, and could be justified, in my judgment, only by reading them as necessarily implying that the criminal charge, out of which the habeas corpus proceedings have arisen, must be a valid subsisting charge, upon which the applicant might still be prosecuted, and not one, in connection with which he had any good legal ground to apply for his discharge from custody under the provisions of the Habeas Corpus Act. If such a principle is to be affirmed, it seems to me that the exception set out in s. 36 might just as well be expunged, for I can conceive of no criminal case or criminal charge, which, upon such a basis, could be brought within its terms.\nI should perhaps say that it would have been quite another matter if the question had come before us by way of appeal under the provisions of s. 58 from the decision of any one of the judges of this court in the exercise of the concurrent original jurisdiction, with which its mem- bers individually are invested by s. 57 to issue the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum for the purpose of an enquiry into the cause of commitment in any criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nFor these reasons I would quash the appeal as one which the Court has no jurisdiction to hear.\nDAVIS J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of my brother Kerwin and would only add a word as to the remand. By sec. 680 the justice may order the accused person to be brought before him, or before any other justice for the same territorial division, at any time before the expiration of the time for which such person has been remanded. But when a remand has expired without any further hearing or appearance the justice becomes functus and thereafter the accused cannot be said to be imprisoned in safe custody \u201ccharged with an offence\u201d within the meaning of sec. 970. That being so, there was no authority under said sec. 970 in the Lieutenant\u2011Governor, subsequent to the expiration of the remand, for the issue of the warrant in question. 59 J.P. 682.

The answers of the jury contained in .their verdict were to the effect that the accident had been occasioned by the common fault of the appellant and the respondent, the fault of the appellant consisting in \" not taking sufficient precaution for his personal safety and using the transom bar for a purpose for which it was not intended,\"and the fault of the respondent being \"the failure to keep the building in proper state of repair.\" The trial judge, confirming the verdict of the jury, awarded $12,600 damages; but that judgment was reversed by the appellate court.\nHeld that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed. The effect of the jury's answers was to eliminate any responsibility under article 1053 C.C. and to place the respondent's liability under article 1055 (3) C.C. The respondent therefore could be held legally responsible only for failure to keep the building in proper state of repair for the purpose for which it was intended. The answer of the jury being that the appellant used the transom bar \"for a purpose for which it was not intended,\" the jury thus negatived the application of article 1055 C.C. and the respondent cannot accordingly be held responsible: the jury could not find a legal foundation where there was no legal obligation.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 66 KB. 324) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Duclos J., with a jury, and dismissing the appellant's action for damages.\nThe material facts of the case are as follows: On the 30th April, 1936, the city of Verdun awarded one Chartrand a general contract for the renovation of the City Hall for the sum of $44,499. Chartrand in turn gave a sub-contract to Heroux & Robert, who, in turn, made a contract with one Raymond for the painting of the windows of the City Hall. When Raymond's work was nearing completion, he entered into a contract with the appellant for the washing of the windows. During the course of his work the appellant, with the object of washing the outside of the windows, stood on the outside sill, and to steady himself grasped the transom, that is, a central bar of the framework for the outside shutters, and as the wood at the end of the transom had become rotten through old age and exposure to the weather, it was not sufficiently strong to support his weight and, giving way, he was precipitated to the concrete- yard below, receiving, as a result of the fall, very grave injuries, which resulted in the amputation of his leg and other injuries which totally incapacitated him. The appellant instituted the present action against the city, charging it with negligence, on the ground that the building, and particularly the window-frame, was not - maintained in a proper state of repair; that the window-frame suffered from latent defects, which were completely hidden by the fresh paint; that the city failed to provide the appellant with the necessary equipment to which a safety-belt could be attached by the respondent during the course of his duties, as a result of which he was compelled to support himself by the window-frame which, had it been in a proper state of repair, would not have given way; that the city had, prior to the accident, been duly informed of the dangerous condition of the woodwork referred to, but nevertheless failed and neglected to make the necessary repairs. Upon the action being tried before a jury, the following verdict was rendered:\n1. Did the plaintiff suffer an accident on or about the 15th day of October, 1936, whilst fulfilling his duties, in cleaning the windows of the City Hall, the property of the defendant in the city of Verdun? Ans. Yes.\n2. Was the said accident due to the breaking of the transom bar fixed to the window frame of the said building? Am. Yes.\n3. Was the said transom bar of the window frame the property, in the possession and under the care and control of the city of Verdun? Ans. Yes.\n4. Was the said transom bar of the window-frame in a defective and dangerous condition? Ans. Yes.\n4a. Did the plaintiff suffer damages as a result of the said accident and, if so, what amount? Ans. $18,000.\n5. Was the said accident due to the sole fault, imprudence, negligence and lack of care of the defendant, and, it so, then what did such fault, imprudence and lack of care consist of?\n9\u2014They are not solely responsible.\n3\u2014Solely responsible.\n6. Was the said accident occasioned by the sole fault of the plaintiff? Ans. No.\n7. Was the said accident occasioned by the common fault of the plaintiff and defendant, and, if in the affirmative, say in what fault?\n(a) of the plaintiff consisted.\n9\u2014Not taking sufficient precautions for his personal safety, and using the transom's bar for a purpose for which it was not intended.\n(b) of the defendant;\nFor failure to keep the building in proper state of repair-3 against. 8. If you answer question number 7 in the affirmative what amount do you reduce from the total amount given?\n$5,400; all in favour except 1 or 30%.\nThe trial judge, holding that the city as owner of the premises\u2014including the window-bar\u2014which was the immediate cause of the accident, should be held responsible for the damages caused by want of repairs under article 1055 C.C., and that the appellant's use of the same was reasonable, dismissed the respondent's motion for a judgment non obstante veredicto, and, maintaining the appellant's motion for judgment in accordance with the verdict, condemned the respondent to pay the sum of $12,600. The city appealed to the appellate court and contended that the verdict, and the judgment, should not have been based on the mere fact that the window-bar gave way because it was old and decayed, but should have taken into account the purpose it was designed to serve, and that, since the appellant submitted it to a strain entirely foreign to that purpose, the accident was due to his own fault, and his action should have been dismissed.\nLouis St-Laurent K.C., M. Gameroff and S. Fenster for the appellant.\nL. E. Beaulieu. K.C. and Francis Fauteux K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014In my view the judgment of the Court of King's Bench dismissing the appellant's action was justified by the answers of the jury to the questions put to them.\nIt was open to the Court of King's Bench to give a judgment different from that rendered by the trial judge on the facts as found by the jury. (Art. 508-1 C.C.P.).\nThe appellant was not working for the city of Verdun. The city had contracted with one Chartrand to effect certain repairs in its City Hall building. Among these repairs were those pertaining to painting and glazing which had been delegated to a sub-contractor; and the appellant was engaged by the sub-contractor to clean the windows. He was an independent contractor of his own.\nWhile doing that work the appellant attempted to support himself on the transom bar of a window frame, the transom bar gave way, the appellant lost his balance and fell to the pavement below.\nThe jury was asked to determine the cause of the accident. Their answers were to the effect that the accident had been occasioned by the common fault of the appellant and the respondent and that the fault of the appellant consisted in\nnot taking sufficient precaution for his personal safety and using the transom bar for a purpose for which it was not intended\nand that the fault of the respondent was the\nfailure to keep the building in proper state of repair.\nThe effect of the jury's answers was to eliminate any responsibility under article 1053 of the Civil Code and to place the respondent's liability under article 1055 C.C., paragraph 3, which reads as follows: \u2014\nThe owner of a building is responsible for the damage caused by its ruin, where it has happened from want of repairs or from an original defect in its construction.\nWe may disregard that part of the article which deals with \"an original defect in its construction,\" since the answer of the jury is limited to the \"want of repairs.\"\nNow the interpretation given to that article has been invariably that the want of repairs must be looked at from the viewpoint of the purpose for which the building or part of building was intended.\nLe d\u00e9faut d'entretien ou le vice de construction s'appr\u00e9cient eu \u00e9gard a la destination qu'avait revue la partie du b\u00e2timent a la ruine de laquelle est du le dommage \u00e0 r\u00e9parer (Aubry et Rau, Fifth Ed. Tome 6, page 433).\nPlaniol (Vol. 6, No. 609) says that the proprietor should not be held responsible\ns'il prouve que le vice ou la v\u00e9tust\u00e9 n'auraient pas entrain\u00e9 la ruine sans l'acte fautif de la victime.\n(See also Demogue, Obligation, vol. 5, pages 313 and 325); Bourassa v. Gregoire[2].\nIn this case, therefore, the respondent could be held legally responsible only for failure to keep the building in proper state of repair for the purpose for which it was intended.\nSuch is the meaning of paragraph 3 of article 1055 C.C. Now the answer of the jury was that the appellant used the transom bar \"for a purpose for which it was not intended.\" The jury thus negatived the application of article 1055 C.C. and the necessary result must be that the respondent, under the circumstances, could not be held legally responsible. The jury could not find a legal foundation where there was no legal obligation.\nAs for the other contentions of the appellant, they were disregarded and set aside by the verdict of the jury, which is strictly limited to the alleged responsibility under article 1055 C.C.\nUpon the finding of the jury that the appellant used the transom bar for a purpose for which it was not intended, the respondent was relieved of any legal responsibility under that article and the Court of King's Bench was right in reversing the judgment of the trial judge and in dismissing the action. The appeal ought, therefore, to be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Seymour Fenster.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fauteux & Fauteux.\n[1] (1939) Q.R. 66 K.B. 324.\n[2] (1926) Q.R. 42 KB. 154.\n"

C. Gravel bequeathed to his wife the usufruct of the remainder and residue of all his estate; and by clause four of his will he bequeathed, subject to his wife's right of usufruct, the remainder and residue of the same property to his daughter, Maria Gravel, wife of Louis Joseph Lajoie, to hold and enjoy as institute, subject to the obligation of delivering over the ownership thereof to her issue in the first degree. By clause nine of his will he disposed as follows: \"It is my will and intention that any substitute inheriting the ownership of my property, in the event of the opening of his. legacy, be placed in possession thereof as actual owner only when he has attained the age of thirty, and that until then he have only the use and usufruct thereof, without power to sell, pledge or alienate any part of his share of capital or of realty, while being allowed to dispose thereof by will, in the event of death before attaining such age providing it be in favour of his children of full age or, in default thereof, in favour of any one of the substitutes of his choice under the said substitution, while nevertheless having the right to bequeath the right of enjoyment of his share to his consort, but during widowhood only, whether he have issue or not, and in default of such a will, the share of any of the said substitutes under the said substitution dying while of age but under thirty shall devolve to his children or, in default of children, to the other substitutes under the said substitution, according; to the conditions hereinbefore provided in the event of the decease under age of any substitute under the said substitution without leaving issue of full age.\" L. C. Gravel's wife died in Montreal on August 16th, 1900, and her daughter Maria Gravel also died in Montreal on September 16th, 1916. By this last decease the substitution created by L. C. Gravel's will became open and the property thereby affected devolved to the seven children of Maria Gravel. Marguerite Lajoie., one of these children, who was one of the substitutes, made on December 13th, 1919, at the age of 24 years and some months, a will in authentic form whereby she disposed of the estate she inherited from her grandfather, in the following terms: \"3. Desiring to avail myself of the rights conferred upon me by clause nine of the solemn will of my grandfather, the late Louis Charles Gravel, * * * to dispose by will of my share in his estate as one of the substitutes under the said will, I give and bequeath to my above-named husband the use and usufruct during his lifetime, or until his remarriage, of my share in the said estate of my late grandfather above named, as one of the substitutes under the said will, and to my two sisters Hortense Lajoie and Blanche Lajoie, in equal parts, the ownership of my said share in the said estate, subject to the said usufruct of my said husband during his lifetime or until his remarriage.\" When she made her will Marguerite Lajoie was childless; and it is only on August 21st, 1925, that is at the age of thirty years and nearly ten months, that she gave birth to her first child, Louise Clerk. Marguerite Lajoie, left a widow in 1926 at the age of thirty-two, married the appellant at the age of thirty-five and died at the age of forty leaving no other will but the one above mentioned. Her lawful heirs, that is, her daughter Louise Clerk and her husband Oscar Benoit, accepted her succession. In his own name, as well as in his capacity of tutor to his minor daughter, the appellant asked, that the bequest to the respondent be declared null and void.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 68 K.B. 117), that clause 3 of Marguerite Lajoie's will was to take effect only in the event of her dying under the age of thirty without leaving any children; and that, this contingency not having occurred, the legacy dependent upon it remained without effect: it lapsed from the moment that the condition to which it was subject was fulfilled and on Marguerite Lajoie's attaining the age of thirty.\u2014In order to determine \"what was the real intention of\" the testatrix, a \"fair and literal meaning\" must be given to the terms and expressions which she used to manifest it (Auger v. Beaudry, [1920] A.C. 1010); and, in doing so, the conclusion must be that the testatrix did not intend to avail herself of the unlimited right to dispose by will and the general power conferred upon her by the Civil Code, but that she only wished to \"avail herself of the rights\" conferred upon her by her grandfather's will, i.e., that she wished merely to provide for the contingency arising in the event of her dying before the age of thirty years.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, McDougall J., and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the question at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nGustave Mouette K.C. for the appellant.\nAld\u00e9ric Laurendeau K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014L'appelant en appelle \u00e0 cette Cour d'un jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi (1) qui, par une majorit\u00e9 des juges, a rejet\u00e9 son action pour faire d\u00e9clarer nul et de nul effet un certain legs fait en faveur de l'intim\u00e9e.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure avait maintenu l'action et avait fait droit \u00e0 la demande de l'appelant.\nVoici dans quelles circonstances la question se pr\u00e9sente:\nM.

Ce n'est que le vingt et un ao\u00fbt 1925, savoir \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de trente ans et pr\u00e8s de dix mois que son enfant, Louise Clerk, lui est n\u00e9e.\nDevenue veuve en 1926, \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de trente-deux ans, Marguerite Lajoie, s'est remari\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de trente-cinq ans avec l'appelant, et elle est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de quarante ans sans autre testament que celui dont il vient d'\u00eatre question et qui porte la date du treize d\u00e9cembre 1919. Ses h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gitimes, savoir, sa fille, Louise Clerk, et son mari, Oscar Benoit, ont recueilli sa succession.\nTant en son nom personnel que comme tuteur \u00e0 Louise Clerk qui est mineure, Oscar Benoit, l'appelant, demande que le legs \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul et sans effet.\nNous n'avons plus \u00e0 nous occuper des int\u00e9r\u00eats de Hortense Lajoie qui a pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 sa s\u0153ur Marguerite. La seule int\u00e9ress\u00e9e est maintenant mademoiselle Blanche Lajoie.\nSuivant nous, la d\u00e9cision de cette cause d\u00e9pend uniquement de l'intention qu'avait la testatrice lorsqu'elle a ins\u00e9r\u00e9 dans son testament la clause troisi\u00e8me que nous avons reproduite ci-dessus.\nIl n'y a pas de doute qu'en sa qualit\u00e9 de grev\u00e9e Marguerite Lajoie pouvait, durant la substitution, disposer par testament de son droit \u00e9ventuel aux biens substitu\u00e9s, sujet au manque d'effet par caducit\u00e9 (Art. 956 C.C.).\nComme grev\u00e9e elle poss\u00e9dait pour elle-m\u00eame le titre de propri\u00e9taire (Art. 944 C.C.). En vertu de la loi, elle poss\u00e9dait la libert\u00e9 illimit\u00e9e de tester (Art. 831 C.C.). Elle aurait pu faire un testament en vertu duquel elle l\u00e9guait tous ses biens. Ce testament aurait pris effet apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9c\u00e8s (Art. 756 C.C.). Et, pourvu qu'elle f\u00fbt d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e apr\u00e8s avoir atteint l'\u00e2ge de trente ans, les biens venant de la succession de son grand-p\u00e8re eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 compris parmi ceux qu'elle aurait ainsi l\u00e9gu\u00e9s. La naissance de son enfant apr\u00e8s qu'elle avait atteint l'\u00e2ge de trente ans n'aurait pas par elle-m\u00eame op\u00e9r\u00e9 la r\u00e9vocation de ce testament (Art. 893 C.C.).\nMais la solution de la question qui nous est soumise ne d\u00e9pend pas des pouvoirs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux ou de la capacit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale de Marguerite Lajoie. Nous n'avons pas \u00e0 nous demander ce qu'elle aurait pu faire. Ce que nous avons \u00e0 rechercher c'est ce qu'elle avait l'intention de faire. Et nous devons trouver cette intention \u00e0 l'aide des termes et des expressions qu'elle a employ\u00e9s pour la manifester.\nEn effet, comme le dit Lord Buckmaster, rendant le jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Auger v. Beaudry[2]: It is now recognized that the only safe method of determining what was the real intention of a testator is to give the fair and literal meaning to the actual language of the will.\nLa clause que nous \u00e9tudions debute par ces mots:\nVoulant user des droits que me conf\u00e8re l'article neuf du testament solennel de mon grand-p\u00e8re, feu M. Louis Charles Gravel, re\u00e7u devant M. Narcisse P\u00e9rodeau et son confr\u00e8re, notaires, le 30 d\u00e9cembre 1892, de disposer par testament, de ma part dans les biens de sa succession, comme l'une des appel\u00e9s \u00e0 la substitution cr\u00e9\u00e9e en vertu du dit testament.\nCette phrase est bien claire. La testatrice n'entend pas user de la libert\u00e9 illimit\u00e9e de tester et du pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui lui sont octroy\u00e9s par le Code Civil; elle veut simplement \"user des droits\" que lui conf\u00e8re le testament de son grand-p\u00e8re. En d'autres termes, elle veut seulement pourvoir \u00e0 ce qui arriverait au cas o\u00f9 elle d\u00e9c\u00e9derait avant l'\u00e2ge de trente ans\u2014dans les limites qui lui sont assign\u00e9es par le testament de son grand-p\u00e8re.\nEn vertu de ce testament, si elle meurt avant d'avoir atteint l'\u00e2ge de trente ans la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la part des biens de son grand-p\u00e8re doit aller \u00e0 ses enfants; et, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'enfants, aux autres appel\u00e9s \u00e0 la substitution. Elle a, cependant, deux droits qu'elle peut exercer par testament:\nPremi\u00e8rement: elle peut l\u00e9guer le droit de jouissance de sa part \u00e0 son conjoint pendant viduit\u00e9;\nDeuxi\u00e8mement: elle a le droit de choisir et d'indiquer parmi les appel\u00e9s ceux qui recueilleront la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'enfants.\nAu moment o\u00f9 elle fait la disposition contenue dans la clause troisi\u00e8me, elle n'a pas d'enfants. Elle proc\u00e8de donc \u00e0 exercer les droits qui lui r\u00e9sultent du testament de son grand-p\u00e8re et qui sont compatibles avec l'\u00e9tat de choses existant \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0.\nTout ce qu'elle entend faire, d'apr\u00e8s les termes m\u00eames de la clause en litige, c'est se servir des droits qui lui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par son grand-p\u00e8re pour l\u00e9guer \u00e0 son \u00e9poux l'usufruit de sa part qu'il n'aurait pas eu autrement, et pour faire le choix des appel\u00e9s \u00e0 qui elle entend l\u00e9guer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nMais comme elle le dit: elle veut simplement \"user des droits\" qui lui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le testament. Elle indique donc clairement qu'elle entend se servir de ses droits dans les limites qui lui sont assign\u00e9es par la clause neuf du testament du grand-p\u00e8re et que les legs qu'elle fait ainsi sont n\u00e9cessairement subordonn\u00e9s aux conditions pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 ce testament, c'est-\u00e0-dire, son d\u00e9c\u00e8s avant d'avoir atteint l'\u00e2ge de trente ans et sans laisser d'enfants qui atteindraient l'\u00e2ge de majorit\u00e9.\nBien respectueusement nous croyons que c'est bien l\u00e0 le sens qui se d\u00e9gage des expressions que Marguerite Lajoie a employ\u00e9es et nous ne pouvons y voir l'intention de se servir de son pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de tester. Il en r\u00e9sulte, suivant nous, que la clause devait prendre effet au cas seulement o\u00f9 se rencontreraient les conditions qu'elle pr\u00e9voit, c'est-\u00e0-dire, si Marguerite Lajoie mourait avant trente ans sans laisser d'enfants.\nComme l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement pr\u00e9vu ne s'est pas produit le legs auquel il \u00e9tait subordonn\u00e9 est rest\u00e9 sans effet. Il est devenu caduc du moment que la condition \u00e0 laquelle il \u00e9tait soumis s'est accomplie et d\u00e8s que Marguerite Lajoie eut atteint l'\u00e2ge de trente ans.\nL'appelant nous dit:\u2014\nCe n'est pas le legs qui devient inefficace. Marguerite Lajoie avait toute capacit\u00e9 de disposer de ses biens, et en ce qui concerne ceux qui lui venaient de son grand-p\u00e8re, la restriction que le testament de ce dernier lui imposait \u00e9tait simplement que la disposition qu'elle en ferait resterait sans effet au cas o\u00f9 elle d\u00e9c\u00e9derait avant d'avoir atteint l'\u00e2ge de trente ans.\nC'est \u00e9galement ce que para\u00eet avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nMais, \u00e0 notre humble avis, cette interpr\u00e9tation ne tient aucun compte de la phrase introductive de la clause 3 du testament.\nNous ne perdons pas de vue que la testatrice est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e plusieurs ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s avoir atteint l'\u00e2ge de trente ans et sans avoir r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 son testament. L'intim\u00e9e voudrait que nous trouvions l\u00e0 une intention de ratifier le testament, mais nous ne voyons pas comment ce fait peut aider \u00e0 soutenir la cause de l'intim\u00e9e. En admettant que le silence de la testatrice pendant les ann\u00e9es subs\u00e9quentes de sa vie ait eu pour effet de confirmer la disposition qu'elle avait faite dans le clause 3 de son testament, cette confirmation ne peut s'entendre que de la clause telle qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 redig\u00e9e et telle qu'elle doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e. Si l'interpr\u00e9tation que nous soumettons ci-dessus est la bonne, toute confirmation ult\u00e9rieure, surtout toute confirmation tacite, ne saurait modifier le sens originaire de la clause. Par ces motifs nous croyons que l'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et que le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance doit \u00eatre r\u00e9tabli avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Monette, Filion & Meighen.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Laurendeau & Laurendeau.\n[1] (1939) Q.R. 68 K.B. 117.\n[2] [1920] A.C. 1010, at 1014.\n"

The King, [1940] S.C.R. 325\nDate: 1940-04-30\nGeorge Alexander Morrison (Suppliant) Appellant;\nand\nHis Majesty the King Respondent.\n1939: November 20, 21; 1940: March 4; 1940: April 30.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Crocket, Davis and Kerwin JJ. Rinfret J. was not present on the re-hearing as to the amount of damages on April 30, 1940, the re-hearing being, by consent, before four Judges.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nCrown\u2014Negligence\u2014Petition of Right for damages\u2014Suppliant struck by motorcycle driven by R.C.M.P. constable on driveway of Federal District Commission\u2014Negligence of an \"officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon a public work\" within s. 19 (c) of Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 34 (as it stood in 1936).\nThe accident in. question occurred on August 23, 1936, on a driveway in the city of Ottawa, constructed and maintained by the Federal District Commission, a body created by c. 55 of the Statutes of Canada, 1927. The cost of construction of the driveway was defrayed out of moneys voted by Parliament for the purpose and the driveway is maintained out of such moneys. A part of the driveway passed through land used by the City of Ottawa for an agricultural exhibition and it; was the practice of the Exhibition Association to obtain permission from the Commission to place barriers across the driveway at the east and west limits of the exhibition grounds for the purpose of preventing the public from gaining access to those grounds through from the Driveway; and such barriers were there on the day of the accident. On the first day of exhibition week, G., a R.C.M.P. constable (who had been engaged as traffic officer on the Driveway in the previous year during exhibition week, when the same part of it had been closed to the public) was driving his motorcycle on the Driveway in discharge of his duty of patrolling it for the purposes (inter alia) of enforcing traffic regulations and protecting the Commission's property. When, driving westerly, he reached the eastern limits of the exhibition grounds he received a signal to pass through the open gate of the barrier and proceeded on his way. In approaching the western limits of the grounds, on rounding a curve, he found his vision impaired by the sun, and when he became aware of the barrier there erected, though he immediately applied his brakes (which were in perfect order), he did not succeed in stopping until he had passed through and some few feet beyond the gate, which appellant, gatekeeper, was in the act of opening to allow G. to pass. Appellant was struck by the motorcycle and injured, and sued the Crown for damages.\nHeld: (1) G. was negligent in not immediately bringing his motorcycle under control when he found his vision affected by the sun. Appellant was not guilty of contributory negligence.\n(2) G. at the time of the accident was an \"officer or servant of the Crown\" and \"acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon\" a \"public work,\" within the meaning of s. 19 (c) (as it then stood) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 34. Conceding that he was not engaged in traffic control when in the part of the Driveway within the ambit of the exhibition grounds (though even there he was charged with protecting Crown property\u2014shrubs, trees, etc., on the Driveway border), yet even when passing through those grounds (to resume his duty as traffic officer beyond them) he was acting within the scope of his duty as traffic officer upon the Driveway (The King v. Schrobounst, [1925] S.C.R. 458, the authority of which has been recognized in The King v. Mason, [1933] S.C.R. 332, The King v. Dubois, [1935] S.C.R. 378, The King v. Moscovitz, [1935] S.C.R. 404, and Salmo Investments Ltd. v. The King, [1940] S.C.R. 263).\nJudgment of Maclean J., [1938] Ex. C.R. 311, dismissing appellant's petition of right, reversed.\nAPPEAL by the suppliant from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing his petition of right, in which he asked damages for personal injuries suffered when, on August 23, 1936, he was struck by a motorcycle driven by a constable of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on a Driveway constructed and maintained by the Federal District Commission in the city of Ottawa. The suppliant (appellant) alleged that the accident was caused by negligence of the said constable and that the latter was at the time of the accident an \"officer or servant of the Crown\" acting \"within the scope of his duties or employment upon\" a \"public work\" within the meaning of s. 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 34 (as it stood at the time of the accident). The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported. The appeal to this Court was allowed and judgment given to the suppliant for damages (fixed, on a re-hearing as to the amount on April 30, 1940, at $9,500) with costs throughout. A. W. Beament K.C. and R. A. Hughes for the appellant.\nA. Lemieux K.C. (W. R. Jackett with him on said re-hearing as to amount of damages) for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Binfret, Davis and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice\u2014The first question concerns the application of section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act and that question subdivides itself into two branches: (a) whether the Driveway between Confederation Park and Hog's Back is a \"public work\" within the meaning of that enactment; and (b) if so, whether Constable Glencross was an \"officer or servant of the Crown acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon\" that \"public work\" when the acts of negligence with which he is charged occurred.\nThe Driveway was constructed and is maintained by the Federal District Commission, a body created by chapter 55 of the Statutes of Canada, 1927. The cost of construction was defrayed out of moneys voted by Parliament for the purpose and the Driveway is maintained out of such moneys and it is not seriously open to question that the Driveway is a \"public work\" within the meaning of section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act. It is argued, however, on behalf of the Crown that this enactment has no application in the present case because Glencross, assuming he was chargeable with negligence in the acts complained of, was not at the time an \"officer or servant of the Crown acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon\" a \"public work.\"\nA brief statement of the facts is necessary.\nThe Driveway between Confederation Park and Hog's Back follows the bank of the Rideau Canal through a tract of land, which, in 1904, was leased by the Crown to the City of Ottawa at a rental of one dollar a year to be used solely for the purposes of an Agricultural Exhibition (with the right to resume possession of any part of the tract on notice). It was not until the year 1927 that the part of the Driveway passing through this tract was constructed. The Commission decided shortly after the construction of this part of the Driveway not to erect a barrier fencing off the Driveway from the Exhibition Grounds proper, but it has been entirely controlled along with the rest of the Driveway by the Commission and the Commission's exclusive right of possession has not been disputed. Traffic over it has been governed by the traffic by-laws of the Commission and it has been the practice, during the week of the Exhibition, for the Exhibition Association to obtain permission from the Commission to place barriers across the Driveway at the east and west limits of the Exhibition Grounds for the purpose of preventing the public from gaining access to those grounds through from the Driveway.\nThe duty of patrolling the Driveway for the purposes (inter alia) of enforcing traffic regulations and protecting the property of the Commission is discharged by constables belonging to a motorcycle squad of the R.C.M.P. and, on the day when the appellant was injured (August 23rd, 1936, the first day of the week of the Exhibition), one Glencross was assigned to this duty and came on duty shortly before four o'clock in the afternoon. Proceeding southerly and westerly from Confederation Park, he arrived at the eastern boundary of the Exhibition Grounds where the Exhibition Association had (as usual during the week of the Exhibition) erected a barrier. There he received a signal from the attendant to pass through the open gate and then proceeded westerly towards the western limit of the Exhibition Grounds at a speed which he estimated at between 23 and 25 miles per hour.\nAt the westerly limit also the Association had, as usual, placed a barrier with the permission of the Commission and a gate which was 12 feet wide and 8 feet high; and it was there that the appellant was stationed as gatekeeper. His duties were to exclude the public from entering the Exhibition Grounds through the gate but to allow the employees of the Hydro-Electric Corporation and the motorcycle squad patrolmen to pass freely in both directions. The predecessor of Glencross had several times that day passed through this gate in the execution of his duty of patrolling the Driveway.\nGlencross, cycling westerly on the Driveway, found, as he rounded a curve between two and three hundred feet east of this barrier and gate, that the sun was shining directly in his eyes and his vision was naturally impaired thereby. It was, indeed, only when he had reached a point about fifty or sixty feet from the barrier that he became aware, as he says, that the roadway was barricaded. He immediately applied his brakes (which were in perfect order) but did not succeed in stopping his motorcycle until he had passed through the gate, which the appellant was then in the act of opening (in order to allow him to pass), and some few feet beyond it. The appellant received a severe blow and suffered permanent injuries.\nThe Crown contends that Glencross was not acting within the scope of \"his duties or employment upon a public work\" while proceeding along the Driveway within the limits of the Exhibition Grounds.\nIt may be conceded that Glencross was not engaged in traffic patrol when in the part of the Driveway within the ambit of the Exhibition Grounds. But when one takes account of the facts, this does not appear to be relevant. Even within the Exhibition Grounds he was admittedly charged with the duty of protecting the property of the Crown,\u2014the shrubs, trees, flowers and bushes on the border of the Driveway. Moreover, the duty of Glencross as traffic officer required him to patrol the Driveway between Confederation Park and Hog's Back. He was conveying himself in a motorcycle which he had in his possession as such traffic officer to enable him to perform his functions as such officer. When he arrived at the easterly limit of the Exhibition Grounds it was his duty to go along the Driveway to the westerly gate in order to resume his duty as traffic officer when he arrived there. Even passing through the Exhibition Grounds he was, under the decision in The King v. Schrobounst[2], acting within the scope of his duty as traffic officer upon the Driveway. In that case it was held by this Court that the driver of a bus employed by the Crown to take workmen engaged on the Welland Canal from their homes to the Canal was acting in his \"duties or employment upon\" a \"public work\" (the Welland Canal) while so engaged. The case is indistinguishable; and its authority has been recognized in The King v. Mason[3]; The King v. Dubois[4]; The King v. Moscovitz[5], and Salmo Investments Ltd. v. The King[6].\nThere remains the issue of the negligence of Glencross. He had been engaged as traffic officer on the Driveway in the previous year during the week of the Exhibition when the same part of the Driveway had been closed to the public; and he had, a minute or two before, passed the eastern limit of the grounds where there was a barrier across the Driveway and an attendant on guard.\nI wish to avoid harsh language, but it does seem plain that a traffic officer of Glencross's experience, when, in approaching the western entrance, he found his vision affected by the sun, as he says it was, ought to have realized the necessity of bringing his motorcycle instantly under control in the interests of the safety of others as well as of himself.\nAs to contributory negligence, it was, as I have said, part of the duty of Morrison to let the traffic officers through his gate, and the constable relieved by Glencross had passed through more than once that same day. He had every reason to suppose that a constable on duty as traffic officer would be acquainted with the practice which had been in force in other years and with which the traffic officer engaged throughout the day had been to his knowledge familiar.\n[The judgment here deals with the amount of damages. The damages were subsequently, on a re-hearing as to the amount on April 30, 1940, fixed at $9,500, for which amount judgment was directed, with costs throughout].\nThe appeal will be allowed and there will be judgment for the amount [of damages, fixed later, as aforesaid, at $9,500], with costs throughout.\nCrocket J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be allowed and judgment entered in favour of the suppliant for [the amount of damages. The damages were subsequently fixed, on a re-hearing as to the amount on April 30, 1940, at $9,500] with costs throughout. I think the evidence clearly proves that the suppliant's injuries were solely caused by the negligence of a servant of the Crown while acting in the scope of his duties or employment upon a public work within the meaning of s. 19 of the Exchequer Court Act, [reference to the amount of damages, which amount was later fixed as aforesaid].\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hughes & Laishley.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Auguste Lemieux.\n[1] [1938] Ex.

Each party claimed that the collision was caused entirely by the other\u2019s negligence and claimed damages. Judgment was given at trial on the jury\u2019s findings in favour of respondent and an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed. Appeal was brought to this Court on the ground of misdirection in the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury.\nHeld (the Chief Justice dissenting): There should be a new trial, on the ground of misdirection.\nPer Rinfret and Kerwin JJ.: On construction of the trial judge\u2019s charge, there was misdirection in that he told the jury that appellant\u2019s allegation that respondent was travelling at an excessive rate of speed under the circumstances was not open to them since respondent was not exceeding the statutory limit of 50 miles per hour; also in that he told the jury that respondent was under no obligation to have his car lights burning, and said: \u201cAs I remember it, every witness said that they could see 100 yards. Why would lights need be on if you could see 100 yards without lights. There is no law in this province requiring lights on under those circumstances\u2014that is, at any rate, after dawn and before dusk\u2014during the day-time.\u201d Such misdirection occasioned substantial wrong or miscarriage. Appellant was entitled to a finding from the jury, not merely on the question as to negligent driving of his own car but also on the question of respondent\u2019s negligence, and in particular as to whether both drivers were negligent. Two allegations of negligence on the part of respondent were really withdrawn from consideration of the jury, and the Court should not place itself in the position of attempting to determine what, on a proper direction, would be solely within the province of the jury on these vital matters.\nPer Davis J.: The trial judge\u2019s directions virtually withdrew from the jury a consideration of the vital question as to the degree of care reasonably to be expected from both drivers under the fog conditions existing at the time.\nPer the Chief Justice (dissenting): The trial judge told the jury in the most pointed way that, if they accepted appellant\u2019s account, then respondent\u2019s conduct amounted to negligence which was the cause of the collision. The issue at the trial was an issue of credibility and, the jury having rejected appellant\u2019s case, he ought not to have an opportunity of putting the same case or another case before another jury because of inaccuracies in the charge which must, in view of the nature of the critical issue and the manner in which that issue was placed before the jury, have been quite innocuous.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing his appeal from the judgment of Kelly J. at trial, upon the findings of the jury, in favour of the plaintiff for $6,530.69 damages. The action arose out of a collision between two motor cars, owned by the plaintiff and defendant respectively. Plaintiff was the sole occupant of his car. Defendant and the driver, Larsen, who was killed in the accident, were the occupants of defendant\u2019s car. Each party claimed that the collision was caused entirely by negligence of the other party, and each claimed damages (the defendant by way of counterclaim) for personal injuries and for destruction of his car. The accident occurred on Ontario provincial highway no. 2 about three miles east of Bowmanville on the morning of October 15, 1938, at about 7.30 o\u2019clock, as alleged by plaintiff, or seven o\u2019clock, as alleged by defendant. There was evidence that there was intermittent fog. The jury found that the driver of defendant\u2019s car was, and that plaintiff was not, guilty of negligence causing or contributing to the accident. The grounds of the appeal to this Court were alleged misdirections in the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury.\nP.E.F. Smily K.C. and R.B. Burgess for the appellant.\nJ.M. Bullen K.C. and J.D. Conover for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)\u2014I find myself unable to concur in the judgment of the majority of the Court. I do not enter at large upon my reasons because I cannot state them fully without a discussion of the details of the evidence, which is inadvisable in view of the fact that there is to be a new trial. I will say simply that the appellant at the trial advanced a case which was based upon his own evidence. The learned trial judge told the jury in the most pointed way that, if they accepted the appellant\u2019s account of what occurred, then the respondent\u2019s conduct amounted to negligence which was the cause of the collision. The jury found that the respondent was not chargeable with any negligence either causing or contributing to the collision. I think the issue at the trial was an issue of credibility, and, the jury having rejected the appellant\u2019s case, he ought not to have an opportunity of putting the same case or another case before another jury because of inaccuracies in the charge which must, I think, in view of the nature of the critical issue and the manner in which that issue was placed before the jury, have been quite innocuous.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014I would allow the appeal and order a new trial. In view of this, it would be inadvisable to discuss the evidence and I restrict my remarks, therefore, to a short statement of the reasons why I consider such an order should be made.\nAfter considering the charge of the learned trial judge in its entirety, I have concluded the jury were there told that the allegation of the appellant (defendant) that the respondent (plaintiff) was travelling at an excessive rate of speed under the circumstances, was not open to them since the respondent was not exceeding the statutory limit of fifty miles per hour. This, of course, was misdirection.\nI have also come to the conclusion that there was misdirection in the charge where the jury were told that the respondent was under no obligation to have the lights on his automobile burning. The learned trial judge continued:\u2014\nAs I remember it, every witness said that they could see one hundred yards. Why would lights need be on if you could see one hundred yards without lights. There is no law in this province requiring lights on under those circumstances,\u2014that is, at any rate, after dawn and before dusk,\u2014during the day-time. This was really withdrawing from the jury another allegation of negligence made by the appellant against the respondent, and this defect was not cured by other passages in the charge.\nObjection was taken by the appellant that the jury had been given a wrong basis for the calculation of damages,\u2014damages of both parties,\u2014when the trial judge told them to be generous. This was probably corrected when the jury were recalled and they were told that they should not, in that connection, be unreasonable.\nUnder section 27 of the Ontario Judicature Act a new trial is not to be granted on the ground of misdirection \u201cunless some substantial wrong or miscarriage has been thereby occasioned.\u201d I take it that it was really on this ground that the Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment at the trial, because Mr. Justice Riddell, after pointing out\nthat it would have been well had the learned judge been more explicit on the question of negligence and drawn the attention of the jury to the necessity and obligation of other duty in respect of care according to the circumstances of the case,\ncontinues:\u2014\nBut we are unable to see that this resulted in injury to the case of the defendant.\nWith great respect, I find myself unable to agree with this conclusion. The appellant was entitled to a finding from the jury, not merely on the question of the negligence of the driver of his own car but also on the question of the negligence of the respondent, and in particular as to whether both drivers were negligent. Two allegations of negligence on the part of the respondent were really withdrawn from the consideration of the jury, and the Court should not place itself in the position of attempting to determine what, on a proper direction, would be solely within the province of the jury on these vital matters.\nThe appellant is entitled to his costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal and to this Court. The costs of the first trial should abide the result of the new trial.\nDAVIS J.\u2014The directions of the learned trial judge virtually withdrew from the jury a consideration by them of the vital question as to the degree of care reasonably to be expected from both drivers under the fog conditions existing at the time.\nThe appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed. The appellant is entitled to the costs of his appeal to the Court of Appeal and to this Court. The costs of the first trial should abide the event of the new trial.\nHUDSON J.\u2014I agree that the appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed on the ground of misdirection of the jury by the learned trial judge. I refrain from making any observations in regard to the evidence.\nAppeal allowed with costs; new trial ordered.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Johnston, Grant, Dods, Smily & Adams.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.D. Conover.\n"

MacIntosh v. MacIntosh, 54 N.B. Rep. 145, and Hyman v. Hyman, [1929] A.C. 601, at 614, cited.\nRespondent, who had been granted a decree of divorce from her husband on the ground of adultery, petitioned for an order for permanent alimony. This was refused by the trial judge (Judge of the Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes) on the ground that the facts did not justify it. His judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, which awarded permanent alimony (13 M.P.R. 524); and its judgment was now upheld by this Court (per the Chief Justice and Kerwin and Hudson JJ.; Rinfret and Crocket JJ. dissenting as to said award in this case). Per Kerwin J.: Respondent was entitled to alimony unless some legal ground may be found upon which to base a refusal. Any discretion that may have been vested in the trial judge is a judicial discretion and the mere fact that he determined not to grant alimony does not absolve appellate courts from examining the record to see if that discretion was properly exercised. On the facts shown by the evidence, respondent was not disentitled to alimony.\nPer Hudson J.: Plaintiff is entitled to alimony on the grounds stated by Le Blanc J. in the Appeal Division (13 M.P.R. 524, at 545-552).\nPer Rinfret and Crocket JJ. (dissenting): The Judge of the Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes has the right to refuse to award alimony to a wife upon a decree of divorce on the ground of her husband's adultery; and an appellate court is not justified in interfering with his discretion unless it plainly appears that that discretion was not judicially exercised. In the present case the trial judge's discretion was properly exercised in refusing upon the evidence to make an order for permanent alimony, and the Appeal Division was not justified in reversing his decision. (As to consideration of wife's earnings or means, especially where the parties have long lived apart, Goodheim v. Goodheim, 30 L.J. (P. M. & A.) 162, Burrows v. Burrows, L.R. 1 P. & D. 554, George v.

Russell, [1897] A.C. 395, cited).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division[1], which (Baxter C.J. dissenting), reversing the judgment of Grimmer J., Judge of the Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes, awarded to the present respondent (who had been granted a decree of divorce) permanent alimony to be paid by her husband, the present appellant. Special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted (subject to terms) by the Appeal Division.\nC. J. Jones K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. J. F. Winslow K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice\u2014I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Crocket JJ. (holding that there was jurisdiction in the New Brunswick Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes to award permanent alimony, but dissenting on the ground that the judgment of the judge of that court in refusing to grant it in this case should not have been reversed by the Appeal Division) was delivered by\nCrocket J.\u2014On December 6th, 1937, Mr. Justice Grimmer, sitting as Judge of the Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes of the Province of New Brunswick, at the suit of the respondent granted a decree dissolving the respondent's marriage to the appellant, which had been solemnized on July 10th, 1907, on the ground of adultery, the appelant not having appeared or defended the action.\nThereupon she filed a petition for an order for permanent maintenance or alimony, which, after an answer had been filed by the appellant, came on for hearing before the learned judge in May, 1938. The appellant himself gave no evidence on this hearing; only the respondent and one other witness in her behalf gave evidence. His Lordship, having taken the matter under consideration, later gave judgment refusing the prayer of the respondent's petition on the ground that no cruelty, force or coercion had been exercised by her husband to justify her in leaving him, as she did, in 1928, and that she was quite able to support herself, as she had done for more than eight years before she brought her action for divorce.\nThe respondent appealed from this judgment to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court. On the hearing of this appeal, the Appeal Division remitted the case to the trial judge \"for hearing of evidence that might have been adduced at the trial.\" In pursuance of this order the case again came before the learned trial judge when both parties were represented by counsel. His Lordship, commenting upon the terms of the order of the Appeal Court, said he did not know what his position was exactly. \"There is a judgment,\" he said,\nwhich is res judicata. Whether that is to be wiped out and we are to go on de novo or just where I am at I do not know. There is nothing in the order of the Court\u2014it is remitted to the judge to hear evidence that might have been adduced at the trial and evidently was not adduced. What I am to do is to take evidence; whether we are to begin in the middle of the previous proceedings, at the beginning of it or at the foot of it, revoke or cancel the judgment and begin de novo I do not know.\nCounsel for the respondent then proceeded to examine the respondent, who was subjected to a long cross-examination by counsel for the appellant. The appellant was then sworn and examined by his counsel and cross-examined by counsel for the respondent. Two other witnesses were also examined. No further judgment appears to have been given in the Court of Divorce, but the evidence taken on the further hearing before the trial judge, having been reported to the Appeal Division, the case was re-argued there in February, 1939, with the result that the appeal was allowed and judgment entered (per LeBlanc and Harrison, JJ., Baxter, C.J., dissenting) for the appellant, ordering the respondent to pay to the appellant the sum of $40 per month during the lifetime of the appellant.\nIt is from this judgment that the appeal now comes before us.\nTwo main grounds were urged in support of the appeal: first, that the New Brunswick Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes possesses no jurisdiction on the granting of a decree for divorce a vinculo matrimonii to award permanent alimony or maintenance; and, second, that, if it does possess such jurisdiction, it lies entirely in the discretion of the judge of that court to award or to refuse it on granting a decree at the suit of the wife, and that there is nothing to indicate that in refusing it in the present case he did not exercise that discretion judicially.\nAs to the first ground, the origin of the jurisdiction of the New Brunswick Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes is found in an Act of the General Assembly of that province, cap. 5, 31 George III (1791), intituled \"An Act for regulating Marriage and Divorce, and for preventing and punishing Incest, Adultery, and Fornication.\" Sec. 5 of that Act provided that\nall causes, suits, controversies, matters, and questions, touching and concerning Marriage, and contracts of Marriage, and Divorce, as well from the bond of matrimony, as divorce, and separation, from bed and board, and alimony, shall, and may be heard, and determined, by, and before the Governor, or Commander in Chief of this Province, and His Majesty's Council,\nand constituted the Governor or Commander in Chief and Council aforesaid or any five or more of the said Council together with the Governor or Commander in Chief as President, \"a Court of Judicature, in the matters and premises aforesaid, with full authority, power, and jurisdiction, in the same.\" Sec. 9 of that Act provided that the causes of divorce from the bond of matrimony and of dissolving and annulling marriage are and shall be frigidity, or impotence, adultery, and consanguinity within the degrees prohibited in and by an Act of Parliament made in the thirty-second year of the reign of Henry VIII, intituled \"An Act for marriages to stand, notwithstanding precontracts,\" and no other causes whatsoever.\nShortly after this Act came into force the Court of the Governor and Council promulgated a number of practice and procedure rules, applying to all citations, libels, answers, their service, filing, etc. These rules applied to all divorce suits alike, whether for dissolution of the bond of matrimony, for separation from bed and board, or for annulment. The Court of the Governor and Council continued to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it by this Act until the year 1860, when an Act was passed by the Legislature of the Province, cap. 37 of 23 Vict., constituting a new Court of Record under the name of the Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes, and transferring to it \"all jurisdiction now vested in or exercisable by the Court of Governor in Council\" under the authority of the first-mentioned statute\nin respect of suits, controversies and questions concerning marriage, and contracts of marriage, and divorce, as well from the bond of matrimony as divorce and separation from bed and board, and alimony.\nThe Act of 1860 was intituled \"An Act to amend the Law relating to Divorce and Matrimonial Causes.\" It provided that the Governor in Council should appoint one of the Judges of the Supreme Court to be the judge of the newly established court, and that he should have power and authority to hear and determine all causes and matters cognizable therein, subject to appeal to the Supreme Court, whose decision should be final. It provided by sec. 10 that the practice and proceedings of the said court should be\nconformable as near as may be to the practice of the Ecclesiastical Court in England, prior to an Act of Parliament made and passed in the year 1857, intituled An Act to amend the Law relating to Divorce and Matrimonial Causes in England, subject however to the provisions of this Act, and the existing rules, orders and practice as now established in the Court of Governor and Council in this Province.\nThe court; was empowered to make rules and regulations concerning the practice and procedure, and the forms to be used under the Act, and to regulate the fees payable on all proceedings, and to alter or revoke the same or any of them as may from time to time be considered necessary. It also provided that all parts of the original Act, cap. 5 of 31 George III, 1791, as were inconsistent with the provisions of the new Act should be repealed as soon as the latter came into operation on July 1st, 1860.\nIn 1869 further rules of practice were promulgated by the then Judge of the Court. Like those formerly promulgated by the Governor and Council, these later rules made no distinction between suits for divorce, whether for dissolution of the bond of matrimony or for divorce and separation from bed and board or for annulment, though No. 5 of these rules provided that every libel containing a claim for alimony shall state the property or income of the husband. The forms of the citation and libel will be found at pp. 249 and 250 respectively of Earle's Supreme Court Rules and it will there be observed that both the citation and the libel are made to apply to suits of divorce from the bond of matrimony for adultery.\nThis last Act was re-enacted as cap. 50 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick (1877) without any substantial change in any of the provisions I have quoted. The only alteration made in the Consolidation of 1877 which could have any possible bearing upon the point now under review will be found in sec. 3 requiring the practice and proceedings in the court to conform to the practice of the Ecclesiastical Court in England, whereby different words are substituted for the concluding words of sec. 10 of the original Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act. For the words\nsubject however to the provisions of this Act and the existing rules, orders and practice as now established in the Court of Governor and Council in this Province\nthe words\nsubject however to the provisions of this chapter, and such rules and orders as are now in force in the said court, and consistent with the provisions of this chapter, whether such rules and orders were made by the said court or by the Court of Governor and Council\nwere substituted. In addition to this change, cap. 50 of the Consolidation of 1877 did away with the declaration contained in the original Act of 1860 that the decision of the Supreme Court from any decision of the Divorce Court should be final, and by sec. 17 declared that from any decision of the Supreme Court of the Province in such a suit an appeal\nmay be made to Her Majesty in Her Majesty's Privy Council, under such rules and regulations as Her Majesty may prescribe, or to any other Court of Appeal having jurisdiction.\nThe provisions of both ss. 3 and 17 of the Consolidation of 1877 were re-enacted in cap. 115 of the Consolidated Statutes of the Province in 1903 and again in the Revised Statutes of 1927, without any change whatever, as were all of the provisions of the original Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act of 1860, in so far as those provisions related to the jurisdiction or powers of that court, and these enactments are still the recognized law of the Province.\nHaving regard to the jurisdiction of the Governor and Council in respect of the subject of Marriage and Divorce, as defined in cap. 5 of 31 George III, 1791, and the transfer of that entire jurisdiction to the Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes, as constituted by cap. 37 of 23 Vict., and to the fact that this jurisdiction has been exercised by the latter court under rules of practice and procedure, promulgated by the judge thereof as well as by the original Court of the Governor and Council, for now nearly 80 years, both in suits for dissolution from the bond of matrimony, as well as for divorce from bed and board, without any distinction being discoverable either in the provisions of the original Act or of the Act of 1860 and its re-enactments as to the application of the court's express jurisdiction over alimony to both classes of divorce, I find it impossible to assent to the contention that it was the intention of these Acts that the court should not have the power to award alimony except upon a decree for divorce a mensa et thoro as in the Ecclesiastical Courts of England prior to the enactment of the English Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857. Prior to the last mentioned Act the Ecclesiastical Courts had no power to grant any decree for a divorce a vinculo matrimonii. This could be done only by a special Act of the Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland, which, of course, possessed the power to grant or withhold permanent alimony or maintenance to a petitioning wife in its discretion, according to the circumstances of the particular case dealt with. When \"The Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes\" was established in England in 1857 and invested by 20 & 21 Vict., c. 85, with jurisdiction to dissolve marriages upon any of the grounds specified in sec. 27, as well as with jurisdiction to pronounce decrees for judicial separation (but not for divorce a mensa et thoro, though providing that a decree for a judicial separation should have the same force and the same consequences as a divorce a mensa et thoro then had), and all other jurisdiction formerly exercisable by the Ecclesiastical Courts of England, except in respect of marriage licences, the newly established court was empowered, \"if it shall think fit, on any such decree\" to order that the husband should to its satisfaction\nsecure to the wife such gross sum of money, or such annual sum of money for any term not exceeding her own life, as, having regard to her fortune (if any), to the ability of the husband, and to the conduct of the parties, it shall deem reasonable,\nand also upon any petition for dissolution of marriage to make interim orders for payment of money by way of alimony or otherwise as it would have in a suit instituted for judicial separation. (See sec. 32 of 20 & 21 Vict., c. 85).\nIt is pointed out in Browne & Watts on Divorce (10th ed.), 1924, in its chapter on Alimony and Maintenance that the English Divorce Court as established in 1857 derived its power to order alimony\u2014whether pendente lite or permanent\u2014in cases other than suits for dissolution, from sec. 6 of 20 & 21 Vict., ch. 85, by which all jurisdiction then vested in the Ecclesiastical Courts in respect of all causes, suits and matters matrimonial, including suits of nullity of marriage, was transferred to the Divorce Court. So that it would appear that even the Ecclesiastical Courts, before the transfer of their jurisdiction to the English Divorce Court, were empowered to award alimony, not only to the petitioning or respondent wife on decreeing a separation from bed and board in the case of a still subsisting marriage, but to award alimony to the de facto wife upon a decree declaring her marriage to have been null and void ab initio, and that this jurisdiction passed to the English Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes in virtue of sec. 6 of the Act of 1857. How then can it be held that \"alimony\" as used in the New Brunswick Acts of 1791 and 1860 must be confined to an award made to a woman who still maintains her status as wife in a suit for a divorce a mensa et thoro? Assuming, however, that that is the true interpretation of the word \"alimony,\" as applicable to the Ecclesiastical Courts of England, or to the English Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes, it is quite another matter to say that the word carries the same meaning in the New Brunswick Acts referred to. If that were so, the New Brunswick Court would be without jurisdiction upon or after pronouncing a decree either for dissolution or nullity of any marriage to make provision in any circumstances for the support or maintenance of the petitioning or respondent wife. As I have already pointed out, the existing New Brunswick Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes derives its jurisdiction to dissolve or annul marriages, as well as to decree separation from bed and board, and alimony, from the original Act of 1791, which makes no reference whatever to the Ecclesiastical Courts of England, and the requirement of the present Act that the practice and proceedings of the Court shall be conformable as near as may be to the former practice of the Ecclesiastical Court in England before the enactment of the English Divorce Act has no application where the provisions of the New Brunswick Act or any rules or orders, whether made by the existing Court or the original Court of Governor and Council, otherwise provide.\nThe jurisdiction of the New Brunswick Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes to award alimony upon the granting of a decree for the dissolution of marriage on the ground of adultery was never questioned until it was challenged in the Appeal Division upon an appeal from a decree dissolving the marriage of one MacIntosh, at the suit of his wife. That case was tried before me during my term of office as Judge of the Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes. While granting the petitioning wife the decree prayed for, I refused to grant permanent alimony to her in the special circumstances of the case[2]. In the Appeal Court the respondent's counsel, among other grounds, raised the point that the trial court had no jurisdiction to grant permanent alimony or maintenance in cases brought for the dissolution of marriage. The Appeal Court[3] unanimously refused to interfere with the discretion exercised by the trial judge in refusing alimony, but, in view of the far-reaching effects which a decision sustaining the contention of the respondent's counsel that the Divorce Court possessed no power to grant permanent alimony in any suit for the dissolution of marriage would have, not only upon future litigation, but upon cases where alimony had been granted in actions of divorce for adultery, decided to give judgment upon that question. White, J., in delivering the judgment of the court said[4]:\nIt is difficult to suppose that the Legislature, in enacting that adultery should be a ground for dissolution of the matrimonial bond, intended to leave the guilty husband in the full enjoyment of the property obtained from his wife by marriage, and at the same time to relieve him from all liability to provide by alimony for his wife's maintenance. If that was the intention of the Legislature, the result would be that the wife could only obtain a divorce for adultery by completely impoverishing herself. I cannot believe that such was the intention of the Act.\nSuch being the construction which the New Brunswick Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes has consistently placed upon the enactment from which it derives its jurisdiction ever since its constitution in the year 1860, as an examination of its records by a former registrar of the court disclosed before the unfortunate destruction of many of them in the year 1936, and the pronouncement of the Appeal Division in the MacIntosh case (I) in 1927 having been since accepted as deciding the question of the jurisdiction of the New Brunswick Divorce Court to award permanent alimony or maintenance in suits for dissolution from the bond of matrimony on the ground of adultery, we should hesitate, even if the language of the enactment in question in connection with other relevant provisions of the Act and the rules of court made thereunder were such as to make the point doubtful, to now place a different construction upon it. So far as I am concerned, I cannot perceive how any other construction than that upon which the New Brunswick Divorce Court has always acted could reasonably be placed upon the jurisdiction, which the Legislature conferred upon it in respect of suits for divorce from the bond of matrimony. As Lord Hailsham, L.C., considering an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal to the House of Lords in the case of Hyman v. Hyman[5], in which a decree for dissolution of marriage had been granted by the English Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes on the ground of the husband's adultery, said[6]:\nThe power of the Court to make provision for a wife on the dissolution of her marriage is a necessary incident of the power to decree such a dissolution.\nLord Buckmaster in the same case, said that the phrase \"alimony or maintenance,\" as used in the English Divorce Act of 1867 and its amendments, was in his opinion \"a legal pleonasm rather than a legal exactitude.\"\nAs to the second ground, it cannot, I think, be questioned that the Judge of the Divorce Court has the right, if he sees fit to exercise it, to refuse to award alimony to a wife upon a decree dissolving her marriage on the ground of her husband's adultery, and that an Appeal Court is justified in interfering with the trial judge's discretion only when it plainly appears that that discretion was not judicially exercised. As already pointed out, the English Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes was empowered by sec. 32 of 20 & 21 Vict., cap. 85, to order alimony or maintenance on such a decree only \"if it should think fit,\" and, if it should choose to award any alimony at all, it was required to have regard to the fortune and ability of the husband, as well as to the conduct of the parties, in fixing the amount it should deem reasonable in the circumstances It was in no way fettered in suits for dissolution by the principles or rules upon which the Ecclesiastical Courts had formerly acted, even with regard to interim orders for the payment of alimony pendente lite, as it was in all other suits, in respect of which the jurisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Courts was transferred to it, and whose decisions were consequently supposed to be binding upon it.\nIn 1861, however, in Goodheim v. Goodheim[7], Sir Cresswell Cresswell, sitting in the Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes as Judge Ordinary, and dealing with a petition for alimony pendente lite and the contention put forward in behalf of the petitioning wife that her earnings ought not to be taken into consideration in awarding alimony, inasmuch as the Ecclesiastical Courts never did so, pointed out that in questions of alimony the Ecclesiastical Courts always acted on the assumption that the wife had nothing and the husband everything. \"Such a principle,\" he said,\nis inapplicable where the wife is actually earning money, as alleged in the answer to the petition. If the husband were earning a salary of \u00a3100 a year as a tutor in a family, and the wife were earning an equal salary as a governess in another family, it would be absurd to hold that alimony should be awarded to her, without taking her income into consideration.\nOn these grounds he declined to make any order for alimony pendente lite. And this, notwithstanding the express provision of sec. 22 of the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857, that in all suits and proceedings, other than proceedings to dissolve any marriage, the said court\nshall proceed and act and give relief on principles and rules which in the opinion of the said court shall be as nearly as may be conformable to the principles and rules on which the Ecclesiastical Courts have heretofore acted and given relief, but subject to the provisions herein contained and to the rules and orders under this Act.\nIt should be noted in this connection that sec. 12 of the New Brunswick Court of Divorce Act, as it now appears in cap. 115 of the R.S.N.B., 1927, under the heading of \"procedure,\" that that section does not require the New Brunswick Court to \"proceed and act and give relief on principles and rules,\" which shall be conformable as near as may be to the principles and rules on which the Ecclesiastical Courts of England formerly proceeded and acted, but that\nthe practice and proceedings of the court shall be conformable, as near as may be, to the practice of the Ecclesiastical Court in England prior to the enactment of the English Divorce and Matrimonial\nCauses Act, and then,\nsubject however to the provisions of this chapter, and such rules and orders as are now in force in the court, and consistent with the provisions of this chapter, whether such rules and orders were made by the court or by the said Court of Governor in Council.\nRule 66 of the rules of that court expressly provides that the Judge upon an application for maintenance shall make such order as he shall think fit, though the Judge of the court before the promulgation of the said rule had always had the right to grant or refuse alimony or maintenance, either pendente lite or permanent, in virtue of the transfer to it of the \"full authority, power and jurisdiction\" of the Court of Governor and Council, and of the provisions of the Act of 1860, constituting the present court, as has already appeared.\nThe principle laid down by Sir Cresswell Cresswell in the Goodheim case[8] in 1861 has ever since been consistently followed by the courts of England in respect of alimony pendente lite.\nIn Burrows v. Burrows[9]\u2014a case in which the parties had been living separate for several years and the wife admitted that she lived with her son and acted as his housekeeper and that he allowed her \u00a330 a year\u2014Lord Penzance, sitting as Judge Ordinary, refused to make an order for alimony pendente lite in a suit by a wife for judicial separation on the grounds of adultery and cruelty.\nIn George v. George[10], in the same volume of the Law Reports, in which it was proved that the wife, who was suing for dissolution of marriage, had been living separate and apart from her husband for several years, was in service and received \u00a314 a year wages, besides being provided with board and lodging, Lord Penzance said:\nThe wife is able to support herself by means of her own exertions, and she has long lived apart from her husband without an allowance. If I were to allot alimony, I should be placing her in a better position than she was in before she instituted this suit. I shall therefore make no order for alimony.\nIn the same volume of the Law Reports at p. 610 will be found another case, Holt v. Holt[11]\u2014where the husband was suing for dissolution of marriage\u2014in which Lord Penzance said:\nI think the husband ought not to be called on to pay alimony for the time during which the wife had other means of support. * * * The ground upon which the court proceeds is, that she was living in such a manner that she had means of support independent of her husband.\nIn Bass v. Bass[12]\u2014which was an appeal from an order of Baxgrave Deane, J., suspending an order for alimony made: by the registrar of the court, and giving the husband leave to cross-examine the wife on her affidavit in support of an application for alimony pendente lite in a suit brought by her husband for divorce on the ground of her adultery, Kennedy, L.J., in his reasons in the Court of Appeal said:\nTurning now to the question of alimony, it appears to me to be also clear that this question depends upon the possession or non-possession by the wife of sufficient means of support; and it is only right that, if the husband is called upon to provide maintenance by way of alimony, it should be open to him to prove, if he can, that the wife has no need of that alimony, the quantum of which, if granted, will depend on such considerations as the income of the husband. The question whether the wife has sufficient means of support is the main issue on which the grant of alimony depends. * * * It may be that this source [the respondent's means of support] is the co-respondent, but it is impossible not to accede to the argument that the husband must have an opportunity before the registrar to show that his wife has sufficient support.\nSwinfen Eady, L.J., said he was of the same opinion. \"The husband,\" he added,\nobjects to. paying it [alimony pendente lite] on the short ground that the wife has sufficient means of support independently of him. It cannot be disputed that, if that be so, it would not be proper to order the husband to pay alimony pendente lite, and the authorities have gone so far as to decide in terms in Madan v. Madan[13], a case stating the practice of the court and decided so long ago as 1867, that \"if the husband can prove that his wife has sufficient means of support independent of him, even although they be derived from the co-respondent, she will not be entitled to an allotment of alimony,\" the principle being that maintenance should be provided by the husband for his wife, but that if she has it already, whether from the co-respondent or any one else, the husband ought not to be ordered to pay alimony.\nBrowne & Watts (10th ed., 1924, at p. 148) cites these and other cases as authority for its statement that:\nIn allotting alimony pendente lite the wife's earnings and power of maintaining herself must be taken into consideration, especially where the parties are very poor.\nWhere the husband and wife have been living apart for many years, and the wife has been supporting herself, and is still able to do so, alimony pendente lite will not be allotted, except under special circumstances.\nWhere the wife has sufficient means of support independent of the husband, even although they be derived from the co-respondent, she will not be entitled to an allotment of alimony.\nThat this long established principle of the English courts was one of the reasons of the learned trial judge's refusal to award permanent alimony or maintenance in the case at bar cannot be doubted. He explicitly found upon the petitioner's own evidence that she lived separate and apart from her husband for a very long time\u2014nearly nine years\u2014and was quite able to support herself and was still quite able to do so, and that no special circumstances were presented by her disclosing any change in her condition or position in life, and added that, while he might be in error, and subject to correction, he understood\nthe rule of this Court that has been followed for a very long time is that when husband and wife have been living separate and apart for many years and the wife has been supporting herself and is still able to do so, that help such as is asked for in this case will not be allotted except under special circumstances.\nIn fact he cited George v. George[14], above referred to.\nThis, however, was not his only reason. He coupled with it the fact that the petitioner had unnecessarily and unjustifiably left her husband's home in November, 1928, without any cruelty, force or coercion having been exercised by her husband to compel her to leave him and that she lived quite independently of him without even asking for any aid: or assistance from him during the nearly nine years which intervened before filing her petition for divorce.\nHis Lordship, in finding that the petitioner was not justified in separating herself from her husband in 1928, undoubtedly was acting upon the authority of two well known decisions of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, which firmly established in that Province the long recognized rule of the Ecclesiastical Courts of England, as well as of the House of Lords, that no conduct, which falls short of legal cruelty, will be recognized by the courts as justifying the separation of husband and wife, and that to constitute such legal cruelty there must be \"either actual bodily hurt or injury to health or such acts or circumstances as are likely to produce an apprehension of such hurt or injury.\" See judgment of Barker, C.J., in Currey v. Currey[15], where he said: \"This is substantially the rule acted upon by this Court in Hunter v. Hunter\"[16].\nIn both these New Brunswick cases there was evidence, not only of hopeless incompatibility, of mutual dislike, aversion and hatred between the parties and of rude and abusive language, but of actual physical violence used by the husband against the wife in the heat of passion, though not causing actual bodily harm; yet the court in the first case unanimously held that in the circumstances, as it and the trial judge viewed them, there was no such cruelty as would justify a court in decreeing separation. In the Currey case[17], nearly fifty years later, the New Brunswick Supreme Court, while dividing 3-3 upon the question of whether the husband's conduct was such as to be likely to produce an apprehension of such bodily hurt or injury to health, if the wife continued to live with him, unanimously held that the learned trial judge (McKeown, J.) was right in accepting Russell v. Russell[18], in holding that the judgment of Lord Stowell in Evans v. Evans[19] correctly laid down \"the rule by which the Divorce Court must be governed as to what in point of law constituted legal cruelty.\"\nFor my part, in view of these decisions, by which he was bound, I cannot perceive how it can properly be said that the learned trial judge in the present case, in finding that upon the evidence adduced before him there was no necessity or justification for the petitioner leaving her husband's home and continuing to live quite independently of him for a period of nearly nine years before the institution of her suit for divorce, did not judicially determine that question.\nThe principles so firmly established by the powerful reasoning of Lord Stowell, sitting as the judge of the Consistory Court of London in the Evans case19 in 1790, that there must be danger to life, limb or health, bodily or mentally, or a reasonable apprehension of it, is still the recognized law of England, as it is of the Province of New Brunswick. Hard and inhumane as it may appear to the modern mind, the Courts of England have to this day consistently rejected repeated appeals to change it for the sake of the happiness of the parties in particular suits. More than one hundred years later the House of Lords, by a majority of the Law Lords (Lords Herschell, Watson, Macnaghten, Shand and Davey) in the celebrated Russell case18 distinctly reaffirmed it, notwithstanding the passage of the Divorce Act of 1857, by which it was urged a new ground for separation and a new practice had been created, and refused to accept the proposition that the long recognized rule should be enlarged so as to include such conduct, either on the part of the wife or on the part of the husband, as renders their future marital cohabitation hopeless and impossible. Lord Herschell in his reasons said[20]:\nBut in laying down a proposition of law on such a subject as that with which your Lordships are dealing, it is necessary to keep in view the consequences, and not to contemplate only its operation in the particular case.\nAnd further, that the extension of the rule in the direction contended for\nwould afford no sort of guide, but would, in my opinion, unsettle the law and throw it into hopeless confusion. Views as to what is possible, or in this sense would differ most widely. Though in some instances most men would, no doubt, concur in their opinion, yet, speaking generally, the determination of the case would depend entirely upon the particular judge or jury before whom it might chance to come. Not a few would think that the discharge of the duties of married life was impossible whenever love had been replaced by hatred, when insulting and galling language was constantly used, when, in short, the ordinary marital relations no longer prevailed. * * * I have no inclination towards a blind adherence to precedents. I am conscious that the law must be moulded by adapting it on established principles to the changing conditions which social development involves. But marital misconduct is unfortunately as old as matrimony itself. Great as have been the social changes which have characterized the last century in this respect, there has been no alteration\u2014no new development. I think it is impossible to do otherwise than proceed upon the old lines.\nIn my opinion, the learned judge of the Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes properly exercised the discretion, which the law vested in him, in refusing upon the evidence adduced before him to make an order for permanent maintenance, and the Appeal Division was not justified in ignoring his decision and itself directing the order prayed for.\nThe appeal, while failing on the first ground, should be allowed on the second, the judgment of the Appeal Court set aside and that of the trial judge restored.\nNo order should be made as to costs.\nKerwin J.\u2014I agree with my brother Crocket that the New Brunswick Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes possesses jurisdiction to award permanent alimony (or maintenance) when granting a decree of divorce a vinculo matrimonii. This being so, I am of opinion that the petitioner, respondent, was entitled to alimony unless some legal ground may be found upon which to base a refusal. Any discretion that may have been vested in the trial judge is a judicial discretion and the mere fact that he determined not to grant alimony does not absolve appellate courts from examining the record to see if that discretion was properly exercised.\nThe evidence in the present case is not very satisfactory because, in my view, the trial judge refused to permit certain questions, put by counsel for the petitioner, to be answered by her. I agree, however, with the majority of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick that there is sufficient evidence to show that the petitioner is not disentitled to alimony. On the point as to her means, the evidence is ample to show that the petitioner really managed to subsist through the assistance, if not the charity, of her relatives, and the mere fact that for some years she did not ask the appellant to maintain her surely cannot disentitle her to the support she now requires. The evidence is also sufficient to show that the petitioner did not desert the respondent; on the contrary, to my mind, it shows that she was justified in leaving him even though she would not at that time be entitled to a divorce.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nHudson, J.\u2014I have had the privilege of reading the judgment in this appeal prepared by my brother Crocket and agree with his view that the Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes of New Brunswick has jurisdiction to grant alimony under the circumstances of this case.\nAfter carefully perusing the evidence and the record of the other proceedings in the action, I have come to the conclusion that the plaintiff is entitled to alimony on the grounds stated by Mr. Justice LeBlanc in the Court below[21].\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Jones & Jones.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.

If she should cease to occupy it as her home, she was to be paid $75,000 out of the general estate, the monthly allowance of $2,250 should cease and in lieu thereof she was to be paid $2,000 monthly during her widowhood. After the testator's death she continued to occupy Castle Frank as her residence and home.\nClause 4 of the will directed (inter alia) that \"all income taxes which may be payable in respect of the said above provisions for my wife shall be paid out of my estate by my trustees.\"\nThe testator's wife received also under the will (clause 16) a portion of the residuary estate and the income (not given free from income tax), during life and widowhood respectively, from two other portions thereof. Also she had income of her own.\nUnder the income taxing Acts, the tax is computed by applying, to the whole net income of the tax-payer, rates which increase on a gradual scale as the amount of the net income increases, and by imposing a surtax on incomes exceeding a certain amount. Therefore the testator's widow paid a higher rate because of the addition of her benefits under clause 3 of the will (so far as they were assessable as income against her) to her income from other sources. Also, under said taxing Acts, the sum paid by the trustees for income tax as directed by clause 4 of the will, is treated as part of her income.\nThe questions in issue arose under said clauses 3 and 4 of the will and had to do with the extent to which the testator's widow was entitled to be indemnified by the trustees in respect of income taxes assessed against her.\nHeld: The trustees must repay to the testator's widow under clause 4 of the will only such proportion of the whole of the income tax assessed against her in respect of each year's income under each Statute imposing an income tax upon her income, as the total amount expended or paid out in such year by the trustees under the provisions of clause 3 and of clause 4 of the will (to the extent that the same is or is deemed to be assessable as income against her under the provisions of such Statute) bears to the total amount which is or is deemed to be assessable as income against her in such year under the provisions of such Statute. (Rinfret and Davis JJ. did not feel justified in taking a contrary view to the judgments in In re Bowring, [1918] W.N. 265, and the Fleetwood-Hesketh case, [1929] 2 K.B. 55, which, though not binding on this Court, carry the greatest weight. Were it not for those judgments, they would have held (as was held by McTague J., [1939] O.R. 59, before whom the questions came in the first instance) that the amount of the allowance to the testator's widow for the maintenance and management of Castle Frank (which under the will are paid upon a condition) should not increase the burden of her income taxes beyond the amount which she would have had to pay in any year, were such allowance not received by her).\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1939] O.R. 245, varied to the extent that (by effect of above holding) the trustees must (subject to the principle of an apportionment as above) indemnify the testator's widow against any tax payable in respect of the sum paid by the trustees under clause 4 of the will for income tax. (The holding below that the deductions and exemptions allowed under the taxing Acts are to be calculated as belonging to and intended for the exclusive benefit of the testator's widow\u2014subject to an apportionment, by consent, with regard to deductions in respect of charitable donations\u2014was not disturbed).\nAPPEAL by Lady Kemp, widow of, and a beneficiary under the will of, Sir Albert Edward Kemp, deceased, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing the appeal of certain residuary beneficiaries under the said will from the judgment of McTague J.[2], on an application by the executors and trustees of the will, by way of originating motion, for an order construing and interpreting the will and for the opinion, advice and direction of the Court upon certain questions arising out of the trusts declared in and by the will.\nClauses 3 and 4 of the will read as follows:\n3. I GIVE AND DEVISE to my said Trustees my residence and lands in the City of Toronto, known as \"Castle Frank,\" including houses, out-houses and other buildings thereon, and all the appurtenances used and enjoyed therewith (all of which are to be understood as being included in the term \"Castle Frank\") upon the following trusts:\n(a) During the lifetime of my wife, Virginia, so long as she shall remain my widow, and so long as she desires to make use of the same as her residence, to keep up Castle Frank in a suitable condition for that purpose; and. all costs and charges for the payment of taxes, insurance and for repairs, renewals and other like expenditures for the proper structural upkeep of the said houses and buildings shall be borne by my estate and be paid by my Trustees.\n(b) To allow my said wife during her lifetime, and so long as she shall remain my widow, to occupy Castle Frank as her home and residence, free of rent.\n(c) The furniture, plate, pictures and other personal chattels constituting the ordinary contents of said house at the time of my death, I give and bequeath to my wife, together with any automobile or automobiles which I may then own.\n(d) While my said wife shall occupy Castle Frank as her home and residence, my Trustees shall also bear the expense of the maintenance and management thereof; and to cover such cost, my Trustees shall pay to my wife the sum of Two Thousand Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($2,250) each month in advance so long as she continues to reside in Castle Frank and to use it as her home.\n(e) If my wife shall cease to occupy Castle Frank as her home for any of the reasons aforesaid, I desire my said Trustees to raise out of my general estate the sum of Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000), which sum will enable her, if she so desires, to purchase or build or otherwise provide a suitable house for herself, including the necessary land in connection therewith, and to pay the said sum to my wife as soon as conveniently may be after she shall inform my Trustees of her desire to give up her occupation of Castle Frank; the said sum of Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000) is intended to be an absolute gift to my wife, and she shall not be obliged, unless she wishes to do so, to expend that sum or any part of it, in purchasing, building or otherwise acquiring any residence; the receipt of my wife therefor shall be an absolute discharge of my Trustees for the payment of the said sum of Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000).\n(f) Upon my said wife ceasing to occupy Castle Frank as her residence, the monthly allowance to her of Two Thousand Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($2,250) for the upkeep thereof, as provided in Paragraph 2 (d) of this Will, shall cease; and in that event, I give her in lieu thereof, and direct my Trustees to pay to her while she shall remain my widow, a monthly allowance of Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000).\n4. I DIRECT that the above provisions in favour of my wife shall be a first charge upon my estate, and shall be provided for and paid by my Trustees in priority to any other legacies payable under my said Will, and I further direct that any Succession Duties, and all income taxes which may be payable in respect of the said above provisions for my wife shall be paid out of my estate by my Trustees.\nBy another clause (16) of the will, Lady Kemp was given a one-sixteenth portion or share of the residuary estate, and the income, during her life, from a further one-sixteenth portion or share thereof, and the income, during her widowhood, from a one-eighth portion or share thereof. (These gifts were not expressed to be free from income tax). Also Lady Kemp had at the time of her marriage and at the time of the making of deceased's will and still has, an independent income of her own. The deceased's will was dated December 1, 1927. He died on August 12, 1929.\nThe questions raised on the application were as follows:\nQuestion (1) Are the amounts of income taxes which the Executors are directed under Clause 4 of the Will to repay to Lady Kemp, to be determined upon the footing\n(a) that Lady Kemp has no income apart from the income received under Clause 3 of the Will; or\n(b) that her income from any or all of the following sources is to enter into the computation,\n(1) sources outside the Will,\n(2) under Clause 16 of the Will,\n(3) the repayment of income tax under Clause 4?\nQuestion (II) If Question 1 (b) is in whole or part answered in the affirmative, must the Executors repay to Lady Kemp\n(a) the whole of the income tax payable by her, or\n(b) a proportion only of such income tax, and, if so, what proportion? Question (III) Must the Executors, in determining the amount of income tax which they are directed to repay to Lady Kemp, take into the computation\n(a) the whole of the deductions and exemptions allowed to her by the Income Tax Acts, or\n(b) a proportion only of such deductions and exemptions, and, if so, what proportion, or\n(c) no part of the said deductions and exemptions?\nQuestion (IV) Do the \"income taxes\" referred to in Clause 4 of the Will include all taxes from time to time imposed on income (including the Ontario Income Tax, first imposed in 1936) or only such taxes as were imposed on income at the date of the testator's death?\nQuestion (V) Are the income taxes which are repayable by the Executors to be paid by them out of capital or income of the estate or apportioned between capital and income and if so on what basis?\nMcTague J., in concluding his reasons for judgment, indicated his answers as follows:\nTherefore my answers to the questions will be in the following terms. Income taxes directed to be paid by the executors under clause 4 of the will are to be determined upon the footing that Lady Kemp's income includes income from sources outside of the will, income under clause 16 of the will and repayment on income tax under clause 4. The executors should repay to Lady Kemp all additional income tax which becomes payable by virtue of the income under clause 3 being superimposed upon her income from all other sources. Deductions and exemptions are to be taken as belonging to and for the benefit of Lady Kemp and not for the benefit of the executors, subject to this, that counsel for Lady Kemp has intimated that she is willing that the executors shall have the benefit of a proportion of the saving due to deduction for charitable donations. If counsel cannot agree on an appropriate term in the formal order to cover this concession, that matter may be spoken to. The words \"income taxes\" referred to in clause 4 of the will, include all income taxes from time to time on income and specifically include Ontario income tax. The income taxes repayable by the executors to Lady Kemp are to be paid out of income primarily and if there is a deficiency of income, then out of capital.\nAnd accordingly the formal order declared that the answers to the questions should be respectively as follows:\n(I) The amounts of income taxes which the Executors are directed under Clause 4 of the Will to repay to Lady Kemp are to be determined upon the footing that her income includes income from sources outside of the Will, income under Clause 16 of the Will, and the repayment of income tax tinder Clause 4 of the Will.\n(II) The Executors must repay to Lady Kemp all income tax levied against her in excess of the income tax which would have been levied against her if she were in receipt of no income under Clause 3 of the Will.\n(III) Deductions and exemptions allowed to Lady Kemp by the Income Tax Acts are to be calculated as belonging to and intended for the exclusive benefit of Lady Kemp and not for the benefit of the Executors, except that the executors shall be entitled in each year to that proportion of any deductions allowed to Lady Kemp in respect of charitable donations which the payments made to Lady Kemp under Clause 4 of the Will during such year bear to Lady Kemp's total income during such year.\n(IV) The words \"income taxes\" in Clause 4 of the Will include all income taxes from time to time imposed on income, and specifically include the Ontario Income Tax, imposed by Act of the Legislature of Ontario.\n(V) The income taxes repayable by the Executors to Lady Kemp are to be paid out of income primarily and in case of a deficiency of income, then out of capital.\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the judgment of McTague J. was varied, and in the formal order it was declared that the answers to the questions should respectively be as follows:\n(I) The amounts of income taxes which the executors are directed under Clause 4 of the will to repay to Lady Kemp are to be determined on the footing that her income consists of\n(a) payments made by the executors under Clause 3 of the will; (b) income under Clause 16 of the will;\n(c) repayment of income tax under Clause 4 of the will; and\n(d) income from all other sources;\nto the extent that all or any thereof are or are deemed to be assessable income of Lady Kemp under the provisions of any statute from time to time in force imposing income tax upon her income.\n(II) The executors must repay to Lady Kamp under Clause 4 of the will only such proportion of the whole of the income tax assessed against her in respect of each year's income under each Statute imposing an income tax upon her income, as the total amount expended or paid out in such year by the executors under the provisions of Clause 3 of the will (to the extent that the same is or is deemed to be assessable as income against Lady Kemp under the provisions of such Statute) bears to the total amount which is or is deemed to be assessable as income against Lady Kemp in such year under the provisions of such Statute. (III) Deductions and exemptions allowed to Lady Kemp by the Income Tax Acts are to be calculated as belonging to and intended for the exclusive benefit of Lady Kemp and not for the benefit of the Executors, except that the executors shall be entitled in each year to that proportion of any deductions allowed to Lady Kemp in respect of charitable donations which the payments made to Lady Kemp under Clause 4 of the will during such year bear to Lady Kemp's total income during such year.\n(IV) The words \"income taxes\" in Clause 4 of the will include all income taxes (which the Executors are required to repay to Lady Kemp as set forth in the answer to question II above) from time to time imposed on income, and specifically include the Ontario income tax imposed by Act of the Legislature of Ontario.\n(V) The income taxes repayable by the Executors to Lady Kemp are to be paid out of income primarily, and in case of deficiency of income then out of capital.\nOn appeal to this Court the judgment pronounced was as follows:\n\"The answer to question II is as follows:\nThe executors must repay to Lady Kemp under clause 4 of the will only such proportion of the whole of the income tax assessed against her in respect of each year's income under each Statute imposing an income tax upon her income, as the total amount expended or paid out in such year by the executors under the provisions of clause 3 and of clause 4 of the will (to the extent that the same is or is deemed to be assessable as income against Lady Kemp under the provisions of such Statute) bears to the total amount which is or is deemed to be assessable as income against Lady Kemp in such year under the provisions of such Statute.\n\"The judgment of the Court of Appeal will be varied accordingly. Subject to this variation the appeal is dismissed.\n\"The costs of appeal of all parties will be paid out of the estate, the costs of the executors as between solicitor and client.\"\nI. F. Hellmuth K.C. and G. B. Balfour K.C. for the appellant.\nH. C. F. Mockridge for adult respondents.\nJ. M. Baird K.C. for infant respondents.\nDonald M. Fleming for Executors, respondents.\nThe Chief Justice\u2014The pertinent words of clause 4 of the will are these:\nI direct * * * that all income taxes which may be payable in respect of the said above provisions for my wife shall be paid out of my estate by my Trustees. My conclusion is that the indemnity under clause 4 is a complete indemnity as to the part of Lady Kemp's income taxes in respect of which that clause takes effect.\nTo be precise, she is entitled in each year to be indemnified by the Trustees against (inter alia) any tax payable in respect of moneys received by her under the words of the clause quoted above.\nI should add that I agree with the Court of Appeal as to the principle by which the amount payable as indemnity under clause 4 is to be calculated; and I think that principle governs the calculation of the amount payable pursuant to the view herein expressed.\nThe formal order of the Court of Appeal should be amended accordingly.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Davis J J. was delivered by\nDavis J.\u2014No question of the liability of Lady Kemp for income taxes (either Dominion or provincial) in respect of the particular moneys in question is raised in this appeal. The only question is: To what extent is Lady Kemp entitled to be reimbursed by the trustees of her husband's will in respect of income taxes assessed against and paid by her on certain moneys received by her from the trustees under the said will?\nFrom the residuary part of her husband's estate she was given a one-sixteenth portion outright, the income from a further one-sixteenth portion so long as she lives, and the income from a further one-eighth portion so long as she remains the widow of Sir Edward Kemp. While the exact amounts are not disclosed in the material filed, it is admitted that they are very substantial amounts. No question is raised with respect to whatever income tax Lady Kemp may have to pay on that part of her total income which arises from these several sources; none of it is made free from income tax under the provisions of the will. Further, Lady Kemp had at the time of her marriage to Sir Edward Kemp, and retains, investments from which she receives additional income.\nThe question raised in these proceedings for the interpretation of the will is solely concerned with certain moneys that are paid to Lady Kemp by the trustees of her husband's will in respect of the maintenance and management of his large residential property in the City of Toronto known as \"Castle Frank.\" Sir Edward dealt with that property at the very commencement of his will. He devised it to his trustees upon certain trusts and refers to it as\nmy residence and lands in the City of Toronto, known as \"Castle Frank,\" including houses, out-houses and other buildings thereon, and all the appurtenances used and enjoyed therewith (all of which are to be understood as being included in the term \"Castle Frank\").\nDuring the lifetime of Lady Kemp, \"so long as she shall remain my widow, and so long as she desires to make use of the same as her residence,\" the trustees of the will are directed \"to keep up\" Castle Frank in a suitable condition for that purpose, and\nall costs and charges for the payment of taxes, insurance and for repairs, renewals and other like expenditures for the proper structural upkeep of the said houses and buildings shall be borne by my estate and be paid by my trustees.\nPermission is given to Lady Kemp during her lifetime so long as she remains Sir Edward's widow to occupy Castle Frank as her residence free of rent. The furniture, plate, pictures and other personal chattels \"constituting the ordinary contents of said house\" are given outright to Lady Kemp. Then follows this provision:\nWhile my said wife shall occupy Castle Frank as her home and residence, my trustees shall also bear the expense of the maintenance and management thereof; and to cover such cost, my trustees shall pay to my wife the sum of Two Thousand Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($2,250) each month in advance so long as she continues to reside in Castle Frank and to use it as her home.\nLady Kemp has been occupying Castle Frank as her home and residence and has been assessed for income tax in respect of her total annual income including the receipt by her of the amount of the allowance made for the maintenance and upkeep of the Castle Frank property.\nIt is important to observe that the particular language of the will is that while Lady Kemp shall occupy Castle Frank as her home and residence, the trustees of the will \"shall also bear\" the expense of \"the maintenance and management thereof\" and \"to cover such cost\" the trustees are to pay Lady Kemp $2,250 each month in advance. This provision, among others, in favour of Lady Kemp\nshall be a first charge upon my estate, and shall be provided for and paid by my trustees in priority to any other legacies payable under my said will, * * * and all income taxes which may be payable in respect of the said above provisions for my wife shall be paid out of my estate by my trustees.\nIt is perfectly plain that the testator's intention was that the amount of the allowance to the widow for the maintenance and management of the Castle Frank property should not be cut down in her hands by the imposition of any income tax. The effect of the language of the testator was that Lady Kemp was to be completely indemnified against all income taxes, in respect of the amount of that allowance that she might be called upon to pay.\nIt is con tended by counsel for Lady Kemp in effect that this money, which Sir Edward obviously considered necessary for the purpose for which it was provided, should be treated as in an air-tight compartment by itself and that the receipt of the amount of this allowance for the maintenance and management of Castle Frank should not increase the burden of income taxes payable by Lady Kemp over and above whatever amount she would have had to pay in any year were this allowance not received by her.\nOn the other hand, counsel for other residuary beneficiaries contended that the proper approach to the problem is to take Lady Kemp's total income from all sources in any year and the total amount of income taxes levied against her in respect thereof and, after ascertaining the proportion of the one to the other, apply that percentage or rate to that portion of her total income which is received as the allowance for the maintenance and management of the Castle Frank property.\nIf the latter contention prevails then it is perfectly plain, although the exact figures are not given to us, that Lady Kemp will not receive indemnity from the trustees for so much of the income tax she is required to pay in any year that she would not be required to pay but for the receipt of the amount of the allowance in question.\nThe moneys paid to Lady Kemp are not impressed with a trust but are paid upon a condition; and unless Lady Kemp is indemnified by the trustees for so much of her income tax as she would not otherwise be required to pay but for this allowance, the plain intention of her husband may be frustrated by judicial decision. We are not to look for some course that may appear to us to be more fair and equitable among all the members of the family than that which commended itself to and was plainly expressed by the testator. After all, in the interpretation of a particular will with its own particular language, very little assistance may be gained from decisions on other instruments and on other language. And if I may say so, with the greatest respect, the vice in some decisions on somewhat similar language is the approach made to the problem on the basis of determining whether the particular income should be regarded as \"the bottom slice\" or the \"upper slice\" or the \"middle slice\" of the total income of the person affected. That approach, it seems to me, is entirely unwarranted. It has led to the conclusion that the fair and equitable way of dealing with the matter is to take neither the bottom slice nor the upper slice, but to work out a general average which, for convenience, is sometimes spoken of as the middle slice. It seems to me that this approach to the solution of the problem may lead one entirely away from a testator's intention where it is plain that a particular sum for a particular purpose shall not be cut down in the hands of the recipient as a result of the imposition of income taxes. In such a case it may well be that the intended indemnity against income taxes occasioned by the receipt of the particular sum can only be complete when the indemnity goes to that sum of money which the recipient is required to pay in income taxes that would not be payable were it not for the receipt of the particular sum.\nThat was the conclusion of McTague, J., who heard the motion for interpretation in the first place, although he rather seemed to base his conclusion upon his view that the allowance arises out of some obligation on the part of Lady Kemp to reside in and keep up Castle Frank, and that, she having assumed such obligation, her husband's intention was that no income tax burden should be placed upon her as a result of her compliance with his wishes. With respect, however, I do not think that there is anything in the nature of an obligation upon Lady Kemp under the clause in question and that this case cannot be distinguished from other cases upon that ground. The Court of Appeal took a different view and followed the principle applied by Sargant J. (as he then was) in In re Bowring[3]. Lady Kemp appealed from that judgment to this Court. Were it not for the judgments of Sargant J. (as he then was) in the Bowring case[4] and of the Court of Appeal in the Fleetwood-Hesketh case[5], I would have accepted the contention of counsel for Lady Kemp. While those decisions are not binding upon us, they are judgments that carry the greatest weight and I do not feel justified in taking a contrary view. The principle is clearly stated by Lawrence, L.J., in the Fleetwood-Hesketh case5 at the foot of p. 58\u2014\" the proper way of apportioning\" the total tax \"between the parties is not to marshal\" the several parts of the total income so that some part \"may come first, and profit by the * * * lighter burden of the lower scale of payments and thus throw the burden of the heavier rate upon\" some other part, \"but to apportion the\" tax \"payable on the total income of the wife upon\" all the component parts of that income \"in the proportion which the amount of the one bears to the amount of the other.\" Sankey, L.J. (as he then was) agreed with that judgment. Greer, L.J., at p. 61, in referring to the sliding scale of rates for ascertaining the total super-tax payable, said it was\nmerely a convenient method of describing how the total amount payable on any given income is to be estimated, and not as a direction that the income is to be separated into slices, of which the lowest is to be free from super-fax and the highest is to bear the heaviest charge, and intermediate parts bear burdens graduated according to their relative positions.\nGreer, L.J., said further that he thought the decision of Sargant, J. (as he then was) in In re Bowring \"is useful as providing a formula.\"\nAnother point raised in the appeal was the question whether the indemnity applied to the tax upon the tax\u2014that is, whatever be the amount of the indemnity paid by the trustees in any year, that amount becomes taxable against Lady Kemp the next year as part of her total income\u2014and the question is whether the indemnity extends to the tax upon the tax. I think the authorities clearly indicate that it does. Michelham's Trustees v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue[6]. Sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 1 of the judgment of McTague J., as varied by the Court of Appeal, should be amended by adding the words \"and of clause 4\" after the words \"under the provisions of clause 3\" in the seventh line of the printed copy of the said sub-paragraph as the same appears on p. 35 of the Appeal case.\nThe variation sought by the respondents in their factum was not the matter of any appeal or cross-appeal on their part but in any event cannot be granted. I am satisfied that the order in respect of deductions and exemptions was a matter of consent.\nCrocket J.\u2014I agree with the Court of Appeal that there is nothing in paragraph 4 of this will to indicate that the testator intended that Lady Kemp should be relieved, not only of all liability to pay all income taxes in respect of the moneys payable to her under the provisions of paragraph 3 for the maintenance and upkeep of the Castle Frank property as her home and residence, but that the trustees should reimburse her as well for any increase in her own personal income tax rate, which should result from the addition to her own independent income by reason of the monthly and other payments made to her by the trustees under those provisions, or, in other words, that she should be indemnified at the expense of the residuary legatees for any and all moneys which she should be required to pay as income taxes upon her whole net income over and above the income taxes which would otherwise have been payable by her.\nThe relevant words of the direction to the trustees are \"all income taxes which may be payable in respect of the said above provisions for my wife.\" The direction, to my mind, is clearly limited to the payments provided for in the Castle Frank gift. Had the intention been to reimburse Lady Kemp as well for any extra income tax for which she would become liable as a result of this gift, \"it would,\" as Robertson, C.J., says, \"have been a simple matter to say so.\"\nWith all respect, however, I cannot agree with the Court of Appeal that the explicit direction in paragraph 4 to the trustees to pay out of the estate \"all income taxes which may be payable in respect of the said above provisions for my wife\" is to be construed as excluding the moneys, which the trustees are thus required to pay in her behalf, from the benefits of the Castle Frank gift. In my opinion, paragraphs 3 and 4 must be read together, and clearly shew that immunity from income tax liability to the extent indicated was intended as part of this gift. The widow was to receive the monthly payments specified and other benefits unimpaired and undiminished by any liability for payment of income tax thereon. If Lady Kemp herself paid these taxes directly with her income tax upon other independent income, she was entitled to be recouped out of the estate to the amount thereof. Whether the trustees paid her the money to meet the income tax payments before they became due or recouped her afterwards, the money under the provisions of the Income Tax Act was, in my opinion, part of her income for income tax purposes, as it was also part of the intended gift. See Michelham's Trustees v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue[7].\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal should be varied so as to provide that the trustees must repay to Lady Kemp under paragraph 4 of the will such proportion of the whole of the income tax assessed against her in respect of each year's income under each statute imposing an income tax upon her income as the total amount expended or paid out in such year by the trustees under the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of the will (to the extent that the same is or is deemed to be assessable as income against Lady Kemp under the provisions of such statute) bears to the total amount, which is or is deemed to be assessable as income against Lady Kemp in such year under the provisions of such statute.\nTo this extent and to this extent only I would allow the appeal, with costs to all parties out of the estate, those of the solicitors for the trustees as between solicitor and client.\nKerwin J.\u2014This is an appeal by Lady Kemp and a cross-appeal by the other residuary beneficiaries under the will of Sir Albert Edward Kemp from the order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which reversed the order of McTague J. in its most important provisions. The matter arose on an originating motion by the executors and trustees of the will for an order construing and interpreting the will, and for the opinion, advice and direction of the Court upon certain questions arising out of the trusts declared thereby.\nClauses 3 and 4 of the will read:\u2014\n3. I GIVE AND DEVISE to my said Trustees my residence and lands in the City of Toronto, known as \"Castle Frank,\" including houses, out-houses and other buildings thereon, and all the appurtenances used and enjoyed therewith (all of which are to be understood as being included in the term \"Castle Frank\") upon the following trusts:\n(a) During the lifetime of my wife, Virginia, so long as she shall remain my widow, and so long as she desires to make use of the same as her residence, to keep up Castle Frank in a suitable condition for that purpose; and all costs and charges for the payment of taxes, insurance and for repairs, renewals and other like expenditures for the proper structural upkeep of the said houses and buildings shall be borne by my estate and be paid by my Trustees.\n(b) To allow my said wife during her lifetime, and so long as she shall remain my widow, to occupy Castle Frank as her home and residence, free of rent.\n(c) The furniture, plate, pictures and other personal chattels constituting the ordinary contents of said house at the time of my death, I give and bequeath to my wife, together with any automobile or automobiles which I may then own.\n(d) While my said wife shall occupy Castle Frank as her home and residence, my Trustees shall also bear the expense of the maintenance and management thereof; and to cover such cost, my Trustees shall pay to my wife the sum of Two Thousand Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($2,250) each month in advance so long as she continues to reside in Castle Frank and to use it as her home.\n(e) If my wife shall cease to occupy Castle Frank as her home for any of the reasons aforesaid, I desire my said Trustees to raise out of my general estate the sum of Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000), which sum will enable her, if she so desires, to purchase or build or otherwise provide a suitable house for herself, including the necessary land in connection therewith, and to pay the said sum to my wife as soon as conveniently may be after she shall inform my Trustees of her desire to give up her occupation of Castle Frank; the said sum of Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000) is intended to be an absolute gift to my wife, and she shall not be obliged, unless she wishes to do so, to expend that sum or any part of it, in purchasing, building or otherwise acquiring any residence; the receipt of my wife therefor shall be an absolute discharge of my Trustees for the payment of the said sum of Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000).\n(f) Upon my said wife ceasing to occupy Castle Frank as her residence, the monthly allowance to her of Two Thousand Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($2,250) for the upkeep thereof, as provided in Paragraph 2 (d) of this Will, shall cease; and in that event, I give her in lieu thereof, and direct my Trustees to pay to her while she shall remain my widow, a monthly allowance of Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000).\n4. I DIRECT that the above provisions in favour of my wife shall be a first charge upon my estate, and shall be provided for and paid by my Trustees in priority to any other legacies payable under my said Will, and I further direct that any Succession Duties, and all income taxes which may be payable in respect of the said above provisions for my wife shall be paid out of my estate by my Trustees.\nBy clause 16, the testator made the following additional provisions for the appellant:\u2014\n(a) He gave her a one-sixteenth portion of his residuary estate absolutely.\n(b) He gave hex the income for life from a further one-sixteenth portion of his residuary estate.\n(c) He gave her the income during widowhood from a further one-eighth portion of his residuary estate.\nFrom the time of the appellant's marriage to the testator in 1925 until his death, the average monthly expense of the maintenance and management of Castle Frank exceeded the sum. of $2,250. Since her husband's death the appellant has continuously occupied Castle Frank as her home and residence and she has received the stipulated monthly sum in advance for the maintenance and management thereof, all of which she has expended for those purposes. At the time of the marriage and the making of the will, the appellant had, to the knowledge of the testator, a private income of her own, which she continued and still continues to receive.\nThe questions propounded to the Court arise because under the Dominion Income War Tax Act the appellant is assessed to income tax on the benefits conferred upon her under clause 3 of the will. Without attempting a precise listing of what benefits, as between the appellant and the taxing authorities, are so taxable, it may be stated generally that they include at present the occupation of Castle Frank rent free, the upkeep thereof, and the monthly payments of $2,250. According to clause 4 of the will, \"all income taxes which may be payable in respect of the said above provisions for my wife shall be paid out of my estate by my trustees.\" It is clear that, however that expression may be construed, it must bear the same meaning if the appellant should cease to occupy Castle Frank and should receive the monthly allowance of $2,000 mentioned in paragraph (f) of clause 3.\nUnder the Income War Tax Act, the income tax payable is computed by the application to the whole net income of the taxpayer, of rates which increase on a gradual scale as the amount of the net income increases, and by the imposition of a surtax on incomes that exceed a certain amount. The appellant, therefore, in adding the benefits received under clause 3 of the will to her private income and to her income under clause 16, pays a higher rate than if those benefits had not been conferred upon her.\nLady Kemp's contention on the first question submitted to the Court is that the income tax that would have been payable by her if there were no such benefits should be computed, and that under clause 4 of the will the trustees should pay the difference between that sum and the total amount of the tax for which she is actually liable. That was the conclusion of Mr. Justice McTague, but the Court of Appeal, adopting the argument of the other residuary beneficiaries, determined that the proper method was that the trustees should pay only such proportion of the income tax assessed against Lady Kemp as the total amount paid out by them under clause 3 bears to the total amount assessable as income against her. In my opinion the Court of Appeal is right.\nThe testator provided an income for his widow other than that mentioned in clause 3; he knew that she had a private income; he knew that she would be required to pay income tax on both these items of income and made no provision that such tax should be paid by his trustees. It was only income taxes which might be payable \"in respect of\" the provisions made by him for Lady Kemp under clause 3 that he directed should be paid out of his estate. If taxation under the Act were a fixed rate on the dollar, each part of Lady Kemp's income would bear its proportionate share, but how may it be said that the total amount of the additional tax payable by reason of adding to her other income the benefits conferred by clause 3 is payable \"in respect of\" the latter? If it is not to be paid out of the estate under that clause, there is no other rule or law by which the appellant may require payment by the trustees. The contention advanced by the other residuary beneficiaries and adopted by the Court of Appeal gives full effect to the clause.\nThe second question arises in this way. Whatever sum the trustees pay for income taxes in respect of the provisions for Lady Kemp, made in clause 3, is treated, under the Act, as part of Lady Kemp's income. I might here say that my own view is that clause 4 directs the trustees to pay these income taxes in the year in which they are payable and that the obligation is not upon Lady Kemp to pay the total and then seek a repayment from the trustees. If the repayment by the trustees is made in the same year, it can, of course, make no difference but it might conceivably do so if the repayment were delayed until the following year. However, the problem would still remain as to whether the extra income tax payable by Lady Kemp, because of the payment or repayment by the trustees, should be paid entirely by the estate, or whether the principle of apportionment adopted in answering the first question should apply. Mr. Justice McTague held that this extra tax should be paid by the trustees under clause 4 of the will. The objecting residuary beneficiaries agree that it is quite clear that to the extent that the repayments of tax swell Lady Kemp's total assessable income they necessarily increase the total amount of income tax payable by her, and on the principle of apportionment adopted in answering the first question, this increases the tax which each part of Lady Kemp's income must bear. But, it is submitted, the estate should not bear more of such increased income tax than the proportion thereof which the provisions for Lady Kemp under clause 3 of the will (to the extent that they form part of her assessable income) bear to her total assessable income. It is argued that for the purpose of computing the proportion, the amounts reimbursed to Lady Kemp in respect of income tax under clause 4 of the will should be treated as part of her income apart from clause 3 of the will.\nThe Court of Appeal agreed with this argument; that is, while, in the answer to question I, \"repayment of income tax under clause 4 of the will\" is treated as part of Lady Kemp's assessable income, according to the answer to question II, the trustees must repay to Lady Kemp only such proportion of the whole of the income tax assessed against her in respect of each year's income as the total amount expended or paid out in such year by the trustees under the provisions of clause 3 of the will bears to the total amount of Lady Kemp's assessable income. I quite agree that such extra income tax is not entirely payable in respect of the provisions made for Lady Kemp by clause 3 of the will and is, therefore, not to be paid by the trustees. However, I am of opinion that, reading together clauses 3 and 4 of the will, the payments or repayments to be made by the trustees form part of the benefits conferred by clause 3 and that the proportion of Lady Kemp's income tax with respect to any year, to be paid by the trustees, should be the proportion that the total amount paid out by them in such year under the provisions of clause 3 and clause 4 bears to the total amount deemed to be assessable income of Lady Kemp in such year, and I would vary the order of the Court of Appeal accordingly.\nThe residuary beneficiaries other than Lady Kemp did not cross-appeal but they argue that the answer given by the Court below to question III is inconsistent with the answers given to questions I and II. The answer to question III deals with deductions and exemptions allowed to Lady Kemp by the Income Tax Acts. I would have thought that, the net taxable income being ascertained, the trustees would receive no benefit from the deductions and exemptions except that, of course, neither they nor Lady Kemp would pay any tax upon them. However, throughout the course of the proceedings Lady Kemp has agreed that the trustees should be entitled, in each year, to that proportion of any deductions allowed to her in respect of charitable donations which the payments made to Lady Kemp under clause 4 of the will, during such year, bear to Lady Kemp's total income during such year. The orders of McTague J. and the Court of Appeal include the terms of this agreement but also provide that, with that exception, deductions and exemptions allowed to Lady Kemp are to be calculated as belonging to and intended for her exclusive benefit and not for the benefit of the trustees. Bearing that in mind, I read the answer to question I as providing that by it Lady Kemp's income is to be determined on the footing of her total assessable income without subtracting any deductions and exemptions, leaving the latter to be dealt with by the answer to question III.\nThe judgments of the Court of Appeal in Michelham's Trustees v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue[8] and in In re Reckitt[9], and the other judgments cited at bar were decided on the terms of other wills differently phrased and under the provisions of a taxing Act modelled in a form far different from ours, and I have been unable to secure any assistance from them in coming to a conclusion in this case. I would vary the order of the Court of Appeal to the extent indicated. All parties should have their costs out of the estate, those of the trustees as between solicitor and client.\nAppeal dismissed subject to a variation in the judgment appealed from.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Balfour, Drew & Taylor.\nSolicitors for the adult residuary beneficiaries, respondents: Osier, Hoskin & Harcourt.\nSolicitor for the infants, respondents: P.

(under s. 60 of the Patent Act, 1935) for a declaration that respondent's patent, a re-issue patent, relating to \"frosted glass articles and methods of making same,\" was invalid and void, or a declaration that no valid claim thereof was infringed by the sale or use in Canada of appellants' electric incandescent lamps. The action was dismissed by Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court, [1939] 1 D.L.R. 412, and appeal was brought to this Court.\nAt the time of the re-issue, the relevant enactment in force as to re-issue of patents was s. 27 of the Patent Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 150.\nIn the re-issue patent no change was made in the specification but change was made in the claims. In the re-issue patent there were four claims, the first two having been in the original patent (as claims 8 and 9) and the other two being introduced by the re-issue patent. The claims were :\u2014\n1. A bulb for electric lamps and similar articles having its inner surface covered with rounded etching pits or depressions.\n2. An incandescent electric lamp bulb having on its inner surface rounded etching pits or depressions.\n3. A glass electric lamp bulb having its interior surface frosted by etching to such an extent as to be free from objectionable glare, said interior bulb surface being characterized by the presence of rounded as distinguished from sharp angular crevices to such an extent that the strength of the etched bulb is sufficient to withstand shocks due to commercial handling.\n4. A glass electric bulb having its interior surface frosted by etching to such an extent that the light is sufficiently diffused to obviate glare, said interior bulb surface being characterized by the presence of rounded as distinguished from sharp angular crevices, to such an extent that the strength of the bulb as compared to an unetched bulb of the same thickness has not been sufficiently reduced to preclude commercial handling.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and respondent's patent declared invalid and void.\nPer the Chief Justice and Davis and Hudson JJ.: There may have been patentable invention in devising the method, dealt with in the specification, of strengthening frosted glass for the purpose (inter alia) of constructing glass bulbs; the real difficulty in respondent's case lay in the manner in which the claims are framed.\nAs to claim 1: The word \"covered\" is an ordinary word and, using it in its ordinary sense, it is plain on the evidence that the surfaces of appellants' bulbs do not fall within that description (nor do the surfaces of respondent's bulbs as manufactured and sold by it), and therefore (apart from any question as to whether claim 1 embodies on its proper construction a patentable monopoly) there was no infringement.\nClaim 2 is too broad to constitute a valid claim, extending in its application (in the light of the evidence as to existence or production of rounded depressions) to bulbs which have not been submitted to respondent's strengthening treatment or to anything that could properly be described as a strengthening treatment.\nClaims 3 and 4 would have been invalid had they been introduced in the patent originally, and also they are such as would give a new character to the invention and the re-issue patent is invalid accordingly. The effect of the evidence is that the inventor had not produced a bulb which would \" obviate glare\" or be \" free from objectionable glare\" in the normal meaning of the words (and on the evidence \"glare\" is not a term definable by reference to any special usage in the art) and that he had not disclosed any means of doing so; further, as regards this characteristic the claim is too indefinite\u2014the ordinarily skilled person is not given a sufficient guide as to its limits; further, on construction of the specification, the problem of glare was not one to which the inventor was applying himself. Nor in the original patent did the problem as to sufficiency of the bull) to withstand the shocks of commercial handling present itself to the inventor; in his specification he gives directions for producing a bulb with a high degree of strength as determined by the \"bump\" test, but he did not apply himself to the relation between strength as shown by that test and the sufficiency of the bulb to withstand the shocks of commercial handling. As shown by the evidence, while the interior bulb surface of respondent's commercial lamp is (forming a contrast in this respect to the surface of the patent lamp) the surface of a lamp possessing, no doubt, the charasteristic described in claims 3 and 4\u2014a lamp combining resistance to shock sufficient for commercial purposes with a high degree of absence of glare, yet this was the result of much experimentation after the invention\u2014experimentation directed to definite commercial ends which the inventor had not in mind and leading to a procedure different from his; and the re-issue provisions of the Patent Act cannot legitimately be employed for the purpose of ascribing this result to the inventor and remodelling his invention to make that invention conform to it. There was nothing to support the proposition that the specification in the original patent was \"defective or inoperative\" by reason of any of the causes mentioned in the statute.\nMoreover, as regards the re-issue patent as a whole, each of the four claims is in respect of an article, while the invention as described in the original patent is an invention of a process for strengthening frosted glass articles.\nPer Rinfret and Kerwin JJ.: Upon construction of the specification and claims in respondent's original patent it is evident that if there was invention it was in a strengthening treatment and not in an article strengthened by any means whatsoever. It is clear from the claims in the re-issue patent that what is now claimed is an article; it is not a correction of the original patent made \"by reason of the patentee claiming more or less than he had a right to claim as new,\" but, if valid, is an entirely different invention; and this an inventor and those claiming under him are not entitled to do. A re-issue is not a grant of a new patent, but must be confined to the invention which the inventor attempted to describe and claim in the original patent.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing their action which asked for a declaration that defendant's patent no. 289,379 (a re-issue of patent no. 252,159, relating to \"frosted glass articles and methods of making same\") is invalid and void, or a declaration that no valid claim of said patent is infringed by the sale or use in Canada of plaintiffs' electric incandescent lamps. Maclean J. found in favour of the defendant on the question of the validity of its patent and on the question of infringement. By the judgment now reported the appeal to this Court was allowed and judgment was directed declaring the patent in question in the action invalid and void, with costs throughout.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and Christopher Robinson for the appellant.\nC. F. H. Carson K.C. and H. K. Thompson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice\u2014The respondents are the assignees of a patent granted to Marvin Pipkin on the 28th of July, 1925, and the action out of which the appeal arises was instituted in the Exchequer Court for the purpose of obtaining a declaration under section 60 of the Patent Act, 1935 (Stats, of Can., 1935, c. 32) that the appellants' lamps made according to a process described do not constitute infringements of the respondents' patent; and that the respondents' patent is void on various grounds.\nThe nature of the invention, as conceived by the patentee, is best explained, I think, by reference to the language used by the patentee himself in his specification. He says:\nMy invention relates to frosted glass bulbs such as are utilized in electric incandescent lamps and similar electrical devices, and to other frosted glass articles in which the glass is thin and subject to breakage. My invention also relates to methods of preparing the frosted surface on such articles. It finds particular application to articles which are frosted on the inside. In the case of electric incandescent lamp bulbs, it has been recognized that an inside frosting is highly desirable since the advantage of light diffusion is secured thereby without the disadvantage of increased susceptibility to collection of dirt which exists when the bulb is frosted on the outside. In order to avoid the introduction of detrimental foreign materials into the lamp as much as possible, such frosting must be done by etching the glass either mechanically as by sand blasting, or chemically by reagents which have a solvent action on the glass. It has been found, however, that such bulbs are weak and break easily in response to shock. This has been shown by subjecting such lamps to the so-called \" bump \" test which has demonstrated that they are much weaker than the unetched bulbs and also bulbs which have been etched on the outside. The object of my invention is to overcome this defect.\nThe bump tester is a machine by which glass articles can be subjected to a breaking test and there is a scale attached to this tester by reference to which the comparative strength of such articles can be indicated as shown by that test.\nThe inventor proceeds:\nAccording to my invention, after the thin, glass article has been etched on the inside, preferably by chemical means, it is treated with a chemical which has a solvent action on the material of the etched surface. The glassware is found thereafter to have much higher resistance to shock, as shown by the \"bump\" test. The probable explanation is that the first etching produces pits in the glass having comparatively sharp angles and that these are rounded out by the treatment comprised by my invention which may be called a strengthening treatment. The sharp angled pits or depressions caused by the first etching are starting places for cracks when the bulb is subjected to shock and the rounding of such pits or depressions apparently effectually prevents such formation of cracks.\nThe evidence adduced on behalf of the respondents deals explicitly with, first, electric light bulbs treated according to the directions of the patent; second, electric light bulbs frosted inside, manufactured and sold by the respondents and their associates, the General Electric Co.; third, a collection of 34 bulbs delivered to the respondents' expert witness, Mr. Spencer, and shipped from Japan to this continent; and, fourth, bulbs made by the appellants' expert witness in Ottawa according to a process alleged by the appellants to be employed by them in the production of their bulbs.\nAs regards; the first of these classes of bulbs, there was produced at the trial a photomicrograph of a part of the surface of the inside of one of them, which was marked as Exhibit 26, and which was one of the lamps actually made by the process disclosed by the patent. Spencer is most explicit in saying that this photomicrograph shows a surface in which there are no sharp angular crevices, in other words, that all the sharp angular crevices produced by the initial frosting have been rounded out by the strengthening treatment, and two drawings by him are produced in which that very clearly appears. From the photomicrograph, as well as from these drawings, it appears that the surface is covered by these shallow, saucer like depressions separated by ridges.\nAs regards the second of the four categories, he produced a photomicrograph marked as Exhibit \"T.\" In the surface represented in Exhibit \"T,\" as the expert explains, the sharp crevices have not all been rounded out; but the rounded depressions predominate.\nExhibit Z. 1, according to the witness, is a photomicrograph illustrating what he found on the inside surface of the frosted Fuso lamps belonging to a lot delivered at his laboratory as above mentioned. Of these lamps he tested 34. On this surface the rounded depressions predominate.\nAs regards the fourth category, the surface is represented by a photomicrograph, Exhibit Z. 3, and there the sharp angular crevices predominate, although there are also rounded ones. Spencer says (in answer to the question, \"What do you say about the rounded etching pits and the sharp angular crevices in the relative sense in that picture?\"), \"There are more sharp angular crevices than rounded etching pits, or rounded depressions.\"\nNow, it is convenient, I think, to consider at this point claims 1 and 2 which are in these words:\n1. A bulb for electric lamps and similar articles having its inner surface covered with rounded etching pits or depressions.\n2. An incandescent electric lamp bulb having on its inner surface rounded etching pits or depressions.\nAs regards both these claims, the evidence to which I have referred makes very clear the meaning which would be attached to the words \"rounded pits or depressions\" by a person skilled in the art. As regards claim 1, the word \"covered\" is an ordinary word and using the word in its ordinary sense it is quite plain that the surfaces of the appellants' bulbs as shown by the photomicrograph produced by the respondents (Exhibit Z. 1) do not fall within that description; and it is not contended that the bulbs produced by the respondents have a surface of such a character. The surface produced by the process described in the patent as shown in Exhibit 26 might fairly be said to be \"covered\" by rounded pits or depressions, but the contrast between such a surface and that found in Exhibits \"T\" and Z. 1 is admitted and signalized in the evidence of Spencer. Apart altogether then from any question as to whether claim 1 embodies on its proper construction a patentable monopoly, it is clear that there is no infringement and that the appellants are entitled to succeed as regards that claim. As to claim 2, the surface described is a surface which has some rounded pits or depressions. It is, in my opinion, too broad to constitute a valid claim. It applies with equal justice to surfaces such as that represented by the photomicrograph, Exhibit Z. 3, and to those represented by Exhibits \"T\" and Z. 1. It applies, in other words, to bulbs strengthened to the degree of strength that characterized the commercial bulbs of the respondents and to bulbs having an inner surface corresponding to that shown by Exhibit Z. 1 as well as to bulbs which have not been submitted to anything that could properly be described as a strengthening treatment.\nSpencer puts this expressly. He says, with reference to Z. 3, that such rounded depressions as are there shown may be produced by the initial frosting treatment because of the difficulty of getting rid of the powerful acid solution employed with sufficient rapidity to prevent some of the angular crevices being rounded. But surfaces with such an extremely limited proportion of rounded crevices, he declares, are not produced by the Pipkin process which includes as essential two stages, the frosting stage and the strengthening stage. He definitely excludes bulbs having such surfaces from the category \"Pipkin bulbs.\"\nReverting now to Pipkin's invention as he describes it. It is shown that before Pipkin's invention it was well known in the art that by the application of a solvent solution to an etched glass surface, a surface might be produced corresponding to that shown by Exhibit 26. Spencer admits that this surface is very similar to that shown in figure 2 appended to the article from Die Glashutte, Vol. 17, 1887, produced and translated. The learned trial judge is, however, right, I think, in saying that Pipkin was the first to realize the fact that the application of a solvent solution to an etched surface may result in adding strength to glass which has been weakened by the etching process; and that this result could be utilized in the manufacture of glass bulbs in the manner effected by him. It is said that the discovery of the effect of the double treatment is without patentable subject-matter because it was only a discovery. In my view it is not necessary to consider this point I am inclined to agree with the learned trial judge that in devising his method of strengthening frosted glass for the purpose (inter alia) of constructing glass bulbs Pipkin must be credited with patentable ingenuity; and while the discovery was no doubt the critical as well as the primary thing, there was manufacture as well.\nThe real difficulty in the respondents' case seems to me to lie in the manner in which the claims are framed. I have already dealt with claims 1 and 2. I come to claims 3 and 4. These claims were introduced by a re-issue patent in 1929. I have come to the conclusion that they would have been invalid had they been introduced in the patent as originally framed for reasons which I shall mention and, further, that they constitute an attempt to give a new character to Pipkin's invention and that the re-issue patent is invalid accordingly. Claims 3 and 4 are in these words:\n3. A glass electric lamp bulb having its interior surface frosted by etching to such an extent as to be free from objectionable glare, said interior bulb surface being characterized by the presence of rounded as distinguished from sharp angular crevices to such an extent that the strength of the etched bulb is sufficient to withstand shocks due to commercial handling.\n4. A glass electric bulb having its interior surface frosted by etching to such an extent that the light is sufficiently diffused to obviate glare, said interior bulb surface being characterized by the presence of rounded as distinguished from sharp angular crevices, to such an extent that the strength of the bulb as compared to an unetched bulb of the same thickness has not been sufficiently reduced to preclude commercial handling.\nThe monopoly defined in these claims is in respect of an electric light bulb which has its interior surface frosted by etching to such an extent \" as to be free from objectionable glare\" (as in claim 3) or \"that the light is sufficiently diffused to obviate glare\" (as in claim 4).\nThe expert witnesses called on behalf of the respondents do not say that the word \" glare \" has any special meaning for a person skilled in the pertinent art or arts. One of them says in a general way that there is some relation between glare and brightness. That relation is not defined. It is admitted that at the time of the trial a lamp such as Exhibit 27, constructed in accordance with the directions in the patent, would not \" obviate glare\" to such an extent as to be commercially satisfactory. It is admitted that the glare from such a lamp is very much greater than the glare from the appellants' lamps or the lamps dealt with commercially by the respondents. It is admitted that no bulb has been put on the market which permits a \"glare as great as that proceeding from the patent lamp. It seems to me that the respondents are in this position: I think the effect of the evidence is that the inventor had not produced a bulb which would \" obviate glare\" or be \" free from objectionable glare\" in the normal meaning of the words and that he has not disclosed any means of doing so. Spencer, it is true, in answer to a. suggestion from his counsel, said that, by limiting the period given in the patent for the application of the strengthening solution, glare might be reduced, but there is no suggestion of this in the patent. And in the most explicit way the patent gives the minimum of that period as ten minutes. Spencer's evidence is quite explicit also upon the point that in the case of the bulb produced by him the period was that given in the patent.\nAgain, it appears to me that as regards this characteristic the claim is too indefinite. I think the ordinarily skilled person is not given a sufficient guide and if, as seems to be argued on behalf of the respondents, glare, within the meaning of these claims, is to be determined by reference to the efficacy in the elimination of glare of bulbs on the market in 1924, it seems to me that the person whose duty it is to ascertain the limits of the claim is left in a hopeless position. I must make it quite clear, however, that I see no justification for construing the words \"free from objectionable glare\" or \" obviate glare\" by reference to any such standard, or for giving them any meaning other than that which they receive in current usage. The expert admitted, I repeat, that \" glare \" is not a term which they could define by reference to any special usage in the art. In the American patent, it should be observed, the claims profess to characterize the invention by reference to the degree of brightness permitted by the frosted surface produced in comparison with the degree of brightness in a lamp made of clear glass, such comparison being expressed mathematically.\nIt seems very clear to me that the patentee was not directing his mind to this question of glare. The question, as he himself says, for him\u2014the problem which he set himself to solve\u2014was that of strengthening bulbs with inside etching. The statement in the specification is the only statement we have from him. The respondents and their associates began putting bulbs frosted on the inside on the market in 1925. Admittedly they did not use the specific method given in the patent. They did not use the solutions. A short time after they began manufacturing these bulbs they abandoned the intermediate step of washing. Their expert says that they have learned how to make a frosted bulb almost as strong as a clear bulb with the sacrifice, however, of a great deal of diffusion. They have had to compromise and they have learned how to compromise. I can quite understand that, as the result of their experience between 1924 and 1929, they might arrive at the conception that Pipkin's invention was a frosted bulb with a given degree of strength which preserved at the same time a sufficient degree of diffusion to obviate glare, but there is no document proceeding from Pipkin supporting the proposition that such was his invention as he conceived it and there is nothing before us giving the slightest support to the proposition that Pipkin's specification as signed by him was inoperative or defective by reason of any of the causes mentioned in the statute. Pipkin's specification as signed by him is the only evidence we have before us as to the character of his invention and as to the nature of the monopoly he intended to claim. It seems quite clear that the problem of glare was one to which he never applied himself.\nThe second feature of the invention described in claims 3 and 4 is that the interior bulb surface is characterized by the presence of rounded, as distinguished from sharp angular, crevices to such an extent that the strength of the bulb is sufficient to withstand shocks due to commercial handling.\nNow, the bulb made according to the directions of the specifications is of a strength of 34 on the bump test scale. And, according to the evidence of Spencer, a strength of 8 and upwards on that scale is sufficient to enable the bulb to withstand such shocks. Pipkin says nothing about commercial handling and there is no reason to suppose that he had any such test in his mind and there is every reason to suppose that he had not. The only test to which he refers is the bump test.\nPipkin's invention, as he himself explains it, consisted in treating glass bulbs with inside frosting in such a way as to obviate the weakness of such bulbs. He gives directions in his specification for producing a bulb with a high degree of strength as determined by the bump test, but he did not apply himself to the relation between strength as shown by the bump test and the sufficiency of the bulb to withstand the shocks of commercial handling. That problem did not present itself to him, just as the problem of the elimination of glare did not present itself.\nI have already mentioned that the respondents' expert contrasts the surface of the respondents' commercial lamps as shown by the photomicrograph \"T\" with the surface of the patent lamp as shown in the photomicrograph Exhibit 26. He says they are radically different. Now, the surface manifested by Exhibit \"T\" is the surface of a lamp possessing, no doubt, the characteristic described in claims 3 and 4, a lamp combining resistance to shock sufficient for commercial purposes with a high degree of absence of glare. But this was the result of much expert mentation by the respondents after Pipkin's invention,\u2014 experimentation directed to definite, commercial ends which Pipkin had not in mind, and leading to a procedure different from Pipkin's. The re-issue provisions of the Patent Act cannot legitimately be employed for the purpose of ascribing this result to Pipkin and remodelling his invention to make that invention conform to it.\nAs regards the re-issue patent as a whole, moreover, the whole four claims are claims, each of them, in respect of an article, while Pipkin's invention, as described by himself in the patent of 1925, the original patent, is an invention of a process for strengthening frosted glass articles.\nFor these reasons the re-issue patent is invalid and void and the appellants are entitled to a declaration to that effect. The appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014This is an action by the appellants,\u2014a partnership known as Fuso Electric Works and the persons forming such partnership,\u2014against the respondent, Canadian General Electric Company, Limited, under section 60 of the current Patent Act, being chapter 32 of the Statutes of 1935. Both subsection 1 and subsection 2 of that section were relied upon, as the statement of claim seeks a declaration that Canadian Patent No. 289379 granted to respondent for new and useful improvements in \"Frosted Glass Articles and Methods of Making Same \" was invalid and void, and a declaration that no valid claim of the patent was infringed by the sale or use in Canada of the appellants' electric incandescent lamps known as Fuso Lamps. In the Exchequer Court the action was dismissed, as the President considered that the patent was valid and that the appellants either did or would infringe the patent.\nOne of the reasons advanced by the appellants in alleging that the patent was invalid is that\nit is not for the same invention as that for which Patent No. 252159, of which it is a re-issue, was granted and in the issue of the latter there was in fact no inadvertence, accident or mistake nor was such letters patent inoperative or defective.\nThe learned President did not deal with this contention but, in my opinion, the point is well taken and is sufficient to justify the allowance of the appeal.\nIt may be stated at once that the plaintiffs clearly are interested persons, within the meaning of subsection 1 of section 60 of the 1935 Act, and that there appears to be no reason to disbelieve the evidence of Naruse, one of the appellants, that he and Hayashi, another of the appellants, are the sole members of the partnership carrying on business under a name translated into English as Fuso Electric Works. The patent in suit, issued to the respondent and dated April 30th, 1929, was \u00e1 re-issue of Patent No. 252159, granted to the respondent as assignee of one Pipkin on July 28th, 1925. The relevant statutory provision in force at the time of the re-issue was section 27 of the Patent Act, R.S.C., 1927, chapter 150, which section is as follows:\u2014\n27. Whenever any patent is deemed defective or inoperative by reason of insufficient description or specification, or by reason of the patentee claiming more or less than he had a right to claim as new, but at the same time it appears that the error arose from inadvertence, accident or mistake, without any fraudulent or deceptive intention, the Commissioner may, upon the surrender of such patent, within four years from its date or within one year from the thirteenth day of June, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-three, and the payment of the further fee hereinafter provided, cause a new patent, in accordance with an amended description and specification made by such patentee, to be issued to him for the same invention for any part or for the whole of the then unexpired residue of the term for which the original patent was or might have been granted.\n2. In the event of the death of the original patentee or of his having assigned the patent, a like right shall vest in his assignee or his legal representatives.\n3. Such new patent, and the amended description and specification, shall have the same effect in law, on the trial of any action thereafter commenced for any cause subsequently accruing, as if the same had been originally filed in such corrected form before the issue of the original patent.\n4. The Commissioner may entertain separate applications, and cause patents to be issued for distinct and separate parts of the invention patented, upon payment of the fee for a re-issue for each of such re-issued patents.\nIn its petition for a re-issue the respondent merely states:\u2014\nThat the petitioner is advised that the said patent is deemed defective, or inoperative, by reason of insufficient description or specification, and that the errors arose from inadvertence, accident or mistake, without any fraudulent or deceptive intention.\nIt does not appear from the documents filed on the application,\u2014nor was any evidence adduced in the action to show,\u2014what the alleged error was or why the patent was deemed defective or inoperative, and even yet it is difficult, if not impossible, to define the position taken by respondent in these respects.\nThe specifications in the old patent and in the re-issue are exactly the same; only the claims are altered. The inventor, Pipkin, in his specification states:\u2014\nMy invention relates to frosted glass bulbs such as are utilized in electric incandescent lamps and similar electrical devices, and to other frosted glass articles in which the glass is thin and subject to breakage.\nThis statement indicates, it is said, that Pipkin's invention, when disclosed, will be that of a new article. The specification continues:\u2014\nMy invention also relates to methods of preparing the frosted surface on such articles. It finds particular application to articles which are frosted on the inside.\nThis, it is stated, indicates that Pipkin's invention would also be of a method. The specification continues:\u2014\nIn the case of electric incandescent lamp bulbs, it has been recognized that an inside frosting is highly desirable since the advantage of light diffusion is secured thereby without the disadvantage of increased susceptibility to collection of dirt which exists when the bulb is frosted on the outside. In order to avoid the introduction of detrimental foreign materials into the lamp as much as possible, such frosting must be done by etching the glass either mechanically as by sand blasting, or chemically by reagents which have a solvent action on the glass. It has been found, however, that such bulbs are weak and break easily in response to shock. This has been shown by subjecting such lamps to the so-called \" bump \" test which has demonstrated that they are much Weaker than the unetched bulbs and also bulbs which have been etched on the outside. The object of my invention is to overcome this defect.\nPipkin then states that after the thin glass article has been etched on the inside, preferably by chemical means, it is treated with a chemical which has a solvent action on the material of the etched surface, and that the glassware is found thereafter to have much higher resistance to shock. He gives a probable explanation of why this should be so:\u2014\nThe probable explanation is that the first etching produces pits in the glass having comparatively sharp angles and that these are rounded out by the treatment comprised by my invention which may be called a strengthening treatment. The sharp angled pits or depressions caused by the first etching are starting places for cracks when the bulb is subjected to shock and the rounding of such pits or depressions apparently effectually prevents such formation of cracks.\nHe continues:\u2014\nAlthough the scope of my invention includes other reagents having the solvent action on the etched surface, I prefer to use for this purpose a solution of alkalin fluoride combined with hydrofluoric acid.\nHe gives examples of solutions which he deems especially efficient and examples of those which he considers not as satisfactory, and describes a specific application of his invention. Then follow the claims. The first six of these are method claims, in which Pipkin subjects the etched surface of glass lamp bulbs and similarly thin glass articles to the action of a reagent having a solvent action on the material of the surface; to the action of a fluoride containing a reagent; to the action of an alkalin fluoride containing a reagent; to the action of a reagent containing ammonium bifluoride. Claims 8 and 9, which will be adverted to later, are article claims as is also number 7:\u2014\n7. An article of glass of a thickness similar to that of an incandescent lamp bulb and having a surface thereof covered with rounded etching pits or depressions.\nNow upon the construction of the specification and the claims, it is evident, I think, that if Pipkin made any invention (which it is unnecessary to determine), it was in a strengthening treatment and not in an article strengthened by any means whatsoever. When we come to the re-issue we find that the respondent, as assignee of Pipkin, reduced the number of the claims to four. Numbers 1 to 7 of the old claims are abandoned; 8 and 9 of the old claims appear in the re-issue as numbers 1 and 2. The re-issue claims are as follows:\u2014\n1. A bulb for electric lamps and similar articles having its inner surface covered with rounded etching pits or depressions.\n2. An incandescent electric lamp bulb having on its inner surface rounded etching pits or depressions.\n3. A glass electric lamp bulb having its interior surface frosted by etching to such an extent as to be free from objectionable glare, said interior bulb surface being characterized by the presence of rounded as distinguished from sharp angular crevices to such an extent that the strength of the etched bulb is sufficient to withstand shocks due to commercial handling.\n4. A glass electric bulb having its interior surface frosted by etching to such an extent that the light is sufficiently diffused to obviate glare, said interior bulb surface being characterized by the presence of rounded as distinguished from sharp angular crevices, to such an extent that the strength of the bulb as compared to an unetched bulb of the same thickness has not been sufficiently reduced to preclude commercial handling.\nThese claims, it will be remembered, are in a patent, alleged to be valid, wherein appears precisely the same specification as was in the original patent. It is clear that what is now claimed is an article; it is not something more or less than Pipkin has a right to claim as new but, if valid, is an entirely different invention, and this an inventor and those claiming under him are not entitled to do. The re-issue is not the grant of a new patent but must be confined to the invention which the inventor attempted to describe and claim in the original patent.\nFor these reasons the appellants are entitled to a declaration that Patent No. 289379 is invalid and void. The security deposited by the appellants to cover any damages which the respondent might suffer through the operation of the injunction order issued by the Exchequer Court on January 5th, 1937, as varied by the order of February 1st, 1937, should be paid out to the appellants. The appellants are entitled to their costs of the action and of this appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors For the appellants: Smart & Biggar.\nSolicitors For the respondent: Macfarlane, Thompson, Little John & Martin.\n[1] [1939] 1 D.L.R. 412.\n"

C.R. 277, holding that the patent in question was valid and had been infringed by defendant. The patent was for improvement in fans and the invention related to fans for producing air currents and had for its principal object to provide such a fan with flexible fan blades of suitable material and shape to give the blades stability for an efficient operation of the fan combined with sufficient flexibility to cause any portion of the moving blades to yield when a stationary rigid or semi-rigid member is brought in contact with them, and to be self-restoring to normal position when the intruded member is withdrawn. This Court held that the substance of the invention lay in shaping the blade in such fashion as to maintain the rigidity of its base and body while leaving the edges sufficiently flexible to be harmless; and in this there was novelty and invention, and in substance this has been taken by defendant; that the bow-like slot in which the rubber blades were inserted, an element not taken by defendant, was only a particular means for maintaining the cupped shape of the base and body of the blade and thereby imparting to it the necessary rigidity; and, as a particular means only for maintaining this rigidity which was the essential thing, it was nonessential.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding that, as between the plaintiffs and the defendant, the claims in question (numbers 1 to 8, inclusive, and 15 and 18) of letters patent number 370,548, were valid and had been infringed by the defendant. The said letters patent were granted to the plaintiff Samson-United Corporation, the assignee of Abe 0. Samuels, the applicant, and the plaintiff Samson-United of Canada, Limited, was the exclusive licensee for Canada. The patent was granted for an alleged new and useful improvement in fans. The specification stated (inter alia) that the invention.\nrelates to fans for producing air currents and has for its principal object to provide such a fan with flexible fan blades of suitable material and shape to give the blades stability for an efficient operation of the fan combined with sufficient flexibility to cause any portion of the moving blades to yield when a stationary rigid or semi-rigid member is brought in contact with them, and to be self-restoring to normal position when the intruded member is withdrawn.\nLeave to appeal was granted by a judge of this Court.\nW. L. Scott K.C. and Cuthbert Scott for the appellant.\nM. Crabtree K.C. and E. G. Gowling for the respendents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I think the decision in this appeal turns upon the question whether the bow-like slot in which Samuels' rubber blades are inserted is an essential element in his invention. If it is, there is no infringement because that element has not been taken.\nI have come to the conclusion, however, that this is only a particular means for maintaining the cupped shape of the base and body of the blade and thereby imparting to it the necessary rigidity; and, as a particular means only for maintaining this rigidity which is the essential thing, it is non-essential. The point is not without difficulty but it does net, as I see it, lend itself to extended discussion. The substance of the invention lies in shaping the blade in such fashion as to maintain the rigidity of its base and body while leaving the edges sufficiently flexible to be harmless. In that I think there was novelty and invention and, in substance., this has, I think, been taken. I do not discuss it further but this in no way implies any disrespect to the able and careful argument of Mr. Scott.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ewart, Scott, Kelley, Scott & Howard.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Crabtree & McKee.\n[1] [1939] Ex.C.R. 227; [1939] 3 D.L.R. 365.\n"

Kaufman (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nBelding-Corticelli Limited and Others (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1939: June 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13; 1940 April 23.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nPatent\u2014Invalidity\u2014Existing art\u2014Analogous user\u2014No invention\u2014Patent, granted in October, 1933, attacked under s. 61 (1) (c) of Patent Act, 1935, c. 32\u2014Patentee's rights not governed thereby\u2014Said Act, ss. 81, 82; Patent Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 160, s. 37A (as enacted in 1932, c. 21, s. 4); Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 1, s. 19 (1) (c).\nThis Court dismissed an appeal from the judgment of Maclean J., [1938] Ex.C.R. 152, holding that defendant's patent in question was invalid. The patent was for improvement in hosiery and the manufacture thereof, and the alleged invention for which it was granted was described in the specification as relating \"to full-fashioned hosiery, particularly of real silk, and to methods of and means for making the same.\"\nPer the Chief Justice, Rinfret and Kerwin J J.: It is a case of analogous user. The method in defendant's alleged invention was analogous to that already used in connection with other articles of wear; and the difference between the problem met by defendant's use of the method for his purposes and the problem solved a long time before by use of the method in connection with other articles was not sufficiently wide to justify the conclusion that defendant's application of the method involved invention. The trial judge's finding that the problem met by defendant had not earlier presented itself as an acute one in the trade (thus negativing, as a factor, any existence of a long-felt and unsatisfied want) was warranted upon the evidence as accepted by him.\nThe doctrine of analogous user arises from the necessity appreciated by the courts that people must be safe-guarded against undue interference with the use of the accumulated stock of experience and knowledge gathered in their own and other trades.\nDisagreement expressed with the view (taken by the trial judge as a further ground against defendant) that defendant's rights were governed by s. 61 (1) (c) of The Patent Act, 1935 (c. 32), in view of the fact that his patent was granted in October, 1933 (more than a year prior to the enactment of said s. 61 (1) (c)), and in view of s. 81 of that Act, and of s. 37A (enacted in 1932, c. 21, s. 4) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 150, which s. 37A was in force at all relevant dates. In view of s. 19 (1) (c) of the Interpretation Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 1), defendant's rights under said s. 81 of said Act of 1935 could not be affected by s. 82 of that Act (repealing, inter alia, said s. 37A, enacted in 1932).\nPer Davis J.: Defendant's alleged invention lay within the limits of the existing art, in the sense that it was such a development as an ordinary person skilled in the art could naturally make without any inventive step. APPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding that the plaintiffs were entitled to the declarations claimed by them, and that the defendant's counter-claim be dismissed. By the formal judgment of the said Court, it was declared and adjudged that the defendant's letters patent no. 336,234 are, and always have been, null and void and of no effect, and said letters patent were vacated and set aside; and it was further ordered and adjudged that defendant's counterclaim (asking for a declaration that plaintiffs had infringed said letters patent, an injunction, damages, etc.) be dismissed. The patent was for improvements in hosiery and the manufacture thereof, and the alleged invention for which it was granted was described in the specification as relating \"to full-fashioned, hosiery, particularly of real silk, and to methods of and means for making the same.\"\nA. J. Thomson K.C. and B. V. McCrimmon for the appellant\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and Christopher Robinson for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Rinfret and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I have been unable to convince myself than this is not a case of analogous user. I think the learned trial judge was right in his view that if there were invention in Kaufman's disclosure it rested in the idea, that is to say, that once the idea was grasped, there were no difficulties in applying it to the knitting of full-fashioned silk stockings which it required invention to overcome. It is quite true that the problem in weaving silks and the problem in outer wear and necktie knitting was not precisely that which presented itself by the rings in silk stockings; but in both weaving and outer wear and necktie knitting, the multiple shuttle method or the multiple carrier method was applied to overcome irregularities due to variations in colour as well as in size. Friedlander, in his letter of the 9th of December, 1931, pointed out the analogy. Mr. Thomson pressed upon us with great force the difference between the nature of the irregularities encountered in weaving and in other branches of the knitting art and the irregularities in translucency which he argues Kaufman set himself to overcome. As I have already intimated, he has not convinced me that the difference between the two problems is sufficiently wide to justify the conclusion that the application to the one problem of the method by which the other problem had been solved a long time before involved invention. The judgments of the courts make it sufficiently clear that the doctrine of analogous user arises from the necessity appreciated by the courts that people must be safeguarded against undue interference with the use of the accumulated stock of experience and knowledge gathered in their own and other trades.\nThe strongest point made on behalf of the appellant is that in this view there is no explanation of the fact that a solution was not reached earlier. This argument was put before us with great ability and is supported by a very considerable body of evidence. The learned trial judge has found as a fact, largely on the strength of the evidence of Feustel, that the problem did not present itself as an acute one in the trade, that is to say, that by reason of commercial demand it did not require a solution, until about the year 1930, and the reasons for this are given by Feustel. Feustel's evidence has been accepted by the learned trial judge.\nMainly from that evidence, as well as from the fact that almost contemporaneously with Kaufman a number of other inventors conceived the idea of applying the multiple carrier method for the purpose of overcoming in the manufacture of silk stockings the blemishes of rings or bands, the learned trial judge has concluded that the problem then for the first time really demanded a solution. I have no doubt, and I think it appears clearly from his judgment, that the learned trial judge was also influenced in arriving at his conclusion by the consideration that, in his view, if the problem had become acute at an earlier stage, it would certainly have been solved in the same way. If the learned trial judge was wrong in his opinion as to the time when the problem first really demanded a solution from the commercial point of view, then one's own prima facie conclusion as to the absence of invention might well be overborne by the evidence of the existence of a long-felt and unsatified want.\nThe weight to be accorded Feustel's evidence was peculiarly a matter for the trial judge who had means of forming an opinion on the value of that evidence which are denied us.\nI am constrained to the conclusion that his judgment cannot properly be reversed.\nThe learned trial judge also based his judgment on other grounds involving the interpretation and application of section 61 (1) (c) of The Patent Act, 1935. I should not wish to be understood as either agreeing with or dissenting from his views as to the application of the enactment of that subsection to the facts in evidence here, if the section were relevant. I think it desirable, however, to say this: Kaufman's Canadian patent was granted in October, 1933. His applications, both in the United States and Canada, of course, preceded that date and, by section 81 of the statute of 1935, his patent\nshall be deemed to have been properly issued if all the conditions of the issue of a valid patent which may have been or shall be in force, either at the date of the application therefor or at the date of the issue thereof, have been satisfied.\nSubsection (c) of section 61 was not enacted until more than a year after the date of the issue of Kaufman's patent and at all the relevant dates section 37A of ch. 150, R.S.C. 1927 (introduced by section 4 of chapter 21 of the statutes of 1932), was in force,\u2014at the date of Kaufman's U.S. application, at the date of his Canadian application, and at the date of the issue of his patent. I am, therefore, quite unable to agree with the view of the learned trial judge that Kaufman's rights are governed by the enactment in subsection (c) of section 61.\nMr. Biggar relied on section 82 of the statute of 1935, but that section must be read in light of section 19 of the Interpretation Act which is in these words:\n19. Where any Act or enactment is repealed or where any regulation is revoked, then, unless the contrary intention appears, such repeal or revocation shall not, save as in this section otherwise provided, ... (c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued, accruing or incurred under the Act, enactment or regulation so repealed or revoked. Obviously, Kaufman's rights under section 81 could not be affected by the repeal of the statute of 1932.\nThere was an alternative point made by Mr. Biggar based upon section 8 (1) of ch. 150, R.S.C. 1927. On that point I express no opinion.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavis, J.\u2014The real question in this appeal, it seems to me, is whether the development in the trade which in fact has been made required inventive skill or was merely the natural development in the particular art. The development was undoubtedly of great utility and commercial advantage, but the evidence of a rather sudden material change in the conditions of the trade creating a new demand to be met, is very strong.\nWhile the question is one of very considerable difficulty, my conclusion is that the alleged invention lies within the limits of the existing art, in the sense that it was such a development as an ordinary person skilled in the art could naturally make without any inventive step. I agree upon this ground that the appeal must be dismissed.\nHudson, J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Tilley, Thomson & Parmenter.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Smart & Biggar.\n[1] [1938] Ex.C.R. 152; [1938] 2 D.L.R. 34?\n"

The action was for damages by reason of a collision, at night on an Ontario provincial highway, between plaintiff\u2019s motor truck and defendant\u2019s motor truck, both going westerly, while plaintiff\u2019s driver was attempting to pass defendant\u2019s truck which was veering to the left for the purpose of a left turn to be made on to a side-road which it was approaching. The trial judge found that the whole proximate cause of the accident was plaintiff\u2019s driver\u2019s negligence and gave judgment for defendant. The Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1939] O.R. 338, apportioned the blame for the accident, 75% against plaintiff\u2019s driver and 25% against defendant\u2019s driver, and gave judgment accordingly. On appeal to this Court, it was held that, in view of the findings at trial and the evidence (discussed), the judgment at trial should be restored. (Davis J. dissented, holding that on the evidence defendant\u2019s driver was clearly guilty of negligence contributing to the accident, that there was evidence wrongly admitted, and that certain evidence given unduly affected the trial judge\u2019s view of the whole case; rather than direct a new trial, he would take advantage of s. 4 of The Negligence Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 115, and award one-half the damages assessed).\nSecs. 39(1) (c) (left turn at intersection of highways), 39(1) (d) (duty of driver before turning left), and 12(1) (b) (rear-view mirror) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 288, considered with regard to matters in question.\nAPPEAL by the defendants, and cross-appeal by the plaintiff, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] allowing the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the judgment of Urquhart J. dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action and giving judgment for defendant company on its counterclaim.\nThe action was for damages by reason of a collision of motor trucks on or about July 19, 1938, in the night-time on provincial highway no. 2 at about two miles east of Prescott, Ontario. Both trucks were going westerly. At the time of the collision the driver (Burns) of the plaintiff\u2019s tractor and trailer was in the act of passing the motor truck of the defendant company, driven by defendant Kelso, and the latter was veering from the north or right hand side of the highway to the south for the purpose of making a left turn on to a road running south from the said provincial highway. The plaintiff claimed damages for loss of his tractor, trailer and cargo and loss of use of the vehicles. The defendant company counter-claimed for damage to its motor truck and for loss of use thereof while undergoing repairs. Urquhart J., at trial, dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action and gave judgment on defendant company\u2019s counter-claim for $110.25. In case on appeal he were found wrong, he fixed the plaintiff\u2019s damages at $9,000.\nAn appeal by the plaintiff was allowed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario (Riddell J.A. dissenting)1, which held that both drivers were guilty of negligence contributing to the accident, and apportioned the blame, 75% against the plaintiff\u2019s driver and 25% against the defendant (driver) Kelso. Plaintiff was therefore given judgment against the defendants for 25% of the amount at which the trial judge had assessed plaintiff\u2019s damages, with costs of action and appeal, and defendant company was given damages for 75% of the judgment recovered by it at the trial (without costs).\nThe defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The plaintiff cross-appealed, asking that he be given a much larger proportion of the damages assessed.\nW.F. Schroeder K.C. and W.R. Burnett for the appellants.\nT.J. Agar K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I should allow the appeal.\nCROCKET J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge (Urquhart J.), dismissing the respondent plaintiff\u2019s action and allowing the defendant\u2019s counter-claim, restored with costs throughout.\nThere was ample evidence to warrant the trial finding that the driver of the plaintiff truck, which was drawing a heavily loaded trailer along the trunk highway at the time of the collision, was wholly responsible therefor by reason of his failure before attempting to pass the defendant truck to see that he could do so in safety. His Lordship distinctly found that the defendant driver, in approaching the side-road leading from the south side of the trunk highway, which he was about to enter, was gradually edging towards the centre of the road, which it was his duty to do in making a left hand turn; that he had his arm out for a distance of probably some 250 feet before the driver of the plaintiff truck attempted to pass him with his heavily loaded trailer, so that at least ten inches of his hand and wrist extended beyond his over hanging truck box and would be clearly visible to the driver of any car coming from behind for 200 feet, if the head lights of the latter were good; and that the driver of the oncoming plaintiff truck, as a consequence of his failure to keep a proper lookout, failed, not only to observe the outstretched hand of the defendant driver, but also the flashing on and off of the rear light of his truck, and the fact that the latter was starting to edge towards the centre of the road for the purpose of making his left hand turn into the side-road, which was marked with signs.\nUpon these findings no other conclusion, it seems to me, is possible than that there was no negligence on the part of the defendant appellant or its driver, which materially contributed to cause the collision. Whether or not there had been any negligence on the part of the defendant itself in respect of its failure to provide in its truck a proper reflector, which would in all circumstances enable the driver to see a car approaching him from behind, or negligence on the part of the driver himself, in not slowing down, even more than he did, and putting his head through the open window at his side, as it was contended he should have done, to make sure before turning into the side-road that there was no danger from behind, such negligence could properly be held to have materially contributed to the collision, only if the plaintiff\u2019s driver could not have avoided it by the exercise of due care. The undoubted effect of the findings of the learned trial judge, to my mind, is that he could have done so, and that his failure to exercise such care in the circumstances was accordingly the sole cause of the damage claimed for.\nDAVIS J. (dissenting)\u2014This appeal arises out of a collision of two motor trucks on the Toronto-Montreal highway at a point a few miles east of Prescott some time near midnight on July 19th, 1938. The respondent\u2019s (plaintiff\u2019s) truck was being driven by one Burns. A trailer was attached to the truck and a load of 32 bales of cotton was being carried. The total gross weight was about 16 tons. As a result of the collision, the truck and the trailer and the cotton were all destroyed by fire. The trial judge assessed the respondent\u2019s total loss at $9,000. The appellants\u2019 (defendants\u2019) truck was much smaller and was empty\u2014it weighed about 7,500 pounds. The appellants counterclaimed in the action for the damage to their truck at $110.25. There is no claim by either party for any personal injuries.\nBoth trucks were travelling in the same direction\u2014westerly. At the time of the collision the appellants\u2019 truck, driven by one Kelso, was ahead of the other though it had passed the respondent\u2019s truck some three or four miles back. Kelso admits that he was aware, after he passed it, that there was a truck following him, but he was not aware, he says, that there was any vehicle near him until the crash. The facts immediately surrounding the collision are plain and are really not in dispute. The appellants\u2019 driver, Kelso, intended to turn into a side road which runs southerly from the main highway to a farm and a coal yard. The highway was paved\u201420 feet in width\u2014and had a solid white dividing line down the centre of it. The trial judge considered the road to be \u201ca particularly dangerous one at this point.\u201d Although the trial judge said that \u201cthis side road was perfectly visible, being marked with signs,\u201d we are in as good a position from the photographs and plans as the trial judge was in this regard and the road cannot fairly be said to be visible to an approaching motorist at midnight\u2014it was obviously, as Burns, the respondent\u2019s driver, said, nothing different from numerous such side roads that run into the main highway all along the route. The side road was not marked with any highway signs\u2014the only sign was one placed six feet back from the highway with the words \u201cRedden\u2019s Coal Yard,\u201d and not lighted. Now 200 feet before Kelso, the appellants\u2019 driver, would have reached the point of entrance to this side road he says he began to veer his truck over to the south, that is, to his left hand side\u2014he himself describes his course as \u201canglewise\u201d\u2014and that after continuing this course for about 100 feet the respondent\u2019s big truck from behind, in attempting to pass, collided with his truck. The left front fender and wheel of the appellants\u2019 truck and the right front fender and wheel of the respondent\u2019s truck came into collision. It is clear on the evidence that at that time the left front wheel of the appellants\u2019 truck had got two feet over the centre line on the south side of the highway.\nThe appellants\u2019 driver, Kelso, did not see or hear the respondent\u2019s large and heavy truck and trailer behind him or know that it was there. He says very frankly he did not. His truck had a cabin in the front of it in which he was sitting behind the wheel on the left hand side with two passengers beside him. His truck, he says, was travelling about fifteen miles an hour and the other truck at approximately thirty-five to forty miles an hour. The maximum statutory speed is fifty miles an hour. Assuming the speed of the two trucks, as Kelso puts it, when his truck began to veer over to the left hand side, 100 feet before the point of impact, the respondent\u2019s truck could not have been then more than 200 feet behind him. And yet Kelso neither heard him nor saw him. It was a type of cabin which did not permit the driver conveniently to put his head out far enough to see what was behind him. The trial judge thought that such a cabin was \u201ca menace to safe driving.\u201d Kelso used what is described in the evidence as a rear-view mirror and in his examination for discovery he said he was looking in this mirror when he was 250 feet from \u201cthe top of the hill\u201d (a point about 150 or 200 feet before he came to the point where he commenced to angle across the highway) and that he did not look again in the mirror. Then during the trial on cross-examination:\nQ. When you went to cross the centre line where there might have been some danger, did you look out of this open window that you had beside you?\nA. No.\nQ. You did not take the trouble to look at all?\nA. No.\nAnd again:\nQ. Can you offer to his Lordship any explanation why you would not see it [the other truck] if you had looked?\nA. There was a curve there, and his lights shone in the field south of the road.\nQ. And you knew there was a curve there?\nA. Yes, but I did not know there was a truck there.\nThe action was tried by Urquhart, J., without a jury, and the learned trial judge at the conclusion of the argu- ment of counsel for the respondent (plaintiff) said to him, \u201cI think it is quite hopeless, Mr. Thompson,\u201d and did not find it necessary to hear counsel for the appellants (defendants).\nQuite apart from any statutory provisions, and much emphasis by counsel for both parties before us was put upon sec. 39 of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O., 1937, ch. 288, it was an act of the plainest sort of negligence for the appellants\u2019 driver to attempt to make a left hand turn across the highway at the place and at the time he attempted to do so without making sure that his movements would not adversely affect a car coming along behind him. It was near midnight in midsummer on a principal highway and it would have been a very simple thing for the driver to have stopped and made sure of traffic behind him before attempting to turn across the highway. And it was his plain duty to do so, if, as he says, the cabin of his truck made it impossible for him to put out his head far enough to get a view of what was behind him. And yet the driver of that truck was wholly exonerated from responsibility for the collision by the trial judge and the respondent\u2019s action against him and the owner of his truck was dismissed, with costs. The trial judge thought that Kelso did all he could, and that he was turning in a reasonable manner, having observed no oncoming vehicle behind. I fear that the fact that the respondent\u2019s driver Burns had taken some beer during the afternoon and again in the evening before starting out on his journey unduly affected the trial judge\u2019s view of the whole case. Although the appellants in their defence had set out specifically some ten or twelve items of alleged negligence, intoxication of the driver Burns was not even suggested and when evidence was brought out at the trial of the taking of the beer, the appellants\u2019 counsel stated to the judge:\nThere is nothing very serious about it, my Lord.\nAnd yet at the very beginning of the trial judge\u2019s reasons for judgment he refers to the taking of the beer by the driver Burns and says:\nHis condition can only be imagined, and I would find it was such that it would have a tendency to make him less observant and more reckless if, in fact, he was not completely under the influence of liquor. And the trial judge reverts to the matter at the close of his reasons for judgment when he says:\nIt seems to me that the whole proximate cause of this accident was the condition of the plaintiff driver and his failure to keep a proper lookout, possibly combined with the dimness of his lights. * * * I find that the plaintiff driver failed in his duty. I have no doubt whatever that such failure was largely caused by the beer he had consumed; it dimmed his senses and rendered him much less observant. That being so, I find that the plaintiff driver was wholly responsible for the accident, and exonerate the defendant driver Kelso.\nThere was no admissible evidence upon which the trial judge could reach any such conclusion as to the drunkenness of the driver Burns. The defendants\u2019 counsel, Mr. Schroeder, who is always very earnest and careful in the presentation of his cases, frankly stated to the judge, as above pointed out, that there was nothing very serious about it, and that was said after inadmissible evidence had been admitted, subject to objection, by the trial judge. Burns had with him at the time of the collision a \u201chitch-hike\u201d passenger named Charlebois who was not called as a witness though the evidence indicates that he was at the time of the trial working in a restaurant at Cobourg, Ontario. The trial judge admitted, notwithstanding objection, during the cross-examination of the highway traffic officer Rose, called by the plaintiff, what the witness described as \u201ca whole line of lingo\u201d given him by Charlebois. The witness gave what Charlebois said to him when in the doctor\u2019s car after the accident, but the witness added:\nI just looked at the man and considered that he was pretty nearly frantic; he was choking.\nThe alleged statement by Charlebois that the driver Burns had been drinking all the way from Montreal was in itself utterly false, if made, because Burns had only taken over the driving of the truck at Morrisburg, about 14\u00bd miles back of the place of the collision. Morrisburg is a town on the St. Lawrence river about 100 miles west of Montreal. The truck had been brought from Montreal by another driver altogether and Burns took it over at Morrisburg to drive it on to Toronto. But in any event the vice of the evidence is that it was merest hearsay. It was tendered and admitted upon a theory that it was a statement made in the presence of Burns. But the evidence is plain that whatever was said was said at a time when Burns, while physically present, had, according to the doctor\u2019s evidence, been given morphine and was suffering pain from burns received before getting out of the burning truck. Charlebois himself was in a \u201csort of raving condition\u201d at the time. Rose, the traffic officer, says that when he returned to Morrisburg and found that Burns had just taken charge of the truck there and that Charlebois had only gotten into the truck there, hitch hiking, \u201cI dismissed what he said.\u201d\nDr. O\u2019Connell, a near-by physician who was called at the time of the accident, washed Burns\u2019 arm with alcohol and gave him morphine. The doctor said he did not detect any smell of intoxicating drink on Burns and that there was nothing about his condition to make him think he was under the influence of liquor. Rose, the traffic officer, had said that when he saw Burns at a near-by farmhouse after the accident,\nthe man was suffering, and the doctor was looking after him then.\nand added:\nI could smell liquor on his breath; it seemed to be in the air that night; I could smell it everywhere; I could smell the doctor\u2019s alcohol that he had been working with; but the man was injured, and I would not care to pass judgment on him. His feet were injured. He was helped out to the doctor\u2019s car; the doctor was anxious to get him away to the hospital.\nThe evidence of Rose was given prior to the time that Mr. Schroeder told the trial judge that there was nothing very serious about it, and yet the trial judge shortly afterwards during the course of the trial said:\nI felt sure Mr. Schroeder was going to make more of it.\nNow Burns had driven from Toronto down to Morrisburg with another truck during the previous evening and after eight hours\u2019 sleep in Morrisburg was up and around at about 2 p.m. He did not leave with the truck in question, arriving from Montreal, until about 11 p.m. He admitted frankly that he had some beer during the afternoon and evening and Mr. Schroeder said to the Court during the evidence about the beer, \u201cI am not alleging he was intoxicated.\u201d Burns said that between two and five o\u2019clock in the afternoon he had taken three glasses of draught beer when he went to a hotel at two o\u2019clock; that he went for a swim around four o\u2019clock and got back around five o\u2019clock, and that he then had some more beer\u2014be bought a quart bottle. Later he had his supper about 6.30 o\u2019clock and he took about three-quarters of a glass of beer right after supper. He did not drink anything else that day besides beer; he had brought no liquor with him from Toronto and he had not bought any while in Morrisburg. Then when he was starting out on his trip at about eleven o\u2019clock at night, he had one glass more. The admissions of Burns were, of course, admissible but they do not go any such length as to warrant the trial judge taking the view he did of the whole case on the basis of a reckless, drunken driver.\nThe difficulty is to determine what disposition of the case ought now to be made by this Court. Like most motor car collision cases, this case turns on its own particular facts and where the findings of fact by the trial judge were obviously controlled by the evidence of the beer and which evidence (the alleged statements of Charlebois being wholly inadmissible) permeated his whole view of the broad estimate of responsibility for the collision, we are not in a position where, in my opinion, we can safely or fairly rest upon the findings. A new trial in such circumstances might be in many respects a satisfactory course, but it is a course which inevitably would work a great hardship on one, if not on both, of the parties. The respondent\u2019s (plaintiff\u2019s) driver was plainly guilty of at least some negligence that contributed to the collision and sec. 4 of The Negligence Act, R.S.O., 1937, ch. 115, provides that\nIf it is not practicable to determine the respective degree of fault or negligence as between any parties to an action, such parties shall be deemed to be equally at fault or negligent.\nI would therefore take advantage of that provision and award the respondent judgment for $4,500, being one-half the amount of the damages assessed by the trial judge.\nIn my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs, the cross-appeal allowed and the judgment appealed from set aside and judgment directed to be entered in favour of the respondent in the sum of $4,500, with costs throughout. KERWIN J.\u2014This is an appeal by the defendants, the owners and driver respectively of a truck, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The trial judge had dismissed the action brought by the respondent, the owner and driver of another truck, for damages sustained by reason of a collision between the two trucks and had allowed the appellants\u2019 counterclaim, as he found the respondent was solely to blame for the occurrence. In the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Riddell agreed with the trial judge. Mr. Justice McTague and Mr. Justice Gillanders were satisfied that the respondent had been guilty of negligence and in fact adopted the findings of the trial judge with respect thereto but differed from the view of the trial judge and Mr. Justice Riddell in that they considered that Kelso, the driver of the appellants\u2019 truck, was at fault to the extent of twenty-five per cent.\nWhile the trial judge placed considerable emphasis upon the quantity of beer consumed by the respondent, he also ascribed the proximate cause of the accident to the respondent\u2019s\nfailure to keep a proper lookout, possibly combined with the dimness of his lights. I find that he failed to observe the outstretched hand of the defendant driver, and also the flashing on and off of the rear light of the defendant\u2019s truck and the fact that the said truck was starting to edge towards the centre of the road with a view to turning into the side-road to the coal-yards. This side-road was perfectly visible, being marked with signs.\nAs has been pointed out, the findings of negligence against the respondent were adopted by all the members of the Court of Appeal. The majority, however, considered that Kelso had not complied with section 39, subsection 1(d) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O., 1937, chapter 288:\u2014\n(d) The driver or operator of a vehicle upon a highway before turning to the left from a direct line shall first see that such movement can be made in safety, and if the operation of any other vehicle may be affected by such movement shall give a signal plainly visible to the driver or operator of such other vehicle of the intention to make such movement.\nThey held that Kelso had not seen that his intended movement to the left could be made in safety and that his failure was one of the direct causes of the accident. The evidence indicates that Kelso looked in his rear view mirror and did not see the respondent\u2019s truck. Kelso admitted that the view reflected in the mirror was that of the land to the north of the road and not of the roadway in the rear of his own truck. At the point where Kelso commenced to veer to his left, there is a down grade in the road and also a curve to the south from east to west.\nThe majority in the Court of Appeal also appear to have thought that the appellants had not complied with section 12. 1 (b) of the Act:\u2014\nEvery motor vehicle other than a motorcycle shall be equipped with,\u2014\n(b) a mirror securely attached to such vehicle and placed in such a position as to afford the chauffeur or operator a clearly reflected view of the roadway in the rear, or of any vehicle approaching from the rear.\nI am rather inclined to agree, as I consider that the mirror required by this provision is one that may be tilted as required so \u201cas to afford the chauffeur or operator a clearly reflected view of the roadway in the rear.\u201d It does not appear from the evidence that the mirror installed on the appellants\u2019 truck was of such a character but the proper inference would appear to be that even if it were so, it was not put in such a position as to fulfil the requirements.\nThe respondent also contended that Kelso had not complied with section 39. 1 (c) of the Act:\u2014\n39. 1 (c) The driver or operator of the vehicle intending to turn to the left into an intersecting highway shall approach such intersection as closely as practicable to the centre line of the highway and the left turn shall be made by passing to the right of such centre line where it enters the intersection, and upon leaving the intersection by passing to the right of the centre line of the highway then entered.\nKelso intended to turn to the left into an intersecting highway. It is true that the front wheels of his truck had crossed the centre line of Highway No. 2 but, as found by the trial judge and all the members of the Court of Appeal, Marsh should have seen the veering to the left and Kelso\u2019s arm signal; and in any event Kelso had not yet entered the intersection of the two highways. In my view, Kelso did not commit any infraction of the last statutory provision.\nUpon consideration, I am of opinion that even if Kelso had committed the other infractions referred to they had nothing to do with the accident. If his rear view mirror had reflected the roadway in the rear of his truck, or if he had put his head out of the cab window and looked back, upon the evidence, he would not have seen the respondent\u2019s truck. In my opinion, the trial judge and Mr. Justice Riddell were right in determining that the sole cause of the accident was the negligence of the respondent.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial, with costs throughout. The cross-appeal of the respondent asking that all the blame be placed on Kelso is, of course, hopeless and must be dismissed with costs.\nHUDSON J.\u2014This was a highway traffic accident tried before Mr. Justice Urquhart without a jury. He found for the defendant, holding that the plaintiff\u2019s negligence was the sole cause of the accident. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Riddell agreed with the trial judge, but the majority, composed of Mr. Justice Gillanders and Mr. Justice McTague, while agreeing with the trial judge that the plaintiff himself was guilty of gross negligence, held that the defendant too had been guilty of negligence which contributed to the accident and assessed him with 25% of the damages.\nMr. Justice Gillanders in giving the opinion of the majority of the Court stated:\nThe learned trial judge has found the plaintiff\u2019s driver negligent and wholly responsible for the accident, and has exonerated Kelso, the driver of the defendant\u2019s truck, from all blame. He accepts the evidence of Kelso and Miss Douglas, a passenger in the defendant\u2019s truck, and, where the evidence of any other witness is in conflict with their testimony, he believes these two witnesses. He has also on conflicting evidence found the facts strongly in favour of the defendant, and it is the duty of this Court to accept his findings of fact supported by the evidence, his appraisal of the credibility of the witnesses, and the testimony of those witnesses whose evidence he accepts where there is a conflict.\nI fully accept and agree with his finding that the plaintiff\u2019s driver was negligent, amply supported as it is by the evidence; that the plaintiff\u2019s driver was not keeping a proper lookout; that he should have observed Kelso\u2019s hand and wrist as a signal; that the flashing on and off of the rear light of the defendant\u2019s truck caused by putting the brake on and off should have been seen, and that he should have seen the truck itself edging towards the centre of the road, and that his failure to keep a proper lookout was possibly largely caused by the beer he had consumed. The learned trial judge held specifically that he believed the evidence that \u201cno horn was sounded by the plaintiff and no warning given of his approach,\u201d and it is clear from the above quotation from the judgment of Mr. Justice Gillanders that the majority of the Court of Appeal accepted such finding. These are concurrent findings of fact.\nIt would then appear on the evidence, as I accept it, that the defendant\u2019s driver was travelling westward on a highway at a moderate rate of speed. For a distance of 100 feet or more he had veered slightly to the left and eventually reached a point where the left front fender of his car was about 2 feet from the left of the centre of the road. At this moment the side of his car was struck by the plaintiff\u2019s car which had approached from the rear at a high rate of speed and was attempting to pass without warning.\nI do not think that the argument based on the Highway Traffic Act applies to the facts here. The defendant had not yet started to make the sort of turn contemplated by the statute.\nThe onus is heavily on the driver of a motor vehicle attempting to pass another from the rear to excuse himself from responsibility for a collision with a car ahead.\nIn my view, the negligence of the plaintiff\u2019s driver was the substantial cause of the accident: see Swadling v. Cooper[2]. The appeal should be allowed, the cross-appeal dismissed, and the judgment at the trial restored with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed, cross-appeal dismissed, and judgment at trial restored, with costs throughout.\nSolicitors for the appellants: MacCracken, Fleming & Schroeder.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hughes, Agar & Thompson.\n[1] [1939] O.R. 338; [1939] 3 D.L.R. 137.\n[2] [1931] A.C. 1, at 10.\n"

Industrial Electric Products Ltd., [1940] S.C.R. 406\nDate: 1940-05-21\nNational Electric Products Corporation (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nIndustrial Electric Products, Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1939: Nov. 13, 14; 1940: May 21.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Crocket, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nPatent\u2014Validity\u2014Infringement.\nAn appeal from the judgment of Maclean J., [1939] Ex. C.R. 282, dismissing; plaintiff's action for alleged infringement of its patent for an invention relating to armoured electric cables, was dismissed.\nAn essential element in the alleged invention was a clearance space, to be made by unwinding one or more coils of the fibrous material covering the insulated conductor or conductors, to receive a protecting bushing within the end portion of the cut-off metallic outer sheath of the cable. Defendant manufactured and sold armoured cables, and sold, for the purpose of preparing a piece of the cable for installation, bags of bushings purchased from a United States company which made them under a United States patent, which bushings were to be inserted over the fibrous material (paper) covering the insulated conductors.\nPer the Chief Justice, Crocket, Davis and Hudson JJ.: Defendant did not infringe plaintiff's patent. Defendant's cable did not infringe, as every element in it was old and well known at the date of the patent and there was no invention in the combination found in that cable; and there could be no invention in merely inserting one of the bushings soldi by defendant for the purpose of preparing a piece of the cable for installation; the use of a bushing in electrical installations for purposes the same or closely analogous to that for which the patented invention employed it was well known long before that invention; the bushings sold by defendant could be readily inserted over the fibrous material (paper) covering the insulated conductors in defendant's armoured cables; and in the article produced by so inserting the bushing there could be no infringement of plaintiff's patent, since the clearance space, an essential feature of plaintiff's patented invention, was left out.\nPer Kerwin J.: Plaintiff's patent was invalid for want of invention.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing the plaintiff's action for a declaration of infringement of patent, and for an injunction, damages, etc. The patent had been granted to plaintiff, as the assignee of 0. A. Frederickson, the applicant, for an invention relating to armoured electric cables. Maclean J. held that there was no subject-matter in the patent sued upon.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and M. B. Gordon for the appellant.\nE. G. Gowling and G. F. Henderson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Crocket, Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014In the appellant's factum it is stated:\n* * * in fact it is of the essence of Frederickson's invention that the paper should be capable of being readily unwound to expose the conductors, and that it should be adapted to be withdrawn from under the end of the armor for a short distance.\nIndeed, the specification is very explicit on the point that the dominant purpose of having a paper \"adapted to be withdrawn from the end of the armor\" is to provide a clearance for the insertion of the bushing.\nAt page 113 of the Case it is said:\nBefore the bushing 18 may be inserted in the armored sheath it is necessary to provide a clearance space for the bushing, but this is readily done by drawing several coils of the fibrous material 15 out of the space between the covered conductors 12 and metal sheath 14 as will be apparent from Fig. 2, whereupon the expansion bushing may be readily inserted to its final position in which it is shown in Fig. 5.\nAt page 114 it is said:\nIn the armored cables employed heretofore it has been customary to provide a braided or woven jacket over the two or more covered insulated conductors and then apply the armored covering directly over the braided or woven jacket in relatively snug engagement with the bracket. There is therefore not sufficient room between the metal covering and outer jacket of the armored cables constructed heretofore to receive a bushing 18, and it is practically impossible to remove a sufficient amount of the braided or woven jacket from the interior of the armored covering to form a sufficient clearance space to receive the bushing 18.\nAt page 111, it is said:\nInasmuch as the insulating fibrous webbing is laid spirally about the conductor or conductors, it is readily unwound from the exposed portion or ends of the conductors when the metallic sheath has been cut, and such removal is readily accomplished by an unwinding action which may be extended down into the metallic sheath itself, thereby providing sufficient space for the ready insertion of the interior bushing or sleeve, as hereinbefore referred to. By this construction it will be evident at once that the sharp edges and burrs at the end of the cut off armored or metallic sheath are prevented from injuring the insulation on the conductor or conductors. In the preferred form of the invention in the respects above noted the bushing is formed of insulating material such as fibre, bakelite or the like, so that even should injury occur to the insulation of the conductor or conductors, the bushing will itself insulate the conductors from the metallic outer sheath.\nFigure 5 of the drawings shows the bushing 18 and the clearance space adverted to in the first of the passages quoted. It is clear from all this, moreover, that this clearance space is an integral element in the combination and also that, as the patentee conceives it, it is an essential element in his invention.\nThe respondents manufacture and sell armoured cable which has two insulated wires side by side with a spirally wound paper cover. The whole is contained in a spirally wound metallic sheath. They also sell bags of insulating bushings which are purchased from the American Metal Moulding Co., a United States Corporation. That company makes these bushings under United States patent No. 1,793,697.\nIt is too clear for discussion, I think, that the cable of the respondents does not infringe the appellants' patent. Every element in the cable was old and well known at the date of the patent and there is no invention in the combination found in that cable.\nI agree with the learned trial judge that there would be no invention in merely inserting one of the fibre bushings sold by the respondents for the purpose of preparing a piece of this cable for installation; but what seems to be contended on behalf of the appellants is that you have something more than the mere addition of the fibrous bushing. You have the clearance made by the removal of part of the paper covering.\nNow, it cannot, I think, be seriously disputed that these fibrous bushings can be readily inserted over the paper covering. I do not think the suggestion need be taken too seriously that loose ends of paper which might be left might create a fire risk. Any competent workman would quickly remove these ends and it is not open to argument, I think, that in the article produced by so inserting the bushings you would have no infringement of the appellants' patent; since the clearance space, an essential feature, as the patentee plainly declares it to be, and as the argument insists it is, is left out. I find it, very difficult to accede to the contention which the appellants' argument seems to involve that you have invention if you pull out some of the paper and leave a clearance space and then insert the bushing; while you have no invention if you insert the bushing over the paper without making a clearance.\nTo put the thing more simply, it is very clear, in my opinion, that the respondents' cable in itself does not involve invention. At the date of the appellants' patent, you could not have obtained a patent for it because there would have been nothing new in it in the patent sense. I think also it is clear that you do not reach the level of invention by adding the element of the fibre ferrule, whether you insert the ferrule over the paper covering or after you have made a clearance space by taking away some of the paper covering.\nThe use of a bushing in electrical installations for purposes the same or closely analogous to that for which Frederickson employed it was well known long before 1927. There was ample evidence to justify the finding of the learned trial judge that each of the elements of the supposed combination was old and that they performed the same function in Frederickson's cable as in the old use.\nAs to infringement, it cannot be disputed that if a purchaser follows the directions as to the manner in which the bushings are to be used there is no infringement. There is no ground for holding that this direction is colourable or that it is given in the expectation that it will be disregarded. In these circumstances I think the proper conclusion of fact is that the appellants' invention has not been taken.\nThere is no evidence of agency or of partnership and on the facts one could not properly find, to borrow the language of Vaughan Williams L.J. in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co., Ltd., v. David Moseley & Sons, Ltd.[2], any relation between the parties of \" principals in the first degree\" or of \"aider and abettor.\"\nI must not be supposed to give any adherence to the argument that the existence of this latter relationship would be sufficient. The existence of any one of these relationships is, of course, in every case a question of fact which must be determined upon the evidence in the particular case.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nKerwin J.\u2014I agree with the learned President of the Exchequer Court that there was no invention in Frederickson. Being of that opinion, I do not enter into the question as to whether, if there had been subject-matter, the respondents infringed.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs\nSolicitors for the appellant: Smart & Biggar.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Singer & Kert.\n[1] [1939] Ex.

On December 6, 1932, at a special general meeting of the shareholders, at which all were represented, defendant presented a statement showing the assets which had come into his hands as liquidator and other statements showing distribution among shareholders and accounting for receipts and disbursements; it was explained, among other things, \u201cthat there has been reserved for taxation, legal charges, and other expenses the sum of $25,000 to be used as the liquidator with the advice of [two named persons] may determine.\u201d By resolution the liquidator\u2019s report was adopted and the plan of distribution approved. On December 10, 1932, the liquidator\u2019s return as to such meeting was filed in the Provincial Secretary\u2019s office as required by s. 229 of said Act, which provides that \u201con the expiration of three months from the date of the filing the corporation shall ipso facto be dissolved.\u201d\nThe said sum of $25,000 consisted of bonds of the face value of $25,000. These bonds or proceeds thereof when received in 1933 by the liquidator from the company\u2019s custodian were of the value of $28,037.21. The liquidator paid thereout certain sums on account of taxation, legal and other expenses.\nPlaintiffs, shareholders in the company, in 1935 demanded distribution of said sum of $25,000, and later, suing on behalf of themselves and all other shareholders of the company of record in the year 1932 other than defendant, brought action against the liquidator. The claim endorsed on the writ was for an accounting of said sum of $25,000, and payment thereof and of interest, less the amount, if any, that might be found to be due and owing to defendant for his fees and disbursements as liquidator; and to recover possession of books, documents, etc., of the company. In their pleadings the plaintiffs claimed a declaration that the company had not been fully wound up or dissolved, an order that the winding-up proceedings be continued under the court\u2019s supervision and that another liquidator be appointed in place of defendant, an accounting and payment of the amount with interest \u201cthat may be found to be due to [the company] or to the shareholders thereof,\u201d possession of books, documents, etc.\nHeld: (1) As against the plaintiffs, in the absence of fraud, the company was fully wound up and dissolved at the expiration of three months from the date of said filing of defendant\u2019s return with the Provincial Secretary.\n(2) The minutes of said meeting of December 6, 1932, as to reservation of the sum of $25,000 could not be taken as an arrangement whereby defendant was to retain the moneys for himself in settlement of all matters, including protection against his liability for prospective claims for taxes, legal charges and expenses.\n(3) (Reversing on this point the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1940] O.R. 28.) The relief of an accounting could be given to plaintiffs in the action as framed (even without calling in aid R. 183, Ontario Rules of Practice). Though plaintiffs sought a declaration (which could not be made) that the company had not been fully wound up or dissolved, yet their claim for an accounting was not subsidiary or consequential upon any declaration that might be so made. Sec. 201(a) of said Act (providing that, upon a voluntary winding up, the property of the corporation shall, subject to satisfaction of its liabilities, and unless otherwise provided by its by-laws, be distributed rateably amongst the shareholders) referred to. APPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which (reversing the judgment of Roach J.[2]) dismissed the action, without prejudice to any further proceedings that the plaintiffs might be advised to take. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported, and are also discussed in the reasons for judgment in the Courts below. The appeal to this Court was allowed but the relief granted in this Court differed in form from that granted by the trial judge, and is set out at the conclusion of the reasons for judgment of Kerwin J.\nG.W. Mason K.C. and C.B. Henderson K.C. for the appellants.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and A.W.R. Sinclair K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014In this action the plaintiffs appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, which allowed an appeal by the defendant from the judgment of the trial judge2. The plaintiffs are William L. Christie, I. Huntly Christie, Katharine Christie and Emma L. Christie, suing on behalf of themselves and all other shareholders of Erwik Estates Limited of record in the year 1932, other than the defendant George Edwards, and the said George Edwards is the sole defendant. The issues involved may be appreciated after a statement of certain events and a reference to the pleadings.\nBy letters patent under the Ontario Companies Act, a company was incorporated, the name of which was subsequently changed to Erwik Estates Limited. The principal shareholder, Robert J. Christie, by his will, appointed as executors National Trust Company Limited, Charles E. Edmonds, and the defendant George Edwards. At all relevant times the shareholders of the Company and the number of shares held by them, respectively, were: Executors of Robert J. Christie, deceased, 3,498 shares; the plaintiff, William L. Christie, 300 shares; the plaintiff, I. Huntly Christie, 300 shares; the plaintiff, Katharine Christie, 300 shares; the plaintiff, Emma L. Christie, 600 shares; the said Charles E. Edmonds, 1 share; the defendant, 1 share; making a total of 5,000 shares, being the total authorized and issued capital stock of the Company.\nOn May 2, 1932, there was held a special general meeting of the shareholders, at which it was resolved that the Company be wound up voluntarily under the provisions of Part XIV of the Ontario Companies Act, R.S.O. 1927, chapter 218, and that the defendant be appointed liquidator. On December 6, 1932, at a special general meeting of the shareholders, at which all were represented, the defendant presented a statement showing the assets which had come into his hands as liquidator and other statements showing the distribution, as of April 30, 1932, of those assets among the shareholders, and accounting for the receipts and disbursements since that date to the end of November. The minutes of this meeting conclude:\nIt was explained that the distribution of the assets had been effected partly in cash and partly in specie, as shown by the separate accounts prepared for each shareholder; and that to the extent that the distribution had been made in specie due account had been taken of accrued interest; and that to ensure a fair and equitable distribution regard was had to both the cost price, and also the market price of each security as determined by independent and competent opinion; and that there has been reserved for taxation, legal charges, and other expenses the sum of $25,000 to be used as the Liquidator with the advice of Messrs. Laughton and Edmonds may determine.\nThe Liquidator produced the bank statements for inspection as required by statute.\nAfter discussion it was upon motion duly seconded,\nResolved, that the report of the Liquidator be adopted, and the plan of distribution approved.\nThe motion was adopted without dissent.\nThe meeting then adjourned.\nThe Messrs. Laughton and Edmonds referred to are respectively the Assistant Estates Manager of National Trust Company, Limited, one of the executors of Robert J. Christie, and Charles E. Edmonds, also an executor and the holder of one share in the Company.\nOn December 9, 1932, the defendant notified the Provincial Secretary for Ontario of the meeting of December 6, reported that the affairs of the Company had been fully wound up and returned the original letters patent and the supplementary letters patent by which the name of the incorporated Company had been changed. This report was filed in the Provincial Secretary\u2019s office on December 10. These steps were taken under section 229 of the Companies Act, which reads as follows:\n229. (1) Where the affairs of the corporation have been fully wound up, the liquidator shall make up an account showing the manner in which the winding up has been conducted, and the property of the corporation disposed of, and thereupon shall call a general meeting of the shareholders or members of the corporation for the purpose of having the account laid before them and hearing any explanation that may be given by the liquidator, and the meeting shall be called in the manner provided by the by-laws for calling general meetings.\n(2) The liquidator shall make a return to the Provincial Secretary of such meeting having been held, and of the date at which the same was held, and the return shall be filed in the office of the Provincial Secretary; and on the expiration of three months from the date of the filing the corporation shall ipso facto be dissolved.\nIn July, 1935, the then solicitors for the plaintiffs, on three occasions, wrote the defendant asking for the distribution of the twenty-five thousand dollars fund referred to in the minutes of the meeting of December 6, 1932, but no reply was sent to these communications. A motion was launched by the plaintiffs in the Supreme Court of Ontario for an order under section 222 of the Act. This motion was dismissed by the Chief Justice of the High Court, before whom it was argued, but without prejudice to any claim the applicants might have otherwise.\nThe present action was then instituted and in view of the manner in which it presented itself to the trial judge and to the members of the Court of Appeal, it appears desirable to state what is claimed. The endorsement on the writ of summons reads:\nThe Plaintiffs\u2019 claim is for an accounting of the sum of $25,000 which was reserved for the liquidator\u2019s expenses at the time of the voluntary winding up of Erwik Estates Limited and which sum together with interest thereon is unlawfully in the possession of the Defendant and for payment to the Plaintiffs of the said amount of money and accrued interest thereon to date of judgment herein less the amount, if any, that may be found to be due and owing to the Defendant for his fees and disbursements as liquidator of Erwik Estates Limited.\nAnd the Plaintiffs\u2019 further claim is to recover possession of all books, documents and other writings of Erwik Estates Limited, and its predecessor Christie Brown & Co. Limited. The statement of claim, after setting forth a number of the details already mentioned and referring specifically to the fund of twenty-five thousand dollars, contains the following allegation in paragraph 16:\n16. The sum of $25,000 referred to in paragraph 15 consisted of Province of Ontario bonds of the face value of $25,000 bearing interest at 5\u00bd per cent. and maturing on February 1, 1947.\nParagraph 17 and part of paragraph 21 are as follows:\n17. The said bonds and\/or the proceeds thereof have subsequently come into the control and possession of the Defendant Edwards and the Defendant Edwards has refused at all times to give to the Plaintiffs any account of his dealings with the same other than his suggestion that he is entitled to the same as his fee as liquidator.\n21. The Plaintiffs were unaware that the Defendant had personally secured possession of the $25,000 bonds aforesaid or the proceeds thereof until June, 1935, whereupon the Plaintiff I. Huntley Christie consulted his solicitor who made three written demands upon the Defendant Edwards under date of July 9, July 20 and July 31, 1935, for an accounting of the said money but did not receive any reply. * * *\nThe statement of claim concludes:\nThe Plaintiffs therefore claim on behalf of themselves and all other shareholders of Erwik Estates Limited other than the Defendant:\n(a) A declaration that Erwik Estates Limited has not been fully wound up or dissolved.\n(b) An order that the winding-up proceedings be continued under the supervision of this Honourable Court and\/or the Defendant be removed as liquidator of Erwik Estates Limited, and that this Honourable Court doth appoint another liquidator in his place and stead.\n(c) An accounting from the Defendant of the said bonds of $25,000 and for payment of the amount with interest at 5 per cent. that may be found to be due to Erwik Estates Limited or to the shareholders thereof.\n(d) For payment or refund to Erwik Estates Limited or to the shareholders thereof of the sum of $950 being the proportionate part of the monies received by the Defendant in 1932 from Erwik Estates Limited as mentioned in paragraph Number 10 for the period subsequent to the 30th day of April, 1932.\n(e) To recover possession of all books, documents and other papers of Erwik Estates Limited and Christie, Brown & Company Limited.\n(f) Their costs of this action.\n(g) Such further or other relief as to this Honourable Court may seem meet and proper.\nBy his statement of defence, the defendant admits paragraph 16 of the statement of claim, and paragraph 9 of his own pleading is as follows:\n9. The Defendant alleges that between the 18th day of March, 1933, and the 31st day of July, 1933, he received from National Trust Company Limited, which had been the custodian of the securities of the Company, the said bonds and proceeds thereof amounting to the sum of $28,037.21, and with the knowledge and advice of Messrs. Laughton and Edmonds previously obtained, he paid out on account of taxation, legal and other expenses, the sum of $5,799.63.\nAt the trial, certain extracts from the defendant\u2019s examination for discovery were put in evidence, from which it appears that the defendant treated the matter as if the shareholders had no interest in the disposition of the fund. It also appears that while the defendant stated he had paid out $5,799.63 (the sum mentioned in paragraph 9 of his statement of defence), $1,275 of that amount had been paid to National Trust Company Limited as an annual fee for the year 1932 for the safe keeping of securities comprising the assets of the Company; that upon the Trust Company discovering that Erwik Estates Limited was really not operating as from about May 1 of that year, it returned to the defendant $850 as being the proportion of the fee which it considered it had not earned. It further appears that included in the $5,799.63 was the annual fee for 1932 ($1,500) to the defendant as one of the executors of the R.J. Christie Estate,\u2014the practice apparently having been for the executors, as the holders of the great majority of the shares of Erwik Estates Limited, to transact a great part of the Company\u2019s affairs. None of the parties to the action testified.\nThe trial judge took the view that it was a condition precedent to the operation of section 229 of the Act that the affairs of the Company should have been fully wound up, and that in view of the reservation of the twenty-five thousand dollars fund, this had not happened. The judgment declared that the Company had not been fully wound up or dissolved, removed the defendant as liquidator and directed a reference to the Master to appoint a new liquidator and to take an account as between the defendant and the new liquidator. The Court of Appeal were of the opinion that as against the plaintiffs, in the absence of fraud, the Company was fully wound up and dissolved at the expiration of three months from the date of the filing of the defendant\u2019s report with the Provincial Secretary. With that view I agree and, as pointed out in the reasons for judgment of McTague J.A. (Gillanders J.A. agreeing and Riddell J.A. agreeing in the result), the same conclusion had been reached in the Court of Appeal in England in two cases, In re Pinto Silver Mining Company[3] and In re London and Caledonian Marine Insurance Company[4].\nAt the end of his reasons for judgment, Mr. Justice McTague states:\nWhile it is the view of the Court that the defendant should be made to account, we feel we cannot give this relief in the action as framed. If we are right in our views then there is no such company as Erwik Estates Limited, no shareholders thereof, and the liquidator as such is functus officio. While technical justice is to be avoided where possible, we do not think that the application of Rule 183 can go so far as to justify us reconstituting the whole action, particularly when it is a matter of conjecture as to how far the defendant would be prejudiced by such action at this stage of the proceedings.\nUpon this branch of the case I feel constrained to differ from the Court of Appeal. It is true there is now no such company as Erwik Estates Limited and there can, therefore, be no shareholders, but this action is brought by several people who were shareholders and who sue on behalf of themselves and all others, except the defendant, who were shareholders of record in the year 1932. Section 201 of the Act provides in part:\nUpon a voluntary winding up:\n(a) the property of the corporation shall be applied in satisfaction of all its liabilities pari passu, and, subject thereto, shall, unless it is otherwise provided by the by\u2011laws of the corporation, be distributed rateably amongst the shareholders or members according to their rights and interests in the corporation;\nFrom the outset the plaintiffs demanded an accounting\u2014by the three letters of the solicitors to the defendant, by the endorsement on the writ of summons, and by the statement of claim. It is true that they also sought a declaration that Erwik Estates Limited had not been fully wound up or dissolved but the claim for an accounting was not subsidiary or consequential upon any declaration that might be so made.\nThe defendant\u2019s contention is that the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars referred to in the minutes of the meeting of December 6, 1932, was handed over to him and that the shareholders have no concern with the disposition of the fund. In his statement of defence he alleged that before the date of that meeting he informed the plaintiffs William L. Christie and I. Huntly Christie of his opinion that, if the Company were wound up, its assets distributed among the shareholders, and the Company dissolved, all prospective claims for taxes and for all legal fees and expenses in connection with the winding up, distribution of assets, and dissolution of the Company could be settled for the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars, and that on that basis the plaintiffs William L. Christie and I. Huntly Christie approved of such winding up, distribution and dissolution, and agreed to recommend the same to the plaintiffs Katharine Christie and Emma L. Christie. No proof was made, or attempted to be made, of this allegation. It is further to be remarked that to establish the fund, the defendant retained or secured control of 5\u00bd per cent. bonds of the Province of Ontario maturing February 1, 1947, which, because of the premium at which they were sold (and possibly because of some accrued interest), produced the sum of $28,037.21. The minutes of the meeting of December 6, 1932, which the defendant sets up as an agreement between himself and the shareholders, whereby he might retain \u201cthe sum of twenty-five thousand dollars\u201d cannot be taken to mean what he suggests; and certainly it could not be taken to include bonds which realized the sum mentioned.\nEven without calling in aid the provisions of Rule 183 of the Ontario Rules of Practice, I do not find any difficulty in granting to the plaintiffs in this action the accounting relief which they claim. The defendant secured the bonds or the proceeds thereof and, on his own admission, still has those proceeds, less certain disbursements. The plaintiffs are the only persons beneficially entitled to the estate of Robert J. Christie and, in any event, sue on behalf of themselves and all other shareholders of record in 1932. If the proper construction of the minutes of the meeting of December 6, 1932, be as I have indicated, it would be strange indeed, in view of the provisions of section 201 of the Act, if this action as framed is not sufficient to call upon the defendant, under the circumstances, to account.\nThe appeal should be allowed but in lieu of the judgment directed to be entered by the trial judge, there should be judgment directing a reference to the Master of the Supreme Court of Ontario to take an account of the $25,000 in bonds received by the defendant (or the proceeds thereof) and to determine what sums have been properly expended by the defendant out of the said bonds, or the proceeds of the same, and to determine the balance of the said bonds and the proceeds of the same unexpended by the defendant, and interest on so much thereof as has remained or should have remained in the hands of the defendant from time to time. In determining such balance, the Master shall not have regard to any claim which the defendant may put forward for remuneration as liquidator (see clause (c) of section 201 of the Act). Any sum found to be due from the defendant is to be paid into the Supreme Court of Ontario to the credit of this cause, subject to the further order of the Court. The plaintiffs are entitled to their costs throughout. The costs of the reference are reserved to be disposed of by a Judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario after the Master shall have made his report.\nRINFRET J.\u2014The appeal should be allowed and there should be judgment directing a reference to the Master of the Supreme Court of Ontario to take an account of the $25,000, as stated in my brother Kerwin\u2019s reasons. The plaintiffs are entitled to their costs throughout, the costs of the reference to be disposed of by a Judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario, after the Master shall have made his report.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: C.B.

T. defaulted in payments and appellant, assignee of the conditional vendor, became entitled under the agreement to re-take from T. possession of the car, but did not do so. A bailiff, acting under executions against T., seized the car and, at bailiff\u2019s sale, sold it to respondent who took possession. Appellant sued respondent for the amount unpaid under the conditional sale agreement, or possession of the car. Respondent claimed that it was a purchaser for valuable consideration in good faith and without notice of appellant\u2019s claim and that the conditional sale agreement, for want of registration, was invalid as against it.\nHeld (reversing judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1940] O.R. 115): Appellant was entitled to judgment. Respondent, as purchaser from the bailiff, was not a subsequent purchaser claiming \u201cfrom or under\u201d T. within the meaning of s. 2 (1) of said Act, and therefore could not invoke that enactment; therefore respondent acquired only the interest in the car which the bailiff had the right to sell, that is, only the execution debtor\u2019s (T.\u2019s) interest or equity in it.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff (by special leave granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario) from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which court (Robertson C.J.O. dissenting) dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the judgment of His Honour Judge Livingstone, of the County Court of the County of Welland, dismissing the action. The action was brought to recover the sum of $245.25 (as damages for conversion) and interest thereon, as being the unpaid balance of purchase price of a motor car, or in the alternative a declaration that the plaintiff was entitled to possession of the car and an order directing defendant to deliver up possession. The car had been purchased by defendant at a bailiff\u2019s sale under executions against one Teakle, who had purchased the car under a conditional sale agreement, which was not registered, and under which Teakle had made default in payment. Plaintiff, who was assignee of the conditional vendor, claimed the right to possession of the car. Defendant claimed that it was a purchaser of the car in good faith for valuable consideration and without notice of the claim of the plaintiff or any other person through whom plaintiff claimed title, and pleaded s. 2 (1) of the Conditional Sales Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 182.\nH.F. Parkinson K.C. for the appellant.\nA.L. Brooks K.C. and J.D. Cromarty for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Davis J. was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014A bailiff of the First Division Court of the County of Welland in the Province of Ontario, acting under executions issued pursuant to judgments of the said Court, seized the motor car in question in these proceedings and purported to sell the same under the executions to the respondent. The purported sale between the bailiff and the respondent was carried out and possession of the car delivered by the bailiff to the respondent. The car some six months prior to the seizure and sale had been purchased by Robert Teakle, the execution debtor, from Mills Motor Sales under a conditional sale agreement. Mills Motor Sales, on its part, assigned the conditional sale agreement to the appellant. Teakle took possession of the motor car at the time of the making of the conditional sale agreement and continued in possession until the time of the bailiff\u2019s seizure. In the interval, however, he had made default in payments called for under the agreement and by the terms of the agreement the appellant (as assignee of the conditional vendor) had become entitled to re-take possession of the car, though it had not in fact done so. It is plain that the property in the car never passed from the conditional vendor to the conditional purchaser. Subsequent to the bailiff\u2019s sale and delivery of the car to the respondent, the appellant made demand upon the respondent for possession of the car and, upon refusal to deliver or to pay the balance owing under the conditional sale agreement, the appellant commenced this action in the County Court of the County of Welland against the respondent, claiming damages for detention or conversion of the car. The amount of the purchase price unpaid under the conditional sale agreement at the time amounted to $245.25, together with arrears of interest.\nThe respondent defended the action upon the ground that it became a purchaser for value in good faith for valuable consideration without any notice of the appellant\u2019s claim and took the position that the conditional sale agreement, not having been filed, was invalid as against the respondent. It is admitted that a copy of the conditional sale agreement had not been filed in the office of the Clerk of the County Court as provided by subsec. (1) (b) of sec. 2 of the Ontario Conditional Sales Act, R.S.O. 1937, ch. 182. The County Court Judge dismissed the appellant\u2019s action and the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirmed the judgment, Robertson, C.J.O., dissenting. By special leave of the Court of Appeal, a further appeal was taken to this Court.\nA bailiff or sheriff to whom an execution is directed has authority only to seize and sell the property of the execution debtor. While the execution debtor here may have been in possession of the motor car, he had never acquired the property in the car. But by the combined force of sec. 165 of the Division Courts Act, R.S.O. 1937, ch. 107, and sec. 18 of the Execution Act, R.S.O. 1937, ch. 125, the bailiff had authority to sell the interest or equity of the execution debtor in the chattel and the sale by the bailiff, being under executions against goods issued out of a division court, would convey whatever equitable or other interest the execution debtor had or was entitled to in or in respect of the chattel at the time of the seizure.\nIt is not disputed that the bailiff seized and sold the motor car as if it had been the property of the execution debtor and no doubt the respondent purchased the car from the bailiff thinking it was acquiring the ownership of the car. But a purchaser from a sheriff or bailiff acquires only the interest in the goods which the sheriff or bailiff had the right to sell.\nAs Middleton J. (as he then was) said in Re Phillips and La Paloma Sweets Ltd.[2]:\nIt is elementary law that an execution creditor, apart from some statutory provision, has no greater right than the execution debtor, and that the sheriff\u2019s sale can only give to the purchaser the right and title of the debtor; so here the applicant has no greater or other right than the execution debtor unless he can point to some statute assisting him.\nAnd as was said in Overn v. Strand[3]:\nA purchaser, therefore, at a sale under execution is under no obligation to go behind the writ, but, in order to make sure that he will acquire title to the goods he buys, he must see that the court issuing the writ had jurisdiction to do so; that the writ is regular on its face, and that the goods sold by the sheriff are the goods of the execution debtor.\nApart, then, from any statutory provision which may be invoked by the respondent in the circumstances of the case to defeat the appellant\u2019s claim to the property in the car, the respondent purchased from the bailiff nothing more than the execution debtor\u2019s interest or equity in the car.\nBut there is really no controversy about the position of the bailiff and his sale. The real controversy turns upon the provisions of the Conditional Sales Act, R.S.O. 1937, ch. 182. What the respondent has said throughout is that by virtue of sec. 2 the appellant was not entitled to set up the conditional sale as against the respondent because a copy of the agreement had not been filed in the office of the Clerk of the County Court of the county in which the conditional purchaser resided at the time of the agreement to sell and that it, the respondent, had purchased from the bailiff without notice, in good faith, and for valuable consideration. But the respondent, to gain advantage under said sec. 2, must be a subsequent purchaser \u201cclaiming from or under\u201d the original conditional purchaser. That is exactly what the respondent claims to be and if it is, then the conditional sale agreement which provided that the ownership was to remain in the conditional vendor until payment, is invalid as against the respondent. The determination of the appeal turns solely upon the question of the proper construction of sec. 2 of the Conditional Sales Act, that is, whether or not the respondent as purchaser from the bailiff became \u201ca subsequent purchaser * * * claiming from or under\u201d the original conditional purchaser. In my opinion the respondent did not; it purchased whatever it did purchase from the bailiff and it got only what the bailiff had to sell. We are not entitled to strain the plain language of the section so as to bring the respondent within its reach as a subsequent purchaser \u201cfrom or under\u201d the original conditional purchaser. It is to be observed that subsec. (1) of sec. 2 is for the protection of \u201ca subsequent purchaser or mortgagee claiming from or under the purchaser, proposed purchaser or hirer, without notice in good faith and for valuable consideration.\u201d Subsec. (3) of the same section specifically provides that where the possession of goods is delivered \u201cto any person for the purpose of resale by him in the course of business\u201d such provision (i.e., subsec. (1)) \u201cshall also, as against his creditors, be invalid and he shall be deemed the owner of the goods unless the provisions of this Act have been complied with.\u201d As Meredith, C.J. C.P., said in Re Alcock Ingram & Co. Ltd.[4] in considering the statute:\nIn short, subsec. (1) is for the benefit of \u201csubsequent purchasers or mortgagees\u201d; subsec. (3) is for the benefit of creditors.\nIt may be observed that the Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act, R.S.O. 1937, ch. 181, which is a statute in pari materia, provides by sec. 4 that\nEvery mortgage of goods and chattels in Ontario, which is not accompanied by an immediate delivery and an actual and continued change of possession of the things mortgaged, shall be registered * * *\nas stipulated in the statute; and by sec. 7,\nIf the mortgage and affidavits are not registered as by this Act provided, the mortgage shall be absolutely null and void as against creditors of the mortgagor, and as against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration.\nThe word \u201ccreditors\u201d as defined by sec. 1 (b) of that Act includes creditors having executions against the goods and chattels of a mortgagor in the hands of a sheriff or other officer. While I do not find it necessary to resort to the history of the Ontario legislation under the Conditional Sales Act to determine the question in issue, it is reassuring to the view I take of the particular section of the statute involved in this appeal to follow through the course of the legislation. The statute was originally enacted in 1888 by 51 Vict., ch. 19, to come into force on the 1st of January, 1889. The statute only applied to manufactured goods and chattels, and conditional sales were only to be valid as against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees without notice in good faith for valuable consideration in the case of such goods which at the time possession was given had the name and address of the manufacturer, bailor or vendor of same painted, printed, stamped or engraved thereon or otherwise plainly attached thereto and unless the bailment was evidenced in writing signed by the bailee or his agent; or, alternatively, where there was registration of the conditional agreement with the Clerk of the County Court of the county in which the bailee or conditional purchaser resided at the time the bailment or conditional purchase was made. The original statute, with slight amendments made by 53 Vict., ch. 36, and by 60 Vict., ch. 14, sec. 80, was carried into the Revised Statutes of Ontario 1897 as ch. 149. Then in 1911 (by 1 Geo. V, ch. 30), the Act was substantially changed into somewhat its present form and as such was carried into the Revised Statutes of 1914 as ch. 136. In the 1911 statute the word \u201cgoods\u201d was defined so as to include \u201cwares and merchandise\u201d and the statute was made more comprehensive in its scope in that it was no longer limited to manufactured goods. The invalidity of a conditional sale accompanied by delivery of possession as against a subsequent purchaser or mortgagee where a copy of the agreement was not filed in the office of the Clerk of the County or District Court, remained. But the special provision (now found in amended form as subsec. (3) of sec. 2 of the present Act) that where the delivery is made to a trader or other person for the purpose of resale by him in the course of business, the agreement \u201cshall also, as against his creditors, be invalid and he (the conditional purchaser) shall be deemed the owner of the goods,\u201d which appeared for the first time in the 1911 Conditional Sales Act, had been introduced originally into the Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act in 1892 (by 55 Vict., ch. 26, secs. 5 and 6) whereby it was provided that if possession of goods was to pass to a trader or other person for the purpose of resale by him in the course of business, but not the absolute ownership until certain payments were made or other considerations satisfied, \u201cany such provision as to ownership shall as against creditors, mortgagees or purchasers be void, and the sale or transfer be deemed to have been absolute,\u201d unless the agreement was in writing signed by the parties to the agreement, or their agents, and unless such writing was filed in the office of the County Court Clerk of the county in which the goods were situate at the time of making the agreement. Subsecs. (3) and (4) of sec. 3 of the 1911 statute, 1 Geo. V, ch. 30, produced into the Conditional Sales Act the provision as to delivery to a trader or other person for the purpose of resale in the course of business, and sec. 10 repealed the old provision that had been sec. 41 of the Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act, R.S.O. 1897, ch. 148. In the 1927 revision of the Ontario statutes the Conditional Sales Act as it then stood became ch. 165 and remained substantially unchanged. The present statute, R.S.O. 1937, ch. 182, has remained practically unaltered from 1927.\nIt may not be without interest that the draft Conditional Sales Act, revised and approved by the Conference of Commissioners on Uniformity of Legislation in Canada in 1922 (See Falconbridge: Cases on the Sale of Goods (1927), pp. 682-88), provided (at p. 683) that:\nAfter possession of goods has been delivered to a buyer under a conditional sale, every provision contained therein whereby the property in the goods remains in the seller shall be void as against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees claiming from or under the buyer in good faith, for valuable consideration and without notice, and as against creditors of the buyer who at the time of becoming creditors have no notice of the provision and who subsequently obtained judgment, execution, or an attaching order, under which the goods, if the property of the buyer, might have been seized, and the buyer shall, notwithstanding such provision, be deemed the owner of the goods, unless the requirements of this Act are complied with.\nThe subsequent revision of the Ontario statute in 1927 did not adopt the draft by giving protection, where the conditional sale agreement was not filed, not only to sub- sequent purchasers or mortgagees but to \u201ccreditors of the buyer who at the time of becoming creditors have no notice of the provision and who subsequently obtained judgment,\u201d etc. The Legislature adhered to the provision as it had stood in the statute whereby the invalidity was limited to \u201csubsequent purchasers or mortgagees claiming from or under\u201d the original purchaser, except in the case Where the goods were delivered \u201cto any person for the purpose of resale by him in the course of business,\u201d in which latter case the invalidity was extended to creditors.\nIt is plain that the Legislature in enacting the provisions of the Conditional Sales Act did not, except in the case of the delivery of possession to a person for resale in the course of business, intend the protection to extend to creditors. Of course the respondent is not a creditor. It is a purchaser, but a purchaser from a bailiff who had no higher title to pass than that of the execution debtor. The bailiff in enforcing the creditors\u2019 judgments under the executions never acquired the property in the motor car. The respondent cannot be said to be a subsequent purchaser \u201cfrom or under\u201d the conditional purchaser, within the meaning of subsec. (1) of sec. 2; it bought in the execution creditors\u2019 rights against the car. It is contended, in effect, by counsel for the respondent that the statutory provision in favour of \u201csubsequent purchasers or mortgagees\u201d ought to be interpreted so as to give to it what is called a convenient and practical application. But in Rex v. Commissioners of Customs and Excise[5], Viscount Dunedin in the House of Lords referred to the \u201cstern warnings\u201d that had been given in the cases\nto those who in order to read in words into a statute which are not there, or to divert words used from their ordinary and natural meaning, permitted themselves to speculate as to what the aim and attainment of the Act was likely to be.\nI would allow the appeal and direct judgment to be entered for the appellant in the sum of $250 with costs of the action and of the appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. It was a condition of the leave to appeal granted by the Court of Appeal that the appellant should not ask for costs of its appeal to this Court. CROCKET, J.\u2014This appeal turns entirely upon the question whether the conditional sale agreement, upon which the appellant plaintiff relied as the basis of its action, was invalidated as against the respondent defendant, which purchased the automobile described therein at a public bailiff\u2019s sale, by the appellant\u2019s failure to file a true copy of the agreement within ten days after its execution in the office of the Clerk of the District Court of the county or district in which the original purchaser resided, as provided by sec. 2 (1) of the Conditional Sales Act, R.S.O. 1937, ch. 182.\nThe bailiff seized and sold the automobile as the property of one Teakle under two executions issued upon judgments recovered against the latter in a Division Court, one of them at the suit of the respondent company. Teakle, the judgment debtor, was the purchaser or hirer under the conditional sale agreement. The trial judge found that the respondent defendant purchased the automobile at the bailiff\u2019s sale in good faith and without notice of the appellant plaintiff\u2019s lien and that the respondent defendant was a subsequent purchaser from or under the judgment debtor within the meaning of sec. 2 (1) of the Conditional Sales Act, and therefore dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs. His judgment was maintained by the Court of Appeal per Masten and McTague, JJ.A.; Robertson, C.J.O., dissenting.\nIt is not doubted that failure to file a copy of the conditional sale agreement within the prescribed time would invalidate the plaintiff\u2019s title to the automobile under sec. 2 (1) if the defendant were a subsequent purchaser claiming from or under Teakle, within the meaning of that section, or that, if the respondent defendant, by reason of his purchase of the automobile at the bailiff\u2019s sale under the Divisional Court executions, did not become a purchaser from or under Teakle as the conditional sale purchaser or hirer, the bailiff\u2019s sale would not avail to pass the property therein.\nThe bailiff had no authority to sell the automobile as the property of the judgment debtor. He might have offered for sale, in virtue of the provisions of the Execution Act, R.S.O., 1937, ch. 125, the judgment debtor\u2019s equitable interest in the automobile, but nothing more. In doing so, the bailiff obviously was not acting either within the authority or in the interest of the judgment debtor but solely under the direction of adverse writs of execution, which were issued at the suit of the judgment creditors, one of whom, as appears, was the respondent company itself.\nSec. 2 (1) of the Conditional Sales Act expressly limits the protection provided thereby to \u201csubsequent purchasers or mortgagees claiming from or under the purchaser, proposed purchaser or hirer,\u201d etc., and, though one can readily understand a court\u2019s inclination to give these words as large and liberal a construction as possible and thus extend the protection to all bona fide subsequent purchasers without notice, I can find nothing in any part of sec. 2 which can safely be relied upon as necessarily implying any such intention on the part of the Legislature. Had the intention been that all unregistered conditional sales agreements should be deemed null and void against all subsequent purchasers or judgment creditors, I cannot think that the enactment would have been framed, as it has been, with such a definite limitation as that indicated, or that the Legislature would have made the special provision it did in subsec. (3) with respect to creditors, viz: that\nwhere the delivery is made to any person for the purpose of resale by him in the course of business, such provision [the clause of the conditional sale agreement, which provides that the ownership of the specified goods shall remain in the seller or lender for hire until full payment of the purchase price] shall also, as against his creditors, be invalid, and he shall be deemed the owner of the goods unless the provisions of this Act have been complied with.\nFor these reasons I agree with the conclusion arrived at by the learned Chief Justice in his dissenting judgment, would allow the appeal and direct the entry of judgment for the appellant for $250, the proved value of the automobile, with costs of the action and of the appeal to the Appeal Court. The order granting special leave to appeal having been granted to the appellant by the Appeal Court on the understanding that it should have no costs of the appeal to this Court in any event, I agree that there should be no costs on this appeal. KERWIN J.\u2014The particular point arising for determination in this appeal depends upon the proper construction of subsection 1 of section 2 of The Conditional Sales Act, Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1937, chapter 182. That subsection is as follows:\n2. (1) Where possession of goods is delivered to a purchaser, or a proposed purchaser or a hirer of them, in pursuance of a contract which provides that the ownership is to remain in the seller or lender for hire until payment of the purchase or consideration money or part of it, as against a subsequent purchaser or mortgagee claiming from or under the purchaser, proposed purchaser or hirer, without notice in good faith and for valuable consideration, such provision shall be invalid, and such purchaser, or proposed purchaser or hirer, shall be deemed the owner of the goods, unless\n(a) the contract is evidenced by a writing signed by the purchaser, proposed purchaser or hirer or his agent, stating the terms and conditions of the sale or hiring and describing the goods sold or lent for hire; and,\n(b) within ten days after the execution of the contract a true copy of it is filed in the office of the clerk of the county or district court of the county or district in which the purchaser, proposed purchaser or hirer resided at the time of the sale or hiring.\nAt the trial, the Judge of the County Court of the County of Welland, and upon appeal, the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, decided that the defendant respondent, Niagara Finance Company, Limited, fell within the expression \u201csubsequent purchaser or mortgagee claiming from or under the purchaser.\u201d The Chief Justice of Ontario dissented. The plaintiff, Commercial Credit Corporation of Canada, Limited, now appeals pursuant to leave granted by the Court of Appeal.\nPossession of a motor car had been delivered to one Teakle under such a contract as is mentioned in the sub-section but a copy of the agreement was not filed in the office of the clerk of the county court. The ownership of the motor car and all rights under the contract of the other party thereto became vested in the appellant. Judgments were recovered against Teakle in two Division Court actions by creditors of his, and at a bailiff\u2019s sale, held in pursuance of executions issued on such judgments, the respondent claims to have become the purchaser of the motor car. The finding of the trial judge, that the respondent was a purchaser for value and without notice of the conditional sale agreement, has not been impugned. It is clear from the provisions of The Conditional Sales Act that in default of filing a conditional sale agreement, (a conditional purchaser is not deemed to be the owner of the goods as against his creditors, except \u201cwhere the delivery [of the goods] is made to any person for the purpose of resale by him in the course of business\u201d (sub-section 3 of section 2). The bailiff, therefore, had no power to seize and sell the automobile, although under section 18 of The Execution Act, R.S.O. 1937, chapter 125, he could seize and sell Teakle\u2019s interest in the car. It is argued that, the bailiff\u2019s possession being referable to his right so to seize Teakle\u2019s interest in the car, the subsequent purported sale by him of the car itself to the respondent, who gave value for the car without notice of the conditional sale agreement, thereby entitled the respondent to hold the car free from any claim of the appellant.\nThis conclusion, in my view, is unsound. The respondent is certainly not a purchaser from Teakle, and a fair reading of all the provisions of the Act impels me to the conclusion that it is not purchaser under him. That expression might envisage circumstances where Teakle would sell the car to A, who in turn would sell to C, but not a case where a sale is made under process of law. In such a case only Teakle\u2019s interest in the car could be sold and not the article itself.\nThe order appealed from should be set aside and there should be substituted therefor a judgment for the appellant against the respondent for the value of the car, $250. The appellant is entitled to its costs of the action and of the appeal to the Court of Appeal. In accordance with the condition attached to the order granting leave to appeal, there will be no costs of the appeal to this Court.\nHUDSON, J.\u2014I agree that the right of the defendant, if any, to retain the automobile in question must arise under the provisions of the Conditional Sales Act.\nI also agree that this Act does not and was not intended to protect creditors, but the claim of the defendant, with which we have to deal here, is in its capacity as a purchaser and not as a creditor. The Conditional Sales Act was intended to and does in its terms protect purchasers of a defined class, namely, purchasers in good faith for value without notice \u201cfrom or under\u201d the original purchaser. The defendant did buy in good faith for value without notice; so in my view the case must be determined by the construction which should be placed upon the words \u201cfrom or under.\u201d\nIt is clear that the defendant did not buy from the original purchaser, nor could the bailiff be considered as the agent of the original purchaser in making the sale.\nThe last and more difficult question is whether or not the sale was made \u201cunder\u201d the original purchaser. I was impressed by the views expressed by Mr. Justice Masten in the Court of Appeal, that the word \u201cunder\u201d meant \u201cthrough\u201d and that anyone who derived title because of the existence of the original purchaser\u2019s conditional right should be considered as a purchaser entitled to the benefit of this Act. However, on consideration I have come to a contrary opinion. The legislature may have intended the Act to extend to purchasers such as the defendant but, if so, I think the intention should have been more clearly expressed, where an important change in the common law was contemplated.\nThe meaning of the word \u201cunder\u201d must, of course, largely be determined by the context of the statute in which it is used. This has been discussed by my brothers Davis and Kerwin and I shall add no more than a reference to two old cases illustrating the ways in which the word was interpreted by the courts.\nThe first is Stanley v. Hayes[6]. In that case a lease contained a covenant by the lessor for quiet enjoyment, providing that the lessee should and lawfully might peaceably and quietly have, hold, use, occupy, possess and enjoy the demised premises for and during the term, without any let, suit, trouble, denial, disturbance, eviction or interruption whatsoever, of or by the defendant, his heirs or assigns, or any other person or persons lawfully claiming or to claim by, \u201cfrom or under\u201d him, them, or any of them. It appeared that the lessor was at that time liable for land taxes and the collector of land taxes entered upon the premises and seized certain goods and chattels there as a distress for the amount of the rent which was due before the making of the indenture. It was held by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench that this was not a breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment. It was stated by Lord Denman, Chief Justice, at page 108:\nWe cannot extend the remedy provided by the indenture. Let, suit, disturbance or interruption by the defendant, or others claiming by, from, or under him, are different things from the injury here complained of, those words implying a claim by title from the lessor. Here the claim was against him.\nThe second is the case of Pennell v. Walker[7], where it was held that a provision of the Common Law Procedure Act giving a remedy to persons claiming land \u201cthrough or under\u201d a deed did not extend to assignees in bankruptcy.\nUnder the circumstances, I think that the appeal should be allowed with costs of the action and in the Court of Appeal but without costs in this Court.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Parkinson, Gardiner & Willis.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.H.

Defendant corporation con- tended that the application of the brake was made necessary by the negligent conduct of the driver of an automobile with which the street car collided. The jury found that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were due solely to negligence of the corporation\u2019s motorman, in that he was \u201cnegligent in not looking or observing the road ahead of him; if he (the motorman) had been observing properly he would not have found it necessary to apply the emergency brake at all, thus avoiding the injury to the plaintiff\u201d; and judgment was given for plaintiff against the corporation. That judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, on the ground that, on the evidence, the jury\u2019s finding was such that no twelve men with a proper appreciation of their obligations and duties could arrive at. Plaintiff appealed.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored. There was evidence on which the jury were entitled to find as they did.\nPer Crocket J.: A study of the printed record might very well produce upon the mind of a trained judge sitting on appeal an impression contrary to the jury\u2019s finding, but that would not warrant him in substituting his own opinion upon a pure question of credibility for that of the jury, who heard the evidence and had the advantage of observing the witnesses\u2019 demeanour, unless he were convinced that the finding was one which was so manifestly wrong that no jury, which fully appreciated its duty as a sworn body, could have conscientiously made it; and, on the evidence, the reversal of the jury\u2019s finding was not warranted.\nPer Hudson J.: Although the carrier of passengers is not an insurer, yet if an accident occurs and a passenger is injured, there is a heavy burden on the carrier to establish that he had used all due, proper and reasonable care and skill to avoid or prevent injury to the passenger. The care required is of a very high degree.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing the judgment of MacKay J. at trial, on the findings of the jury, in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant Toronto Transportation Commission. The plaintiff, a passenger in a street car of the defendant Commission, while standing and picking up a parcel preparatory to disembarking, was thrown to the floor and injured by the sudden application of the emergency brake. It was contended by the defendant Commission that the application of the brake was caused entirely by the negligent conduct of one Clarkson, the driver of an automobile with which the street car collided, who was added as a party defendant. The jury found that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were due to negligence on the part of the Commission\u2019s motorman in that he was \u201cnegligent in not looking or observing the road ahead of him; if he (the motorman) had been observing properly he would not have found it necessary to apply the emergency brake at all, thus avoiding the injury to the plaintiff\u201d; that defendant Clarkson had satisfied the jury that the injuries of the plaintiff did not arise through any fault or negligence on his part. The jury assessed the plaintiff\u2019s damages at $1,800, for which amount judgment was given for the plaintiff against the defendant Commission (the action being dismissed as against Clarkson). The Court of Appeal for Ontario (per Fisher and Henderson JJ.A.; Middleton J.A. dissenting) allowed the defendant Commission\u2019s appeal and dismissed the action as against it, and gave judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant Clarkson. Henderson J.A., in the course of his reasons, stated that he was of opinion that the jury\u2019s answers (to the questions put to them by the trial judge) were \u201csuch that no twelve men with a proper appreciation of their obligations and duties could arrive at\u201d and \u201cI can find no evidence on the record on which the jury could make the finding they did.\u201d Fisher J.A. agreed with the reasoning and conclusions of Henderson J.A. and at the conclusion of his reasons stated: \u201cClarkson\u2019s conduct threw the motorman into an emergency at a time, according to the evidence, when it was impossible for him to avoid an impact. The jury\u2019s finding that the driver of the street car was solely to blame is a perverse finding, and I can find no evidence to support it.\u201d Middleton J.A., dissenting, held that there was evidence from which the jury might properly find the motorman at fault; that \u201cif the motor-man had been alert, he would have seen [Clarkson] sufficiently far away to have avoided the stringent application of his brakes followed by the throwing of the plaintiff to the floor of the car.\u201d Special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted to the plaintiff by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nD.H. Porter and T.R. Deacon for the appellant.\nI.S. Fairty K.C. and G.A. McGillivray for the respondent Toronto Transportation Commission.\nRINFRET J.\u2014I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial with costs throughout. CROCKET J.\u2014This action was originally brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent Transportation Commission to recover damages from it for injuries sustained by her while travelling as a passenger on one of the. Commission\u2019s street cars in the City of Toronto. In her statement of claim the plaintiff alleged that the street car collided violently with a motor car, which was proceeding in the same direction, and that that collision was caused solely by the negligence of the respondent Commission, its servants or agents, as a result of which negligence she, while standing in the street car in the act of picking up a parcel preparatory to disembarking from the car, was thrown violently to the floor and seriously injured. The respondent in its statement of defence alleged that the motor car, with which the street car collided, was owned and operated by one, Ernest R. Clarkson, and that the collision in question was entirely caused by the latter\u2019s negligence. The appellant joined issue upon this defence and subsequently the respondent applied for and obtained from a Master of the Supreme Court of Ontario, under the Negligence Act, R.S.O., 1937, ch. 115, an order adding Clarkson as a party defendant to the action. The respondent defendant\u2019s solicitor thereupon consented to the plaintiff amending the statement of claim so as to claim damages (in the alternative) against Clarkson. Clarkson, having been served with a writ and amended statement of claim in pursuance of the Master\u2019s order, entered a statement of defence, in which he denied all negligence on his part and alleged that the accident was the result of the negligence of the Commission\u2019s motorman in (a) driving the street car at an excessive rate of speed; (b) not keeping a proper lookout; (c) failing to apply his brakes; and (d) failing to give adequate warning when he saw or should have seen him making a turn. When the trial came on before Mr. Justice MacKay, sitting with a jury, the Commission\u2019s statement of defence seems to have been amended with the consent of counsel, so as to open the question as to whether the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were or were not entirely attributable to the negligence of Clarkson in making it necessary for the motorman in his attempt to avoid the collision with the motor car to suddenly apply the emer- gency brake of the street car, which obviously was the immediate cause of the appellant\u2019s injuries. This, apart from the quantum of damages, was the real issue to which the evidence adduced at the trial was directed, as is so clearly shown by the questions submitted to the jury by the learned trial judge and their answers thereto. These questions and answers were as follows:\n1. Were the plaintiff\u2019s injuries due to any negligence on the part of the motorman of the Transportation Commission?\nA. Yes.\nIf your answer is \u201cyes\u201d in what did such negligence consist?\nA. The motorman was negligent in not looking or observing the road ahead of him; if he (the motorman) had been observing properly he would not have found it necessary to apply the emergency brake at all, thus avoiding the injury to the plaintiff.\n2. Has the defendant Clarkson satisfied you that the injuries of the plaintiff did not arise through any fault or negligence on his part?\nA. Yes.\nThe jury assessed the damages at $1,800, for which judgment was entered against the Commission with costs, while the action was dismissed as against Clarkson and the Commission ordered to pay Clarkson his costs of the action.\nAn appeal having been taken from this judgment by the Transportation Commission, the Court of Appeal, per Fisher and Henderson, JJ.A., Middleton, J.A., dissenting, allowed the appeal with costs and directed the dismissal of the action against the respondent Commission with costs and the entry of judgment against Clarkson for the sum of $1,800 with costs, and further ordered that the appellant plaintiff recover from Clarkson any costs which she may have paid under the trial judgment to the respondent Commission as well as her costs on that appeal.\nThe present appeal, to which Clarkson is not a party, is from the latter judgment, which obviously is founded upon the complete reversal of the findings of the jury upon the principal issue tried before them.\nWith all respect, I am of opinion that the Appeal Court was not warranted in thus interfering with the jury\u2019s findings upon essential questions of fact, which the record shows depended entirely upon the credibility of witnesses examined before them. Although the evidence was such that the jury, if it chose, might well have found the other way, I agree with Middleton, J.A., who says in his dissenting judgment that there was evidence from which the jury might properly find that the motorman was at fault. His Lordship says that he does not himself accept Clarkson\u2019s. evidence, because he thought he was so confused as to be unable to tell exactly what did happen, but adds that if the motorman had been alert he would have seen him (Clarkson) sufficiently far away to have avoided the stringent application of his brakes followed by the throwing of the plaintiff to the floor of the car. This is precisely what the jury found\u2014a clear finding of ultimate negligence against the respondent\u2019s motorman, and can only mean that the jury, whether they fully accepted Clarkson\u2019s evidence or not, did not wholly credit that of the motorman. It must be borne in mind that there were other witnesses than Clarkson and the motorman and that, as my brother Kerwin points out, there was a conflict of testimony as to the operation of the motor car by Clarkson, which might very well have influenced the jury in its decision upon the whole evidence to reject the motorman\u2019s explanation of his sudden application of the emergency brake. This was really the crucial issue in the case, as appears from the whole conduct and course of the trial\u2014an issue which it was the sole right and duty of the jury to determine according to the convictions produced upon the minds of its individual members by the whole evidence bearing thereon without reference to what they may have gathered from the learned trial judge\u2019s charge he personally may have believed, as the latter so fairly and clearly pointed out to them. A study of the printed record might very well produce a contrary impression upon the mind of a trained judge sitting on appeal, but that, of course, would not warrant him in substituting his own opinion upon a pure question of credibility for that of the jury, which heard the evidence of all the witnesses and had the advantage of observing their demeanour on the witness stand, unless he were convinced that the finding was one which was so manifestly wrong that no jury, which fully appreciated its duty as a sworn body, could have conscientiously made. That the jury fully comprehended the issue it was its duty to decide is shown by the preciseness of its statement of the particulars of the motorman\u2019s negligence in answering question 1. For my part, I cannot think that a jury, which so comprehended the issue with which it was charged, did not equally appreciate the obligation which rested upon it to conscientiously find the true facts according to the evidence. The Court of Appeal was, therefore, to my mind not warranted in completely reversing the judgment of the trial court by directing the dismissal of the appellant\u2019s action against the respondent and the entry of judgment against its co-defendant in lieu thereof.\nAs to the respondent\u2019s contention that if this Court should come to the conclusion just stated we should order a new trial, I am of opinion that the whole case was fully and fairly tried; that there was no such misdirection, non-direction or improper admission of evidence as could well be held to warrant a new trial.\nMy conclusion, therefore, is that the appeal should be allowed and the trial judgment restored as originally entered, with costs throughout.\nDAVIS J.\u2014The appellant sustained personal injuries while a passenger in one of the respondent\u2019s street cars. No blame was suggested against the appellant herself. The street car was suddenly stopped by the application of its emergency brakes. What the respondent said was that the improper conduct of its co-defendant, Clarkson, who was driving a motor vehicle, was the real cause of the injury to the appellant.\nThe duty of the respondent to the appellant, its passenger, was to carry her safely as far as reasonable care and forethought could attain that end. I feel bound to hold that the evidence given entitled the jury to find, as they did, that the operator of the street car failed to exercise that reasonable care and forethought and that his negligence was the cause of the appellant\u2019s injuries.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment entered at the trial against the respondent upon the jury\u2019s answers should be restored, with costs throughout.\nKERWIN J.\u2014By special leave of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the plaintiff, Eliza Day, appeals from an order of that Court which set aside the judgment at the trial (following a jury\u2019s verdict), in favour of the appellant against the Toronto Transportation Commission, and directed judgment to be entered for the appellant against one Clarkson.\nThe appellant was a passenger on a street car of the Commission and as a result of a sudden application of the brakes by the motorman, was thrown to the floor of the car and injured. The motorman testified that he was obliged to apply the brakes in this manner because Clarkson had started his automobile from the position where it was parked and suddenly darted in front of the oncoming street car. Clarkson\u2019s story was that he had, before starting his automobile, looked back and observed the street car some distance away; that, considering that he had ample time he started to make a gradual U turn, first signalling with his arm, and that the motorman should have seen him and that, if he had done so, there would have been no necessity for the application of the brakes at all.\nSo far as Clarkson was concerned, the case went to the jury upon the basis that, under the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, the onus was upon him, Clarkson, to establish that the appellant\u2019s injuries had not been caused through any negligence or improper conduct on his part; so far as the Commission was concerned the case was left to the jury as an ordinary one in which the onus of establishing negligence would be upon the appellant. The jury determined that Clarkson had satisfied the onus cast upon him and that the appellant\u2019s injuries were due to negligence on the part of the motorman, such negligence being, according to the verdict:\nThe motorman was negligent in not looking or observing the road ahead of him; if he (the motorman) had been observing properly he would not have found it necessary to apply the emergency brake at all, thus avoiding the injury to the plaintiff.\nThere was conflicting testimony as to the operation of the automobile by Clarkson. The witness Wright did not see the automobile or street car until the collision that subsequently ensued was imminent. The witness McDonald first saw the automobile, then noticed the street car, and when he next saw the automobile it was making a turn on to the street car tracks. It is clear, I think, from a perusal of his evidence that there was a period of time during which he was not looking at the automobile and at what Clarkson in it was doing. The testimony of the motorman, as to the left front window of the motor car being down, was contradicted, and it may well be that that (contradiction was weighed in the balance by the jury and finally determined their conclusion that Clarkson\u2019s story should be believed.\nI find it impossible to say that there is no evidence upon which a jury doing their duty could find as they did. We were invited, in case we came to this conclusion, to direct a new trial but I can find no basis for such an order. I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial against the Toronto Transportation Commission, with costs throughout.\nHUDSON J.\u2014The appellant was a passenger on a street car of the defendant Commission and, as a result of the sudden application of the brakes by the motorman, she was thrown to the floor of the car and injured. The motorman gave evidence that he applied the brakes in the manner in which he did because a man named Clarkson had started his automobile from where it was parked, on the side of the street, and suddenly turned in front of the street car.\nThere was conflicting evidence and in the end the jury brought in a verdict holding the defendant guilty of negligence because\nthe motorman was negligent in not looking or observing the road ahead of him; that if he (the motorman) had been observing properly he would not have found it necessary to apply the emergency brake at all, thus avoiding the injury to the plaintiff.\nAlthough the carrier of passengers is not an insurer, yet if an accident occurs and the passenger is injured, there is a heavy burden on the defendant carrier to establish that he had used all due, proper and reasonable care and skill to avoid or prevent injury to the passenger. The care required is of a very high degree: 4 Hals., p. 60, paras. 92 and 95. In an old case of Jackson v. Tollett[1], the rule was stated by Lord Ellenborough, at p. 38, as follows:\nEvery person who contracts for the conveyance of others, is bound to use the utmost care and skill, and if, through any erroneous judgment on his part, any mischief is occasioned, he must answer for the consequences. The question, then, for the jury was whether the motor-man had used in a high degree all due, proper and reasonable care and skill under the circumstances. On conflicting evidence the jury chose to accept that part which was. favourable to the plaintiff. I am of opinion that there was some evidence on which they could properly decide that the motorman had failed in his duty. I would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial, with costs here and below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Deacon & Howell.\nSolicitor for the respondent Toronto Transportation Commission: Irving S.

VI, c. 60.\nWhen several plaintiffs cumulate in a single action their respective claims for wages, amounting each to less; than $2,000, against a same employer, as permitted by the provisions of a provincial statute and judgment is rendered accordingly, no appeal lies to this Court from that judgment, even if the total amount of all the claims exceeds $2,000. L'Autorit\u00e9 Limit\u00e9e v.

The plaintiffs joined their claims in a single action, as permitted by section 22 of the Fair Wages Act of Quebec. The total amount of the claims was then exceeding $2,000; but, by the conclusions of their declaration, the plaintiffs were asking not for the total amount to be divided between them according to their respective claims, but for a separate award to each of them of the specific sum due to each. The judgment in the Superior Court was rendered accordingly. Eleven of the claims awarded were below $200.\nThe appellants appealed, but their appeal was dismissed for want of jurisdiction by the appellate courts except as to the three claims exceeding $200.\nThe appellants were now appealing from the judgment quashing their appeal against the eleven other respondents, none of whose claims was for a sum above $200 and the total amount of their claims being only $1,783.93.\nThe respondents moved to quash.\nPaul L. Belcourt for motion.\nFrank B. Chauvin contra.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRinfret, J.

Ibbotson[2], where, curiously enough, the respondents were the same number as in the present case.\nUnder s. 22 of the Fair Wages Act the claims of several employees against the same employer may be cumulated in a single action. But the statute is only permissive, not compulsory, and the mere fact that several plaintiffs have joined their claims in a single action does not affect our jurisdiction. So far as this Court is concerned, each claim by itself must be considered as separate for purposes of jurisdiction.\nMoreover, even the aggregate amount involved in this appeal does not reach the sum of $2,000.

Varcoe K.C. for Attorney-General for Canada.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014After a most attentive consideration of the able argument of Mr. Farris, I think our decision in this appeal is governed by the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Shannon's case[3].\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014The plaintiffs (appellants) brought action against the Attorney-General of British Columbia, Coal and Petroleum Control Board, and Dr. William Alexander Carrothers (the sole member of the Board), for a declaration that the Coal and Petroleum Products Control Board Act of British Columbia (chapter 8 of the statutes of 1937), or that certain sections of it, were ultra vires the legislature of the province. The plaintiffs also asked a declaration that an amending Act of 1938 was ultra vires the legislature, and that a certain regulation was ultra vires the Board. The trial judge declared sections 14 and 15 of the principal Act to be ultra vires the legislature, and certain words in section 42 of the principal Act, as enacted by the amending Act, in so far as they purported to limit the powers of the courts of the province to determine the constitutional validity of the principal Act, to be ultra vires the legislature. The defendant Board and the defendant Carrothers were restrained from fixing the price, prices, maximum price or prices, minimum price or prices, at which gasoline or other petroleum products may be sold in British Columbia, either wholesale or retail or otherwise for use in the province, and from making any orders, rules or regulations in respect of such price or prices, and from taking any steps or proceedings to compel the plaintiffs to comply with the provisions of sections 14 and 15 of the principal Act or of any orders, rules or regulations made thereunder with respect to the prices aforesaid.\nThe defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia and their appeal was allowed and the action dismissed. There was no cross-appeal by the plaintiffs. By special leave of the Court of Appeal the plaintiffs now appeal to this Court.\nThe principal Act provides for the appointment of a Board with power to regulate and control within the province the \" coal and petroleum industries.\" That expression is stated to include:\u2014\nthe carrying-on within the Province of any of the following industries or businesses: The mining of coal; the preparation of coal for the market; the storage of coal; the wholesale and retail distribution and selling of coal; the distillation, refining, and blending of petroleum; the manufacture, refining, preparation, and blending of all products obtained from petroleum; the storage of petroleum and petroleum products; and the wholesale and retail distribution and selling of petroleum products.\nSections 14 and 15, which are the ones declared ultra vires the provincial legislature by the trial judge, are as follows:\u2014\n14. (1) The Board may from time to time, with the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, fix the price or prices, maximum price or prices, minimum price or prices at which coal or petroleum products may be sold in the Province either at wholesale or retail or otherwise for use in the Province.\n(2) Without limiting the generality of the powers conferred by subsection (1), the Board may:\u2014\n(a) Fix different prices for different parts of the Province; (b) Fix different prices for licensees notwithstanding that they are in the same class of occupation:\n(c) Fix schedules of prices for different qualities, quantities, standards, grades, and kinds of coal and petroleum products.\n15. Where the Board has fixed a price for coal or for petroleum or for any petroleum product, it may, with the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, declare that any covenant or agreement for the purchase or sale within the Province of coal or petroleum or a petroleum product for use in the Province contained in any agreement in existence at the time of fixing such price shall be varied so that the price shall conform to the price fixed by the Board, and the agreement, subject only to the variation declared by the Board, shall in all other respects remain in full force and effect.\nBy section 2 of the Act:\u2014\n\"Petroleum products\" includes petroleum, gasoline, naphtha, benzene, kerosene, lubricating-oils, stove oil, fuel oil, furnace-oil, paraffin, and all derivatives of petroleum and all products obtained from petroleum, whether blended with or added to other things or not.\nReading these sections in the light of all the other provisions of the Act, I am of opinion that, to quote the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Shannon v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board[4]:\u2014\nthe legislation in question is confined to regulating transactions that take place wholly within the Province, and are therefore within the sovereign powers granted to the Legislature in that respect by s. 92 of the British North America Act;\nor to quote again from the same judgment, at page 720:\u2014\nThe pith and substance of this Act is that it is an Act to regulate particular businesses entirely within the Province and it is therefore intra vires of the Province.\nIn coming; to this conclusion I have taken the report of a commissioner appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council as being a recital of what was present to the mind of the legislature, in enacting the principal Act, as to what was the existing law, the evil to be abated and the suggested remedy (Heydon's Case)[5]. There can, I think, be no objection in principle to the use of the report for that purpose, and Lord Halsbury's dictum in Eastern Photographic Machine Company v. Comptroller General of Patents [6] is to the same effect. It was argued by counsel for the appellants that the statements in the report were to be taken as facts admitted or proved, but that this cannot be done is quite clear from the authorities, the most recent of which is Assam Railways and Traders Company v. The Commissioners of Inland Revenue[7]. I have not considered the provisions of the amending Act which are objected to, and make no comment as to those provisions. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nCrocket, J.\u2014Notwithstanding Mr. Farris's ingenious and able argument regarding the integrated character of the oil production, refining and sales industry and the apprehended effect of the impugned legislation upon the profits of that industry as an integrated whole outside the limits of British Columbia, I am unable to discover any substantial or satisfactory reason for holding that the legislation is anything else than what it plainly purports to be, namely, an enactment constituting a board with power to fix maximum and minimum wholesale and retail prices of all coal and petroleum products sold in the Province of British Columbia or for use in that Province. This, in my judgment, the Provincial Legislature clearly had the right to do under the exclusive legislative powers assigned to it by s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act.\nThe fact that the motive of the Legislature may have been, as was suggested, to empower the Coal and Petroleum Products Board, by fixing an arbitrary maximum price for the sale of gasoline and a minimum price for the sale of crude fuel oil within the Province, to afford some needed protection for the important coal mining industry of the Province against the menacing competition of the sale of the latter product at the then current prices, cannot in my opinion alter the character of the legislation as legislation for purely provincial purposes. Neither can the fact that the legislation was calculated to compel all international or external corporations desiring and authorized to do business within the limits of the Province to alter their methods and policy regarding the allocation of profits as between the gasoline and fuel oil branches of their so-called integrated industry. If they desire to carry on their business in the Province of British Columbia, they must comply with provincial laws in common with all provincial and independent dealers in the same commodities. In my opinion the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Shannon v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board[8] is in all essential points indistinguishable from and decisive of the present appeal.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Davis J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an action in which the validity of certain legislation of the province of British Columbia, aimed at fixing prices for the sale of gasoline in the province, is sought to be determined.\nThe statute in question is the Coal and Petroleum Products Control Board Act, ch. 8 of the British Columbia statutes of 1937. It is not a revenue Act and there is no compulsion to sell; the impugned legislation provides for fixing prices for sale of coal, or petroleum products to the public in the province from time to time by a Board set up by the legislature whose orders are, however, to be subject to approval by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. The several appellants (plaintiffs) are vendors in the province of petroleum products and the respondents (defendants) are the Attorney-General of the Province, the Board, and Dr. Carrothers, its sole member.\nWhile the appellants claimed in the action a declaration that the whole Act was ultra vires the legislature of the province, the trial judge, Manson J., merely declared secs. 14 and 15 to be ultra vires and granted an injunction against the Board and Dr. Carrothers restraining them from fixing the price at which gasoline or other petroleum products may be sold in the Province, either wholesale or retail or otherwise, for use in the Province, and from making any orders, rules and regulations in respect of such price or prices and from taking any steps or proceedings to compel the appellants to comply with the provisions of said secs. 14 and 15 of the said Act, or of any orders, rules or regulations made thereunder with respect to the prices aforesaid. From that Judgment the Attorney-General for British Columbia and the other defendants, the Board and Dr. Carrothers, appealed to the Court of Appeal for that province. There was no cross appeal by the appellants and therefore only secs. 14 and 15 remained in controversy. The Court of Appeal by a majority allowed the appeal, set aside the judgment at the trial and dismissed the appellants' action. From that judgment, by special leave of the Court of Appeal, the appellants appealed to this Court.\nSections 14 and 15 of the statute are as follows:\u2014\n14. (1) The Board may from time to time, with the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, fix the price or prices, maximum price or prices, minimum price or prices at which coal or petroleum products may be sold in the province either at wholesale or retail or otherwise for use in the province.\n(2) Without limiting the generality of the powers conferred by subsection (1), the Board may:\u2014 (a) Fix different prices for different parts of the province:\n(b) Fix different prices for licensees notwithstanding that they are in the same class of occupation:\n(c) Fix schedules of prices for different qualities, quantities, standards, grades, and kinds of coal and petroleum products.\n15. Where the Board has fixed a price for coal or for petroleum or for any petroleum product, it may, with the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, declare that any covenant or agreement for the purchase or sale within the province of coal or petroleum or a petroleum product for use in the province contained in any agreement in existence at the time of fixing such price shall be varied so that the price shall conform to the price fixed by the Board, and the agreement, subject only to the variation declared by the Board, shall in all other respects remain in full force and effect.\nThe appellants' case rests in substance upon the basis that the report of a commissioner appointed November 29th, 1934, by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of the Province of British Columbia under its Public Inquiries Act to inquire (a) into matters respecting coal mined in or imported into the province and used for fuel purposes in the province, and (b) into matters respecting petroleum products imported into or refined or produced in the province and used or designed for use therein for fuel, lighting and motor vehicles' operation, discloses the true intent and purpose of the subsequent legislation now in question and that the report with all the evidence contained in its three volumes was open to the Court and should be accepted as prima facie evidence of the facts for the purpose of a proper understanding of the legislation. Mr. Farris in an unusually powerful argument attacking the legislation made it abundantly plain that his contention was based upon the industry affected by the legislation being what he called \" an integrated industry, interprovincial and international \" and the legislation an invasion of the Dominion's power to regulate trade and commerce. His. contention was that the subject-matter of the impeached legislation was not local or provincial within the competence of the legislature.\nLeaving aside any reference to the report of the commissioner and assuming for the moment that it must be excluded, the language of the statutory provisions is itself plain and unambiguous. The Board appointed under the provisions of the Act is empowered from time to time \"with the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council\" to fix the prices at which petroleum products may be sold\u2014and then follow the limiting words, \" in the province \" and \"for use in the province \"\u2014and where the Board fixes a price it may. with the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, declare that any covenant or agreement for the purchase or sale\u2014and again the limiting words, \" within the province \" and. \" for use in the province \"\u2014contained in any agreement in existence at the time of fixing such price shall be varied so that the price shall conform to the price fixed by the Board.\nOn the face of the legislation it appears that the legislature is dealing solely with the sale within the province for use in the province of petroleum products; legislation in relation to the petroleum industry in its local aspects within the province. There is nothing in the language of the statute which necessarily gives to its enactments an extraterritorial effect.\nThere is no necessity to refer at any length to the long line of authorities on the constitutional validity or invalidity under the British North America Act of this sort of legislation and we are not concerned with whether the legislation appears to us to be commercially fair and reasonable or not. The sole question is whether the provincial legislature had authority to enact such legislation. It is sufficient, I think, to say that the principle to be applied is that so plainly laid down by the Privy Council in the Board of Commerce case,[9]; the Fort Frances case[10]; the Snider ease[11], and in the Shannon case[12]. Taking the legislation as it stands, alone, secs. 14 and 15 are within the competence of the provincial legislature.\nBut it is said that if we examine the commissioner's report and the evidence (a part of which only was issued and before the legislature at the time the enactment was made) we shall discover the mischief at which the legislation was aimed and that the real purpose and intent of the legislation was to control the petroleum industry at large and in the State of California particularly, and that the legislation is directed to the control of the industry in its interprovincial and international aspects. Briefly, what is said is that the legislature, with the commissioner's report before it, thought that the large California oil companies having a very limited market in California for their fuel oil, due to the warm climatic conditions there, sought a market for their fuel oil in the province of British Columbia and in order to gain that market adopted the sale at very low prices, with great mischief to the coal policy of dumping their fuel oil into British Columbia for BRITISH industry in British Columbia; but of selling their gasoline, with which there was no natural resource in British Columbia to enter into competition, at exorbitant prices.\nUpon an examination of the evidence in the elaborate inquiry by the commissioner and of his report it is said that it plainly appears that the hand of the legislature was reaching out far beyond the limits of its own province in an effort to control an integrated industry with wide interprovincial and international activities.\nGenerally speaking, the Court has no right to interpret legislation by reference to such extraneous material as the evidence taken before and the report of a public inquiry under a Royal Commission. It would be a dangerous course to adopt. The principle was stated by Lord Wright in the Assam case, in the House of Lords[13], where, with reference to an attempt to introduce certain recommendations from a report of a Royal Commission to show that the words of the section of a statute there in question were intended to give effect to them, he said:\nBut on principle no such evidence for the purpose of showing the intention, that is the purpose or object, of an Act is admissible;\nand distinguished the dictum of Lord Halsbury in the Eastman Photographic case[14]. The statement of Lord Langdale in the Gorham case in Moore, 1852 edition, p. 462, was accepted. That statement was this:\nWe must endeavour to attain for ourselves the true meaning of the language employed\u2014in the Articles and Liturgy\u2014assisted only by the consideration of such external or historical facts as we may find necessary to enable us to understand the subject-matter to which the instruments relate, and the meaning of the words employed.\nThe furthest the courts have gone recently, I think, is in the case of Ladore v. Bennett in the Privy Council[15], where Lord Atkin (who had agreed in the House of Lords with the opinion of Lord Wright in the Assam case (13)) said: Their Lordships do not cite this report as evidence of the facts there 1940 found, but as indicating the materials which the Government of the Province had before them before promoting in the Legislature the statute now impugned.\nThat was an action raising a constitutional issue on certain Ontario statutes. There was a complicated piece of municipal legislation whereby the city of Windsor in the province of Ontario and three adjoining municipalities were, on account of their financial difficulties, put into one amalgamated whole. Not only did the parties consent before the Judicial Committee to the report being before their Lordships, but it would be useful, to readily understand the framework of the particular legislation, to have a convenient reference to the problems involved and disclosed by the report.\nA rule somewhat wider than the general rule may well be necessary in considering the constitutionality of legislation under a federal system where legislative authority is divided between the central and the local legislative bodies. But even if that be so, the legislation here in question is expressly confined and limited to the sale of the products of the particular industry in, and for use in, the province and must, upon the well settled authorities, be held to be valid legislation.\nI have refrained from any mention of an amendment to the statute because I think the above conclusion is inevitable without regard to the amendment. The action did not go to trial until January 16th, 1939. Prior to that, on December 9th, 1938, the legislature amended the statute in question by adding thereto the following as sec. 42:\n42. This Act is not intended to implement or carry into effect the recommendations or findings of any report made or to be made by the Commissioner appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council under the \" Public Inquiries Act \" on the twenty-ninth day of November, 1934; and in construing this Act and in ascertaining its purpose, intention, scope, and effect, no reference shall be made to any such reports; and the Board shall regulate and control the coal and petroleum industries in their Provincial aspects only; and in fixing the price of any product or commodity the Board shall consider only matters that relate to that product or commodity in its Provincial aspect and shall not fix the price of any product or commodity for the purpose of affording protection or assistance to any other product, commodity, or industry, and this Act shall not apply to the importation into or export from the Province of any product or commodity.\nThe Attorney-General stated to us that during the argument on the interlocutory proceedings for an interim injunction counsel for the appellants had contended that the statute was the outcome of the commissioner's inquiry and report and was intended to implement or carry into effect the report and that the real character of the Act was to be gathered from a consideration of the report. The Attorney-General said that the legislature then desired to make a declaration that it had not been its intention to implement or carry into effect any recommendations or findings of the report and that in fixing the price of any product or commodity the Board should consider only matters that relate to the product or commodity in its provincial aspect, and that the Act should not apply to the importation into or export from the province of any product or commodity, and accordingly the legislature passed the above amendment to the statute. The Attorney-General conceded in his argument before us the submission of counsel for the appellants that a legislature cannot support an Act attacked as being ultra vires by denying to a citizen access to the courts for purpose of attacking the legislation or by denying to the courts access to the evidence. But he said that the amendment was not in any sense an attempt to deny the appellants any right to attack the constitutional validity of the Act; the amendment was merely to make plain what the intention of the legislature was in view of contentions made during the course of the interlocutory proceedings.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nHudson J.\u2014The statute in question is clearly on its face within the legislative competence of the British Columbia Legislature. In the case of Shannon v. Lower Mainland Products Company[16], an Act in many respects similar to the present was upheld by the Judicial Committee. Lord Atkin, in giving the judgment of the Board, repeated what has been the principle of many leading cases, namely, page 720:\nThe pith and substance of this Act is that it is an Act to regulate particular businesses entirely within the Province, and it is therefore intra vires of the Province.\nMr. Farris, in a very able and exhaustive argument, contended that the Act under consideration in the present case was designed to affect extra-territorial business, and was not in pith and substance directed to the regulation of particular businesses within the Province.\nOn examination of the evidence, I am of opinion that the Legislature here at most did no more than take into , account extra-territorial marketing conditions and sources of supply in making regulations for the conduct of particular businesses within the Province. In my view, this is something which might be done legitimately. The direct purpose of the Act as expressed was to regulate sales of coal and gasoline taking place within the Province and I think the ultimate object was to do this.\nFortunately we are not concerned with the wisdom or policy of the legislation, and in construing section 91 (2) of the British North America Act we are bound by a long series of decisions which preclude us from giving weight to many of the arguments of Mr. Farris, which otherwise might have been very convincing.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: T.

In May, 1937, the appellant was struck by one of respondent's treks, operated by one of its employees and he sued the respondent for the damages resulting from the accident. This employee was not employed as a truck driver, but was simply a helper; he had no operator's licence and took the truck without the respondent company's knowledge, permission or consent and in breach of the company's instructions and regulations.' The respondent had left the truck unattended on the street, with the key in the switch. The appellant sought to hold the respondent responsible both under Article 1054 C.C. and under sections 31 and 43 of the Quebec Motor Vehicle Act. The action, tried before a jury, was dismissed by the trial judge, which judgment was affirmed by the appellate court.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (Q.R. 66 KB. 385), that the respondent was not liable.\nHeld, also, that article 1054 C.C. had no application in the circumstances of this case. According to the evidence, the employee took the truck contrary to formal prohibition of his employer and exclusively for his own purposes and, therefore, could not be held to have been in the performance of the work for which he was employed. Moreover the respondent cannot be held to be liable on the ground that the injury was caused by a thing under his care, as the real cause of the accident was the employee's intervention; the latter, in acting as he did, was a stranger vis-\u00e0-vis the respondent.\nHeld, also, that section 53 of the Quebec Motor Vehicle Act, which places the onus on the owner of a car to establish that the loss or damage did not arise through his negligence or improper conduct, has no application under the circumstances of the case; the proximate cause of the appellant's injury was the independent act of the employee and not any conduct of the respondent. Moreover, the presumption of liability created by that enactment was amply rebutted by the evidence.\nHeld, further, that the respondent cannot be found guilty of negligence, for having left the truck unattended on the street in front of the garage with its key in the switch, in contravention of the provisions of section 31 of the Quebec Motor Vehicle Act. Prima facie, in view of the sanction by penalty, the owner of a motor vehicle guilty of an offence under that section by reason of which another person suffers harm is not responsible in a civil action. Such section is a police regulation and is not intended to attach a civil liability. But, assuming that an offence against that section may entail civil consequences, civil responsibility can only arise when the damage caused is the direct consequence of the offence. In this case, the damage was the direct consequence of the act of the employee and it was, moreover, the direct consequence of his independent wrongful act; there was no relation of cause and effect between the alleged negligence of the respondent and the accident which subsequently took place. Davis J. was of the opinion that it was unnecessary to decide the question whether, in a case of an alleged breach of a statutory duty, the imposition of a penalty leaves any room for an additional civil remedy, and held that, in all the circumstances of this particular case, the injuries sustained by the appellant were not the result of the respondent's breach of the statute in leaving the truck on a public highway unlocked; there was no causal relation. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Duclos J., with a jury and dismissing the appellant's action in damages.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nGordon D. McKay for the appellant.\nL. E. Beaulieu K.C. and R\u00e9n\u00e9 Duguay for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I agree with the conclusion of my brother Rinfret. I add one or two observations to what he has said.\nDealing first with the question of liability apart from the enactments of the Motor Vehicles Act of 1925. The facts as he has stated them leave room for only one conclusion and that is that the cause, not only the immediate cause but the real cause of the appellant's injury was the conscious act of the volition of St. Germain in wrongfully possessing himself of the car and driving it negligently; in these acts St. Germain was a stranger vis-\u00e0-vis the respondent.\nUnder section 53 the onus was, no doubt, on the respondents in the strict sense. It was their duty to establish that the loss or damage did not arise through their negligence or improper conduct; but it is plain that on the facts as my brother Rinfret has stated them the proximate cause of the appellant's injury was the independent act of St. Germain and not any conduct of the respondents. There are no circumstances disclosed which, in point of law, could form the basis (apart from the statute) of an affirmation that the respondents were under any obligation to the appellant or the public generally to protect him or them against the acts of such wrongdoers as St. Germain by taking precautions in respect of the locking of the truck.\nI turn now to section 31 of the statute. It is in these words:\n31. (1) Every motor vehicle shall be provided with a lock or other device to prevent such vehicle from being set in motion.\n(2) When a motor vehicle is left unattended on a public highway, it shall be locked or made fast in such a manner that it cannot be set in motion. By section 49, anybody contravening this enactment is guilty of an offence against the Act and incurs certain penalties as set forth in that section.\nPrima facie, in view of the sanction by penalty, the owner of a motor vehicle guilty of an offence under section 31 by reason of which another person suffers harm is not responsible in a civil action. Assuming, however, that an offence against this section may entail civil consequences, and I did not understand Mr. Beaulieu to dispute that, civil responsibility can only arise where the damage caused is the direct consequence of the offence. Here, I repeat, the damage was the direct consequence of the act of St. Germain; it was, moreover, the direct consequence of his independent wrongful act. The offence of the respondents furnished the opportunity, the occasion for the commission of St. Germain's wrong; and the respondents do not, by reason of this circumstance, incur civil responsibility in respect of that wrong unless it can be affirmed that it is the intention of the section to impose upon the owner of a motor vehicle a duty to the appellant or to the public generally to observe the enactments of the section for the purpose of protecting him or them against the acts of such independent wrongdoers as St. Germain. I am satisfied that the statute neither expresses nor evidences any such intention.\nIt should, perhaps, be noted that certain decisions of this court have been cited in the course of the proceedings as authoritative (Montreal Rolling Mills Co. v. Corcoran[2]; Tooke v. Bergeron[3]). These cases were cited by Mr. Justice Girouard in Dominion Cartridge Co. v. McArthur[4], in support of the proposition that the plaintiff must fail unless\n* * * the latter proves, by positive testimony, or by presumptions weighty, precise and consistent, that there is fault on the part of the former, and that this fault is the immediate, necessary and direct cause of the injury he sustains.\nThe judgment of the Judicial Committee delivered on appeal in the Dominion Cartridge Co's case[5] by Lord Macnaghten made it very clear that the principle of these decisions resting upon a doctrine propounded by the French tribunals cannot be accepted as establishing a rule of general application in Quebec. The rule enunciated again and again by the judgments of this court since the Dominion Cartridge Co's case[6] and now well established is that, in Quebec as elsewhere, where an issue of fact is to be tried by a jury, if the party on whom rests the burden of proof adduces reasonable evidence in support of his allegation he is entitled to have the issue submitted to and passed upon by the jury.\nI should add a word of appreciation for the admirable argument contained in the factum for the appellants.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nRinfeet J.\u2014The respondent is engaged in the trucking business and operates a warehouse on Argyle street, in the city of Montreal, which is also used as a garage for its trucks.\nOn the 30th day of May, 1937, the appellant was struck by one of respondent's trucks, operated by one of its employees and he sued the respondent for the damages resulting; from the accident.\nThe case came before a jury; and, at the conclusion of the appellant's evidence, the trial judge dismissed the action on the ground that the appellant had given no evidence upon which a jury could find a verdict.\nThis judgment was unanimously confirmed by the Court of King's Bench.\nThe employee, one St. Germain, was co-defendant in the action brought against the respondent; but in this appeal we are concerned only with the latter's responsibility.\nIt may be assumed, for the purpose of the discussion, that the. accident was due to the employee's negligence.\nThe appellant sought to hold the respondent responsible both under art. 1054 C.C. and under secs. 31 and 53 of the Motor 'Vehicle Act.\nIn the circumstances, art. 1054 C.C. does not help the appellant.\nSt. Germain was not employed as a truck driver; he was simply a helper. He had no licence and he had nothing to do whatever with the driving of the truck. He took the truck without the company's knowledge, permission or consent, and in breach of the company's instructions and regulations. In fact, he took it contrary to formal prohibition and exclusively for his own purposes. He could not possibly be held to have been in the performance of the work for which he was employed.\nMoreover, on the authority of P\u00e9russe v. Stafford[7], the appellant could not succeed in this Court on the ground that the injury was caused by a thing under the care of the respondent. The real cause of the accident was St. Germain's intervention.\nIf, on the other hand, the rule laid down in paragraph 2 of sec. 53 of the Motor Vehicle Act be urged as being applicable to the respondent, the presumption of liability created by this enactment was amply rebutted by the evidence.\nUnder that paragraph,\nWhenever loss or damage is sustained by any person by reason of a motor vehicle on a public highway, the burden of proof that such loss or damage did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver of such motor vehicle shall be upon such owner or driver.\nIn this case, the truck was taken surreptitiously by St. Germain. The respondent had done everything that it could reasonably be expected to do. With all the precautions taken by the respondent, the theft of the car by one of the employees was not a circumstance which might have been anticipated. The fact of the theft in itself acted in exoneration of the respondent as owner or master, both under sec. 53 of the Motor Vehicle Act and art. 1054 C.C.\nI fully agree with the statement of the law made by Savatier: \"Trait\u00e9 de la responsabilit\u00e9 civile,\" 1939, vol. 1, p. 533:\nLe propri\u00e9taire de la voiture ne saurait done r\u00e9pondre en cette seule qualit\u00e9 d'un risque qui ne s'est r\u00e9alis\u00e9 que par la faute d'un tiers et qui doit done peser exclusivement sur la personne en faute. Il n'en est autrement que si lui-m\u00eame vient \u00e0 \u00eatre prouv\u00e9 auteur d'une faute dommageable.\nIn this case, under the circumstances proven, St. Germain was in no way the \" pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 \" of the respondent. He was to all intents \"un tiers\"; and the general rules concerning the exoneration of the owner through the fault of a third party must apply.\nThe appellant, however, contends that there was some negligence on the part of the respondent because it left the truck unattended on the street in front of the garage; and, in support of that contention, the appellant refers to sec. 31 of the Motor Vehicle Act, which reads as follows:\n31. 1. Every motor vehicle shall be provided with a lock or other device to prevent such vehicle from being set in motion.\n2. When a motor vehicle is left unattended on a public highway, it shall be locked or made fast in such a manner that it cannot be set in motion.\nIn our view, this section does not pretend to deal with the liability for actionable negligence. It is a police regulation; and the sanction is the penalty provided by the statute. It is not intended to attach a civil liability.\nDealing with the matter, however, as a question of common law independently of the statute, we agree with the Court of King's Bench that, even if the facts were assumed, there is no relation of cause and effect between the alleged negligence of the respondent and the accident which subsequently took place. The accident was caused exclusively through the human agency of St. Germain; and the supposed link between that and the respondent in this particular case is too remote to be of any legal consequence on the question of responsibility. The cause of the accident was St. Germain's fault; and there was no direct relation between leaving the truck on the street and the injury caused to the appellant.\nWhile we do not wish to be understood to say that the truck was left unattended within the meaning of the statute, we think the statute in itself does not create any civil liability and that, as a matter of common law, no link existed between the act of leaving the truck as it was and the subsequent accident.\nSavatier, in the recent work already referred to, in vol. 2nd, parag. 473, examines precisely the responsibility of the owner of an \"automobile laiss\u00e9e sans precaution dans un lieu public \" and he states that in cases such as these it is impossible to speak of \" un dommage normalement pr\u00e9visible.\" He follows up the discussion in the. light of the jurisprudence in France and comes to the following conclusion (no. 478):\nNous croyons pourtant que la negligence du propri\u00e9taire de l'automobile vol\u00e9e ne doit pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme la cause directe, au sens g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la jurisprudence, de l'accident caus\u00e9 \u00e0 un tiers par le voleur.\nThis conclusion agrees with the unanimous judgment of the Court of King's Bench and the reasons given by each of the judges composing that Court; and it also expresses our view of the law which should be applied in the premises.\nWe have, therefore, come to the conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavis J.\u2014The appellant took action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained on the night of May 30, 1937, when he was struck by a motor vehicle owned by the respondent which was being driven at the time by St. Germain, one of its employees. The facts are very simple. The respondent carries on a trucking business with headquarters in the city of Montreal and owns and operates some forty motor trucks. The warehouse premises in Montreal are used for loading and unloading and when several of the respondent's trucks are not on the road, they are parked for convenience on the public street in front of the warehouse, leaving the ground floor of the building available for such trucks as are, at the time, being loaded or unloaded. The trucks are driven by licensed chauffeurs but there are other employees who are engaged solely on what may be called the inside work, that is, the loading or unloading of the trucks. St. Germain was one of the latter class of employees; he did not even have a licence to operate a motor vehicle.\nShortly after midnight St. Germain, being engaged on the night shift and desirous of going down town to get something to eat, took without permission one of his employer's motor trucks that was standing on the street and drove it down town for his personal purposes. The key was in the lock in the car. In the course of St. Germain's journey the appellant, walking across a downtown street, was struck by the motor truck and suffered personal injuries for which he has sued in damages the respondent company. The case against the respondent was first put upon the ground of negligence but in his answer to plea the appellant set up against the respondent a further cause of action by asserting a breach of a statutory duty which required that the truck should not have been left unattended on the public street without it being locked or made fast in such a manner that it could not be set in motion. The action came on for trial in the Superior Court, District of Montreal, before Duclos, J. with a jury. At the close of the appellant's case, on motion of counsel for the respondent, the trial judge took the case from the jury and dismissed the action without costs upon the ground that St. Germain had taken the truck without the respondent's permission and that he was not at the time of the accident acting in the performance of the work for which he was employed, and that there was no evidence of any negligence on the part of the respondent. Upon appeal being taken by the appellant to the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, that Court by a unanimous judgment found that there was no error in the judgment of the trial judge and affirmed the said judgment with costs to the respondent. The appellant then appealed further to this Court.\nCounsel for the appellant before us limited his grounds of appeal to what he alleged was a breach of a statutory duty. He was content for the purpose of the appeal to treat St. Germain as if he were a stranger or even a thief. The case was put this way to us: The respondent in breach of a statutory duty allowed its truck to be left standing in the public street without being locked (or at least with the key in the lock) and as a result of that St. Germain was able to take the car and the appellant's injuries were due directly to that breach of statutory duty.\nThe relevant sections of the Quebec Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.Q. 1925, ch. 35, are these:\n31. (1) Every motor vehicle shall be provided with a lock or other device to prevent such vehicle from being set in motion.\n(2) When a motor vehicle is left unattended on a public highway, it shall be looked or made fast in such a manner that it cannot be set in motion.\n53. (1) The owner of a motor vehicle shall be held responsible for any violation of this Act committed with such motor vehicle, or of any regulation made thereunder by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\n(2) Whenever loss or damage is sustained by any person by reason of a motor vehicle on a public highway, the burden of proof that such loss or damage did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver of such motor vehicle shall be upon such owner or driver.\nSec. 49 provides penalties for anyone who contravenes any of the provisions of the Act (other than those of sec. 48 with which we are not concerned).\nCounsel for the respondent contends that it is not open to the appellant to raise the alleged breach of statutory duty in that this cause of action was not stated in the writ or in the declaration annexed to it but was only brought in by the appellant's answer to plea. But that is a matter of practice and procedure and we should not interfere with the disposition of that question by the provincial court.\nAlthough it was contended that the evidence did not strictly establish a breach of the statutory duty referred to, I think the evidence shows that the statutory provision was not complied with. The difficult question of law which so often arises where you have a breach of statutory duty, whether the imposition of a penalty leaves any room for an additional civil remedy, may not arise upon the interpretation of this statute because sec. 53 (1) has expressly made the owner of the motor vehicle responsible for any violation of the Act committed with such motor vehicle and this provision follows after the penalty clauses. See Square v. Model Farm Dairies[8]. But it is unnecessary to express any opinion in this case upon that question because, assuming there is a civil remedy, the underlying problem is always whether the damage done or the personal injuries sustained are the direct result of the act complained of, in this case the breach of the particular statutory duty. In many cases it is a difficult problem. Where the consequence complained of is the ordinary consequence of the original negligence, the interference of another, however wrongfully or even criminally that other may have acted, may not affect the liability of the original wrongdoer. See Haynes v. Harwood[9]. It is safe to say, I think, that in all the circumstances of this particular case the injuries sustained by the appellant were not the result of the respondent's breach of the statute in leaving the truck on the public highway unlocked. There is no causal relation. The Quebec statute, sec. 53 (2), puts the onus of proof upon the owner of the motor vehicle but that does not mean that a, plaintiff may not be non-suited in a non-jury trial where at the conclusion of the case all the available facts have been brought out in examination and cross-examination of the witnesses and the evidence plainly discloses that the loss or damage did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the defendant.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Genser & McKay.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Duguay, Carignan & Lalande.\n[1] (1939) Q.R. 66 K.B. 385.\n[2] (1896) 26 Can.

Defendant manufactured and sold shaving machines and used the word \" Schick \" in association therewith. Plaintiff (and its co-plaintiff, to which it had assigned its said trade mark) brought action in 1938, claiming that defendant had infringed its trade mark. Defendant, by counterclaim, asked (inter alia) that plaintiff's trade mark be modified to exclude therefrom shaving machines. By the judgment in the Exchequer Court (Maclean J., [1939] Ex.C.R. 108) the registration of plaintiff's trade mark was amended by striking therefrom the words \"shaving machines\"; plaintiff's action was dismissed, except that defendant was restrained from using the word \" Schick\" otherwise than in a way specified. Plaintiff appealed from the judgment. Defendant cross-appealed, asking removal of said restraint.\nHeld: Plaintiff's appeal should be dismissed and defendant's cross-appeal allowed.\nPer the Chief Justice and Hudson J.: Plaintiff could not rely upon its trade mark as a word mark unless, at all events, it had established that the word \" would at the date of registration have been registrable independently of any defined form or appearance and without being combined with any other feature\" (Unfair Competition Act, 1932, c. 38, s. 23 (5) (c)). No attempt was made to comply with that condition. Moreover, of the Rules made under authority of s. 42 of the Trade Mark and Design Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 201), it is not seriously open to dispute that the registration of plaintiff's trade mark was a registration under R. 11 (of surname \" presented in a distinctive form, or accompanied by a distinctive device \") and not under R. 10 (registration of surname upon evidence that the mark has \" through long-continued and extensive use thereof in Canada acquired a secondary meaning, and become adapted to distinguish the goods of the applicant\"); it would have been difficult to the point of practical impossibility to show that the surname \" Schick\" had in its very brief period of use prior to the application for the trade mark become distinctive' in Canada of the applicant's wares in the sense of R. 10. R. 10 was validly made and was intended to, and did, give effect to s. 11 (e) of the Trade Mark and Design Act, which provided for refusal of registration \" if the so-called trade mark does not contain the essentials necessary to constitute a trade mark, properly speaking\" and thus imposed a condition for valid registration (Canadian Shredded Wheat Co. Ld. v. Kellogg Co. of Canada Ld., 55 R.P.C 125). It follows that plaintiff's mark was only a \"design mark having the features described in the application therefor but without any meaning being attributed to the words\" (s. 23 (5) (c) of the Unfair Competition Act, 1932)\u2014\" a trade mark consisting of an arbitrary and in itself meaningless mark or design\" (s. 2 (c) of that Act, defining \"design mark\"); it is in this sense only that plaintiff could have any exclusive rights in respect of its trade mark; it has no exclusive rights in respect of the use of the surname \"Schick\" because for the purpose of determining its rights the letters in its mark are to be emptied of all such meaning; the design is the only thing which plaintiff is entitled to have protected; and defendant is entitled to. use the name \"Schick,\" provided that its design is not the same or \"similar\" (as defined in s. 2 (k) of that Act) to plaintiff's design; and the evidence quite failed to establish such sameness or similarity.\nOn the evidence, \"shaving machines\" are recognized by the trade as entirely distinct from any goods made or sold at any time by plaintiff and it cannot be rightly affirmed that at the date of registration of plaintiff's mark it was carrying on or had any intention of presently carrying on any business which included the manufacture or sale or dealing in or with such machines in the trade mark sense. The trade mark registered was a specific trade mark and, as the trade mark of plaintiff, it could not, in the circumstances, have any meaning as applied to such machines. Plaintiff could not have a trade mark in respect of such machines within the meaning of the provisions of said Trade Mark and Design Act, and consequently its registered mark was not valid in relation to such goods.\nIt was not established (as a basis for alleged infringement of plaintiff's mark, even as amended by striking out \"shaving machines\") that \" shaving machines\" are goods similar to the goods in which plaintiff deals, within the tests of similarity set forth in s. 2 (l) of the Unfair Competition Act, 1932.\nMoreover, as regards the whole issue of infringement, plaintiff's conduct in permitting until a quite recent date the Schick companies to use the name \"Schick\" in connection with their goods justifies the conclusion that it was not seriously apprehensive of any risk of confusion that could be of any commercial importance.\nWith regard to plaintiff's contention based on ss. 18 and 23 (1) of the Unfair Competition Act, 1932, that the production of a certified copy of the record of registration was conclusive evidence of certain facts, questions as to the meaning and effect of those enactments were discussed; but decision on those questions was deemed unnecessary because (1) plaintiff's argument left untouched the point that its mark was &, design mark and the consequences thereof; and (2) ss. 18 and 19 cf said Act must be read together, and as \"it appears\" (s. 19) from the undisputed facts that plaintiff was not entitled to register its mark as a trade mark for shaving machines, effect must be given to s. 19 against plaintiff's contention.\nPer Kerwin J. Even if plaintiff was entitled to rely upon s. 18 of the Unfair Competition Act, 1932, s. 18 must be read in conjunction with s. 19. Defendant is entitled to succeed on its counterclaim that said registration of plaintiff's trade mark should be amended by striking therefrom the words \"shaving machines\" and therefore the foundation of plaintiff's action disappears. It appears from the history and the agreements (discussed in the judgment) of Schick, plaintiff company, and the companies bearing Schick's name, that plaintiff's registration \" does not accurately express or define \" (s. 52 of said Act) plaintiff's existing rights with reference to shaving machines, and that the rights to manufacture and sell shaving machines and use the name \" Schick \" as a trade mark in connection therewith is now vested in defendant company, which is, therefore, an interested party under s. 52 of said Act and is entitled to the order made by the Exchequer Court amending the plaintiff's registration as aforesaid.\nPer Tascheretau J.: In view of the fact that the articles which were understood to be referred to by the words \"shaving machines\" were not patented until after registration of plaintiff's trade mark, and in view of the agreements (discussed in the judgment) between Schick and plaintiff company and of the transactions of Schick and the companies bearing his name, plaintiff's registration, in so far as it covers \"shaving machines,\" is irregular and should be amended by striking those words from it, and defendant has the right to use the word \" Schick \" in connection with such machines.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing their action and also directing an amendment of their registered trade mark in question. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendant had infringed the plaintiffs' rights in a certain registered trade mark, and asked for an injunction, damages, etc. The defendant, in addition to disputing the plaintiffs' claim, counterclaimed, asking (inter alia) that the registration of the trade mark should be declared invalid and expunged, or modified to exclude therefrom shaving machines.\nBy the formal judgment in the Exchequer Court it was ordered and adjudged that the action be dismissed (\"except as herein ordered\"); that the registration of the trade mark be amended by striking therefrom the words \" shaving machines\" (and that otherwise defendant's counterclaim be dismissed); but, by paragraph 4 of the judgment, that\nthe defendant, its officers, servants, agents and workmen, be and they are hereby perpetually restrained from using the said trade mark \" SCHICK \" on or in association with, or in connection with, the manufacture and\/or distribution and\/or sale and\/or advertisement of mechanical razors or shaving machines unless it be immediately preceded or succeeded by some other word having the same number of letters as the name \" SCHICK \" in letters of a size at least equal to that of the letters composing the word \" SCHICK \" and of the same style of type. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court. The defendant cross-appealed, asking that the judgment in the Exchequer Court be varied by striking out said paragraph 4 therefrom.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported. The plaintiffs' appeal to this Court was dismissed and the defendant's cross-appeal allowed with costs throughout.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and R. S. Smart K.C. for the appellants.\nJ. D. Kearney K.C., E. G. Gowling and J. D. MacKay for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Hudson J. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The appellants' trade mark was registered on the 3rd of August, 1927, when the Act respecting Trade Marks and Industrial Designs (which I shall refer to as the Trade Marks Act) was still in force. Some enactments of the Trade Marks Act and of the Rules made under that Act will have to be noticed.\nSection 42 of the Act is in these words:\n42. The Minister may, from time to time, subject to the approval of the Governor in Council, make rules and regulations and adopt forms for the purposes of this Act respecting trade marks and industrial designs; and such rules, regulations and forms circulated in print for the use of the public shall be deemed to be correct for the purposes of this Act.\n(2) All documents executed according to the said rules, regulations and forms, and accepted by the Minister, shall be deemed to be valid so far as relates to official proceedings under this Act.\nOf the Rues made under the authority given by this section, Rules 10 and 11 are material. They are as follows:\n10. A Trade Mark consisting either of a surname, a geographical name or adjective, or a word having a direct reference to the character or quality of the goods in connection with which it is used, may be registered as a Specific Trade Mark upon the filing of the prescribed application and payment of the prescribed fee, and upon furnishing the Commissioner with satisfactory evidence, either by statutory declaration or by affidavit, that the mark in question has, through long-continued and extensive use thereof in Canada acquired a secondary meaning, and become adapted to distinguish the goods of the applicant.\n11. A Trade Mark consisting of the name of an individual, a firm, or a company, or of a surname, if presented in a distinctive form, or accompanied by a distinctive device, may be registered as a Trade Mark upon compliance with the requirements of the Act, Rules and Forms. The application of the Magazine Repeating Razor Co., dated the 21st of March, 1927, is as follows:\nWe, Magazine Repeating Razor Company, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of New Jersey, United States of America, located at Sound Beach, State of Connecticut, U.S.A., hereby request you to register in our name a Specific Trade Mark to be used in connection with the sale of razors of all kinds; safety razors of all kinds; mechanical, automatic, and magazine razors; shaving machines; razor blades; razor blade holders; stroppers for razor blades; magazines, containers, and receptacles for razor blades; cutlery of all kinds, safety razor sets; machinery for making razors and razor blades; shaving brushes; shaving soaps, creams and powder; pharmaceutical products, including antiseptics, talcum powder, face lotions, cold cream, perfumery, toilet preparations and toilet articles, which we verily believe is ours on account of having been the first to make use of the same.\nWe hereby declare that the said Specific Trade Mark was not in use to our knowledge by any other persons than ourselves at the time of our adoption thereof.\nThe said Specific Trade Mark consists of the word\n\"SCHICK\"\nA drawing of the said Specific Trade Mark is hereunto annexed.\nSigned at New York City, this 21st day of March, 1927, in the presence of the two undersigned witnesses.\nMAGAZINE REPEATING RAZOR COMPANY.\nBy Orlando B. Willcox,\nVice-President.\nWitnesses:\nEdward G. McLaughlin\nWilliam H. Crawford\nTo the Minister of Trade and Commerce,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThe certificate filed in proof of the registration of the trade mark is in these words:\nSCHICK\nCANADA\nThis is to certify that this Trade Mark (Specific) to be applied to the sale of Razors of all kinds, Safety Razors of all kinds, Mechanical, Automatic, and Magazine Razors, Shaving Machines, Razor Blades, Razor Blade Holders, Stroppers for Razor Blades, Magazines, Containers, and Receptacles for Razor Blades, Cutlery of all kinds, Safety Razor Sets, Machinery for making Razors and Razor Blades, Shaving Brushes, Shaving Soaps, Creams and Powder, Pharmaceutical Products, including Antiseptics, Talcum Powder, Face Lotions, Cold Cream, Perfumery, Toilet Preparations and toilet articles, and which consists of the word:\n\"SCHICK\" as per the annexed pattern and application has been registered in The Trade Mark Register No. 191, Folio 42001, in accordance with \"The Trade Mark and Design Act,\" by\nMagazine Repeating Razor Company,\na Corporation, of Sound Beach, State of Connecticut, United States of America, on the 3rd day of August, A.D. 1927.\nPatent and Copyright Office (Copyright and Trade Mark Branch), Ottawa, Canada, this 3rd day of August, A.D. 1927:.\n(Sgd.) Thos. L. Richard, Acting Commissioner of Patents.\nIt is not seriously open to dispute that the registration of this trade mark is a registration under Rule 11. Subsection 5 (c) of section 23 of the Unfair Competition Act, 1932, shows the effect to be given to the registration of a mark such as that of the appellants where the registration took place before that statute came into force. The subsection is in these words:\n23. * * *\n(5) Marks registered before the coming into force of this Act shall be treated as word marks or as design marks according to the following rules:\u2014\n****\n(c) Any mark including words and\/or numerals in combination with other features shall be deemed to be a design mark having the features described in the application therefor but without any meaning being attributed to the words or numerals, which shall, however, also be deemed to constitute a word mark if and so far as they would at the date of registration have been registrable independently of any defined form or appearance and without being combined with any other feature.\nIt is perfectly clear that the appellants cannot rely upon their trade mark as a word mark unless, at all events, they have established that the word \"would at the date of registration have been registrable independently of any defined form or appearance and without being combined with any other feature.\" If this condition had been fulfilled I assume for our present purposes that the word could have been so relied upon. No attempt has been made to comply with the condition. It appears (See the American application) that the use of the word \"Schick\" as a trade mark by the applicants began only a week or two before the date of the application and it would have been difficult to the point of practical impossibility to show that the surname \"Schick\" had in that brief period become distinctive in Canada of the applicants' wares in the sense of Rule 10. Rule 10, in my opinion, was validly made under section 42 and was intended to give effect to section 11 (e) which is in these words:\n11. The Minister may refuse to register any trade mark or union label\n****\n(e) if the so-called trade mark does not contain the essentials necessary to constitute a trade mark, properly speaking.\nThis section imposes a condition and a trade mark which does not conform to the condition cannot validly be registered (Canadian Shredded Wheat Co. Ld. v. Kellogg Co. of Canada Ld.[2]. I repeat, I think regulation 10 is intended to give effect to section 11 (e) and in my opinion it does so. The registration of a surname which had not acquired a secondary meaning, in such a manner as to become adapted to distinguish the goods of the applicant, would be wanting in the essential elements of a trade mark within the contemplation of section 11. That, I think, was the law governing the registration of trade marks under the Trade Marks Act.\nIt follows that the appellants' mark is only a \"design mark having the features described in the application therefor but without any meaning being attributed to the words \" (s. 23 (5) (c)). In the language of section 2 (c) which defines \"design mark,\" such a mark means \"a trade mark consisting of an arbitrary and in itself meaningless mark or design.\" It is in this sense only that the appellants can have any exclusive rights in respect of their trade mark. They have no exclusive rights in respect of the use of the surname \"Schick\" because for the purpose of determining their rights the letters in their mark are to be emptied of all such meaning.\nThis appears to me to be quite conclusive upon the issue of infringement. The appellants, relying upon the Unfair Competition Act, 1932, must bring themselves within the terms of that statute. By the combined operation of sections 3 and 10 they must establish that their mark, or a similar mark, has been taken by the respondents as a trade mark for the respondents' wares or similar wares. I do not propose to enter upon the evidence. It is not even suggested that the respondents have taken the appellants' trade mark as a design mark and I think the evidence quite fails to establish that they have adopted a trade mark similar in the sense of section 2 (k) to the appellants' mark as a design mark. The only thing charged against them is the use of the name \" Schick.\" They are entitled to use the name \" Schick\" provided that the design, because that is the only thing the appellants are entitled to have protected, has not such a similarity with the design of the appellants that the contemporaneous use of the two in the same area and in association with wares of the same kind would be likely to lead to confusion. In my opinion, the evidence fails to establish that. No confusion has arisen from any such similarity of design.\nBut there is another limitation to which the appellants' trade mark is subject. It is a specific trade mark and ex facie as registered it is to be applied to \"shaving machines\" among other articles. It is not disputed that the appellants have never at any time sold or manufactured or in any manner dealt in the class of goods designated by the phrase \"shaving machines,\"\u2014machines, that is to say, in which the operation of removing hair from the human face is performed by a machine operated by an electric motor and without a blade. The plaintiff had no right to register a trade mark in respect of such goods. They are, I think the evidence establishes, recognized by the trade as entirely distinct from any goods made or sold at any time by the appellants and it cannot be rightly affirmed that at the date of registration the appellants were carrying on or had any intention of presently carrying on any business which included the manufacture or sale or dealing in or with such machines in the trade mark sense. The trade mark registered is a specific trade mark and, as the trade mark of the appellants, it could, in the circumstances, have no meaning as applied to such shaving machines. It is very clear to me that they could not have a trade mark in respect of such articles within the meaning of the provisions of the Trade Marks Act and that, consequently, their registered trade mark was not a valid registered trade mark in relation to such goods. It is necessary, however, to consider the provisions of the Unfair Competition Act, 1932. It was argued that \"shaving machines\" are goods similar to the other goods in which the appellants deal and have always dealt within the test of \" similarity \" laid down in the Unfair Competition Act (s. 2 (l)); and accordingly it is contended that, assuming the original registration was invalid as respects shaving machines, nevertheless, since the appellants are entitled to protection in respect of the use of their design mark in association with shaving machines as being wares similar to the wares to which they are entitled to apply that mark, their case for infringement is made out, on the assumption, of course (with which, as I have just explained, I do not agree), that the respondents are using a design mark similar to theirs. In other words, it is contended that the appellants' trade mark amended, as the learned trial judge has amended it, by striking out \"shaving machines\" is infringed. This appears to me to be a question of fact and, I think, when section 2 (l), which sets forth the tests of similarity in respect of wares, is properly understood, the proper conclusion is that the appellants fail.\nI have not overlooked Mr. Biggar's argument touching the case of Edwards v. Dennis[3], but I think Lord Justice Cotton in his judgment in that case puts the test in a few words: The appellants must establish that the respondents \" have done or are doing \" something \" calculated to mislead the public into thinking that their goods are the goods of the \" appellants. I think for the purposes of this case that sums up the rule embodied in section 2 (l) and, in my opinion, in this the appellants have failed.\nAs regards the whole issue of infringement, I think it is important to consider the conduct of the appellants. I think their conduct in permitting the Schick companies to use the name \" Schick\" in connection with their goods justifies the conclusion that they were not seriously apprehensive of any risk of confusion that could be of any commercial importance. If they thought of it at all they treated it as a case of de minimis. They were, I am satisfied, quite content until a quite recent date to allow these companies to make use of the name \" Schick.\"\nFor these reasons the appellants fail on the issue of infringement; and the learned trial judge, moreover, was right in amending the register by striking out \"shaving machines\" from, the record of the appellants' trade mark.\nThe appellants rely on section 18 and the first subsection cf section 23 of the Unfair Competition Act, 1932. These enactments are in these words:\n18. (1) In any action for the infringement of any trade mark, the production of a certified copy of the record of the registration of such trade mark made pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be prima facie evidence of the facts set out in such record and that the person named therein is the registered owner of such mark for the purposes and within the territorial area therein defined.\n(2) Such a certified copy shall also, subject only to proof of clerical error there in, be conclusive evidence that, at the date of the registration, the trade mark therein mentioned was in use in Canada or in the territorial area therein defined for the purpose therein set out, in such manner that no person could thereafter adopt the same or a similar trade mark for the same or similar goods in ignorance of the use of the registered mark by the owner thereof for the said purpose in Canada or in the defined territorial area within Canada.\n23. (1) The register now existing under the Trade Mark and Design Act shall form part of the register maintained pursuant to this Act, and, subject as hereinafter provided, all entries therein shall hereafter be governed by the provisions of this Act, but shall not, if properly made under the law in force at the time they were made, be subject to be expunged or amended only because they might not properly have been made hereunder.\nBy force of section 18, the appellants contend, the certified copy of the record of the registration of the appellants' trade mark is conclusive evidence that, at the date of its registration in August, 1927, it was in use in Canada in the manner stated in the second subsection of section 13. I think it is open to serious doubt whether the registration of the appellants' trade mark, which was effected, as we have seen, under the Trade Marks Act before the Unfair Competition Act came into force, is a registration \"made pursuant to the provisions of\" the Unfair Competition Act within the meaning of section 18. The statute, in legislating with regard to registrations effected under the Trade Marks Act in the first and fourth subsections of section 4, for example, uses precise language. In subsection 1 such trade marks are described as trade marks \" recorded in the register existing under the Trade Mark and Design Act at the date of the coming into force of this Act.\" Where, as in subsection 4, trade marks registered under the Trade Marks Act and then registered under the Unfair Competition Act are both included, the phrase again is precise: \" unless such trade mark is recorded in the register maintained pursuant to this Act.\"\nI do not think that the words of section 23 (1), which provides that the register now existing under the Trade Marks Act shall form part of the register maintained pursuant to the Unfair Competition Act and that all entries in that register \" shall be governed by the provisions of the Unfair Competition Act,\" would alone be sufficient to bring registrations under the Trade Marks Act within the description \" registrations made pursuant to the Unfair Competition Act.\" On the other hand, it must be admitted that the phrase \" registered pursuant to the provisions of this Act \"is very loosely used in more than one place in the statute, and in some cases (it could be argued with a good deal of force) with the plain intention of denoting registrations under the earlier Act, as well as those effected under the. Unfair Competition Act.\nIt is not necessary to decide the point for the purposes of this appeal. In the first place, accepting Mr. Biggar's argument as he puts it, it leaves untouched the point that the appellants' mark is a design mark and the consequences thereof. In the second place, sections 18 and 19 must be read together. Neither of the two sections is at all happily expressed, and it may be that, when read together, the only effect of subsection 2 is to create a legal presumption on the production of the certified copy of the record of the registration.\nHowever that may be, \"it appears \" in this case from the undisputed facts that the appellants' predecessors were not entitled to register their trade mark as a trade mark for shaving machines and effect must be given to section 19 accordingly.\nIt was agreed by counsel on both sides that paragraph 4 of the formal judgment of the Exchequer Court cannot be sustained and the judgment ought to be modified accordingly.\nThe appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed with costs. Rinfeet J.\u2014I would dismiss the appeal with costs and I would dispose of the cross-appeal in the manner indicated in his reasons by my brother Kerwin.\nKerwin J.\u2014The plaintiffs in this action are Magazine Repeating Razor Company, a United States company, hereinafter referred to as the Magazine Company, and Magazine Repeating Razor Company of Canada, Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the Dominion of Canada. The defendant is Schick Shaver, Limited, a company incorporated in the Bahamas but licensed to do business in the Province of Quebec. The action was brought in the Exchequer Court of Canada for infringement of a Canadian trade mark \"SCHICK,\" granted to the Magazine Company and assigned by the latter to its co-plaintiff, In addition to denying the validity of the trade marie and the allegation of infringement, the defendant counter-claimed to have the registration expunged or modified.\nThe registration of the trade mark was ordered to be amended by striking therefrom the words \" shaving machines.\" With one exception, the claims in the action were dismissed. The exception appears in clause 4 of the judgment which, although the President had in his reasons expressed doubt as to his power so to do, restrains the defendant from using the trade mark on or in association with, or in connection with, the manufacture and\/or distribution and\/or sale and\/or advertisement of mechanical razors or shaving machines unless it be immediately preceded or succeeded by some other word having the same number of letters as the name \" SCHICK \" in letters of a size at least equal to that of the letters composing the word \"SCHICK\" and of the same style of type. The plaintiffs now appeal and the defendant cross-appeals and asks that clause 4 of the judgment be stricken out. Counsel for the appellants admitted that, if they could not succeed on the main appeal, the respondent was entitled to the relief claimed by its cross-appeal.\nThe trade mark in question was applied for March 21st, 1927. It was granted August 3rd, 1927, and according to the record in the Trade Mark Office it was\nto be applied to the sale of Razors of all kinds, Safety Razors of all kinds, Mechanical, Automatic, and Magazine Razors, Shaving Machines, Razor Blades, Razor Blade Holders, Stroppers for Razor Blades, Magazines, Containers, and Receptacles for Razor Blades, Cutlery of all kinds, Safety Razor Sets, Machinery for making Razors and Razor Blades, Shaving Brushes, Shaving Soaps, Creams and Powder, Pharmaceutical Products, including Antiseptics, Talcum Powder, Face Lotions, Cold Cream, Perfumery, Toilet Preparations and toilet articles.\nIt consisted of the word \"SCHICK,\" in accordance with the application and pattern annexed.\nThe registration was made pursuant to the provisions of the Trade Mark and Design Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 201, and at the trial the appellants produced a certified copy of the record. By the time the action was brought, The Unfair Competition Act, 1932 (c. 38 of the Statutes of 1932), was in force. By section 23, the register existing under the old Act is to form part of the register maintained pursuant to the new Act and \" all entries therein shall hereafter be governed by the provisions of this Act,\" but even if the appellants were entitled to rely upon section 18 of The Unfair Competition Act, that section must be read in conjunction with section 19. The two sections are as follows:\n18. (1) In any action for the infringement of any trade mark, the production of a certified copy of the record of the registration of such trade mark made pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be prima facie evidence of the facts set out in such record and that the person named therein is the registered owner of such mark for the purposes and within the territorial area therein defined.\n(2) Such a certified copy shall also, subject only to proof of clerical error therein, be conclusive evidence that, at the date of the registration, the trade mark therein mentioned was in use in Canada or in the territorial area therein defined for the purpose therein set out, in such manner that no person could thereafter adopt the same or a similar trade mark for the same or similar goods in ignorance of the use of the registered mark by the owner thereof for the said purpose in Canada or in the defined territorial area within Canada.\n19. If it appears to the court that a registered trade mark was not registrable by the person by whom the application for its registration was made, the owner thereof shall not be entitled to any remedy or relief in an action for the alleged infringement of such mark without other evidence of his rights than the mere production of a certified copy of the record of the registration.\nIt is unnecessary to express any opinion upon various defences to the claim for infringement raised by the respondent, as it is entitled to succeed on its counter-claim that the registration of the Canadian trade mark should be amended by striking therefrom the words \"shaving machines\" and the foundation of the action therefore disappears. Section 52 of The Unfair Competition Act provides:\n52. (1) The Exchequer Court of Canada shall have jurisdiction, on the application of the Registrar or of any person interested, to order that any entry in the register be struck out or amended on the ground that at the date of such application the entry as it appears on the register does not accurately express or define the existing rights of the person appearing to be the registered owner of the mark.\n(2) No person shall be entitled to institute under this section any proceeding calling into question any decision given by the Registrar of which such person had express notice and from which he had a right to appeal.\nAs will appear from the history of one Jacob Schick, various companies bearing his name, and the Magazine Company, the registration here in question does not actually express or define the appellants' existing rights with reference to shaving machines. Schick was an inventor and the owner of certain United States letters patent and of other applications for United States letters patent relating to a certain safety razor and blades to be used therein. On March 18th, 1925, he assigned all his right and interest in the letters patent and applications to Sharp Manufacturing Corporation (by which name the Magazine Company was previously known). On October 8th, 1926, the Magazine Company applied for, and on March 1st, 1927, was registered in the United States as the owner of, a trade mark as shown in an accompanying drawing. It is stated in the application that \" the word 'Schick' is disclaimed apart from the mark as shown,\" and:\nThe class of merchandise to which the trade mark is appropriated is Class 23, Cutlery, machinery, and tools, and parts thereof, and the particular description, of goods comprised in said class upon which said trade mark is used is: SAFETY RAZORS AND RAZOR BLADES.\nThe \"mark as shown\" in the United States trade mark is in a form different from that which appears in the Canadian trade mark in question, which, it will be recollected, was applied for on March 21st, 1927, although not granted until August 3rd, 1927. On March 31st, 1927, the Magazine Company filed in the United States Trade Mark Office another application to be registered as the owner of the trade mark \" Schick\" shown in the accompanying drawing, stating that such mark had been used continuously in the Company's business since March 12th, 1927. This drawing corresponds to the one appearing in the Canadian trade mark. The disclaimer of the word \"Schick\" does not appear in this United States application but the class of merchandise to which the trade mark is to be appropriated is the same as that described in the prior United States trade mark. Registration was not granted until April 24th, 1928.\nIn the meantime, on May 1st, 1927, an agreement was entered into between Schick and the Magazine Company whereby, after a recital that Schick had filed certain other applications for letters patent in the United States, Schick agreed to assign and transfer them to the Magazine Company and agreed that the Company \"may use the name 'Schick' in connection with the razors, blades and other articles, on the sale of which royalties are payable.\" Paragraph XI provided that if, while there were in effect any letters patent or applications for letters patent of the United States, acquired by the Magazine Company under this or the prior agreement of March 18th, 1925, and while the agreement was not terminated, Schick should make any invention or discovery relating to the \" art of shaving,\" other than inventions or discoveries relating to razors or blades or machinery or process for the manufacture thereof, he would disclose the same to the Company and make and file applications for letters patent thereon of the United States and such foreign countries as he might deem advisable and would assign and transfer such applications to the Company on such terms as should be fixed by agreement of the parties or by arbitration as therein provided.\nA reorganization of the Magazine Company apparently being contemplated, Mr. Willcox, a director of and counsel for the Magazine Company, wrote Jacob Schick on October 25th, 1927, for a letter confirming the statement that the Company was the\nsole owner of all the patents and patent rights of the United States and all foreign countries covering all inventions of said Jacob Schick relating to razors and razor blades and the machines, tools and processes employed in making the same.\nMr. Willcox concluded by stating:\nI understand, of course, that the shaving machine, which does not employ blades and which is not properly classified as a razor, is not included in such assignments. On January 1st, 1929, the Magazine Company released Schick from all claims, demands, obligations and liabilities which then existed or which might at any time exist under or by reason of paragraph XI of the agreement of May 1st, 1927, in so far as it applied to shaving machines or designs thereof, or machinery, tools or process for the manufacture thereof, or inventions, discoveries, letters patent or applications for letters patent relating to shaving machines, or machinery, tools, or process for the manufacture thereof. This was done as part of an arrangement, the remainder whereof was taken care of by an agreement of the same date whereby Schick granted to the Magazine Company an exclusive licence to make and sell in the United States, its territories and possessions, during the existence of the agreement, under the name of \"SCHICK\", shaving machines embodying the inventions described in certain letters patent of the United States and the letters patent which might be issued upon applications for letters patent of the United States, or any thereof. By one of the recitals:\nthe expression \"Schick Dry Shavers\" is hereinafter used to designate shaving machines which are characterized by a thin slotted shear plate engaging the skin and a moveable cutter behind the plate, the slots being narrow and open at both ends and the slots and the cutter being so shaped and proportioned that the operation of the cutter shaves close to the skin without cutting the skin, and the expression \"shaving machines \" is hereinafter used to designate all kinds of shaving machines, including Schick Dry Shavers;\nClause 16 of this agreement provides, inter alia, that, if the Magazine Company should terminate the agreement in accordance with clause 14 thereof, it would assign, transfer and deliver to Schick:\n(1) the entire business or businesses of manufacturing and selling shaving mac] lines then conducted by the Licensee, or any agent of the Licensee, the good will thereof and all trade marks and trade names used exclusively in connection therewith, the exclusive right to use the name of \" Schick \" upon or in connection with shaving machines, and the exclusive right without compensation to use in connection with the manufacture and sale of shaving machines all inventions acquired or controlled by the Licensee, or any agent of the Licensee, which relate directly to shaving machines or machinery or process for the manufacture thereof, and\n(2) all the special machinery and all the tools, jigs and fixtures acquired or controlled by the Licensee, or any agent of the Licensee, and designed or used exclusively for the manufacture of shaving machines or parts thereof, including special machinery, tools, jigs and fixtures adequate for the manufacture of slotted shear plates and cutters for Schick Dry Shavers at the rate of at least five hundred per day. On March 26th, 1930, in accordance with clause 14 of this agreement, the Magazine Company exercised its option to terminate the arrangement provided for by clause 16 and thereby the agreement would cease to operate on July 1st, 1930, as regards shaving machines. Before the expiration of that period, a release and agreement dated May 14th, 1930, was entered into between the parties. By it the sum of $14,000 was paid by the Company to Schick as remuneration for its inability to deliver to him special machinery, tools, jigs and fixtures adequate for the manufacture of slotted shear plates and cutters at the rate of at least five hundred per day. Schick released and discharged the Company from all claims and demands under the agreement of January 1st, 1929, and the Company\nhereby releases and discharges Schick from all claims, demands, obligations and liabilities which now exist or which might at any time exist under said agreement dated January 1, 1929, and the Company further agrees that any and all rights relative to Schick Dry Shavers and shaving machines, including all rights in connection with the machinery or processes for the manufacture thereof, heretofore granted to it by Schick under said agreement dated January 1, 1929, is now terminated and at an end.\nPausing here, for a moment, in the narrative, it is clear that the Magazine Company was under no misapprehension as to what was included in the term \" shaving machines\" and that it had divested itself of all rights relating to them in favour of Schick. As between him and the Magazine Company there could be no question of his right to use his own name as a trade mark as applied to those machines. It is unnecessary to state categorically the proceedings which Schick might be entitled to take against the Company in order to secure the transfer to him of the Company's interest in the Canadian trade mark as applied to shaving machines. The release and agreement is dated May 14th, 1930,\u2014prior to the coming into force of The Unfair Competition Act. The connection between Schick and the respondent company must now be traced.\nOn April 30th, 1930, a company known as Schick Dry Shaver Incorporated had been incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. The fact of this incorporation was known to the Magazine Company, as appears from a letter of August 22nd, 1930, to its Treasurer, written by a Mr. Bonbright, and from the reply thereto, of September 5th, 1930, written by the Secretary of the Company. On October 24th, 1930, Schick entered into an agreement with Schick Dry Shaver Incorporated, assigning his interest in certain letters patent and applications for letters patent in the United States and other countries, relating to shaving machines, and also granted to the Company the sole and exclusive right, throughout the entire world, to own, use and enjoy, and to register in its name, the name \"Schick\" in such form or forms, and with such designs or devices as the Company might from time to time elect, as trade marks and\/or trade names, in connection with shaving machines.\nThe first recorded order for a shaving machine from the United States was received by Schick Dry Shaver Incorporated on October 28th, 1930, and the machine was shipped by the Company on March 18th, 1931. So far as Canada is concerned the first shaving machine was ordered in March, 1931, and shipped in June of that year; 1,944 shaving machines were sold in Canada from 1931 to December, 1933, during which period no machine was made in this country.\nBy agreement dated December 28th, 1933, Schick Dry Shaver Incorporated transferred to Schick Limited, an intervening company incorporated in the Bahamas on November 16 th, 1933, certain letters patent and applications therefore,\u2014presumably those it had acquired from Jacob Schick. No mention is made of trade mark rights in the agreement but the objects of Schick Limited were to manufacture and sell shaving machines and their parts and accessories. As a matter of fact it sold 25,513 machines in Canada from January 1st, 1934, to February, 1936, when it ceased to do business. It has since been wound up and its charter surrendered. The respondent, Schick Shaver Limited, sold 35,359 shaving machines in Canada in 1936, 1937, and down to August 1st, 1938.\nThe rights to manufacture and sell shaving machines and use his own name as a trade mark in connection therewith, being vested in Jacob Schick on May 14th, 1930, under the agreement of that date, it has been shown that Schick transferred all such rights, on October 24th, 1930, to Schick Dry Shaver Incorporated. The result of the evidence indicated above, together with the evidence as to the holdings of the capital stock in the various Schick companies, which need not be detailed, is that Schick Dry Shaver Incorporated transferred all such rights to Schick Limited, and that the latter, in turn, transferred them to Schick Shaver Limited, the respondent. It follows that the respondent is an interested party under section 52 of The Unfair Competition Act, and that it is entitled to the order made by the Exchequer Court amending the registration of the appellants by striking therefrom the words \" shaving machines.\"\nThe appeal is therefore dismissed, the cross-appeal allowed, and the judgment below amended so as to dismiss the action and amend the registration in the manner indicated, with costs throughout.\nTaschereau J.\u2014In March, 1925, Jacob Schick entered into an agreement with Sharp Manufacturing Corporation, whereby in consideration of the assignment by Schick of certain patents on safety razors and blades, the Company agreed to pay Schick $50,000 and an annual royalty. This agreement contained amongst other things:\n* * * and Schick has granted and hereby grants to the Corporation the exclusive right to manufacture, use, offer for sale and sell said safety razor and blades throughout the entire world, and hereby grants to the Corporation all rights to all patents, trade marks, trade names and other privileges relating to said safety razor and blades throughout the entire world, * * *\nLater, on the 1st of May, 1927, the Corporation, then operating under the name of Magazine Repeating Razor Company, and Jacob Schick, modified and supplemented the former agreement of March, 1925, and additional patents relating to razors and blades were assigned to the Company. An important clause of this second agreement is the following:\nSchick agrees that the Corporation may use the name \"Schick\" in connection with the razors, blades and other articles on the sale of which royalties are payable under the provisions of this paragraph IV, and that such razors, blades or other articles may be marked or associated with the name of \"Schick\".\nIt is worth while to note that the right for the Company to use the word \"Schick\" applies only to the razors, blades and other articles on the sale of which royalties are payable. Subsequently, on the 6th of November, 1928, Schick registered and became the owner of new letters patent relating to shaving machines called \" Schick Dry Shavers \" which were not included in the previous agreements. A new agreement was therefore signed by the parties on January 1st, 1929, which embodied the following clauses:\nThe Licensor grants and agrees to grant to the Licensee an exclusive licence to make and sell in the United States, its territories and possessions, during the existence of this agreement, under the name of \"Schick\" shaving machines embodying the inventions described and claimed in said letters patent of the United States and the letters patent which may be issued upon said applications for letters patent of the United States, or any thereof.\n****\nThe Licensee [The Magazine Repeating Razor Company] agrees that if the Licensor [Jacob Schick] shall terminate this agreement in accordance with paragraph 11, paragraph 12 or paragraph 13 hereof, or if the Licensee shall terminate this agreement in accordance with paragraph 14 hereof, the Licensee will assign, transfer and deliver to the Licensor the entire business or businesses of manufacturing and selling shaving machines then conducted by the Licensee, or any agent of the Licensee, the good will thereof and all trade marks and trade names used exclusively in connection therewith, the exclusive right to use the name of \" Schick\" upon or in connection with shaving machines * * *\nThe Magazine Repeating Razor Company gave notice on March 26th, 1930, that the agreement would come to an end, and on the 14th of May, 1930, Schick received the sum of $14,000 and each party released the other from all obligations and claims existing in relation to the Schick Dry Shavers as defined in the agreement of January 1st, 1929.\nAs a result of the execution of this release which embodies the following clause,\n* * * and the Company further agrees that any and all rights relative to Schick Dry Shavers and shaving machines, including all rights in connection with the machinery or processes for the manufacture thereof, heretofore granted to it by Schick under said agreement dated January 1, 1929, is now terminated and at an end.\nthe Company ceased to have any rights relative to Schick Dry Shavers, but its rights on razors and blades governed by the former agreements were still in existence.\nJacob Schick then proceeded to organize a Company called \" Schick Dry Shaver, Inc.\" to which he assigned his rights on the 24th of October, 1930, and later Schick Shaver Limited, the respondent, acquired these same rights. The defendant proceeded to manufacture shaving machines, using the word \"Schick\", which had formerly been registered as a trade mark by the appellants on the 3rd day of August, 1927. The registration included: safety razors of all kinds, mechanical, automatic and magazine razors, shaving machines, razor blades, etc., etc. The appellants then took action for infringement of their statutory rights under the Unfair Competitions Act, 1932, and claimed an injunction to restrain the defendant from infringing the plaintiffs' trade mark and from selling, distributing or advertising in Canada any manufactured razors or shaving machines not of the plaintiffs' manufacture in association with the word \" Schick \", or any other word so similar to the trade mark \" Schick \" as to be calculated to cause confusion. They also claimed damages in the sum of $100,000. This action was dismissed by Mr. Justice Maclean and this is an appeal from that judgment.\nThe recital of the various agreements shows that originally in 1925 and 1927, Jacob Schick assigned to the appellants patents for razor and blades and the right to use the word \" Schick \", but only for the sale of these articles on which a royalty was payable. However, the appellants registered the word \" Schick \" as a trade mark and this registration covered razors, blades and shaving machines. It was only on the 6th of November, 1928, that \" Schick Dry Shavers\" were patented by Schick and could not therefore have been transferred in 1925 nor in 1927. It was by the agreement of January 1st, 1929, that the appellants acquired rights on these patents and the right to use the word \" Schick \" in respect of the sale of these machines. This agreement of January, 1929, came to an end by mutual consent, and the release signed by the parties on the 14th of May, 1930, covered this last agreement only and, consequently, the rights to manufacture these shaving machines and to use the word \" Schick \" reverted to the respondent. The appellants remained the owners of the patents affecting razors, which are quite different from the dry shavers, and have the right to use the word \" Schick \" only for the sale of the former.\nThe registration of August 3rd, 1927, in so far as it covers shaving machines is irregular, and I am of the opinion that Maclean, J., was right in ordering that the registration of the trade mark \" Schick\" made at folio 42001 be amended by striking therefrom the words: \"shaving machines\". I believe also that the judgment below should, be varied to allow the respondent to use the word \"Schick\" in association with the manufacture and sale of its shaving machines without restriction.\nAppeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Smart & Biggar.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ralston, Kearney & Duquet.\n[1] [1939] Ex.C.R. 108; [1939] 2 D.L.R. 17.\n[2] (1938) 55 R.P.C. 125.\n[3] (1885) 55 L.J.

Dominion Bridge Co. Ltd., [1940] S.C.R. 487\nDate: 1940-04-23\nHis Majesty the King (Respondent) Appellant;\nand\nDominion Bridge Company Limited (Suppliant) Respondent.\n1940: Feb. 29; Apr. 23.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Davis, Hudson and Taschereau JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nRevenue\u2014Sales tax\u2014Petition of right to recover money paid to the Crown for sales tax\u2014Goods sold and delivered\u2014Special War Revenue Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 179, secs. 86, 87, 87 (d), 105.\nBy certain contracts entered into between the suppliant and His Majesty the King, represented by the Minister of Public Works for the province of Quebec, the suppliant undertook to erect the structural steel superstructure of three bridges in that province, in consideration of the sums set out in each contract. The suppliant erected the three bridges and was paid according to the contracts. In respect of the materials incorporated in the bridges, suppliant was assessed for sales tax, alleged due under the terms of the Special War Revenue Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 17 and amendments. It paid under protest a proportion of the amounts so assessed to the Commissioner of Excise. The suppliant then claimed by way of a petition of right before the Exchequer Court of Canada a return of the moneys so paid on the grounds that no tax was payable by it in respect of the materials supplied in virtue of the contracts or, alternatively, that, if the materials were taxable, suppliant was entitled to a refund by reason of the fact that the materials were sold, if sold at all, to His Majesty the King in the right of the province of Quebec.\nHeld, that the above transaction between the suppliant and the Crown in right of the province of Quebec must, by force of section 87 (d) of the Special War Revenue Act, be deemed to be a sale and that the suppliant was rightly chargeable accordingly for a sales tax. (The King v. Fraser Companies, [1931] S.C.R. 490 applied); but\nHeld, also, that the suppliant was entitled to a refund of the money paid to the Crown appellant, pursuant to s. 105 of The Special War Revenue Act. The \" transaction\" in this case involved translation of the property in the goods to the provincial government, and, taking the provisions of sections 86 and 87 into account as a whole, such transaction must be deemed to fall within section 105. \"Goods\" are \" sold \" within the meaning of that section when there is a sale that is such solely by force of the statutory declaration that at shall be deemed to be a sale for the purposes of the statute. Section 105 is part of the statute and transactions within the declaration are, therefore, deemed to be sales for the purposes of the section.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1939] Ex. C.R. 235) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Angers J.,[1] holding that the suppliant (the present respondent) was entitled to a refund of a sum of $1,503 paid by it to the Crown (now appellant) on account of sales tax assessed against it under the Special War Revenue Act.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. for the appellant.\nL. A. Forsyth K.C. and J. de M. Marler for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The contract in this case was a contract for building the superstructure of a bridge and the erection of it and the securing of it; and the contract price was an entire price for the entire job. It was not, in the ordinary sense of the words, a contract, I think, for the sale of the superstructure or for the sale of the members of the superstructure. The production, however, of the members of the superstructure for the purpose of fulfilling the contract would bring the case within section 87 (d) (Special War Revenue Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 179 and amendments).\nIn The King v. Fraser Companies[2], four judges of this Court (Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.) expressed the view touching the application of section 87 (d) to the facts of that case which, I think, applies here. In the judgment of those learned judges, delivered by Smith J., it is said (p. 493):\n* * * it is not unusual for a manufacturer engaged in the production and manufacture of lumber for sale to engage at the same time in the business of a, building contractor. He manufactures his lumber for sale, and, as a general rule, would not manufacture any specific lumber for use in connection with his building contracts, but would simply take lumber for these purposes from the general stock manufactured for sale, and might thus, under the view taken in the court below, escape taxation on all lumber thus diverted from the general stock manufactured for sale.\nI am of the opinion that, construing the provisions of the Act as a whole, the respondent is liable for taxes on the lumber consumed by him, as claimed.\nThis passage in the reasons of my brother Smith was not part of the ratio decidendi but it was the considered opinion of the four judges who constituted the majority of the Court. They said that, if a building contractor is also a manufacturer of building material, lumber or brick for example, and uses, for the purpose of executing a building contract, brick or lumber produced by himself, that is a case within section 87 (d) and the transaction is, by force of that section, deemed to be a sale and he is chargeable accordingly. In the present case the members of the bridge produced were produced specially for the purposes of the cor tract.\nI have fully considered. the able argument addressed to us by Mr, Forsyth and my conclusion is that, when sections 86 and 87 are read together, this transaction falls within the category of cases described by section 87 (d), and that the view expressed by my brother Smith in Fraser's case[3] is the view which ought to govern us in the disposition of this appeal. I think, in this respect, the practice of the Department is right.\nThen comes the question, the real question I think on the appeal, whether in such circumstances section 105 applies. Section 105 is in these words:\n105. A refund of 'the amount of taxes paid under Parts X, XI, XII and XIII of this Act may be granted to a manufacturer, producer, wholesaler, jobber or other dealer on goods sold to His Majesty in the right of the Government of any province of Canada, if the said goods are purchased by His Majesty, for any purpose other than purposes of resale or of any railway, commission, board or public utility which is operated by or under the authority of the Legislature or the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of the province. The question to be decided is not without difficulty. I have come to the conclusion that \" goods\" are \" sold\" within the meaning of this section when there is a sale that is such solely by force of the statutory declaration that it shall be deemed to be a sale for the purposes of the statute. Section 105 is part of the statute and transactions within the declaration are, therefore, deemed to be sales for the purposes of the section. A transaction within section 87 (2), for example, would, if the other conditions were fulfilled, be a sale within section 105.\nMr. Varcoe's argument is that here, while the transaction (the production of the goods in question for the use of the producer in fulfilling this contract) is deemed to be a sale by force of the statute, the goods produced are not \" sold \" to the provincial government. This argument has force and I have given it attentive consideration. The \" use \" of these goods for the purposes of the respondents in fulfilling the contract involves a translation of the property in them to the provincial government by force of the contract under which the entire consideration for the whole work is payable by the provincial government to the respondents.\nOur duty, as Lord Hailsham said in Dominion Press v. Minister of Customs[4], is to ascertain whether the goods are \" sold \" to the provincial government within the meaning of those words as employed in the statute. I think, in view of the fact mentioned, that the \" transaction \" involves translation of the property in the goods to the provincial government, the proper view, when the provisions of sections 86 and 87 are taken into account as a whole, is that it falls within section 105.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. Stuart Edwards.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Montgomery, McMichael, Common & Howard.\n[1] [1939] Ex. C.R. 235.\n[2] [1931] S.C.R. 490.\n[3] [1931] S.C.R. 490.\n[4] [1928] A.C. 340 at 342.\n"

The King1, that the Committee is regarded in the Act as a judicial body or Court, though all it can do is to report or recommend to His Majesty in Council, by whom alone the Order in Council which is made to give effect to the report of the Committee is made.\nBut according to constitutional convention it is unknown and unthinkable that His Majesty in Council should not give effect to the report of the Judicial Committee, who are thus in truth an appellate Court of Law, to which by the statute of 1833 all appeals within their purview are referred.\nThe Bill referred to us purports to enact that the Supreme Court of Canada shall have, hold and exercise exclusive, ultimate, appellate jurisdiction, civil and criminal, in and for Canada; and, for the purpose of giving effect to this enactment, it is in substance provided that the jurisdiction of His Majesty in Council and of the Judicial Committee to hear appeals from Canadian Courts is abrogated.\nThe consideration of the questions raised involves an examination of the authority of the Parliament of Canada under section 101 of the British North America Act as well as its authority under its general powers to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada.\nThe authority last mentioned, to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada is, by the express provisions of the Confederation Act of 1867, affected by only two limitations; first, it does not extend to matters assigned exclusively to the legislature of the provinces, a limitation which still persists notwithstanding the enactments of the Statute of Westminster; and, second, by section 129, it did not authorize the repeal, abolition or alteration of any law in force in the federated provinces or of any legal commission, power or authority existing therein, enacted by or existing under any Act of the Imperial Parliament, a limitation now, since the enactment of the Statute of Westminster, no longer in force.\nSection 101 is expressed in absolute terms and by it,\nThe Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, from time to time, provide for the constitution, maintenance, and organization of a general court of appeal for Canada, and for the establishment of any additional courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada.\nWhether the second of the above mentioned limitations formerly affected the authority of Parliament under section 101 is of little, if any, importance since the statute of Westminster. I shall advert to the point later. I turn first to the general powers of Parliament respecting peace, order and good government. It is, I think, not wholly irrelevant to notice the nature of the sovereignty which the Parliament of Canada has been conceived to possess (within, at all events, the territorial limits of Canada) and has actually exercised since the earliest times of Confederation. Under the authority of section 146 of the British North America Act, the territories comprised within Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territories (to the north and west of the federated provinces) were (June, 1870) admitted into the Union. Already, in May, 1870, the Parliament of Canada had (acting under its general law making authority) provided for the establishment (to take effect upon the admission of those territories) of the province of Manitoba, for a constitution for the province including an executive authority exercisable in that province by a Lieutenant-Governor, parliamentary institutions with legislative authority respecting (inter alia) the administration of justice, taxation, municipal institutions, property and civil rights virtually identical with the authority granted to the original provinces under section 92. For more than thirty years thereafter, the territory west of Manitoba, extending to the Rocky Mountains, now within the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, was governed under statutes of the Parliament of Canada which provided for executive authority vested in a Lieutenant-Governor, a legislative assembly with large legislative powers, for taxation, for the administration of justice and for courts of judicature. In 1905, by other statutes of Canada, the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were established with constitutions similar to that of Manitoba.\nTrue, it is, that, by the British North America Act of 1871, it was recited that doubts had been expressed as to the authority of Parliament to enact the Manitoba Act; but by the Act of 1871 the Manitoba Act was declared to have been validly enacted and the power to erect provinces and provide constitutions for them was explicitly vested in Parliament together with unqualified authority to legislate for the peace, order and good government of the territories not included in any province.\nIt would, indeed, be singular if the enactments of a legislature, charged with such responsibilities, responsibilities of the very highest political nature, should be interpreted and applied in a narrow and technical spirit or in a spirit of jealous apprehension as to the possible consequences of a large and liberal interpretation of them.\nThe question whether the Bill falls within the ambit of the powers of Parliament under the authority to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada must be answered in the affirmative unless the subject-matter of the Bill is in whole or in part, in the words of section 91, a matter \"coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\" The main contention against the validity of the Bill on this branch of the argument is founded on clause 14 of section 92, which is in these words:\n92. In each province the legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated; that is to say,\u2014\n* * *\n(14) The administration of justice in the province, including the constitution, maintenance, and organization of provincial courts, both of civil and of criminal jurisdiction, and including procedure in civil matters in those courts.\nSo far as concerns this contention, the subject-matter of this Bill in its substance is found in sections 2 and 3 which profess to abrogate the jurisdiction of His Majesty in respect of appeals from the courts of Canada and the statutory jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee to hear and report upon such appeals under the statutes of 1833 and 1844. I repeat, I am at the moment addressing my attention only to the prerogative appeal.\nThe members of His Majesty's Privy Council, as everybody knows, are nominated by the King on the advice of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (Anson, Vol. II, Part I, p. 153). The Judicial Committee is, as was observed in the judgment mentioned above (British Coal Corporation v. The King2, a statutory appellate Court established and exercising jurisdiction as a court of justice under statutes of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\nThe Court (the Judicial Committee) exists and exercises its jurisdiction under authority derived from the Parliament of the United Kingdom and its members are Privy Councillors who are nominated by statute in virtue of holding, or having held, specified high judicial offices in England or Scotland or are appointed by Order in Council pursuant to statutory authority. The constitution and organization of the Court in every respect is exclusively subject to the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\nThe constitution of the Judicial Committee is not, I think, without importance in its bearing upon the point I am now to consider; whether, namely, the subject-matter of the Bill referred to us in whole or in part falls within the category of matters defined by clause 14 of section 92.\nFirst of all, it is obvious that the Judicial Committee is not a provincial court within the sense of that clause, it being self evident that the phrase denotes courts which, as to their jurisdiction are primarily subjects of provincial legislation and whose process in civil matters, save in certain exceptional cases which will be adverted to, does not run beyond the limits of the province. No legislature in Canada has, of course, anything to say about the constitution of the Judicial Committee or about its organization. Provision for all such matters is, as I have said, made by the legislature of the United Kingdom and orders in council pursuant to authority derived therefrom.\nThe argument is, however, put in this way. Decisions of the provincial courts are subject to be reversed or varied, it is said, under prevailing law, by the decisions of the Judicial Committee and the orders of His Majesty in Council; and this appellate jurisdiction includes the subsidiary power to make such orders and give such directions as the appellate tribunal may consider just and convenient for the purpose of giving effect to such decisions: and the court appealed from may be required by its own process and its own officers to carry out such orders.\nIt is contended that legislation which abrogates this jurisdiction so to intervene in and ordain the course of proceedings in provincial courts is legislation in relation to the jurisdiction of such courts.\nI cannot agree with this view for two reasons. First, while it would, perhaps, not be an abuse of language to say that this jurisdiction of His Majesty in Council, by which he is enabled, for the purpose of giving effect to adjudications in prerogative appeals, to make orders requiring the court appealed from to carry out such adjudications is a jurisdiction which affects the jurisdiction of the Court from which the appeal lies, it is, nevertheless, quite another thing to say that this jurisdiction or power of His Majesty's is a matter within the definition of clause 14 so that legislation to abrogate that jurisdiction is legislation \"in relation to\" provincial courts within the meaning of clause 14. I am unable to convince myself that such legislation would in its \"pith and substance\" be legislation \"in relation to\" the \"constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts\" or \"procedure in those courts in civil matters.\" Its true subject matter would be the appellate jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee.\nMy second reason really involves a consideration of the alternative argument based upon clause 14. The general subject of clause 14 is \"the administration of justice in the province.\" It is argued that the scope of these words must not be restricted by reason of the specific designation of provincial courts and matters connected therewith, as included in the general subject, and it is said interposition in proceedings in provincial courts in the manner just alluded to constitutes an intervention in the administration of justice and that the orders in council by which this is effected are truly acts done in \"the administration of justice in the province\"; and that legislation abrogating the jurisdiction from which they emanate is consequently legislation \"in relation to\" that subject.\nSomething must be said at this point as to the essence of the prerogative appeal which the Bill before us purports to abrogate. The judgment of the Judicial Committee in Nadan v. The King3 (as interpreted in British Coal Corporation v. The King)4 requires us to hold that any legislation intended to abrogate the prerogative appeal must, if it is to be effective, be \"extra-territorial in its operation\"; that the legislative powers vested in the Parliament of Canada under the enumerated clauses of section 91 did not, before the Statute of Westminster, enable that legislature to annul the prerogative right of the King in Council to grant leave to appeal because, however widely such powers are construed, they are confined to \"action taken in Canada\"; and it would, indeed, appear that the central governing act in the appeal to the Judicial Committee is the decision. If there is authority in the Court as an appellate court to pronounce an effective decision, it is because such is the law that governs, not the appellate tribunal alone, but the inhabitants of Canada and the courts in Canada which carry out the decision. To say that the authority to adjudicate exists without the authority to make the adjudication effective in Canada would seem to be a self-contradictory statement; and you cannot get rid of this authority unless you are endowed, it was held in Nadan v. The King5, with extra-territorial powers which the Parliament of Canada did not in 1926 possess.\nTo return to section 92(14). The legislative powers of the provinces are strictly confined in their ambit by the territorial limits of the provinces. The matters to which that authority extends are matters which are local in the provincial sense. This principle was stated in two passages in the judgment in the Local Option case6 delivered by Lord Watson speaking for a very powerful Board at pp. 359 and 365, respectively. I quote them:\n* * * the concluding part of s. 91 enacts that\n\"any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\"\nIt was observed by this Board in Citizens' Insurance Co. of Canada v. Parsons7 that the paragraph just quoted \"applies in its grammatical construction only to No. 16 of s. 92.\" The observation was not material to the question arising in that case, and it does not appear to their Lordships to be strictly accurate. It appears to them that the language of the exception in s. 91 was meant to include and correctly describes all the matters enumerated in the sixteen heads of s. 92, as being, from a provincial point of view, of a local or private nature.\n* * *\nIt is not necessary for the purposes of the present appeal to determine whether provincial legislation for the suppression of the liquor traffic, confined to matters which are provincial or local within the meaning of Nos. 13 and 16, is authorized by the one or by the other of these heads. It cannot, in their Lordships' opinion, be logically held to fall within both of them. In s. 92, No. 16 appears to them to have the same office which the general enactment with respect to matters concerning the peace, order and good government of Canada, so far as supplementary of the enumerated subjects, fulfils in s. 91. It assigns to the provincial legislature all matters in a provincial sense local or private which have been omitted from the preceding enumeration, and, although its terms are wide enough to cover, they were obviously not meant to include, provincial legislation in relation to the classes of subjects already enumerated\nThe legislation of the provinces under all the heads of section 92 is, by law, confined to matters which are local \"in the provincial sense.\" In the Royal Bank of Canada v. Rex8 a statute of Alberta was held, in conformity with this principle, to be invalid and beyond the powers of the legislature.\ninasmuch as what was sought to be enacted was neither confined to property and civil rights within the province nor directed solely to matters of merely local or private nature within it.\nThe subject-matter in question was beyond the powers of the province as the Judicial Committee held, because the legislation dealt with an interest of some of the parties in a deposit in the Bank of Montreal carried on its books at Edmonton which was in the nature of an equitable debt having a constructive situs at the head office of the bank which was outside the province. The principle has been applied also in Provincial Treasurer v. Kerr9, in Bonanza Creek v. The King10 and in other cases; and, indeed, in all the clauses of section 92, with the exception of clause 3, the territorial restriction is expressed or implied.\nConstruing clause 14 in light of the general principle stated as above by the Judicial Committee in the Local Option case11, I am unable to accede to the proposition that the jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee and of His Majesty in Council in respect of prerogative appeals from a province belongs to the field described by the words \"administration of justice in the province\" as a local matter in the sense of that principle. Indeed, I think we are bound by the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Nadan v. The King12 as interpreted by the British Coal Corporation v. The King13, to hold that legislation intended to prevent the exercise of the prerogative in relation to the judgments of Canadian courts is not legislation in relation to a local matter in that sense.\nAn argument was based upon clause 13 of section 92 \"property and civil rights.\" With great respect to those who take a different view, I am unable to agree that clause 13 is pertinent. The subject-matter of administration of justice including jurisdiction of provincial courts is specifically dealt with in clause 14 and, if the particular matter with which we are now concerned does not fall within the ambit of clause 14, then I think it must be taken to be excluded from the general clause 13 as well as the residuary clause, 16. That is a principle which has been acted upon more than once in the construction of the clauses of section 92 as well as those of section 91. In the case of section 92 it was applied in determining the scope and effect of clause 11, \"the incorporation of companies with provincial objects.\" This clause was the subject of a great deal of controversy until its effect was finally settled by the judgment of the Privy Council in Bonanza Creek v. The King14; a controversy which would have been quite pointless if, for the purpose of ascertaining the powers of the provinces in relation to the incorporation of companies, you could properly resort to clause 13. The Dominion authority in respect of the incorporation of companies under its powers in relation to peace, order and good government rests upon the limitation imposed upon the provincial power by the language of section 11. If the provinces were entitled to invoke the general authority of clause 13 in order to fill up the gap created by the limiting words of clause 11, the reasoning upon which the Dominion authority rests under the residuary powers under section 91 would be deprived of its foundation; and, indeed, as Lord Haldane says in John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton15 if that were a legitimate procedure \"the limitation in clause 11 would be nugatory.\"\nNor is the contention advanced by calling in aid the residuary clause (No. 16). That clause, as the Judicial Committee says in the passages already quoted, serves the purpose of supplementing the preceding enumerated clauses and includes \"matters of a merely local or private nature within the province\" not included in the preceding clauses. These words, as the judgment declares, are \"wide enough to cover\" all matters embraced within the preceding clauses, all of which, it also declares, are correctly described by the words of section 91 as \"matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\" Whatever ancillary powers the provinces may possess in virtue of section 92 (16) they can only be ancillary to the local matters comprised in the preceding clauses as therein defined and they can only be exercised in relation to \"matters of a merely local or private nature within the province.\"\nAs regards clause 1 of section 92, which is also relied upon, the exception \"the office of Lieutenant-Governor\" points to the subject-matter and the scope of the clause. The term \"provincial constitution\" is employed as the heading of Title V. That title deals with the Executive Government of the provinces, with constitution of their legislative institutions and very largely with appointments to Legislative Councils and elections to Legislative Assemblies. The heading of Title V may be contrasted with that of Title VI, \"Distribution of Legislative Powers.\" There is nothing in the enactments of the earlier title supporting the contention that clause 1 of section 92 can be read as enlarging the authority of the legislature under the other clauses of that section, or as freeing the legislature from the restrictions imposed by those clauses.\nI now come to section 101. That section has two branches, one which deals with a general court of appeal for Canada, while the other relates to the establishment of additional courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada. The phrase \"laws of Canada\" here embraces any law \"in relation to some subject-matter, legislation in regard to which is within the legislative competence of the Dominion\" (Consolidated Distilleries v. The King)16.\nIt may be added that it has been held to give authority to Parliament in relation to the jurisdiction of provincial courts; and to impose on such courts judicial duties in respect of matters within the exclusive competence of Parliament: insolvency (Cushing v. Dupuy)17; in election petitions (Valin v. Langlois)18. Furthermore, the general jurisdiction of Parliament in relation to peace, order and good government has been exercised in imposing duties on provincial courts in relation of appeals from the courts of territories not within the limits of the provinces. Examples are: the appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench for Manitoba from the court of the North-West Territories (Riel v. The Queen)19; and the appeal from the courts of the Yukon to the Supreme Court of British Columbia (McDonald v. Belcher)20.\nAs respects the general court of appeal, the authority is \"notwithstanding anything in this Act, from time to time\" to- make provision \"for the constitution, maintenance, and organization of a general court of appeal for Canada.\" And the question for determination is whether this enactment imports an ambit of legislative authority that embraces the power to endow the court constituted under it with \"ultimate and exclusive\" jurisdiction in respect of appeals from provincial courts.\nPrima facie, the authority is to make legislative provision for a court which shall have general authority as a court of appeal for Canada; and to provide for the constitution and organization of that court. This necessarily involves the power to subject every court of judicature or of public justice to the appellate jurisdiction of the court so to be constituted.\nThe section, until it is acted upon by Parliament, subtracts nothing from the legislative authority of the provinces. It subtracts nothing from any judicial authority exercisable in the Dominion. But when the Court is constituted and its jurisdiction and powers are defined by Dominion legislation, such legislation takes effect according to its scope and purport notwithstanding anything in the Confederation Act or anything done under that Act. Therefore, it is within the ambit of the legislative authority conferred by this section to define the cases in which, and the conditions under which, the appellate jurisdiction may be invoked, the powers of the court in respect of the judgments and orders it may pronounce, to provide for making such judgments and orders effective, and for that purpose to require the court appealed from to give effect to such judgments and orders according to their tenor.\nIn other words, it is competent to Parliament to give jurisdiction to entertain an appeal in any and every case in which it thinks fit to do so, and also to confer the correlative right of appeal in such cases and in any and every case to require the court appealed from to carry out any judgment pronounced upon the appeal. This, it appears to me, is involved, without qualification, in the very words of the section.\nAre you then to imply a constitutional exception imperatively exempting from the operation of legislation under the section judgments or decisions from which, by the existing law, appeal may be taken or may have been taken to the Judicial Committee?\nIt is of the first importance, I think, to notice that in ascertaining what powers are derived from the section, you are to give effect to its language \"notwithstanding anything in this Act.\"\nI think, since the Statute of Westminster, I cannot, without disregarding the reports of the Imperial Conferences recited therein, imply such a qualification. On the contrary, the governing object of section 101 being to invest the Parliament of Canada with legislative authority to endow a court of appeal for Canada with general appellate jurisdiction over all courts in Canada, and all persons concerned in proceedings in those courts, and with power to give complete effect to the judgments of that court,\u2014 such being the general object of the enactment, all subsidiary powers must, especially in view of the phrase just mentioned, be implied to enable Parliament to legislate effectively for that object.\nThree considerations seem to me to be decisive:\n(a) Since this legislative authority may be executed in Canada \"notwithstanding anything in this Act,\" you cannot imply any restriction of power because of anything in section 92. Assuming even that section 92 gives some authority to the legislatures in respect of appeals to the Privy Council, that cannot detract from the power of Parliament under section 101. Whatever is granted by the words of the section, read and applied as prima facie intended to endow Parliament with power to effect high political objects concerning the self government of the Dominion (section 3 of the B.N.A. Act) in the matter of judicature, is to be held and exercised as a plenary power in that behalf with all ancillary powers necessary to enable Parliament to attain its objects fully and completely. So read it imports authority to establish a court having supreme and final appellate jurisdiction in Canada;\n(b) Since, in virtue of the words of section 101, Parliament may legislate for objects within the ambit of section 101 regardless of any powers the provinces may possess to affect appeals to the Judicial Committee, it follows that the general power of Parliament to make provision for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to such objects is in no way limited by the exception of \"local matters\" assigned exclusively by the introductory words of section 91 to the legislatures of the provinces; and, consequently, no existing judicial authority competent to affect the course of judicature in Canada can be an obstacle precluding the Parliament of Canada from making its legislation relating to these objects effective;\n(c) Having regard to the reports of the Imperial Conferences recited in the Statute of Westminster, to the provisions of that statute, and to the terms of section 101, you cannot properly read anything in the Statute of Westminster or in the B.N.A. Act as precluding Parliament, for the purpose of effecting its objects within the ambit of that section from excluding from Canada the exercise of jurisdiction by a tribunal constituted, organized and exercising jurisdiction under the exclusive authority of another member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.\nThe exercise of such jurisdiction for Canada by a tribunal exclusively subject to the legislation of another member of the Commonwealth is not a subject which can properly be described (as subject matter of legislative authority) as a matter merely local or private within a province. And again, the power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to matters within section 101 being without restriction, the power of Parliament in such matter is, as I have said more than once, paramount. In truth, the point seems to be governed by the decision in the Aeronautics Reference21 as well as by the decision in the Radio Reference22. The primacy of Parliament under section 101 is just as absolute as under the enumerated clauses of section 91.\nAs to appeals from the Supreme Court of Canada, or from any additional courts established under section 101. it ought, perhaps, to be noticed that since the provinces can have no jurisdiction respecting them, they obviously fall within the ambit of the general power in relation to peace, order and good government.\nSecond, I come to the appeal as of right, so called.\nBefore this topic is discussed, it is advisable, I think, to refer to the contention that His Majesty's prerogative in relation to appeals was merged in the statutory powers of the Judicial Committee under. the Judicial Committee Acts of 1833 and 1844. I should have thought it more accurate to say that this legislation affirmed and regulated the exercise of His Majesty's prerogative power in relation to appeals. The appeal is still an appeal to His Majesty in Council though in point of substance (British Coal Corporation's case23, the appellate jurisdiction is now exercised by the statutory court of the Judicial Committee, and I should have thought it resulted from the terms of section 92 of the British North America Act and the judgments in Nadan v. The King24 and in the British Coal Corporation v. The King23 that before the enactment of the Statute of Westminster neither the Parliament of Canada, nor the legislature of a province, could subtract from or add to His Majesty's prerogative as exercised by the Judicial Committee or, to put it another way, to the jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee.\nWe have to consider the legislation of Ontario and Quebec touching this subject, the appeal as of right, the orders in council affecting the other provinces, except British Columbia, and the rather special position of British Columbia.\nAs to Ontario and Quebec, the statutory provisions with which we are concerned were first enacted by the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada in professed exercise of authority conferred by the Constitutional Act of 1791; they were continued in force in the province of Canada by section 46 of the Act of Union of 1840 and are still in force under the authority of section 129 of the British North America Act.\nTo begin with Ontario and Quebec. The legislation in force was considered by the Judicial Committee in the year 1880 in Cushing v. Dupuy25. The appeal was from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench of the province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of a judge of the Superior Court in certain proceedings in insolvency instituted under an Act of the Parliament of Canada entitled An Act respecting Insolvency (38 Vict., c. 16). An application to the Court of Queen's Bench for leave to appeal to His Majesty in Council was refused on the ground that under the Insolvency Act its judgment was final. Article 1178 of the Code of Civil Procedure of 1867 in so far as relevant is in these words:\n1178. An appeal lies to Her Majesty in the Privy Council from final judgments rendered in appeal or error by the Court of Queen's Bench:\u2014\n1. In all cases where the matter in dispute relates to any fee of office, duty, rents, revenue, or any sum of money payable to her Majesty;\n2. In cases concerning titles to lands or tenements, annual rents and other matters by which the rights in future of parties may be affected;\n3. In all other cases wherein the matter in dispute exceeds the sum or value of five hundred pounds sterling.\nThe corresponding Ontario enactment is to the same effect except as to the pecuniary limit and as to another point to which reference will be made.\nThe effect of the Insolvency Act in declaring the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench to be final in insolvency proceedings was held to preclude any appeal under article 1178 if valid; and it was also held that legislation precluding such appeal could be validly enacted in respect of insolvency proceedings by the Parliament of Canada under the authority of section 91 (21) relating to Bankruptcy and Insolvency unless it infringed the Queen's prerogative.\nIt was held that such an enactment would not \"infringe the prerogative\" for the reason that\nsince it only provides that the appeal to Her Majesty given by the Code framed under the authority of the Provincial Legislature as part of the civil procedure of the province shall not be applicable in the new proceedings in insolvency which the Dominion Act creates, such a provision in no way trenches on the Royal prerogative.\nThe judgment is important, first, since it characterizes the article of the code as a provision enacted under the authority of the provincial legislature \"as part of the civil procedure of the province.\" Second, that the legislature of the Dominion, in legislating upon a subject within its powers, could remove proceedings under that legislation from the operation of this provision and that in doing so it was in no way trenching on the Royal prerogative.\nIt ought also to be added as of equal importance that, the Judicial Committee having held the Court of Queen's Bench to be right in refusing to admit the appeal, it follows in point of law that there was no appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench which the Parliament of Canada could not declare inadmissible in insolvency proceedings without infringing Her Majesty's prerogative.\nNow, it is quite plain that, neither in 1867 nor in 1875 (it is conclusively settled by Nadan v. The King26, as interpreted by the British Coal Corporation's case)27, neither the legislature of a province nor the Parliament of Canada could enact laws binding upon His Majesty respecting his appellate jurisdiction. We must, consequently, hold that this provincial legislation does not, and cannot, be legislation upon the subject of His Majesty's jurisdiction.\nIt is legislation in relation to procedure in the provincial courts giving directions to such courts as to proceedings that may be taken in them in respect of appeals to His Majesty.\nThe same considerations apply to Ontario.\nIf the Royal Proclamation of 1763 had the effect of creating jurisdiction then we are bound to hold under the authorities mentioned that no legislature in Canada had, prior to the Statute of Westminster, authority to abrogate that jurisdiction and the powers of the provinces have not, as explained above, been since enlarged because such jurisdiction is not a local matter within section 92. The same considerations apply to British Columbia in so far as regards the statute of 1858. The order in council of 1856 must, I think, be taken to have been passed under the authority of the Judicial Committee Act of 1844; and the orders in council of that character I am now to consider.\nThe provinces, other than Ontario and Quebec, are governed in respect of the appeal as of right by orders in council under the statute of 1844. These orders in council merely regulate the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee; but, for the reasons given, no province can be competent to abrogate them in so far as the jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee would be thereby impaired; and it is only with this jurisdiction that we are concerned, because jurisdiction is the subject matter of this Bill. In truth, it would appear that the orders in council and the legislation of Ontario and Quebec assume the existence of the jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee. The Bill before us professes to take away that jurisdiction. The power of Parliament even under the introductory clause of section 91 in respect of that subject does not conflict with any authority of the provinces in relation to procedure in the provincial courts which postulates the existence of the jurisdiction.\nThe statute of Ontario professes to declare that, except in the cases specified, no appeal shall lie to His Majesty in his Privy Council. If the subject matter of this enactment really is the jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee then it is invalid. Probably, it ought to be read as a declaration that the rights given under the statute, whatever they may be, apply only in the cases specified.\nTo sum up with regard to the appeal as of right. In respect of that appeal, in so far as we are concerned with His Majesty's prerogative or the jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee, what I have said applies to the appeal as of right as well as to the prerogative appeal; and, I repeat, we are concerned here only with legislation abrogating the prerogative as regards Canada and with legislation abrogating the jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee as regards Canada. If such legislation is not within the ambit of the powers given to the provinces, or is within the ambit of the powers of the Dominion in respect of objects contemplated by section 101, then the Bill is valid. I have proceeded thus far without any reference to the judgment of their Lordships of the Judicial Committee in the British Coal Corporation v. The King28. I cannot satisfy myself whether or not their Lordships intended to express a final view that the appeal as of right is, from the provincial point of view, a local matter assigned to the provinces for legislative action by section 92. As far as I can see, that particular point did not arise for decision or for examination in that case.\nWe have been obliged to say in some cases, and have said with the approval of the Judicial Committee, that observations forming no part of the ratio decidendi in judgments of the Judicial Committee do not necessarily acquit us of the responsibility of deciding for ourselves on the point dealt with (Dominion of Canada v. Province of Ontario)29. For my own part, if I were satisfied their Lordships had really intended to express an opinion upon the point new before us I should regard that as conclusive for the purposes of this reference; but I am not satisfied they did, and I am inclined to think they did not. In these circumstances it is my duty to form an opinion upon the point. I should add that their Lordships expressed no opinion as to the effect of section 101 and, apparently, did not consider it.\nI return now to a point as to the effect of section 129 of the British North America Act already alluded to. Their Lordships in the British Coal Corporation's case30 say that before the Statute of Westminster the Dominion legislature was subject, in legislating under section 91, to the limitations imposed not only by the Colonial Laws Validity Act, but also by section 120 of the British North America Act. I do not know that the point is now of any practical importance, but if it has not been finally decided, I venture to suggest, as regards section 101, that \"notwithstanding anything in this Act\" includes within its purview every part of section 129 as well as all the other sections of the Act.\nMy opinion, therefore, is:\nFirst, that since, by the Statute of Westminster, the obstacles have been removed which prevented the Parliament of Canada giving full effect to legislation for objects within its powers affecting the appeal to His Majesty in Council, there is now full authority under the powers of Parliament in relation to the peace, order and good government of Canada in respect of the objects within the purview of section 101 to enact the Bill in question.\nSecondly, that neither the prerogative power of His Majesty to admit appeals from Canadian courts, nor the exercise of that power in admitting such appeals, nor the jurisdiction of the statutory tribunal, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in respect of such appeals, or in respect of appeals as of right, is subject matter for the legislative jurisdiction of the provinces as comprised within the local matters assigned to the legislatures by section 92, and all such matters are, therefore, within the general authority in relation to peace, order and good government.\nThe answer to the interrogatory addressed to us by His Excellency in Council is that the Bill mentioned in the question is intra vires of the Parliament of Canada in its entirety.\nRinfret J.\u2014The question referred to this Court is as follows:\nIs said Bill 9, entitled \"An Act to amend the Supreme Court Act,\" or any of the provisions thereof, and in what particular or particulars, or to what extent, intra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe object and intent of Bill 9 is to amend the Supreme Court Act so that the Supreme Court shall have, hold and exercise \"exclusive, ultimate\" appellate civil and criminal jurisdiction within and for Canada, and that its judgments shall in all cases be final and conclusive.\nMy opinion is that the question should be answered in the affirmative, as to all the provisions of the Bill; and I base that opinion upon the following reasons:\nIt has been repeatedly laid down by the Judicial Committee adjudicating upon the powers conferred by the British North America Act, that\nthe powers distributed between the Dominion on the one hand and the provinces on the other hand cover the whole area of self-government within the whole area of Canada and\nwhatever belongs to self-government in Canada belongs either to the Dominion or to the provinces, within the limits of the British North America Act.\n(Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada)31.\nSince the adoption of the Statute of Westminster, 1931, and the judgment of the Privy Council in British Coal Corporation v. The King32, it must be taken as now settled that appeals from Canadian courts to The King in Council are\nessentially matters of Canadian concern, and the regulation and control of such appeals would thus seem to be a prime element in Canadian sovereignty as appertaining to matters of justice.\nIt follows, therefore, that the real question presented for decision is whether the power to constitute the Supreme Court of Canada the \"exclusive, ultimate\" appellate court and to prohibit all appeals to His Majesty in Council is within the legislative competence of the Dominion Parliament or of the provincial legislatures.\nThe rule of construction followed in such cases is to decide, first, whether the Act falls within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in section 92 and assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces. (Citizens Insurance Company v. Parsons33. If it does not, then it must fall within the legislative competence of the Dominion Parliament, for\nthe Federtaion Act exhausts the whole range of legislative power, and whatever is not thereby given to provincial legislatures rests with the Parliament.\n(Bank of Toronto v. Lambe)34.\nThe only head of provincial legislative jurisdiction which we have to consider is head (14) of section 92:\nThe administration of justice in the province, including the constitution, maintenance, and organization of provincial courts, both of civil and of criminal jurisdiction, and including procedure in civil matters in those courts.\nIf the matter of appeals to the Privy Council be within the legislative competence of the provinces, it must fall under this head, for the several compartments of section 92 cannot overlap and it must be obvious that head (14) excludes the others.\nThe controlling words in head (14) are \"The administration of justice in the provinces.\" The words are not: in respect of or for the province; they restrict the power to the administration of justice \"in the province.\" These words cannot include matters of appeal from Canadian courts to the Privy Council in London. (Royal Bank of Canada v. The King35; Brassard v. Smith36, and Provincial Treasurer of Alberta v. Kerr)37.\nAs for the remainder of head (14) concerning the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts, both of civil and of criminal jurisdiction and the procedure in civil matters in those courts, it need only be said that obviously it cannot have any reference whatever to His Majesty in Council or to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\nIn recent years we have had the advantage of two pronouncements of the Judicial Committee on the question of the power to abolish appeals to the Privy Council and it seems to me that they are decisive of the point which is now submitted to this Court.\nIn Nadan v. The King38, there was an application for special leave to appeal from a provincial court from two convictions, one under a provincial Liquor Act and the other under the Dominion Liquor Act. The point was raised that there was no jurisdiction to give leave having regard to section 1025 of the Criminal Code of Canada. It was held that section 1025 was ineffective to annul the right of His Majesty to grant special leave to appeal in a criminal case upon two grounds, first, that the powers of the Dominion Parliament are confined to action to be taken in the Dominion and, second, that the section was repugnant to the Judicial Committee Acts and, therefore, inoperative by virtue of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865.\nThe judgment in Nadan's case38 was interpreted by the Board in the British Coal Corporation case39, as being based upon those two grounds: the repugnancy of section 1025 to the Privy Council Acts and, therefore, to the Colonial Laws Validity Act and that it could only be effective if construed as having extra-territorial operation, whereas according to the law as it was in 1926 the Dominion statute could not have extra-territorial operation. The effect of those two decisions is clearly that the matter of the appeal to the Privy Council was then considered outside the territory of Canada and could only be effectively dealt with by Canadian legislation if that legislation could have extra-territorial operation, which it had not at the time. By the Statute of Westminster the restriction imposed by the Colonial Laws Validity Act has been removed both as regards the Dominion Parliament and the provincial legislatures. The Dominion Parliament was further given full power to make laws having extra-territorial operation; but such power was not given to the provincial legislatures. The following consequences seem to be the result from the two decisions of the Privy Council above referred to and from the subsequent enactment of the Statute of Westminster:\u2014\nThe question of appeals to the Privy Council was considered by the Judicial Committee as a matter of extraterritorial operation.\nIt was decided that previous to the Statute of Westminster the Dominion Parliament could not effectively deal with the whole question of the appeals to the Privy Council because it had not then the power to make laws having extra-territorial operation.\nIt is only because such power was given to the Dominion Parliament by the Statute of Westminster that the British Coal Corporation case40 was subsequently decided upholding the Dominion's jurisdiction.\nWe must conclude that a fortiori the provincial legislatures could not effectively legislate with regard to the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council as the law stood before the Statute of Westminster; and, as they continue as before to have no legislative capacity to make any law having extra-territorial operation, they have no power to deal with the matter of appeals to the Privy Council.\nThe result would be that this matter not being within the legislative competence of the provinces it must fall necessarily within the competence of the Dominion Parliament.\nThis result is further supported in my view by section 101 of the British North America Act.\nUnder that section\nthe Parliament of Canada may notwithstanding anything in this Act from time to time provide for the constitution, maintenance and organization of a general Court of Appeal for Canada, etc.\nThe legislative authority conferred on the Dominion by that section is exclusive, paramount and plenary. It cannot be taken away or impaired by provincial legislation (Crown Grain Co. v. Day)41. Its jurisdiction extends as well to the laws passed by the Parliament of Canada as to any provincial law. It is \"a general Court of Appeal for Canada\" and the Dominion Parliament may exclusively determine the appellate jurisdiction of the Court.\nOne of the principal functions of a general Court of Appeal should be to settle jurisprudence and that object fails completely if it is not the final and ultimate Court of Appeal. There appears to be no sound ground for the suggestion that legislation by Parliament directed to that purpose would not be legislation relating to the constitution, maintenance and organization of the Supreme Court of Canada in its character as a general Court of Appeal for Canada.\nAn attempt was made at the argument to make a distinction with regard to admiralty law, but I think the legislative competence of the Dominion Parliament on that subject would naturally fall under the power to deal with navigation and shipping and the further power given by section 101 as to the\nestablishment of any additional courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada.\nFor those reasons, I have come to the conclusion that Bill 9 in toto is intra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\nCrocket J.\u2014Although this bill, as it comes to us on this reference, simply entitled \"An Act to amend the Supreme Court Act of Canada\" purports to amend \"The Supreme Court of Canada Act,\" c. 35 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, only by repealing s. 54 of that Act and substituting for it a new section of three comparatively short subsections, the most cursory examination of the proposed substitution shews that it goes far beyond the mere elimination from the existing section of its express recognition of the royal prerogative to grant leave to appeal from the judgments of this court. Its real purpose is to give this court \"exclusive ultimate appellate civil and criminal jurisdiction within and for Canada,\" as it is expressed in s.s. 1. To accomplish this purpose the bill itself recognizes that the mere abrogation of the existing prerogative in relation to the judgments of this court will not suffice, and that it requires to make an end also of the long established prerogative of the reigning Sovereign to grant special leave to appeal to His Majesty's Privy Council from any judgment pronounced by any of His courts of justice in any of the provinces of the Dominion, and to annul as well the provisions of any and every statute or law now in force in any province under which appeals may be taken directly as of right to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in certain cases from the judgments of provincial courts. (The Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec, as amended by 8 Edward VII, c. 75 and 8 George V, c. 78 expressly provides for an appeal to His Majesty in His Privy Council from final judgments of the Court of King's Bench in all cases where the amount or value of the thing demanded exceeds $12,000, as well as in all cases concerning titles to lands or tenements, annual rents or other matters in which the rights in future of the parties may be affected. The Privy Council Appeals Act, Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1937, provides also that an appeal shall lie to His Majesty in His Privy Council where the matter in controversy in any case exceeds the sum or value of $4,000, as well as in any case where the matter in question relates to the taking of any annual fee or rent, customary or other duty or fee or any like demand of a general and public nature affecting future rights, of what value or amount soever the same may be, while in all the other Provinces of Canada Imperial Orders in Council, made under the provisions of the Judicial Committee Act, 1933, 3 & 4 William IV, c. 41, and the Judicial Committee Act, 1844, c. 69, of the Imperial Statutes, 7 & 8 Vict., which provide for direct appeals from the judgments of the Supreme and other courts of the several provinces to the Judicial Committee without any special leave of the Imperial Privy Council, undoubtedly are now operative in the other seven provinces and have the same force and effect as if their provisions had been expressly enacted by their respective legislatures.) Hence the far-reaching, all-embracing proposal of s.s. 2:\u2014\n(2) Notwithstanding any royal prerogative or anything contained in any Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (this manifestly would cover the B.N.A. Act itself) or any Act of the Parliament of Canada or any Act of the legislature of any province of Canada or any other statute or law, no appeal shall lie or be brought from any court now or hereafter established within Canada to any court of appeal, tribunal or authority by which, in the United Kingdom, appeals or petitions to His Majesty in Council may be ordered to be heard.\nAnd that of s.s. 3, actually declaring that:\u2014\n(3) The Judicial Committee Act, 1833, chapter forty-one of the statutes of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, 1833, and The Judicial Committee Act, 1844, chapter sixty-nine of the statutes of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, 1844, and all orders, rules or regulations made under the said Acts are hereby repealed in so far as the same are part of the law of Canada.\nThe undoubted effect of the enactment of such a measure by the Parliament of Canada would be an open defiance by that body of the authority of any of the provincial legislatures of Canada to legislate in respect either of appeals as of right directly to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council from the judgments of provincial courts now or hereafter established within Canada, or in respect of the royal prerogative to grant leave to appeal thereto independently of the provisions of any statute or law duly enacted by the legislature of any province or duly established by Order in Council under the provisions of the Imperial Judicial Committee Acts of 1833 and 1844. It would amount to an attempt on the part of the Parliament of Canada to arrogate to itself the complete control of the administration of justice in all the Provinces of the Dominion in so far as the finality of judgments in civil as well as in criminal cases is concerned and the right of the subject or anybody submitting to the jurisdiction of a provincial court to petition His Majesty for leave to appeal to him for redress through his Judicial Committee, and thus to strike at the constitutional integrity of all the provinces of Canada as self-governing entities under the British Crown. If any warrant exists for the presentation to the Parliament of Canada of such a drastic bill it must be found either in the Statute of Westminster, 1931, 22 George V, ch. 4, or in the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1930.\nSec. 4 of the first mentioned Imperial Statute, enacting that the Parliament of a Dominion has full power to make laws having extra-territorial operation, has been much stressed as a justification for the presentation of the bill in question. It is contended that its enactment would have extra-territorial operation inasmuch as it would prohibit the hearing of appeals by His Majesty's Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which sits in the United Kingdom beyond the territorial limits of Canada.\nThe answer to this contention, I think, is that in so far as the direct right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council provided by the statutes of Quebec and Ontario and by orders in council in the other provinces of the Dominion is concerned, the principal, and indeed the only effective, operation of the now proposed enactment would be the virtual repeal of these provincial statutes and orders in council, which manifestly could have effect only in Canada. This would be true also of the proposed abrogation of the royal prerogative in relation to the granting not only of appeals from the judgments of any provincial court in Canada, but also in relation to the granting by royal prerogative of appeals from judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada. So far as the exercise by the Sovereign of the royal prerogative is concerned, it cannot in any sense be said to be localized either in the place where the Sovereign resides nor in the place where His Judicial Committee sits, as was so clearly pointed out by Viscount Haldane in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Hull v. McKenna42: \"The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,\" said Lord Haldane,\nis not an English body in any exclusive sense. It is no more an English body than it is an Indian body, or a Canadian body, or a South African body, or for the future, an Irish Free State body. There sit among our numbers Privy Councillors who may be learned Judges of Canada\u2014there was one sitting with us last week\u2014or from India, or we may have the Chief Justice, and very often have had them from the other Dominions, Australia and South Africa. I mention that for the purpose of bringing out the fact that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is not a body, strictly speaking, with any location. The Sovereign is everywhere throughout the Empire in the contemplation of the law. He may as well sit in Dublin, or at Ottawa, or in South Africa, or in Australia, or in India as he may sit here, and it is only for convenience, and because we have a Court, and because the members of the Privy Council are conveniently here that we do sit here; but the Privy Councillors from the Dominions may be summoned to sit with us, and then we sit as an. Imperial Court which represents the Empire, and not any particular part of it.\nIn British Coal Corporation v. The King43, Lord Sankey in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee said:\nIt may now be considered whether there is since the statute (authorizing appeals as of right to the Privy Council) any sufficient reason why this matter of the special or prerogative appeal to the King in Council should be treated, as being something quite special and as being a matter standing, as it were, on a pedestal by itself. Ought it not to be treated as simply one element in the general system of appeals in the Dominion? The appeal, if special leave is granted, is from the decision of a Canadian Court, and is to secure a reversal or alteration of an order of a Canadian Court: if it is successful, its effect will be that the order of the Canadian Court will be reformed accordingly. Rights in Canada and law in Canada will thus be affected. The appellant and respondent in any such appeal must be either Canadian citizens or persons who have submitted to the jurisdiction of the Canadian courts. Such appeals seem to be essentially matters of Canadian concern, and the regulation and control of such appeals would thus seem to be a prime element in Canadian sovereignty as appertaining to matters of justice. But it is said that this class of appeal is a matter external to Canada: emphasis is laid particularly on the fact that the Privy Council sits in London, and that in form the appeal by special leave is not to the Judicial Committee as a Court of Law, but to the King in Council exercising a prerogative right outside and apart from any statute. As already explained, this latter proposition is true only in form, not in substance. But even so the reception and the hearing of the appeal in London is only one step in a composite procedure which starts from the Canadian court and which concludes and reaches its consummation in the Canadian court. What takes place outside Canada is only ancillary to practical results which become effective in Canada. And the appeal to the King in Council is an appeal to an Imperial, not a merely British, tribunal.\nThe last mentioned case, which was an application for leave to appeal from a criminal conviction, decided that the extent of the legislative competence conferred on the Canadian Parliament in regard to appeals to the King in Council in criminal matters must now be ascertained from its constituent Act, the British North America Act, and that s. 91 of that Act, read with the rest of the Act by necessary intendment, invested the Parliament with power to regulate or prohibit appeals to the King in Council in criminal matters. In the course of his judgment Viscount Sankey said, at p. 520:\nA most essential part of the administration of justice consists of the system of appeals. It is not doubted that with the single exception of what is called the prerogative appeal, that is, the appeal by special leave given in the Privy Council in London, matters of appeal from Canadian courts are within the legislative control of Canada, that is, of the Dominion of the Provinces, as the case may be.\nSo that, while the decision in British Coal Corporation v. The King44 may be taken to have settled the question of the right of the Dominion Parliament (by reason of its exclusive legislative jurisdiction in relation to criminal law, including procedure in criminal cases) to prohibit appeals to the King in Council in criminal matters, that decision does not extend to appeals, either as of right or by the exercise of the royal prerogative in relation to classes of subjects, which the British North America Act has assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nApart, however, from these considerations and pronouncements it seems to me that it is only necessary to examine ss. 2 of s. 2 of the Statute of Westminster in connection with and in the light of ss. 2 of s. 7 of that statute to see that s. 3 of that statute respecting the power of the Parliament of the Dominion to make laws having extra-territorial operation could not reasonably be held to apply to such a matter as the royal prerogative to grant leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Ss. 2 of s. 7 provides that ss. 2 of s. 2 shall extend to laws made by any of the Provinces of Canada and to the powers of the legislatures of such provinces. The provisions, therefore, of ss. 2 of s. 2 of the Statute of Westminster enacting that no law and no provision of any law made after the commencement of that Act by the Parliament of a Dominion shall be void or inoperative on the ground that it is repugnant to the law of England or to the provisions of any existing or future Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom or to any order, rule or regulation made under any such Act, and that the powers of the Parliament of the Dominion shall include the power to repeal or amend any such Act, order, rule or regulation, in so far as the same is part of the law of the Dominion, applies in the same way to laws made by any of the Provinces of Canada and to the powers of the Legislatures of those Provinces as it does to laws made by the Parliament of Canada and to the powers of that Parliament. The power, therefore, to repeal or amend any Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom or any order, rule or regulation made thereunder, whether such repeal or amendment be made by the Parliament of Canada in relation to matters within its legislative jurisdiction or by the legislature of any province in relation to matters within its legislative jurisdiction is expressly limited by the words \"in so far as the same is part of the law of the Dominion,\" i.e., Canada and its several component provinces.\nIf the extra-territorial argument is not fully met by what I have already said, it is in my opinion effectually disposed of by reference to ss. 1 and 3 of s. 7 of the Statute of Westminster. The argument in behalf of the Dominion in this regard rests entirely upon the fact that ss. 2 of s. 7, which extends the provisions of ss. 2 of s. 2 to the Legislatures of the Provinces, makes no specific mention of s. 2 relating to the power of the Parliament of the Dominion to make laws having extra-territorial operation. It is claimed that this omission shews conclusively that it was the intention of the Imperial statute to confer some new power upon the Parliament of a Dominion as distinguished from the Legislatures of the Provinces. Ss. 2 of s. 7, however, explicitly enacts that\nthe powers conferred by this Act (including of course that conferred by s. 3) upon the Parliament of Canada or upon the Legislatures of the Provinces shall be restricted to the enactment of laws in relation to matters within the competence of the Parliament of Canada or of any of the Legislatures of the Provinces respectively,\nso that by the operation of this ss. 3 of s. 7 alone s. 3 could not well be held to confer upon the Parliament of Canada any power to make laws in relation to matters, which were not already within its competence at the time of the passing of this Imperial statute. This accords entirely with the principle laid down by Lord MacMillan in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Croft v. Dunphy45, in holding that the Parliament of Canada was competent to provide by ss. 151 and 207 of the Customs Act (R.S. Canada 1927, ch. 42 as amended in 1928) that any vessel registered in Canada hovering within twelve miles of Canada having on board dutiable goods, the vessel and her cargo were to be seized and forfeited. Lord MacMillan there said:\nBut while the Imperial Parliament may be conceded to possess such powers of legislation under international law and usage, the respondent contends that the Parliament of Canada has no such powers. It is not contested that under the British North America Act the Dominion legislature has full power to enact customs laws for Canada, but it is maintained that it is debarred from introducing into such legislation any provisions designed to operate beyond its shores or at any rate beyond a marine league from the coast.\nIn their Lordships' opinion the Parliament of Canada is not under any such disability. Once it is found that a particular topic of legislation is among those upon which the Dominion Parliament may competently legislate as being for the peace, order and good government of Canada or as being one of the specific subjects enumerated in s. 91 of the British North America Act, their Lordships see no reason to restrict the permitted scope of such legislation by any other consideration than is applicable to the legislation of a fully Sovereign State.\nAlthough the Statute of Westminster was then in force and their Lordships' attention was drawn to s. 3, which it was suggested had retrospective effect, their Lordships held in the view which they had taken of that case it was not necessary to say anything on that point beyond observing that the question of the validity of extra-territorial legislation by the Dominion could not at least arise in the future. The decision, however, as I have already intimated, is clearly in line with the express provisions of ss. 3 of s. 7 of the Statute of Westminster, which so explicitly restricts the Parliament of Canada in making laws having extra-territorial operation to matters within its competence. This obviously can only refer to matters within the competence of the Parliament of Canada under the provisions of the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1930, in the light of the provisions of ss. 1 of that section enacting that\nNothing in this Act shall be deemed to apply to the repeal, amendment or alteration of the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1930, or any order, rule or regulation made thereunder. Far, then, from conferring any new legislative powers upon the Parliament of Canada in derogation of the legislative powers of its several provinces, the Statute of Westminster plainly preserves the British North America Acts, 1867-1930, intact and, moreover, explicitly restricts the legislative powers of both the Dominion Parliament and the provincial legislatures to their respective legislative fields, as prescribed by those Acts.\nIf I am right in this view it follows that if any authority exists for the enactment of this far-reaching bill by the Parliament of Canada it must be sought within the four corners of the British North America Act itself.\nNow, there are but two sections of that Act which are or possibly can be relied upon to support it or any part of it, viz: ss. 91 and 101.\nDealing first with s. 91, this is the well-known section, which prescribes the general authority of the Parliament of Canada to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces. In addition to this general authority, and subject to the express limitation mentioned, it declares that\nfor greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms of this section * * * (notwithstanding anything in this Act) the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated.\nThen follows the enumeration of 29 specific classes of subjects.\nIf the subject matter of this bill does fall within any of the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces, it seems perfectly clear that the residuary power conferred on the Parliament of Canada by the introductory words of s. 91 to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada does not authorize its enactment by that body. Our first duty, therefore, is to determine whether the bill does or does not relate to matters falling within the exclusive legislative prerogative of the Provinces. These 16 classes of subjects include: 1. The amendment from time to time, notwithstanding anything in this Act, of the constitution of the Province, except as regards the office of Lieutenant-Governor.\n13. Property and civil rights in the province.\n14. The Administration of Justice in the Province, including the constitution, maintenance and organization of Provincial Courts, both of civil and of criminal jurisdiction, and including procedure in civil matters in those courts.\nThat the proposed enactment directly and vitally concerns the administration of justice in all the Provinces of Canada is self-evident. Its avowed purpose is to constitute this court a court\nof exclusive ultimate appellate civil and criminal jurisdiction within and for Canada,\nand to that end,\nnotwithstanding any Royal prerogative or anything contained in any Act of the United Kingdom * * * or any Act of the Legislature of any Province of Canada\nto prohibit all appeals \"from any court now or hereafter established within Canada\" to the Judicial Committee of His Majesty's Privy Council. How then could it possibly be said that the bill does not essentially relate to the administration of justice in every province of the Dominion, or that it is not designed to nullify or render inoperative the laws of all the nine provinces of Canada, under which appeals now lie directly to that body from provincial courts \u2014both appeals as of right in specified cases, as well as appeals in all other cases in which His Majesty may be advised to grant special leave to appeal thereto?\nCounsel for the Attorney-General of Canada, however, argued that the meaning of the expression \"The Administration of Justice,\" as used in enumeration 14, is not only limited territorially by the words \"in the Province,\" but also by the words\nincluding the constitution, maintenance and organization of Provincial Courts both of civil and of criminal jurisdiction, and including procedure in civil matters in those courts.\nIt was never intended, of course, that the laws which s. 92 exclusively empowered the legislature \"in each Province\" to make in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects therein enumerated should have any application beyond the limits of the province in which they are enacted. That fact, however, in no way adds to the residuary power of the Dominion Parliament under the introductory words of s. 91 to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects \"assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces,\" that is to say, to the legislatures of all the provinces of Canada alike. Obviously no single legislature could make laws in relation to the administration of justice in any other than its own province, but the legislatures of all the nine provinces of Canada are indisputably authorized by s. 92 (14) to exclusively make laws in relation to the administration of justice in their several provinces. The question is, not whether any single province could legislate in relation to the administration of justice in any other province, but whether the Dominion Parliament under s. 91 is authorized to make laws in relation to the administration of justice in all the provinces of Canada alike merely because the legislature of each province necessarily can make laws in relation to the administration of justice only in and for its own province. The answer to such a question, I think, must be No.\nAs to the argument that the quoted words immediately following narrow and limit the meaning of the general words \"The Administration of Justice in the Province,\" Street, J. in his judgment in Regina v. Bush46, sitting with Armour, C.J. and Falconbridge, J. in the Ontario Divisional Court in 1888, effectually, I think, disposed of this precise point when he said:\nBut these words (including the constitution * * * of provincial courts) do not, as I read the clause, in any way limit the scope of the general words preceding them, by which the whole matter of the administration of justice is included. The fundamental weakness of the defendant's argument appears to be his assumption that the word \"including\" in this para. 14 is to be read as if it were \"videlicet\" or as if the words \"The Administration of Justice\" were to be treated, for the purpose of this discussion, as being entitled to no weight.\nHis Lordship in the course of this judgment said that para. 14 of s. 92 appeared to him to be sufficient to confer upon the provincial legislatures the right to regulate and provide for the whole machinery connected with the administration of justice in the provinces, including the appointment of all the judges and officers requisite for the proper administration of justice in its widest sense.\nand pointed out that the general, governing words of that paragraph were subject to no other limitation than that to be found in para. 27 of s. 91 (\"The Criminal Law, except the constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction, but including procedure in criminal matters\") and that contained is Part VII under the title \"Judicature\" (ss. 96 to 101 inclusive) relating to the appointment of judges of Superior, District and County courts and the payment of their salaries and to the authority of Parliament to provide for the constitution, maintenance and organization of a general Court of Appeal for Canada and for the establishment of any additional courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada.\nEverything coming within the ordinary meaning of the expression \"the administration of justice,\" not covered by (these) sections, (he said) remains, in my opinion, to be dealt with by the provincial legislatures in pursuance of the powers conferred upon them by para. 14 of s. 92 * * * . It is clearly the intention of the Act that the provincial legislatures shall be responsible for the administration of justice within their respective provinces, excepting in so far as the duty was cast upon the Dominion Parliament. The only duty cast upon the Dominion Parliament in the matter is contained in the clauses to which I have referred.\nMy Lord the Chief Justice in delivering the unanimous judgment of this court in 1938 in the matter of the Reference concerning the authority of judges and junior and acting judges, etc., to perform the functions vested in them respectively by the Ontario Children's Protection Act and other Acts of the Ontario Legislature47 expressly approved the judgment of Street, J. in this case and quoted two of the passages I have ventured now to reproduce. Relating as it does so essentially to the Administration of Justice, as that expression is ordinarily understood, in all the provinces of Canada alike, it is, as I have already indicated, impossible to say that the main purpose and the real subject matter of the proposed enactment now before us does not fall within the classes of subjects, which the British North America Act has assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces. For that reason the residuary power of the Dominion Parliament cannot properly be invoked in its support.\nThis being so, the question remains, as regards s. 91, whether, notwithstanding the fact that the proposed denial of the Royal prerogative to grant direct appeals from all courts in and throughout Canada to the Judicial Committee of His Majesty's Privy Council as well as the proposed abolition of all direct appeals as of right, for which the laws of all the provinces now provide, prima facie fall within enumerated head 14 of s. 92, do not also fall within any one of the 29 specific classes of subjects enumerated in s. 91, in which event the power of the provincial legislatures would be overborne according to the principle laid down by the Judicial Committee in Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons48; Dobie v. Board for the Management of the Temporalities Fund of Presbyterian Church of Canada49, and Russell v. The Queen50.\nIn expounding the principle of the pre-eminence of Dominion legislation in cases of conflict between the enumerated heads of ss. 91 and 92, as declared by the non obstante clause in the second branch of the former section, Sir Montague Smith in the Parsons case51 pointed out that it was obvious that in some cases where apparent conflict exists it could not have been intended\nthat the powers exclusively assigned to the provincial legislature should be absorbed in those powers given to the Dominion Parliament * * *. It could not (he said) have been the intention that such a conflict should exist; and in order to prevent such a result, the two sections must be read together, and the language of one interpreted, and, where necessary, modified, by that of the other. In this way it may in most cases be found possible to arrive at a reasonable and practical construction of the language of the sections so as to reconcile the respective powers they contain and give effect to all of them.\nDoes then the real subject matter of this bill fall within any of the classes of subjects specifically enumerated in s. 91?\nThe only one of the 29 enumerated heads of this section having any possible relevancy on this subject is that which has already been mentioned, (27), The Criminal Law, except the constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction, but including procedure in criminal matters. Reading the two sections together and setting 21 (27) against 92 (14), there can be no doubt that the intention was that the exclusive power of the legislatures to make laws in relation to the \"Administration of Justice\" should be subject to the exclusive power of the Dominion Parliament to make laws in relation to the Criminal Law, except the constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction, but including procedure in criminal matters, and that with that single exception, so far as s. 91 is concerned, it conferred upon the Dominion no express legislative power in relation to the administration of justice in the provinces.\nWhile it is true that the decision of the Privy Council in British Coal Corporation v. The King52 settled the question that s. 91 invests the Dominion Parliament with the power to regulate or prohibit appeals to the King in Council in criminal matters, that decision, as previously pointed out, manifestly proceeded on the ground that The Criminal Law, including procedure in criminal matters, was specifically placed within its jursidiction by enumerated head 27. Lord Sankey was careful to say that their Lordships were in that judgment\ndealing only with the legal position in Canada in regard to this type of appeal in criminal matters\nand that it was\nneither necessary nor desirable to touch on the position as regards civil cases.\nThe Parliament of Canada has already by s. 17 of c. 53, 23-24 Geo. V (1933), provided that\nNotwithstanding any royal prerogative, or anything contained in the Interpretation Act or in the Supreme Court Act, no appeal shall be brought in any criminal case from any judgment or order of any court in Canada to any court of appeal or authority by which in the United Kingdom appeals or petitions to His Majesty in Council may be heard.\nIndeed, that was the particular enactment, the constitutional validity of which was challenged in the British Coal Corporation case )52, and definitely held by that judgment to be within its legislative competence for the reason above indicated. This fact would seem to make it clear that the presently proposed enactment is directly aimed at the regulation and control of appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in all civil cases throughout Canada, regardless of the provisions of any and all existing provincial laws. I have endeavoured to shew that this is quite beyond the legislative power vested in the Parliament of Canada by s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act.\nThis brings me to the more difficult question as to whether justification can be found in s. 101 for the proposal of this bill to completely do away with all appeals from Canada to the Judicial Committee of His Majesty's Privy Council and to give this court \"exclusive ultimate appellate and civil and criminal jurisdiction within and for Canada.\" That this section enacting that the Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, provide for the constitution, maintenance and organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada, constitutes a further exception to the exclusive power of the provincial legislatures to make laws in relation to the Administration of Justice has already appeared. It is not questioned that the unrestricted power to constitute and organize a court necessarily implies power to define its jurisdiction and provide for the regulation of its procedure, nor, of course, that the exercise of such a power directly concerns the administration of justice. The difficulty arises from the fact that while s. 92 vests the exclusive legislative power in relation to the general subject of the administration of justice as well as in relation to civil rights in the Provincial Legislatures, s. 101, notwithstanding that fact, specifically invests the Dominion Parliament with power to constitute and organize a General Court of Appeal for Canada, and that we are again confronted with two apparently conflicting enactments, which must be read together and so interpreted as to give, as far as possible, reasonable and practical effect to each. This, as I take it, is the meaning of Sir Montague Smith's pronouncement above quoted in my discussion of the apparent conflict between ss. 91 and 92 regarding Procedure in Criminal Matters and Administration of Justice in the Provinces, and in my opinion it is quite as applicable to the question now under review, for, as he said, it could not have been intended that the powers exclusively assigned to the Provincial Legislatures should be absorbed in those powers given to the Dominion Parliament.\nIt is clear enough that s. 101 must be read as conferring upon the Dominion Parliament whatever legislative authority is necessary to the constitution and organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada, no matter to what extent the exercise of such authority may infringe upon the exclusive legislative rights of the provincial legislatures as defined in ss. 92. Indeed, this court and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council have both decided, as regards this conflict of legislative authority, that the provincial legislatures have no authority to limit the right of appeal to this court or in any way impair the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the Supreme Court Act. See Clarkson v. Ryan53; City of Halifax v. McLaughlin Carriage Co.54, and Crown Grain Co. Ltd. v. Day55. An examination of these cases shews that the decisions all proceeded on the ground that, if the provinces could so legislate, they could take away the jurisdiction of this court entirely and thus virtually defeat the object of its constitution and organization. No such consideration arises here.\nThe question with which we are immediately concerned is, not the power to prescribe what type or class of case may be appealed from provincial courts to this court, but the power, not only to abrogate the Royal prerogative, in respect of the judgments of this court on such appeals, but to abrogate it also in respect of the judgments of all provincial courts, and to abolish as well all per saltum appeals, which now lie to the Judicial Committee of His Majesty's Privy Council under provincial laws, the validity of which has never before been brought into question. Unless such power is necessarily incidental to the constitution, maintenance and organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada, I cannot, for my part, see how it can be justified by the terms of s. 101 or any of the cases relied upon by counsel for the Attorney-General of Canada. To hold otherwise would, in my most respectful opinion, be to practically ignore s. 92 (14) as well as s. 92 (13) and virtually transfer to the Dominion Parliament the regulation and control of these two classes of subjects\u2014the most general and important of all the 16 classes of subjects which the B.N.A. Act has marked out as the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the provinces\u2014by the simple expedient of amending the Supreme Court of Canada Act and thus placing the final disposition of all litigation in Canada, no matter how important the constitutional and property and civil rights involved may be, in the hands of a court established and exclusively controlled by Dominion legislation, without the long cherished right of recourse to the Crown for the redress of any grievance, which may be suffered by any litigant in connection therewith. Could it fairly be said in reading s. 101 together with s. 92 with a view to give, as far as possible, reasonable and practical effect to each, that the Parliament of Canada would be justified by s. 101 in arrogating to itself, as necessarily incidental to the constitution, maintenance and organization of this court, the power to regulate and control the Administration of Justice, as well as Property and Civil Rights in all the provinces to such an extent as is proposed in this bill?\nIn discussing the introductory words of s. 91 in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in the Board of Commerce case56, Viscount Haldane said:\nNo doubt the initial words of s. 91 of the British North America Act confer on the Parliament of Canada power to deal with subjects which concern the Dominion generally, provided that they are not withheld from the powers of that Parliament to legislate, by any of the express heads in s. 92, untrammelled by the enumeration of special heads in s. 91. It may well be that the subjects of undue combination and hoarding are matters in which the Dominion has a great practical interest. In special circumstances, such as those of a great war, such an interest might conceivably become of such paramount and overriding importance as to amount to what lies outside the heads in s. 92, and is not covered by them. The decision in Russell v. The Queen57 appears to recognize this as constitutionally possible, even in time of peace; but it is quite another matter to say that under normal circumstances general Canadian policy can justify interference, on such a scale as the statutes in controversy involve, with the property and civil rights of the inhabitants of the provinces. It is to the Legislatures of the Provinces that the regulation and restriction of their civil rights have in general been exclusively confided, and as to these the provincial legislatures possess quasi-sovereign authority. It can, therefore, be only under necessity in highly exceptional circumstances, such as cannot be assumed to exist in the present case, that the liberty of inhabitants of the provinces may be restricted by the Parliament of Canada, and that the Dominion can intervene in the interests of Canada as a whole in questions such as the present one.\nAnd further, in discussing the question as to whether the Dominion legislation there under consideration fell under s. 91 (27) (The Criminal Law) His Lordship used this language at pp. 198 and 199: It is one thing to construe the words \"the criminal law, except the constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction, but including the procedure in criminal matters,\" as enabling the Dominion Parliament to exercise exclusive legislative power where the subject-matter is one which by its very nature belongs to the domain of criminal jurisprudence. A general law, to take an example, making incest a crime, belongs to this class. It is quite another thing, first to attempt to interfere with a class of subject committed exclusively to the Provincial Legislature, and then to justify this by enacting ancillary provisions, designated as new phases of Dominion criminal law which require a title to so interfere as basis of their application. For analogous reasons their Lordships think that s. 101 of the British North America Act, which enables the Parliament of Canada, notwithstanding anything in the Act, to provide for the establishment of any additional courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada, cannot be read as enabling that Parliament to trench on provincial rights, such as the powers over property and civil rights in the Provinces exclusively conferred on their Legislatures. Full significance can be attached to the words in question without reading them as implying such capacity on the part of the Dominion Government. It is essential in such cases that the new judicial establishment should be a means to some end competent to the latter.\nThe King v. Consolidated Distilleries Limited58 was an appeal from the judgment of Audette, J. of the Exchequer Court, granting a motion made by the defendant appellant as third party to set aside the third party notice on the ground that the issue raised by the third party notice between the original defendant and it was one over which that court had no jurisdiction. This court, Anglin, C.J. and Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ., Newcombe, J. dissenting, dismissed the appeal on the ground that the matter in controversy between the original defendant and the third party was purely one of exclusive provincial jurisdiction concerning a civil right in one of the provinces. Anglin, C.J. in delivering the judgment of himself and his three brethren said:\nWhile there can be no doubt that the powers of Parliament under s. 101 are of an overriding character, when the matter dealt with is within the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, it seems equally clear that they do not enable it to set up a court competent to deal with matters purely of civil right as between subject and subject. While the law., under which the defendant in the present instance seeks to impose a liability on the third party to indemnify it by virtue of a contract between them, is a law of Canada in the sense that it is in force in Canada, it is not a law of Canada in the sense that it would be competent for the Parliament of Canada to enact, modify or amend it. The matter is purely one of exclusive provincial jurisdiction, concerning, as it does, a civil right in some one of the provinces (s. 92(13)). The really decisive question on this branch of the argument regarding the conflict between the legislative power vested in the Dominion Parliament by s. 101 and that exclusively vested in the Provincial Legislatures by s. 92, as I have already said is, whether the subject-matter of this proposed enactment is comprised in the language of s. 101, as necessarily incidental to the exercise of the power thereby confided to the Dominion Parliament. Reading the section in connection with and in the light of s. 92, as it must be, it is in my opinion our clear duty to so construe it as to interfere as little as possible with the general scheme of the British North America Act regarding the distribution of legislative powers between the Dominion and the Provinces, and thus, while fully safeguarding the overriding legislative powers of the Dominion, in so far as they are explicitly declared, to prevent any undue or unnecessary encroachment upon what s. 92 has so unequivocally declared to be the exclusive legislative powers of the Provinces. This, I take it, to be the true guiding principle when a court is confronted with the duty of endeavouring to arrive at a reasonable and practical solution of a problem of this kind, as deducible from the pronouncements I have above reproduced and many other cases of similar import, which might have been quoted, dealing with apparently conflicting provisions of the British North America Act.\nIt is contended that the words\nto provide for the constitution, maintenance and organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada, and for the establishment of any additional courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada\nnecessarily imply power to declare that the judgments of these courts shall be absolutely final and conclusive, and, if the Dominion Parliament in its wisdom chooses to say so, unappealable to His Majesty's Privy Council, even by the exercise of the Royal prerogative. Power to constitute a court, it is said, covers power to define its jurisdiction, and this in turn power, not only to prescribe what cases it may hear and determine, but power to declare the consequences and effects of its judgments. If this be true of the power vested in the Dominion Parliament by s. 101 to provide for \"the constitution, maintenance and organization\" of the courts therein indicated, must it not also be true of the exclusive power vested in the Provincial Legislatures by s. 92 to make laws in relation to \"the constitution, maintenance and organization\" of provincial courts, whether of civil or of criminal jurisdiction? Surely it cannot be said that these words have one meaning when applied to any court or courts, which the Dominion Parliament may create, and another meaning when applied to provincial courts. And I cannot for my part see that there is anything in the context, in which they are used in s. 101, which carries any larger implication than that arising from the context in which they are used in s. 92. Indeed, the contrary would seem to me to be the case. For, in s. 92 they are clearly used to indicate a specific sub-head or subdivision of the larger and more comprehensive class of subjects, viz: the Administration of Justice in the provinces.\nThe argument that either the general subject of the Administration of Justice in the Province or the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts, both of civil and of criminal jurisdiction, is restricted by the additional words \"and including procedure in civil matters in those courts\" has already been dealt with in discussing the opposing submissions concerning ss. 91 and 92. I may add, however, in relation to the particular point now under consideration as to the conflict between ss. 92 and 101 that the obvious and the only reason, as it seems to me, for the alleged qualification of the general subject of \"The Administration of Justice in the Province\" by the words which immediately follow in enumeration 14 was to make it conform with s. 91 (27) regarding the general subject of \"The Criminal Law.\" The latter excepts from \"The Criminal Law,\" as a general subject for the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament, \"the constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction,\" but includes \"the procedure in criminal matters,\" while s. 92 (14) specifically includes the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts, both of civil and of criminal jurisdiction, and procedure in civil matters in those courts. The clear intention, so far as s. 91 and 92 are concerned, was to vest exclusive legislative authority in the Province over the whole subject of the Administration of Justice therein, subject only to the overriding legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion in relation to the Criminal Law and all matters necessarily incidental thereto (except the constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction), and to such other encroachments on this general provincial legislative power over the Administration of Justice as might become necessary in order that the Dominion Parliament might legislate effectively in relation to any other one of the 28 other specific subjects assigned to it by s. 91. If I may supplement what I have before suggested as to the basic ground of the decision in the British Coal Corporation case59, it is obvious that this decision could not have been founded on any implication arising from the Dominion's power to constitute courts of criminal jurisdiction, which latter power is expressly excepted from that in relation to Criminal Law and exclusively vested in the Provinces. Its whole tenor, to my mind, is that it is the specific assignment to the Parliament of Canada by s. 91 (27) of the exclusive legislative jurisdiction in relation to such a general subject as that of \"The Criminal Law,\" in the terms therein stated, which actually or by necessary intendment carries the power to prohibit appeals from provincial courts to His Majesty's Privy Council in criminal matters. Certainly that decision in no way supports the argument that power to constitute any court necessarily implies control of the right of appeal from its adjudications. On the contrary, it seems to me to flatly negative it for the reason just stated, viz: that the control of appeals from provincial courts of criminal jurisdiction in criminal matters is necessarily involved in the Dominion Parliament's exclusive legislative jurisdiction in relation to the general subject of The Criminal Law, notwithstanding that the constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction is expressly excepted in s. 91 (27) from that general subject. If that be the case, as regards criminal matters, how can it consistently be claimed that the assignment by s. 92 (14) to the Provincial Legislatures of the exclusive legislative jurisdiction in relation to such a general subject as \"The Administration of Justice,\" subject only to the limitations before mentioned, does not invest the Provincial Legislatures with the power to allow or prohibit, as they choose, appeals from the judgments of provincial courts in civil matters? Only, it seems to me, on one intelligible ground, viz: that, though s. 92 (14) indisputably comprises it, s. 101 takes it away and vests it entirely in the Dominion Parliament. But can the language of s. 101 itself, when read in conjunction with that of ss. 91 and 92, properly be so interpreted? In my opinion it cannot. The power thereby granted to the Parliament of Canada \"notwithstanding anything in this Act,\" so far as the establishment of a General Court of Appeal for Canada is concerned, is, not only a special power relating to a single court, but is definitely limited to legislation providing for \"the constitution, maintenance and organization\" of such a court. While it can readily be understood that this language in association with the non obstante clause must be construed as necessarily entitling the Dominion Parliament to cut into the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the provinces over the general subject of the Administration of Justice therein to such an extent as may be necessary to enable this court to fully function as a General Court of Appeal for Canada, and thus to regulate to that extent appeals to this court from provincial courts, that to my mind is the farthest limit to which the words \"constitution, maintenance and organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada\" can reasonably be extended. The section itself says nothing about the finality of the judgments of the court authorized to be constituted or about its \"exclusive, ultimate appellate jurisdiction,\" and certainly contains no suggestion of any power to divest the Crown of its prerogative to grant leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, either in respect of its own judgments, or in respect of the judgments of provincial courts, nor of any power to repeal or annul any of the laws relating to courts of civil and criminal jurisdiction existing in Canada, Nova Scotia or New Brunswick at the time of the Union, which s. 129 expressly continued in the four original provinces, as if the Union had not been made until they should be repealed, abolished or altered either by the Parliament of Canada or by the Legislatures of the respective Provinces, according to the authority of Parliament, or of the Legislatures under that Act. To say that all these things are necessarily implied by the power to constitute such a court itself is to my mind quite inadmissible unless some reason can be found, either in the general scheme of the Act concerning the distribution of legislative authority between the Dominion and the Provinces or in some particular provision thereof, clearly demonstrating that the grant of this special power was so intended. Singularly enough, notwithstanding the argument already dealt with that none of the matters covered by this bill fall under s. 92 (14) and that consequently they fall under the general residuary power conferred upon the Parliament of Canada by the introductory words of s. 91, s. 92 (14) is now invoked, shorn of its principal subject, for the purpose of attributing the provincial legislative power concerning the whole subject of appeals from the judgments of provincial courts to the words \"constitution, maintenance and organization\" of such courts, and thus by enlarging their scope, enlarging that of s. 101. Assuming this to be true of the provincial legislative power under s. 92 (14), where, as the factum in support of the now proposed enactment puts it, the quoted words are in effect qualified and curtailed by the express mention in the context of \"procedure in civil matters in those courts,\" it is urged that\nit must a fortiori be true of the exclusive paramount and plenary legislative power conferred upon the Parliament of Canada by the corresponding words of s. 101, where they stand unqualified.\nThis argument simply brings us back to the construction of s. 92 (14), and obviously is founded upon the bald assumption that the only operative part of enumeration 14 is that which immediately follows the principal subject of the Administration of Justice, viz.: \"the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts both of criminal and civil jurisdiction.\" Such an assumption has already been shewn to be entirely insupportable as manifestly involving the complete absorption of the principal general subject by a lesser, subordinate one, which is only mentioned for the purpose of meeting the exception provided for in s. 91 (27) to the Dominion's exclusive legislative jurisdiction in relation to the general subject of the Criminal Law. That the specification of the lesser subject in no way qualifies or curtails the general subject of the Administration of Justice any more than the specification of procedure in civil matters in those courts qualifies or curtails the subordinate, lesser subject of the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts seems to me, with all respect, to be too clear to require demonstration. The legislative power of the Provinces in relation to the appealability or non-appealability of the judgments of their own courts is derivable in my opinion from the principal general subject of the Administration of Justice, which unmistakeably would have comprised that power, had the subordinate subject of the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts not been introduced into enumeration 14 for the reason above indicated, not with the words \"that is to say,\" but with the word \"including.\"\nThe highly ingenious attempt to extend the scope of the power to constitute a court by separating the words \"constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts\" from their context in s. 92(14) and thus practically deleting from that section the introductory and really governing words of enumeration 14 must, therefore, fail.\nIf it had been the intention of the Imperial Parliament, in constituting the Dominion and the Provinces as self-governing units thereof in 1867 and assigning to them their respective legislative rights, to annex to the special power conferred upon the Dominion to constitute this court such sweeping authority as that now insisted upon, is it to be supposed that it would in the unequivocal language of s. 92 have purported to invest the Provinces with the exclusive power \"to make laws in relation to\" all the classes of subjects therein enumerated, and then proceed to divest them of all effective control of such a vital subject as the Administration of Justice by merely conferring upon the Dominion Parliament a special power to create a General Court of Appeal for Canada in such language as that used in s. 101, viz.: \"to provide for the constitution, maintenance and organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada\"?\nWhile s. 101 undoubtedly clashes to some extent with s. 92 (14), I find it quite impossible to spell out of its language an intention to confer on the Dominion Parliament authority to encroach on the general subject of The Administration of Justice in the provinces any farther than is reasonably and necessarily incidental to the constitution, maintenance and organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada or any other Federal court, which it may from time to time desire to set up for the better administration of its own laws. It surely never could have been intended by the enactment of s. 101 to empower the Dominion Parliament to extinguish the exclusive legislative rights of the provinces to the extent contemplated by this bill, the enactment of which, if validated upon such grounds as those which have been advanced on this hearing, would practically reduce the important and general subject of the Administration of Justice, as the exclusive legislative prerogative of the Provinces, to the bare matter of procedure in civil matters in provincial courts, and invest the Dominion Parliament with the actual control of the whole litigation of the country, in so far as its final disposition is concerned, without any recourse to the Crown, and this regardless of whether the matters in controversy in such litigation relate to Property and Civil Rights in the Provinces, to the Constitution of the Provinces themselves, to Taxation for Provincial Purposes or any other of the sixteen classes of subjects exclusively assigned to the legislative competence of the Provinces, subject only to the exceptions already indicated.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion with all possible respect that what is described in the factum of counsel representing the Attorney-General of Canada as \"the cardinal object\" of this bill, viz.: the total and indiscriminate prohibition of appeals from all courts now or hereafter established within Canada to the Judicial Committee of His Majesty's Privy Council as a necessary means to accomplish the end of constituting this court a court of exclusive, ultimate appellate, civil and criminal jurisdiction, without any recourse to the Crown, is not embraced within the legislative power confided to the Parliament of Canada, either expressly or by necessary implication, by the terms either of s. 91 or those of s. 101 of the British North America Act, and that bill No. 9 should therefore be declared to be wholly ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada as seeking in the form of an amendment of the Supreme Court Act to extend the prohibition, which that Parliament has already applied against appeals in criminal cases by s. 17 of ch. 53, 23-24 Geo. V, in amendment of the Criminal Code, and in the exercise of its exclusive legislative jurisdiction in relation to Criminal Law, to appeals in all civil cases from this and all other courts throughout the Dominion, regardless of whether such civil cases concern matters, which fall within the legislative powers granted it by s. 91, or not.\nThe bill being one, the avowed object of which must fail unless every one of its provisions is intra vires of the Parliament of Canada, to which it has been presented for enactment, and it being impossible for the reason just stated to sever the valid from the invalid parts thereof beyond the general lines I have endeavoured in these reasons to make clear without completely recasting its material provisions, I most respectfully am of opinion that for these reasons, and in accordance with the rule laid down in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Reciprocal Insurers60, and re-affirmed in Attorney-General for Manitoba v. Attorney-General for Canada61, the bill must be pronounced ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada in its entirety.\nMy answer, therefore, to the question referred is that the bill is wholly ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\nDavis J.\u2014In the submission by the Governor General in Council for the opinion of this Court as to the competence of the Dominion Parliament to enact Bill No. 9, in whole or in part, the real question, and it is a question of the greatest constitutional importance in Canada, is whether or not in civil cases the Dominion Parliament has the power to abolish the right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council from any of the courts in Canada (i.e., courts whether created by the Dominion or by the provinces) and to abolish the prerogative in such cases to grant special leave to appeal from any such courts.\nThe question of the power of the Dominion Parliament in criminal cases to abolish appeals was raised and determined by the Judicial Committee in the British Coal Corporation case62. That decision sustained the constitutional validity of an amendment made by the Dominion Parliament to the Criminal Code in 1933 (23-24 Geo. V, ch. 53, sec. 17) which reads as follows:\nNotwithstanding any royal prerogative, or anything contained in the Interpretation Act or in the Supreme Court Act, no appeal shall be brought in any criminal case from any judgment or order of any court in Canada to any court of appeal or authority by which in the United Kingdom appeals or petitions to His Majesty in Council may be heard.\nWhile it is always material in considering constitutional powers to ascertain the origin and development of the constitution and to examine the decisions of the courts on its interpretation, it would be inutile for me to attempt to traverse again the difficult territory which their Lordships in the Privy Council have so fully explored in their judgments in the Nadan case63, in the Irish Free State case (Moore v. Atty.-Gen. for the Irish Free State)64, and in the British Coal Corporation case65. It is sufficient to say that these cases were examined and discussed at length during the argument and have been very carefully considered. The judgments are fully reported and any attempt to summarize them might only mislead. But I would venture to make the observation that it is plain from those decisions that\u2014\n(1) before the passing of the Statute of Westminster 1931 it was not competent to the Dominion to pass an Act repugnant to an Imperial Act,\n(2) the effect of the Statute of Westminster was to remove the fetters which lay upon the Dominion by reason of the Colonial Laws Validity Act and by sec. 129 of the British North America Act and also by the principle or rule that the Dominion's powers were limited by the doctrine forbidding extra-territorial legislation, and\n(3) whatever might be the position of the King's prerogative if it were left as matter of the common law, it may by appropriate action be made matter of Parliamentary legislation so that the prerogative is pro tanto merged in the statute.\nWe cannot escape from the conclusion that in the British Coal Corporation case 65 once the former limitations which had restrained legislative action by the Dominion were recognized as now removed by the Statute of Westminster, the judgment rests upon the fact that criminal law is one of the enumerated heads of sec. 91 of the British North America Act which section sets forth specific subject-matters of legislation which lie exclusively within the competence of the Dominion Parliament. It is to be observed that the validated legislation prohibited an appeal in any criminal case \"from any judgment or order of any court in Canada.\" That being the decision, and binding upon us, the same result necessarily follows in respect of any such Dominion legislation in relation to matters properly within any of the other specific subjects enumerated in said sec. 91 or within the general power of the Dominion Parliament to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada. As was said by Lord Macmillan in the Privy Council in Croft v. Dunphy66:\nOnce it is found that a particular topic of legislation is among those upon which the Dominion Parliament may competently legislate as being for the peace, order and good government of Canada or as being one of the specific subjects enumerated in sec. 91 of the British North America Act, their Lordships see no reason to restrict the permitted scope of such legislation by any other consideration than is applicable to the legislation of a fully Sovereign State.\nWe were invited to say that head 14 of sec. 92,\nThe administration of justice in the province, including the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts, both of civil and of criminal jurisdiction, and including procedure in civil matters in those courts,\ncontrols the solution of the problem. The proposed abolition of appeals to the Privy Council is not however legislation in relation to the administration of justice \"in the province.\" Nor can head 13 of sec. 92, \"Property and civil rights in the province,\" be regarded as controlling the Dominion power in relation to matters within the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.\nAs to appeals in admiralty. The whole subject of admiralty jurisdiction has stood upon a special footing of its own. Whatever may have been the limitations on the Dominion power (prior to the Statute of Westminster) under the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act 1890, see The Woron case67, there never, was any doubt that admiralty was not a provincial matter. As early as 1879 this Court held in The Picton68, that the Dominion legislation, 40 Vic. (1877), chap 21, creating a \"Court of Maritime Jurisdiction in the province of Ontario\" was intra vires the Dominion Parliament. In 1934, the Dominion Parliament by the Admiralty Act, 1934 (24-25 Geo. V, chap. 31), repealed the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act 1890 in so far as the latter Act was part of the law of Canada, with the exception of the provisions relating to appeals to His Majesty in Council. Legislation abolishing appeals or the prerogative to grant special leave in relation to admiralty matters in Canadian courts stands in the same position as do those subjects specifically enumerated in sec. 91.\nApart then from the power of the Dominion Parliament to abolish any right of appeal to the Privy Council and to abolish the prerogative to grant special leave to appeal in civil cases coming within any of the above mentioned classes, there remains the vital question whether there is any such right in the Dominion Parliament in relation to the specific subject-matters enumerated in sec. 92 of the British North America Act\u2014subject-matters over which the provincial legislatures are given exclusive legislative authority. It is fundamental in the Canadian Constitution and has always been recognized as fundamental that the authority of the legislatures of the provinces is\nas plenary and as ample within the limits prescribed by sec. 92 as the Imperial Parliament in the plenitude of its power possessed and could bestow,\nas was said as early as 1883 in Hodge v. The Queen69; the principle has been recognized over and over again and particularly, for our present purposes, in the British Coal Corporation case70.\nThe Statute of Westminster does not make it competent to the Dominion to legislate in relation to classes of subjects which before the statute were outside its competence (such, for example, as \"Property and civil rights in the province,\" head 13, and \"All matters of a merely local or private nature in the province,\" head 16, of sec. 92). The assigned limits of subject and area under the British North America Act, as between the Dominion and the provinces, are not disturbed. The true character and position of the provincial legislatures remain and ought to be given full recognition.\nSec. 101 of the British North America Act, which enables the Dominion Parliament to provide for the constitution, maintenance and organization of \"a general court of appeal for Canada,\" cannot in my opinion be so interpreted as to extend power to the Parliament of Canada to make the jurisdiction of such court exclusive and final in relation to subject-matters which are within the sole legislative authority of the provincial legislatures.\nThere may be some difficulty at times in working out a division of legislative authority in appeals in civil cases but that is inherent in the practical working out of any federal system with a division of legislative powers between the central and the local legislating bodies.\nIt is inadvisable and indeed unnecessary to consider what powers may be possessed in the relevant regard by the legislatures of the provinces; it is sufficient for the purpose of the question submitted to the Court to determine only the powers of the Dominion Parliament itself.\nI would answer the question submitted by saying that the Bill if enacted would be within the authority of the Dominion Parliament if amended to provide that nothing therein contained shall alter or affect the rights of any province in respect of any action or other civil proceeding commenced in any of the provincial courts and solely concerned with some subject-matter, legislation in relation to which is within the exclusive legislative competence of the legislature of such province.\nKerwin J.\u2014By Bill No. 9, introduced and read a first time in the House of Commons in the fourth session of the eighteenth Parliament of Canada, it was proposed to repeal section 54 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, chapter 35, and substitute a new section therefor. This Court was established under the power conferred by the following section (101) of the British North America Act, 1867 (hereafter referred to as the Act):\u2014\nThe Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, from Time to Time, provide for the Constitution, Maintenance and Organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada, and for the Establishment of any additional Courts for the better Administration of the Laws of Canada.\nThe present Supreme Court Act continues this Court as a general court of appeal for Canada, and section 54 provides:\u2014\nThe judgment of the Court shall, in all cases, be final and conclusive, and no appeal shall be brought from any judgment or order of the Court to any court of appeal established by the Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland, by which appeals or petitions to His Majesty in Council may be ordered to be heard, saving any right which His Majesty may be graciously pleased to exercise by virtue of his royal prerogative.\nThe primary object of the Bill is set forth in the first subsection of the proposed new section 54:\u2014\n(1) The Supreme Court shall have, hold and exercise exclusive ultimate appellate civil and criminal jurisdiction within and for Canada; and the judgment of the Court shall, in all cases, be final and conclusive.\nIt is undoubted that the effect of this and the other provisions of the new section would be to confer upon this Court not only appellate jurisdiction but exclusive and ultimate appellate civil and criminal jurisdiction within and for Canada, and to abolish any right of His Majesty in Council to entertain appeals from any court within Canada now or hereafter established whether by Dominion or provincial authority.\nIn British Coal Corporation v. The King71, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council determined that Parliament had effectively and validly abolished appeals in criminal cases to His Majesty in Council from any judgment or order of any court in Canada, by enacting in 1933, after the coming in force of the Statute of Westminster, 1931, the following as subsection 4 of section 1025 of the Criminal Code:\u2014\n4. Notwithstanding any royal prerogative or anything contained in the Interpretation Act or in the Supreme Court Act, no appeal shall be brought in any criminal case from any judgment or order of any court in Canada to any Court of Appeal or authority by which in the United Kingdom appeals or petitions to His Majesty in Council may be heard.\nIn substance, the question now submitted by the Governor General in Council for our opinion, is whether a similar power exists as regards civil cases. It will be convenient to investigate at the outset the position of appeals from Dominion Courts, that is, the Supreme Court of Canada and those additional courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada, which Parliament may constitute. This inquiry resolves itself into two heads, (a) the prerogative right of the Sovereign in Council to grant special leave to appeal from judgments of the Dominion Courts and (b) the power, if any, to appeal therefrom as of right. As applicable to both heads, it is of importance to recollect that in Crown Grain Company Limited v. Day72, it was determined that a provincial legislature could not circumscribe the appellate jurisdiction of this Court by attempting to make the judgment of a provincial court final in cases where the Supreme Court Act permitted an appeal; and that, notwithstanding the subject-matter of the litigation was within the domain of provincial legislation.\nFirstly then as to the prerogative right of the Sovereign in Council to grant special leave to appeal. While appeals in civil cases, either de jure or by grace, were not in question and were, therefore, not considered in the British Coal Corporation case73, their Lordships did state the present position of the prerogative right in general. They explained that in early days \"it was to the King that any subject who had failed to get justice in the King's Court brought his petition for redress.\" So far as English courts were concerned, this practice was altered whereby such petitions were brought to the King in Parliament or to the King in his Chancery, but from the Courts of the Plantations or Colonies, the petition went to the King in Council. This jurisdiction or prerogative right was settled and regulated by the Imperial Parliament in the Privy Council Acts of 1833 and 1844 and as a result, as their Lordships pointed out (page 512):\nAlthough in form the appeal was still to the King in Council, it was so in form only and became in truth an appeal to the Judicial Committee, which as such exercised as a Court of Law in reality, though not in name, the residual prerogative of the King in Council. No doubt it was the order of the King in Council which gave effect to their reports, but that order was in no sense other than in form either the King's personal order or the order of the general body of the Privy Council. That is, the Sovereign, by and with the consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in Parliament Assembled, through the instrumentality of Imperial statutes transferred the prerogative right to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. It therefore follows that in these matters the Sovereign has no personal discretion whatever and that under constitutional usage His Majesty in Council may not decline to give effect to the Judicial Committee's recommendations.\nPrior to the passing of the Statute of Westminster, 1931, the proper body to abolish the right, as settled and fixed by the Judicial Committee Acts referred to, to grant leave to appeal in a civil case from a decision of a Dominion court would have been the Imperial Parliament, but in my opinion that statute affords a complete answer to the first branch of the pending inquiry. The statute followed upon a series of declarations and resolutions set forth in the reports of the Imperial Conferences of 1926 and 1930 and according to one of the recitals of the statute, its enactment was deemed necessary\nfor the ratifying, confirming and establishing of certain of the said declarations and resolutions of the said Conference that a law be made and enacted in due form by authority of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\nIn truth the statute embodies in legislative form the established constitutional position of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations with respect to several matters. For present purposes, only sections 2 and 3 need be referred to:\u2014\n2. (1) The Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, shall not apply to any law made after the commencement of this Act by the Parliament of a Dominion.\n(2) No law and no provision of any law made after the commencement of this Act by the Parliament of a Dominion shall be void or inoperative on the ground that it is repugnant to the law of England, or to the provisions of any existing or future Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom, or to any order, rule or regulation made under any such Act, and the powers of the Parliament of a Dominion shall include the power to repeal or amend any such Act, order, rule or regulation in so far as the same is part of the law of the Dominion.\n3. It is hereby declared and enacted that the Parliament of a Dominion has full power to make laws having extra-territorial operation.\nBy the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, it was declared that the law of any colony should be void to the extent that it was repugnant to any Act of the Imperial Parliament extending to the colony or any order or regulation made under such Act, but by subsection 1 of section 2 of the Statute of Westminster, the Colonial Laws Validity Act is not to apply to any law passed after the commencement of the statute by the Parliament of the Dominion. The meaning of subsection 2 is beyond question. In view of several expressions of opinion by the highest authorities, it is perhaps unnecessary to call in aid the provisions of section 3 but certainly the combined effect of sections 2 and 3 is to remove the fetters that previously prevented Parliament from abolishing the right of the Judicial Committee to grant leave to appeal from a judgment of a Dominion court. In view of the plain wording of section 101 of the Act, the provinces enjoyed no such powers, and the reasoning and conclusion in the British Coal Corporation case74 that that Act invests Parliament with the power by necessary intendment, apply equally to civil as to criminal cases.\nWith reference to the second branch of the inquiry, my opinion is that Parliament has the power to prohibit appeals as of right from any Dominion court. In view of the grant and growth of self government in the Dominion, and subject to the special position of appeals in Admiralty to be mentioned later, this power existed and was recognized even before the Statute of Westminster. As stated in the British Coal Corporation case74 (page 520):\u2014\nIt is not doubted that with the single exception of what is called the prerogative appeal, that is, the appeal by special leave given in the Privy Council in London, matters of appeal from Canadian courts are within the legislative control of Canada, that is of the Dominion or the provinces as the case may be.\nFor the same reason that has been adverted to when considering the right to grant leave to appeal, the provinces have no power to prevent Parliament abolishing appeals as of right from Dominion courts and the necessary authority therefore resides in Parliament.\nAppeals in Admiralty require a more detailed investigation. The Exchequer Court of Canada, organized under the provisions of section 101 of the Act, was by a Canadian statute declared to be a Colonial Court of Admiralty under the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act 1890. By subsection 1 of section 6 of this last mentioned statute: \"The appeal from a judgment of any Court in a British possession in the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by this Act, either where there is, as of right, no local appeal or after a decision on local appeal, lies to Her Majesty the Queen in Council\"; and by section 15 the expression \"local appeal\" means \"an appeal to any Court inferior to Her Majesty in Council.\" In Richelieu and Ontario Navigation Company v. Owners of S.S. \"Cape Breton\",75 it was decided that by virtue of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act 1890, an appeal as of right could be brought from a decision of this court varying, on appeal, a judgment of a Local Judge in Admiralty. Following the enactment of the Statute of Westminster 1931, and particularly in view not only of sections 2 and 3 but also 5 and 6 of that statute, Parliament passed The Admiralty Act, 1934, chapter 31, establishing an Admiralty jurisdiction in the Exchequer Court. Sections 34 and 35 thereof provide:\u2014\n34. Notwithstanding anything in this Act contained, the pro visions of any law now in force in Canada providing for an appeal to His Majesty the King in Council in Admiralty matters shall continue to be in force and shall be deemed not to have been repealed.\n35. Saving the effect of the immediately preceding section, the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890, chapter twenty-seven of the Acts of the United Kingdom for the year 1890, is repealed in so far as the said Act is part of the law of Canada.\nSo that, as Dominion legislation stands, a suitor may still appeal as of right from a decision of this Court rendered upon appeal from the Exchequer Court on its Admiralty side. By Bill No. 9 this appeal would be abolished.\nThe ingenious contention is that as Parliament by The Admiralty Act, 1934, had repealed the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890 (with the exception noted), it thereby lost its jurisdiction in Admiralty, which, it is argued, was derived solely from the repealed Act. But that overlooks the fact that Parliament has jurisdiction under head 10 of section 91 of the Act over the subject matter of \"Navigation and Shipping\" and that it could, therefore, invest the Exchequer Court with jurisdiction over actions and suits in relation to that subject matter (Consolidated Distillers Limited v. The King)76. The limitations upon the exercise of its powers under head 10 of section 91 and the peace, order and good government clause imposed by the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, and the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890, having been removed by the Statute of Westminster, Parliament is now clothed with the same ample authority to abolish appeals as of right in Admiralty cases as it possesses with respect to appeals in civil cases generally from Dominion courts.\nAttention must now be directed to the problem as to whether Parliament has the requisite authority to abolish appeals as of right, or to abrogate the right of His Majesty in Council to grant leave to appeal, from decisions of provincial courts. Section 129 of the Act reads:\u2014\n129. Except as otherwise provided by this Act, all Laws in force in Canada, Nova Scotia, or New Brunswick at the Union, and all Courts of Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction, and all legal Commissions, Powers and authorities, and all Officers, Judicial, Administrative, and Ministerial, existing therein at the Union, shall continue in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick respectively, as if the Union had not been made; subject nevertheless (except with respect to such as are enacted by or exist under Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain or of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland), to be repealed, abolished, or altered by the Parliament of Canada, or by the legislature of the respective Province, according to the Authority of the Parliament or of that Legislature under this Act.\nAll laws in force on July 1st, 1867, in the four named provinces were by this section continued therein subject to the exception and proviso. By appropriate legislation or Imperial order in council the section was made to apply to each of the other provinces as of the date of its entry into the Union. It would therefore appear convenient to ascertain what laws touching appeals were in force in the nine provinces on the relevant dates.\nOntario and Quebec\nThe Constitutional Act, 1791, divided the old province of Quebec into Upper and Lower Canada. Section 34 provided:\u2014\nXXXIV. And whereas by an Ordinance passed in the Province of Quebec, the Governor and Council of the said Province were constituted a Court of Civil Jurisdiction, for hearing and determining Appeals in certain Cases therein specified, be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid That the Governor, or Lieutenant-Governor, or Person administering the Government of each of the said Provinces respectively, together with such executive Council as shall be appointed by His Majesty for the Affairs of such Province shall be a Court of Civil Jurisdiction within each of the said Provinces respectively for hearing and determining Appeals within the same, in the like Cases, and in the like Manner and Form, and subject to such Appeal therefrom, as such Appeals might before the passing of this Act have been heard and determined by the Governor and Council of the Province of Quebec; but subject nevertheless to such further or other Provisions as may be made in this Behalf, by Any act of the Legislative Council and Assembly of either of the said Provinces respectively assented to by His Majesty, His Heirs or Successors.\nThe important part of this section for our present purpose is the proviso at the end. The power thereby conferred was exercised in Upper Canada by chapter 2 of the statutes of 1794, and in Lower Canada by chapter 6 of the statutes of the same year.\nBy virtue of section 46 of the Act of Union, 1840 (Imperial), these enactments were continued in force subject to being varied by legislation of the provinces of Canada. Such legislation was duly passed so that when the Act was passed in 1867 there were in force chapter 13 of the statutes of 1859 providing for appeals as of right in Upper Canada, and chapter 77 of the statutes of 1861, and section 1178 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1867, providing for appeals as of right in Lower Canada. In each province the right of appeal was limited to certain cases.\nNova Scotia\nExcept possibly for the period 1861 to 1863, either the commissions or instructions issued to the Governors of the province of Nova Scotia, from time to time, contained regulations providing for an appeal to the Sovereign in Council. By an Imperial order in council of 1863 authority was conferred upon the Supreme Court of the province to grant leave to appeal in certain cases, but the right of Her Majesty to admit an appeal in any case, upon special petition, was expressly reserved. At the time of Union, therefore, there existed in Nova Scotia under an Imperial order in council, the right, by leave of the provincial Supreme Court, to appeal de jure in certain cases, and the right of the Sovereign in Council in any case to give leave to appeal as of grace. New Brunswick\nAppeals from the Supreme Court of New Brunswick were provided for and regulated by an Imperial order in council dated November 27th, 1852. In all relevant respects it corresponded to the order in council of 1863 relating to Nova Scotia.\nManitoba\nOn June 3rd, 1870, under the relevant provisions of the Act, an order in council admitted Rupert's Land and the Northwestern Territory into the Union. In anticipation of this step the Dominion Parliament had already passed The Manitoba Act in the same year, carving out of the newly admitted lands the Province of Manitoba. Any doubt as to the power of Parliament so do to was removed by the British North America Act of 1871. No order in council appears to have been issued regulating appeals from Rupert's Land or the Northwest Territories.\nBritish Columbia\nAn Imperial Statute of 1839, chapter 48, authorized Her Majesty from time to time to make provision for the administration of justice in Vancouver's Island, and for that purpose to constitute such court or courts of record and other courts as she should think fit. Section 3 enacted:\u2014\nIII. Provided always, and be it enacted, That all Judgments given in any Civil Suit in the said Island shall be subject to Appeal to Her Majesty in Council, in the Manner and subject to the Regulations in and subject to which Appeals are now brought from the Civil Courts of Canada, and to such further or other Regulations as Her Majesty with the Advice of Her Privy Council shall from Time to Time appoint.\nPursuant to this Act, an Imperial order in council of April 4, 1856, established a Supreme Court of Civil Justice of the Colony of Vancouver's Island, provided for an appeal to Her Majesty in Council in certain cases and preserved Her Majesty's prerogative right to grant leave to appeal in any case.\nIn 1858 the Colony of British Columbia (excluding Vancouver Island) was established by 21-22 Victoria, chapter 99 (Imperial), section 5 whereof, relating to appeals to Her Majesty in Council, corresponds to section 3 of the Act providing for the administration of justice in Vancouver's Island.\nOn November 19th, 1866, the Colony of Vancouver Island was united to the Colony of British Columbia under the name of \"British Columbia\" by a proclamation issued pursuant to 29-30 Victoria, chapter 66 (Imperial). This statute enacted that the laws in force in the separate colonies should be retained until otherwise provided by lawful authority, and the powers of Her Majesty in Council were left unaffected by anything in the statute.\nPursuant to an Imperial Order in Council, the Colony of British Columbia entered Confederation as of July 20th, 1871, at which date appeals from British Columbia courts would appear to be subject to the same terms and regulations as applied to appeals from Ontario and Quebec.\nPrince Edward Island\nIn Prince Edward Island a system of courts was established under the authority of the instructions issued to the Governors of the province, which instructions also provided for an appeal to Her Majesty in Council in certain circumstances.\nNo order in council was issued regulating these appeals down to July 1st, 1873, as of which date the province joined Confederation. Since only laws that were in force at that time were continued, the Common Law Procedure Act, 1873, passed by the General Assembly of the province on June 14th, 1873, would appear to have no relevancy as by its terms it was not to come into operation until January 1st, 1874. In any event, it is understood that the judges of the provincial Supreme Court did not exercise the powers conferred upon them by section 158 of the 1873 Act to make rules and regulations\ndirecting the mode of procedure, either pro hoc vice, or generally, as may be required, and as may not be inconsistent with the Royal instructions and the rules and mode of procedure of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\nAlberta and Saskatchewan\nThe British North America Act of 1871 conferred upon Parliament the power to establish new provinces in any territories forming part of the Dominion, and accordingly, by Dominion Acts of 1905, the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were constituted as of September 1st of that year. It has been mentioned previously, when speaking of Manitoba, that no order in council appears to have been issued regulating appeals from Rupert's Land or the Northwest Territories (out of which these two provinces were formed).\nThese being the laws with respect to appeals to His Majesty in Council, in force in the several provinces as of the date of their entry into the Union, it may be stated that subsequent thereto appeals were regulated by Imperial orders in council passed with respect to British Columbia in 1887, Manitoba in 1892, and finally with respect to each province except Ontario and Quebec in 1910 and 1911,\nwith a view of equalizing as far as may be the conditions under which Her Majesty's subjects in the British Dominions beyond the Seas shall have a right of appeal to Her Majesty in Council.\nIt is now necessary to revert to the provisions of section 129 of the Act. By virtue of that part of the section which appears in brackets, all such laws, that were enacted by or existed under Imperial Acts, could not be repealed, abolished or altered either by Parliament or by the provincial legislatures; if they were not of that description, they might be repealed, abolished or altered by the proper legislative body \"according to the authority of the Parliament or of that legislature under this Act.\" Primarily, it is contended that these laws fall in the second division and that the provincial legislatures have the required authority under the Act; in the alternative it is contended that, if they fall within the first division, the effect of sections 2 and 7 of the Statute of Westminster is to invest the legislatures with the necessary power.\nThe alternative argument may first be noticed. Section 2 of the Statute of Westminster has already been referred to; section 7 is as follows:\u2014\n7. (1) Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to apply to the repeal, amendment or alteration of the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1930, or any order, rule or regulation made thereunder.\n(2) The provisions of section two of this Act shall extend to laws made by any of the Provinces of Canada and to the powers of the legislatures of such Provinces.\n(3) The powers conferred by this Act upon the Parliament of Canada or upon the legislatures of the Provinces shall be restricted to the enactment of laws in relation to matters within the competence of the Parliament of Canada or of any of the legislatures of the Provinces respectively. The effect of subsection 2 of section 7 is that the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, will not apply to any law made after the commencement of the statute by the legislature of a province, and that no law so made will be void or inoperative on the ground that it is repugnant to the law of England or to the provisions of any existing or future Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom, or to any order, rule or regulation made under such Act, and the powers of a provincial legislature shall include the power to repeal or amend any such Act, order, rule or regulation in so far as the same is part of the law of the province. Subsection 2 must, of course, be read in conjunction with the other subsections and in my opinion the proper construction of section 7, upon a consideration of all its provisions, requires that a province or the Dominion be restricted to the powers of legislation conferred upon the legislature or Parliament, as the case may be, by the Act. The Statute of Westminster does not enlarge the classes of subjects within which fall those matters in relation to which Parliament or a legislature may make laws. If, but for the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, or any other Imperial Act applying to the Dominion, a provincial legislature would have been empowered by the Act to legislate upon a given matter, the restrictions imposed by those statutes are removed by the Statute of Westminster, but no alteration is made in the division of subjects between the two authorities. It must also be borne in mind that while by section 3 of the Statute of Westminster the doctrine prohibiting extra-territorial legislation ceased to apply to Parliament that section, unlike section 2, was not made applicable to the provincial legislatures.\nThe summaries of the laws in force in each of the provinces at the relevant dates demonstrate that, except in the cases of Ontario and Quebec, and possibly British Columbia, they existed by virtue of the Judicial Committee Acts of 1833 and 1844 or Imperial orders in council passed in pursuance thereof. They, therefore, fall within that part of section 129 that appears in brackets and for the reasons given immediately above may not be repealed, abolished or altered by the provincial legislatures unless these bodies already possess the necessary power under the Act.\nThis brings us to a consideration of the first contention. It is said generally on behalf of all those provinces that deny the jurisdiction of Parliament to enact the provisions of Bill 9, that their legislatures have the necessary authority under one of three heads of section 92 of the Act:\u2014\n1. The Amendment from Time to Time, notwithstanding anything in this Act, of the Constitution of the Province, except as regards the Office of Lieutenant-Governor.\n13. Property and Civil Rights in the Province.\n14. The Administration of Justice in the Province, including the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those Courts.\nTaking these in reverse order, it will be noticed that by the very terms of head 14, the administration of justice is confined to the provinces, the courts which the provincial legislatures are authorized to constitute, maintain and organize are provincial courts, and the procedure in civil matters is confined to procedure in those, i.e., provincial courts. At page 520 of the judgment in the British Coal Corporation case77 appears a statement, already set out, which together with the preceding sentence is relied upon by the provinces. It seems advisable to reproduce the entire passage:\u2014\nA most essential part of the administration of justice consists of the system of appeals. It is not doubted that with the single exception of what is called the prerogative appeal, that is, the appeal by special leave given in the Privy Council in London, matters of appeal from Canadian Courts are within the legislative control of Canada that is of the Dominion or of the provinces as the case may be.\nOne argument based upon this passage is that the reference to the provinces would have been unnecessary if their Lordships had not felt that authority to deal with appeals here under review was in the provincial domain. But their Lordships pointed out at the end of the judgment that they had been dealing only with the legal position in Canada in regard to appeals in criminal matters and that it was neither necessary nor desirable to touch on the position as regards civil cases. There must always be kept in mind the particular thing with which a judgment is dealing. The difficulty of discovering language applicable only to particular circumstances is shown by the fact that if one's attention is confined to the sentence in the British Coal judgment preceding the passage quoted above, it would appear as if it were categorically stated that the power to constitute law courts and regulate their procedure was by the Act vested only in the Dominion legislature; whereas it is well known, and the succeeding part of the judgment indicates, that certain powers with reference to the law courts are vested in the provinces.\nThe second argument, founded upon the first sentence in this passage, is that the phrase in head 14 of section 92, \"administration of justice,\" conferred the power upon the legislatures to establish and regulate a system of appeals. Now it has been made clear in the Crown Grain case78 that the administration of justice, confined as it is to the provinces, is certainly not sufficient to permit the legislatures to deal with appeals from the provincial courts to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the proper conclusion appears to be that His Majesty in Council or the Judicial Committee cannot in any sense of the term be deemed \"Provincial Courts\" and that the legislatures are still territorially restricted.\nAs to head 13, while the right to launch an appeal to His Majesty in Council may be said to be a right in the province since a litigant in the provincial courts is either a resident of the province or has attorned to the jurisdiction, the effective part of the proceeding is the hearing and determination of the appeal; and as to these, it cannot be said that they are rights in the province. It follows, I think, from the decision in Brassard v. Smith79, that unless all the elements of the right exists in the province, head 13 can have no application.\nIn truth, if the provinces have not power under head 14, it is difficult to see how head 13 can have any application. As Viscount Haldane stated in John Deere Plow Company, Limited v. Wharton80:\u2014\nThe expression \"civil rights in the province\" is a very wide one, extending, if interpreted literally, to much of the field of the other heads of s. 92 and also to much of the field of s. 9.1. But the expression cannot be so interpreted and it must be regarded as excluding cases expressly dealt with elsewhere in the two sections, notwithstanding the generality of the words.\nWith reference to the subject matter of the appeal in that case, His Lordship had already pointed out that unless heads 11 and 13 were read disjunctively the limitation in the former, \"the incorporation of companies with provincial objects,\" would be nugatory. Similarly in the present instance, the limitation \"in the province\" in head 14 would have no application if the power under head 13 to enable an appeal to be launched carried with it the power to permit or abolish its hearing and determination.\nAs to head 1 of section 92, it must first be observed that the salient word \"Constitution\" is found in many parts of the Act. It appears in the first recital, \"A Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom \"; in section 22 \"In relation to the Constitution of the Senate\"; in the heading of Part V \"Provincial Constitutions \"; in section 64 (which is included in Part V) \"The Constitution of the Executive Authority in each of the Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick \"; in section 88 (also included in Part V) \"The Constitution of the Legislature of each of the Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick\"; in head 27 of section 91 \"except the Constitution of Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction\"; then in head 1 of section 92; and in section 101. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list but it is sufficient to indicate that the word is used in different senses throughout the Act. In head 1 of section 92, it must, I think, refer, as to the executive power, to such things as the appointment of Lieutenant-Governors and Provincial Administrators, and as to the legislative power, to such things as the legislatures for the provinces; all of these matters being dealt with by sections appearing under Part V. It can have no reference to such a particular subject as is identified by head 14.\nIf a province does not possess that authority, it has been made clear by a number of decisions of the Judicial Committee, some of which are referred to in the British Coal Corporation case81, that such power must necessarily reside in the Dominion. It will be remembered that Bill 9 proposes to amend the Dominion statute respecting the Supreme Court of Canada. Under the opening clause of section 91, Parliament may make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, and by section 101 \"The Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, from time to time, provide for the constitution, maintenance and organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada.\" In my opinion the power thereby conferred includes the power to make the decisions of such appellate court exclusive and ultimate. The reasons set forth in Nadan's case82, as explained in the British Coal Corporation case83, as to why Parliament could not, prior to the Statute of Westminster, abolish appeals as of grace in criminal cases, apply with equal force to explain the inability of Parliament during that period to compel a litigant desirous of appealing from the judgment of a provincial court to apply to the Supreme Court of Canada, if his suit fell within the jurisdiction of that court, and otherwise to abide by the decision against him. These restrictions have been removed by the Statute of Westminster and therefore, so far as all the provinces except Ontario and Quebec and possibly British Columbia are concerned, Parliament may validly enact the provisions of Bill 9.\nIt is now necessary to refer to an additional argument presented on behalf of Ontario, which is to this effect. By assenting to the Constitutional Act of 1791 His Majesty must be taken not only to have abandoned the prerogative right to regulate appeals as of right from Upper Canada to the Sovereign in Council but to have transferred it to the Legislative Council and Assembly of that province; that such transferred prerogative was so regulated by statute, which was continued in force by the Act of Union, 1840; that it was regulated by the Parliament of Canada by legislation, applying to Upper Canada, which existed at the time of Confederation and which was continued in force by section 129 of the Act; that thereafter Ontario continued to regulate appeals as of right and effectively abolish them, except under the condition set forth in its legislation. So much may be conceded. The remainder of the argument that Ontario has also acquired the power to abolish the right of His Majesty in Council to grant special leave to appeal is, under the authorities, not so obvious.\nGranting, however, the entire premises and conclusion of this contention, it will be recollected that the power deemed to reside in Parliament to make the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada exclusive and ultimate may be exercised \"notwithstanding anything contained in this Act.\" This non obstante clause places the Dominion power on the same footing as those conferred by the specially enumerated heads of section 91. As to these, their Lordships pointed out in Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. Attorney-General for Canada (Combines Investigation Act case) 84:\u2014\nIf then the legislation in question is authorized under one or other of the heads specifically enumerated in s. 91, it is not to the purpose to say that it affects property and civil rights in the provinces. Most of the specific subjects in s. 91 do affect property and civil rights but so far as the legislation of Parliament in pith and substance is operating within the enumerated powers there is constitutional authority to interfere with property and civil rights. The same principle would apply to s. 92, head 14, the administration of justice in the province.\nIn Crown Grain Company Limited v. Day85, it is stated:\u2014\nIt is inconceivable that a Court of Appeal could be established without its jurisdiction being at the same time defined.\nThe pith and substance of the proposed Bill is the jurisdiction of that General Court of Appeal, so that even if Ontario had authority the two powers overlap and \"the enactment of the Dominion Parliament must prevail.\" Crown Grain Company Limited v. Day86; Attorney-General of Canada v. Attorney-General of British Columbia (Fish Canneries case) 87; In Re Silver Bros.88.\nStress was placed upon a passage in the judgment of Viscount Haldane in the Board of Commerce case89. The paragraph in which these words appear is as follows (the particular passage being italicized):\u2014\nFor analogous reasons the words of head 27 of s. 91 do not assist the argument for the Dominion. It is one thing to\" construe the words \"the criminal law, except the constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction, but including the procedure in criminal matters,\" as enabling the Dominion Parliament to exercise exclusive legislative power where the subject matter is one which by its very nature belongs to the domain of criminal jurisprudence. A general law, to take an example, making incest a crime, belongs to this class. It is quite another thing, first to attempt to interfere with a class of subject committed exclusively to the Provincial Legislature, and then to justify this by enacting ancillary provisions, designated as new phases of Dominion criminal law which require a title to so interfere as basis of their application. For analogous reasons their. Lordships think that s. 101 of the British North America Act, which enables the Parliament of Canada, notwithstanding anything in the Act, to provide for the establishment of any additional Courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada, cannot be read as enabling that Parliament to trench on Provincial rights, such as the powers over property and civil rights in the Provinces exclusively conferred on their Legislatures. Full significance can be attached to the words in question without reading them as implying such capacity on the part of the Dominion Parliament. It is essential in such cases that the new judicial establishment should be a means to some end competent to the latter.\nIt is quite evident that Viscount Haldane was there applying a well-known principle to the legislation in question by pointing out that Parliament could not, under the guise of establishing a provincial court for the better administration of the laws of Canada, really legislate upon matters of provincial concern. That principle has no application in the present case where Bill 9 deals with the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada, a subject matter within its exclusive power.\nIn all relevant respects Quebec is in the same position as Ontario. On behalf of British Columbia, it was urged that in view of section 3 of The Vancouver's Island Act of 1839 and section 5 of The Colony of British Columbia Act of 1858, the situation of that province, under section 129 of the Act, was identical with that of Ontario. It is not necessary to determine whether that be so or not, but certainly British Columbia stands in no higher position.\nThe views expressed with reference to the other six provinces add force to the opinion as to Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia. Without the use of express words, it could surely not have been intended that in a matter of this kind three provinces; should be able to exercise a power denied to the others. From time to time all provincial courts are engaged in the duty of construing and enforcing Acts of Parliament and as to these particularly it is not to be expected that in some provinces an appeal could be taken only to this court, while in others an alternative right to appeal or ask for leave to appeal, to His Majesty in Council would still exist. If that were so, the court could not properly be described as \"a General Court of Appeal for Canada.\"\nFor these reasons I would answer the question submitted to us \"Yes, in its entirety.\" Hudson J.\u2014His Excellency the Governor General in Council has submitted to this Court for its opinion a question in the following language:\nIs said Bill No. 9, entitled An Act to amend the Supreme Court Act, or any of the provisions thereof, and in what particular or particulars or to what extent, intra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\nBill No. 9 referred to proposes, first, to give the Supreme Court of Canada exclusive ultimate appellate civil and criminal jurisdiction within and for Canada; secondly, to abolish appeals to the Privy Council; and thirdly, to repeal the Judicial Committee Act of 1833 and the Judicial Committee Act of 1844, of the statutes of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and all orders, rules or regulations made thereunder in so far as they affect Canada.\nThe validity of the Bill was supported by the Dominion and the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and opposed by Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, British Columbia and Alberta. Neither Quebec nor Prince Edward Island took any part.\nIn the division of legislative power between the Dominion and the provinces consequent upon Confederation, there was allotted to the provinces by the British North America Act, section 92 (14),\nExclusive Powers of Provincial Legislatures\n92. In each Province the Legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to Matters coming within the Classes of Subjects next hereinafter enumerated; that is to say,\n* * *\n14. The Administration of Justice in the Province, including the Constitution, Maintenance and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in these Courts.\nUnder the authority of this provision, the provinces have defined the constitutions of their several courts and provided for their maintenance and organization.\nBut to enable these courts to function, the judges who interpret and apply the law must be appointed by the Dominion who must pay their salaries and under whose authority alone they can be removed; sections 96, 99 and 100; Toronto Corporation v. York90. The laws administered in the provincial courts are the laws applicable to the causes coming before them, whether these laws be within the legislative competence of the province or of the Dominion.\nThe Dominion may impose additional duties on the judges and utilize the machinery of these courts to enforce Dominion laws of a special character, such as Dominion election petitions and bankruptcy; see Valin v. Langlois91 and Cushing v. Dupuy92.\nFrom final decisions of these provincial courts an appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada, which was established under the authority of section 101 of the British North America Act:\n101. The Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, from Time to Time, provide for the Constitution, Maintenance and Organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada, and for the Establishment of any additional Courts for the better Administration of the Laws of Canada.\nA province cannot take away or impair the jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court by the Dominion Act in respect of matters otherwise purely provincial: Crown Grain v. Day93. Nor has a provincial legislature any power to grant an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada: Union Colliery v. Attorney-General for British Columbia94.\nThe Bill under consideration, if it became law, would make this Court the exclusive, final tribunal in all Canadian cases.\nAn appeal may also be brought from the provincial courts to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in all except criminal cases. There are two classes of such appeals: First, what are called \"prerogative appeals\" by which the Judicial Committee may, if they see fit, grant leave to any litigant to appeal thereto from any decision of any court, either Dominion or provincial. The second class is where provision has been made for what are called appeals as of right. In the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, this has been done by legislation purporting to authorize appeals to the Judicial Committee subject to defined conditions, and in the other provinces there are somewhat similar provisions made by orders in council. The Bill under consideration would abolish appeals of both classes.\nIn criminal matters there is no longer any right of appeal to the Judicial Committee from any court, either Dominion or provincial In 1933, an amendment was made to the Criminal Code of Canada, section 17 of the Statutes of 23 and 24, Geo. V, as follows:\nSubsection 4 of section 10 of the said Act (the Criminal Code) is repealed and is hereby re-enacted as follows:\u2014\nNotwithstanding any royal prerogative or anything contained in the Interpretation Act or in the Supreme Court Act, no appeal shall be brought in any criminal case from any judgment or order of any court in Canada to any court of appeal or authority in which in the United Kingdom appeals or petitions to His Majesty may be heard.\nThe validity of this provision was upheld in the case of British Coal Corporation v. The King95. Therefore, future appeals in all criminal matters are effectually barred. In giving the judgment of the Committee, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Sankey, stated:\nIt is here neither necessary nor desirable to touch on the position as regards civil cases.\nBut the reasons for arriving at this judgment lead inevitably to the conclusion that the Canadian Parliament has a right to abolish any right to appeal to the Judicial Committee in any matter falling within the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament, including an appeal from the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in any matter whatsoever.\nThere remains for consideration the matter of appeals from the decisions of provincial courts where the law involved is within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the provinces.\nPrior to 1833, the right of the Sovereign in Council to entertain, by way of special leave, appeals from any court in His Majesty's Dominions beyond the seas, was a settled part of the royal prerogative: \"a residuum of the royal prerogative of the Sovereign as the fountain of justice \"; British Coal Corporation v. The King96. This appellate jurisdiction was usually exercised in a Committee of the Whole Privy Council which having heard the allegations and proofs, made their report to His Majesty in Council, by whom a judgment was finally given. In 1833 there was passed an Act of the Imperial Parliament, 3-4 William IV, chap. 41, entitled An Act for the better administration of justice in His Majesty's Privy Council, later given the short title of The Judicial Committee Act, 1833. This Act created a statutory body called \"The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,\" and is the basis of the present constitution and procedure of this tribunal. It recites, inter alia, that\nfrom the decisions of various courts of judicature in the East Indies and in the Plantations, Colonies and other Dominions of His Majesty abroad, an appeal lies to His Majesty in Council;\nand proceeds to provide for the more effectual hearing and reporting of appeals to His Majesty in Council and on other matters, and for giving powers and jurisdiction to His Majesty in Council. The Act goes on to provide for the formation of a Committee of His Majesty's Privy Council to be styled \"The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council\"; and enacts that\nall appeals, or complaints in the nature of appeals whatever which, either by virtue of this Act, or of any law, statute or custom, may be brought before His Majesty or His Majesty in Council\nfrom the order of any court or judge, should thereafter be referred by His Majesty to, and heard by the Judicial Committee as established by the Act, who should make a report or recommendation to His Majesty in Council for his decision thereon, the nature of such report or recommendation being always stated in open court.\nIt would appear, therefore, that this Act and the Supplementary Act of 1844 did not change the character of the jurisdiction but merely provided a more efficient method of exercising it. Reference here might be made to a statement of Lord Watson in the case of Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for Ontario97. At page 208 he said:\nBy a clause in the statutes of 1890 and 1891 (Statutes of Ontario and Canada), it is enacted that when the arbitrators proceed on their view of a disputed question of law, \"the award shall set forth the same at the instance of either party, and the award shall be subject to appeal so far as it relates to such decision to the Supreme Court, and thence to the Privy Council of England, in case their Lordships are pleased to entertain the appeal.\" The concluding part of that enactment ignores the constitutional rule that an appeal lies to Her Majesty, and not to this Board; and that no such jurisdiction can be conferred upon their Lordships, who are merely the advisers of the Queen, by any legislation either of the Dominion or of the Provinces of Canada.\nOn the granting of self-government, many of the royal prerogatives passed to the Provinces, and, at Confederation, these and some others were distributed between the Dominion and the provinces largely in accordance with the distribution of legislative power.\nThere remained, however, some prerogatives which did not pass either to the Dominion or to the provinces. They have sometimes been referred to as \"Imperial prerogatives.\"During the past few decades with the broadening of Dominion status these Imperial prerogatives, in so far as they affected Canadian affairs, passed progressively under Dominion control. To illustrate by recent events, His Majesty now makes a declaration of war so far as it affects Canada on the advice of his Canadian Ministers. Again, by the Statute of Westminster, any alteration made in the succession to the Throne was made subject to the approval of the Dominion. When a change became necessary, this was done, first, with the approval of the Canadian Ministers and afterwards confirmed by the Parliament of Canada.\nThe prerogative of appeal is the only one affecting Canadian affairs which continues to be exercised without the active participation of the Dominion. There were two initial legal obstacles in the way of Dominion legislation abrogating this particular prerogative. The first was that by reason of the operation of the Colonial Laws Validity Act such legislation by Canada would be repugnant to the Judicial Committee Acts of 1833 and 1844, and void for that reason. The second was that it. would be in the nature of extra-territorial legislation and for that reason beyond the power of Parliament: see Nadan v. The King98. However, these obstacles were removed by the Statute of Westminster: see British Coal Corporation case99.\nNow it is contended on behalf of a majority of the provinces that whatever remains of this prerogative is something in which they have rights and, for that reason, cannot be taken away by the Canadian Parliament. The rights of the provinces must be found within the four corners of the British North America Act. Before dealing with the particular sections of this Act, there are some general observations which merit consideration.\nPrior to Confederation, each of the original Provinces was in the nature of a unitary state. Each had general power to make laws for the peace, order and good government within the province. There was no restriction on the establishment of courts and the appointment of judges. They were in fact subject to no limitations except those imposed by the Imperial Parliament, or retained in the way of royal prerogatives. Upon Confederation, however, such powers of the provinces were greatly restricted. In addition to the distribution of legislative power, some of the Imperial prerogatives were transferred to the Dominion and many of those formerly enjoyed by the Provinces were also transferred to the Dominion.\nThe Governor in Council now appoints and can dismiss the Lieutenant-Governors of the provinces. The Dominion pays their salaries. The Governor General in Council now has power to disallow provincial statutes. This could not be done by His Majesty in Council (other than his Council in Canada). As has been said before, the Governor General in Council now appoints the judges of the provincial courts as well as those of the Dominion, and the Dominion pays the salaries of all. Perhaps the most important is that the reserve power to legislate for peace, order and good government was allotted to the Dominion Parliament and specific powers alone went to the provinces.\nThere is no mention whatever in the British North America Act of appeals to the Judicial Committee or in fact to any other tribunal, except only the provision in section 101 for the establishment of a general court of appeal for Canada.\nThe British Coal Corporation case100, establishes that the right to control appeals to the Judicial Committee must now be a matter coming within the jurisdiction of either the Canadian Parliament or the provincial legislatures.\nAs has been stated, the reserve power to legislate for peace, order and good government is vested in the Canadian Parliament and, therefore, unless something can be found in the provisions of the Act which confer this power on the provinces, the Dominion must have that power. As was stated by Sir Montague Smith in the case of Citizens Insurance Company v. Parsons101:\nThe first question to be decided is, whether the Act impeached in the present appeals falls within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in sect. 92, and assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces; for if it does not, it can be of no validity, and no other question would then arise. It is only when an Act of the provincial legislature prima facie falls within one of these classes of subjects that the further questions arise, viz., whether, notwithstanding this is so, the subject of the Act does not also fall within one of the enumerated classes of subjects in sect. 91, and whether the power of the provincial legislature is or is not thereby overborne.\nSection 92 enumerates the subjects assigned exclusively to the provinces. Of these the only relevant head of provincial legislative jurisdiction would appear to be section 92 (14).\n14. The Administration of Justice in the Province, including the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those Courts.\nThe first and controlling phrase is \"the administration of justice in the province.\" These words in their natural sense mean the enforcement of justice according to law in the province. They would imply authority to provide machinery necessary for that purpose. They would not imply making law. They might or might not imply the creation of courts for the interpretation and application of law. But the following words make clear the extent and limitation of any such implication, that is,\nincluding the constitution, maintenance and organization of Provincial courts, both of civil and of criminal jurisdiction, and the procedure in civil matters in those courts.\nIt is obvious that the provincial courts must be courts functioning within the province and whose jurisdiction is limited by territorial boundaries of the province.\nNow the administration of justice means the enforcement of all justice according to law, civil or criminal, Dominion or provincial, and the judges of the courts who are to interpret and apply the law for the purposes of such administration in the provinces are to interpret and apply both Dominion and provincial laws, and this in fact is what is done. The courts are for all parties commonly the subjects of both jurisdictions. While a province constitutes these courts and supplies the machinery for and does enforce the law, the function of judicature is entrusted to judges appointed and paid by Canada and not by the provinces. The Dominion may also impose additional duties on the judges and utilize the machinery of those courts to enforce Dominion laws of a special character, such as Dominion Election Petitions and Bankruptcy. Although called provincial courts they are in truth created by joint action, by and for the benefit of both jurisdictions.\nThe composition of these courts and the character of the business entrusted to them rebut any implication there might be that a province had a right to control appeals therefrom to any external tribunal.\nThen there is the objection of extra-territoriality found fatal to the attempted repeal in question in the Nadan case, supra. Although this objection was removed by section 3 of the Statute of Westminster so far as it affected the Dominion, it still subsists in the case of the provinces. I am of the opinion that this section does not give the provinces the power for which they contend.\nIt was also contended on behalf of the provinces that subsections 1 and 13 of section 92 might supply jurisdiction. But I am unable to see that either of these confers any such power. In any event, heading 14 is the compartment dealing with the subject-matter and for this reason would exclude application on the others.\nAnother argument advanced on behalf of the provinces was based on section 129 of the British North America Act, as follows:\n129. Except as otherwise provided by this Act, all Laws in force in Canada, Nova Scotia, or New Brunswick at the Union, and all Courts of Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction, and all legal Commissions, Powers and Authorities, and all Officers, Judicial, Administrative, and Ministerial, existing therein at the Union, shall continue in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick respectively, as if the Union had not been made; subject nevertheless (except with respect to such as are enacted by or exist under Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain or of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland), to be repealed, abolished, or altered by the Parliament of Canada, or by the Legislature of the respective Province, according to the Authority of the Parliament or of that Legislature under this Act. The obvious purpose of this section was to provide for continuity of law and administration until the new Parliament and new legislatures were organized, assembled and able to function. I think it was clearly not the intention to alter the distribution of powers made by sections 91 and 92. The introductory words \"Except as otherwise provided by this Act\" make this perfectly plain.\nIf my view is correct that none of the headings in section 92 confer on the provincial legislatures, expressly or impliedly, power to abolish the right of appeal, then the reserve powers of the Dominion would come automatically into operation, and it is, therefore, \"otherwise provided\" in the Act that the Dominion should have any rights which the provinces theretofore may have had in the matter.\nA very able and interesting argument was presented to us on behalf of Ontario and by counsel for several of the other provinces, based in the case of Ontario on the Constitutional Act of 1791, and in several of the other provinces on subsequent orders in council; but holding the views that I do it is not necessary to discuss the points raised by them. I would just make one observation here. It must never be overlooked that with the passing of this Act there was a new orientation of powers, prerogative as well as legislative.\nFor complete accuracy, it should be stated that references herein to provincial courts do not apply to those inferior jurisdictions under consideration in a reference before this Court, the judgment in which is reported102.\nThere remains to be considered the extent of the power conferred upon the Dominion by section 101. This provides:\n101. The Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, from Time to Time, provide for the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada, and for the Establishment of any additional Courts for the better Administration of the Laws of Canada.\nThe extent of the power thus conferred came before the Judicial Committee for consideration in the case of Crown Grain v. Day103. The circumstances in this case were that the Manitoba Legislature had passed a Mechanics' and Wage Earners' Lien Act applying to the suit under appeal. This statute enacted that in suits relating to liens the judgment of the Manitoba court of King's Bench should be final and that there should be no appeal therefrom. It was held that a provincial Act could not circumscribe the appellate jurisdiction granted by the Dominion Act. Lord Robertson, in giving the opinion of the Board, said at page 507:\nThe appellants maintain that the implied condition of the power of the Dominion Parliament to set up a Court of Appeal was that the Court so set up should be liable to have its jurisdiction circumscribed by provincial legislation dealing with those subject-matters of litigation which, like that of contracts, are committed to the provincial Legislatures. The argument necessarily goes so far as to justify the wholesale exclusion of appeals in suits relating to matters within the region of provincial legislation. As this region covers the larger part of the common subjects of litigation, the result would be the virtual defeat of the main purposes of the Court of Appeal.\nIt is to be observed that the subject in conflict belongs primarily to the subject-matter committed to the Dominion Parliament, namely, the establishment of the Court of Appeal for Canada. But, further, let it be assumed that the subject-matter is open to both legislative bodies; if the powers thus overlap, the enactment of the Dominion Parliament must prevail. This has already been laid down in Dobie v. Temporalities Board104, and Grand Trunk Ry. Co. of Canada v. Attorney-General of Canada105.\nSection 101 is included in a group of sections forming a distinct division of the Act under the heading \"7. Judicature\" wherein provision is made for the appointment, payment, retirement and removal of judges and concludes with the provision for a general court of appeal. It would seem to me that, reading the sections of this division together with other sections of the Act, there is envisaged the ultimate establishment of a complete system of judicature within Canada with a final, general court of appeal of a last resort in Canada, and this should be established when and with whatever jurisdiction Parliament might from time to time decide.\nAs has already been observed, there is no provision in the Act relating to appeals beyond Canada, but, undoubtedly, when the Act was passed in 1867 the prerogative right to appeal by special leave existed. But that did not necessarily mean that litigants who wished to appeal might not first be obliged to come to the Supreme Court of Canada. The words \"a general court of appeal for Canada\" surely imply only one court of appeal and it would appear to be anomalous that there should be concurrently a right of appeal to two different courts. This situation could not be effectively corrected until the passing of the Statute of Westminster, not because of any provisions in the British North America Act but because of external constitutional limitations. These having been removed, I can see no reason why the Dominion should not exercise the full powers given by this section, either expressly or impliedly and make the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada final and conclusive and without appeal.\nA special argument was raised in regard to admiralty appeals, but I think this argument is shortly and definitely answered by the fact that \"navigation and shipping\" is a subject which is expressly allotted to the Dominion under section 91 of the Act, and the reasoning by which the conclusion was arrived at in the British Coal Corporation case106, that Canada had the power to make the decision of the Supreme Court final in regard to criminal matters, applies equally in regard to admiralty cases.\nFor these reasons, I would answer the question submitted in the affirmative and say that a Bill in substantially the form of Bill No. 9 would be intra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\n1 [1935] A.C. 500, at 510.\n2 [1935] A:C. 500, at 510, 511.\n3 [1926] A.C. 482.\n4 [1935] A.C. 500.\n5 [1926] A.C. 482.\n6 [1896] A.C. 348 (Attorney-General for Ontario v.

He applied his brakes, and the engine of his car stalled but the car kept going and stopped with its rear end over the east side of the railway track. He saw that the train was 1,000 feet or more distant, he alighted, went to the back of his car, waved signals to the train to stop, alternating with attempts to push the car off the track, until the train (which had kept sounding warning whistles) was near (60 or 70 feet away, when plaintiff first realized it was not going to stop, according to his evidence), when he ran to get behind a \u201cwig-wag\u201d signal post on the northeast corner of the crossing. When he had nearly reached the post, he slipped and in falling threw his arm around the post and at that moment his car, being struck and thrown forward by the train, crashed into the post and crushed his arm. He sued defendant railway company for damages for personal injuries and damage to his car.\nAt trial with a jury, plaintiff was non-suited without submission of his case to the jury. The Court of Appeal for Ontario ([1940] 2 D.L.R. 101) held that there was no evidence that defendant was the cause of plaintiff\u2019s personal injuries; that plaintiff himself was the sole cause; but that, with respect to the claim for damage to the car, plaintiff might be entitled to the verdict of a jury on the questions whether the train could have been stopped and whether it ought to have been stopped before it reached the crossing; and plaintiff was given a right to elect for a new trial limited to that claim, but as he did not so elect his appeal was dismissed. He appealed to this Court.\nHeld: Plaintiff was entitled to have his claims, both for damage to his car and for personal injuries, submitted to a jury.\nPer the Chief Justice, Davis and Taschereau JJ.: It was open to the jury to take the view that the train could have been stopped and that it was negligent not to stop it to avoid collision with the motor car on the ground that defendant\u2019s engine driver, seeing plaintiff and his car, his signals and attempts to move the car, had not exercised the reasonable care incumbent upon him to employ in order to avoid unnecessary injury to property and persons on the highway; and the jury might properly have considered that to this negligence was proximately due the emergency which plaintiff said confronted him when he first realized (if the jury accepted his evidence as to when he first realized) that the train was not going to stop. If on these questions of fact the jury found against defendant, then the question of fact would remain for the jury whether plaintiff\u2019s injuries were solely the result of negligent conduct of himself or were, in part at least, caused by the negligence of defendant. As to defendant\u2019s contention that, in view of plaintiff\u2019s direction in running and the way his injuries occurred, his injuries did not follow in the ordinary course of things from its negligence, if there was such\u2014that issue depends upon the answer to the question (which was for the jury) whether or not plaintiff\u2019s conduct when he ran for safety was so unreasonable in the particular circumstances as to take it outside of the category, the ordinary course of things. While remoteness of damage in itself is no question for the jury, issues as to reasonable conduct are questions for the jury.\nWhere the evidence is such that it should have been submitted to the jury, the power of the Court of Appeal to dismiss the action on the ground that on the whole of the facts in evidence only one reasonable conclusion could be arrived at (Ontario Judicature Act, s. 26) is a power which must be exercised with caution and, generally speaking, only when it is quite clear that the Court of Appeal has all the available evidence before it (Paquin v. Beauclerk, [1906] A.C. 148, at 161; McPhee v. Esquimalt & Nanaimo Ry. Co., 49 Can. S.C.R. 43; Skeate v. Slaters, [1914] 2 K.B. 429).\nSec. 48 of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 288, has no application to the present case, where the role of the automobile was simply that of a projectile moving under the impulse of a blow from a railway train delivered at a highway crossing.\nPer Crocket J.: There was sufficient evidence to go to the jury on the question whether defendant\u2019s engineer could have avoided hitting the motor car by the exercise of due care; and it follows that there was sufficient evidence to leave to the jury upon the further issue as to whether plaintiff\u2019s injuries, which immediately followed, were the direct and natural consequences of the train hitting and throwing the car in the direction in which plaintiff ran; this involves consideration of the question whether plaintiff, when he realized or should have realized that the train would hit the car, could in the existing circumstances have avoided the injuries by exercise of reasonable care; and that was a question peculiarly for the jury.\nPer Hudson J.: There was some evidence which might properly have been submitted to the jury as to whether or not defendant\u2019s employees saw or reasonably should have seen plaintiff\u2019s predicament in time to stop the train and avoid the collision, and, this being so, the claims both for damage to the car and for personal injuries should have been submitted; it is a question of fact whether or not plaintiff acted reasonably under the circumstances, and on this he was entitled to have an expression of the jury\u2019s views. APPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing his appeal from the judgment of McFarland J. at trial dismissing his action, which was brought to recover damages for personal injuries and damage to his motor car when it was struck by defendant\u2019s train.\nOn November 29, 1938, at about ten o\u2019clock a.m., the plaintiff in his motor car, going easterly, was approaching a crossing on defendant\u2019s railway tracks in the village of Stouffville, Ontario, when he heard the whistle from defendant\u2019s train coming from the south. He applied his brakes, and the engine of his motor car stalled but the car continued going and it stopped with its rear end over the east side of the railway track. Plaintiff saw that the train was 1,000 feet or more distant, and he alighted, went to the back of the car, waved signals to the train to stop, alternating with attempts to push the car off the track, until he realized that the train (which had kept sounding warning whistles) was near him (60 or 70 feet away, according to plaintiff\u2019s evidence). The above matters are dealt with in more particularity in the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice of this Court, now reported, and in the reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal1. The plaintiff then ran to get behind a \u201cwig-wag\u201d signal post on the northeast corner of the crossing. When he had nearly reached the post he slipped and in falling threw his arm around the post to save himself and at that moment his motor car, being struck and thrown forward by the train, crashed into the post and caught and crushed his arm.\nThe case was tried before McFarland J. with a jury. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, counsel for the defendant moved for a non-suit and judgment on the motion was reserved. On the completion of the evidence the motion was renewed and was granted, the trial judge holding that the plaintiff had not established a prima facie case sufficient to justify the matter being referred to the jury, and the action was dismissed with costs.\nThe Court of Appeal held that there was no evidence that the defendant was the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s personal injuries; that the plaintiff was himself the sole cause; but that, with respect to the claim for damage to the motor car, it might be that the plaintiff was entitled to have the verdict of a jury on the questions whether the train could have been stopped and whether it ought to have been stopped before it reached the crossing. And the plaintiff was given the right to elect within a fixed time for a new trial limited to that claim; and if he did not so elect, the appeal should be dismissed with costs. The plaintiff did not so elect, and the appeal was dismissed with costs. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nR.R. McMurtry and H.A.C. Breuls for the appellant.\nR.E. Laidlaw K.C. and A.D. McDonald for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Davis and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I fully agree with the Court of Appeal that the appellant was entitled to have his claim for damages in respect of the loss of his motor car submitted to the jury; in other words, that there was reasonable evidence that the loss of the motor car was due to the negligence of the respondent railway company.\nWith great respect, I am unable to concur with their view that the trial judge was right in withdrawing from the jury the claim as to personal injuries.\nIn substance, the view of the Court of Appeal is that the learned trial judge ought to have submitted to the jury the appellant\u2019s claim that the destruction of his automobile, which was struck by the respondents\u2019 train, was the result of the negligence of the servants of the respondents in charge of the train and that consequently he was entitled to recover damages in respect of that negligence from the respondents. The Court of Appeal held that the appellant was entitled to have the jury pass upon the questions \u201cwhether the train could have been stopped and whether it ought to have been stopped before it reached the crossing.\u201d If they so found, the appellant would have been entitled to a verdict in respect of the destruction of his motor car, but the Court of Appeal\u2019s view was that, starting from the proposition that the respondents were negligent and that the result of this negligence was the impact of the railway train upon the motor car and the throwing of the motor car from the place where it was to the place where it struck the appellant, this negligence was, nevertheless, not the cause of the injury thereby resulting to the appellant but that these injuries were the consequence of the appellant\u2019s own negligence and that the negligence of the respondents in no material respect was a contributing cause in producing them.\nIt is to be observed that the impact of the train upon the appellant\u2019s automobile had the immediate physical consequence of throwing the automobile to the point where it struck the appellant. The chain of physical occurrences is uninterrupted and, prima facie, the injury to the appellant is the natural and direct result of the impact of the train upon the motor car, in respect of which, on the evidence adduced, it was a question for the jury whether or not the respondents are responsible in law.\nThis, however, is by no means the whole story. The respondents contend, and the Court of Appeal has held, that by the exercise of the most ordinary care the appellant could have avoided the consequence of the respondents\u2019 negligence and that the appellant\u2019s injuries were solely due to his own negligent and heedless acts. As I think there must be a new trial, I refrain from discussing the facts further than is absolutely necessary in order to make intelligible my view of the case.\nThe plaintiff is a farmer living two or three miles out of Stouffville. On 29th November, 1938, at about 10 o\u2019clock in the morning he drove to Stouffville in his motor car, entering the village from the west on Main street. This is a paved street running approximately east and west and it crosses, almost at right angles, the respondents\u2019 line of railway from Toronto to Lindsay. Coming along Main street to this crossing from the west there is first a local railway siding, then a vacant strip of land a few feet in width, and then the single track through railway line. Both the siding and the through line are planked on the crossing while the space between them is filled with cinders at about the same level.\nAs the plaintiff, driving easterly, approached the crossing at a speed of from eight to ten miles per hour, he heard the whistle of a locomotive from the south. He at once applied his brakes, and he says he put them on \u201cpretty full.\u201d He was then to the south of the centre line of the paved roadway and about thirty feet west of the westerly rail of the local siding. When the appellant applied his brakes his engine stalled and he did not get it started again. The motor car, however, continued on its way to the siding, across the siding, and the intervening strip and on to the main line. There it stopped, with the front wheels east of the easterly rail of the main line and the rear wheels at or close to that rail. When his car stopped the appellant saw that the train was still 1,000 feet or more distant; he at once alighted, thinking he might be able to push his car off the track. He first went to the back of the car, and with both arms elevated waved a signal to the train to stop. Then, turning to his car, he tried to push it ahead but could not move it, and having again, according to one of the witnesses, signalled the train to stop (the train was due to stop at Stouffville station less than forty yards north of the crossing), he made another and more persistent attempt to get the car over the rail. The train continued whistling\u2014\u201ctooting,\u201d he said, \u201cfor him to get off\u201d\u2014and he turned again to signal and did again signal the train to stop. He then realized that the train was coming toward him at a distance of 60 or 70 feet at from 30 to 35 miles an hour and, he says, it was not until then that he knew it was not going to stop. If the jury took the view that the servants of the railway company in charge of the train could have brought the train to a stop and were negligent in not bringing it to a stop in order to avoid collision with the motor car, they would do so on the ground, or they might do so on the ground, that the driver of the locomotive, having the appellant and his car in full view in broad daylight, seeing his signals, observing his two separate attempts to move his car off the railway track, had not, in the management of the train, exercised that reasonable care which it was incumbent upon him to employ in order to avoid unnecessary injury to property and persons on the highway. If this were their view, and if they should accept the appellant\u2019s statement that he first knew they were not going to perform their duty when the train was within 60 or 70 feet of the car, then the issue of fact would remain whether or not the injury which befell the appellant, notwithstanding his attempt to escape, was solely the result of his own ineptitude and negligence, or whether the negligence of the railway servants was, in part at least, the cause of it. I am unable to agree that the jury might not properly have considered that the driver of the locomotive acted not only negligently but recklessly in giving no attention to the situation of the appellant and his car, and that to this negligence was proximately due the emergency which the appellant says confronted him when he first realized that the train was not going to stop. The jury in respect of this topic would be entitled to draw all proper inferences from the fact that the respondents did not call the driver of the locomotive as a witness. I think these questions were questions of fact for them. If they answered these questions in the affirmative, then it was still a question of fact for them whether or not the appellant\u2019s subsequent conduct was the sole cause of his injury.\nWith great respect, I am unable to agree with the view of the Chief Justice of Ontario that the fact the appellant accidentally slipped when running away from the track interrupted the chain of causation. If the jury accepted the appellant\u2019s story that he first realized the train was not going to stop when it was almost upon him, then the point for them to consider was whether in the circumstances, giving to his evidence as to the condition of the planking and the road east and west of the motor car as much weight as they might think proper, the appellant\u2019s injuries were due to the failure on his part to act with that degree of care for his own safety that a person of ordinary prudence placed in like circumstances would have shown. If they took the view that there was no such failure, then the fact that he accidentally slipped could not prejudice his right to recover. Remoteness of damage in itself is, of course, no question for the jury, but issues as to reasonable conduct are such questions. In this case the respondents contend that the appellant\u2019s injuries did not follow in the ordinary course of things from their negligence, if there was such; that issue depends upon the answer to the question whether or not the appellant\u2019s conduct when he ran for safety was so unreasonable in the particular circumstances to to take it outside of the category, the ordinary course of things.\nThere is another point which requires notice. The Court of Appeal, no doubt, has wider powers than the trial judge. Even in a case where it is the duty of the trial judge to submit the case to the jury, the Court of Appeal may be in a position to set aside the verdict and either grant a new trial or give judgment on the ground that on the whole of the facts in evidence only one reasonable conclusion could be arrived at (Ontario Judicature Act, sec. 26). This is not material here, because there being, as I think, evidence which it was the duty of the trial judge to submit to the jury, the action ought not to be dismissed in any view of that evidence, because the power to dismiss the action on this ground where there is evidence for the jury is a power which must be exercised with caution and, generally speaking, only when it is quite clear that the Court of Appeal has all the available evidence before it (Paquin v. Beauclerk[2]; McPhee v. Esquimalt & Nanaimo Ry. Co.[3]; Skeate v. Slaters[4]). In this case, as has already been observed, the respondents did not see fit to produce the driver of the locomotive.\nI may add that I think section 48 of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act has no application to a case of this kind where the role of the automobile was simply that of a projectile moving under the impulse of a blow from a railway train delivered at a highway crossing.\nThe appeal should be allowed; a new trial should be ordered with costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal and to this Court, the costs of the abortive trial to abide the event of the new trial.\nCROCKET J.\u2014I think this appeal should be allowed and the whole action sent back for a new trial, as well in respect of the claim for personal injuries, as in respect of the claim for damage to the plaintiff\u2019s motor car. The judgment of the Appeal Court gave the plaintiff the option of accepting an order for a new trial, limited to the latter claim and taking the risk as to costs, or of having the entire action dismissed with costs. As the plaintiff did not elect to take an order for a new trial so limited, the action was formally dismissed with costs.\nThat the evidence adduced on the trial was such as to entitle the plaintiff to have his case presented to the jury on the issue as to whether the damage to the motor car had been caused in whole or in part by the negligence of the engineer of the defendant\u2019s train in approaching the crossing, seems to me to be quite clear. Indeed the judgment of the Appeal Court in giving the plaintiff the option of accepting a new trial upon that issue can only mean that the learned Appeal Judges were of that opinion themselves. Their decision to dismiss the action entirely in the event of the plaintiff not electing to take an order for a new trial, limited in the manner indicated, can only be maintained upon the ground that they were themselves justified in trying and disposing of that issue upon the printed trial record. It seems to me, with the highest respect, that they were not warranted in so doing. If there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury that the defendant\u2019s engineer could have avoided hitting the motor car by the exercise of due care on his part as the train was approaching the crossing\u2014and it must be taken there was\u2014, it seems to me equally clear that there was also sufficient evidence to leave to the jury upon the further issue as to whether the serious personal injury, which immediately followed, was the direct and natural consequence of the locomotive hitting and throwing the car in the direction in which the plaintiff ran in his attempt to escape injury himself. This, of course, involves consideration of the question as to whether the plaintiff, when he realized or should have realized that the train would hit the car, could in the existing circumstances have avoided the injury by the exercise of reasonable care upon his part. To my mind that was a question peculiarly for a jury, and one which, (I say this also with every respect), the jury, who heard all the witnesses as they gave their evidence, was in a much better position to determine than the learned judges sitting on appeal.\nThe appellant should have his costs of appeal to the Court of Appeal and to this Court, the costs of the abortive trial to abide the event of the new trial.\nHUDSON J.\u2014The plaintiff\u2019s automobile stalled on the defendant\u2019s railway line on a highway crossing. The plaintiff got out and endeavoured to push his automobile across, but his efforts not being at all successful and finding that a train on the defendant\u2019s tracks was rapidly approaching, he abandoned his efforts and ran some 27 feet to a point behind a signal post. At that moment the train arrived, struck the automobile and threw it over to the post and there injured the plaintiff. The motor car was wrecked.\nThe action was brought on for trial before Mr. Justice McFarland and a jury, but the case never was submitted to the jury, Mr. Justice McFarland coming to the conclusion that there was no evidence to support the plaintiff\u2019s claim. He held specifically that there was no negligence on the part of the defendant company in the operating of its train, that is, that all the provisions of the law had been complied with and that the plaintiff himself was solely responsible for the accident.\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeal directed a new trial limited to the claim in respect of the motor car, holding that the plaintiff\u2019s personal injuries were due to his own negligence.\nOn reading over the evidence I would not care to disturb the findings of the learned trial judge in respect to the defendant company having observed all the statutory requirements in regard to operation.\nThe only point on which there may be room for doubt is as to whether or not the defendant\u2019s employees saw, or reasonably should have seen, the plaintiff\u2019s predicament in time to stop the train and avoid the collision. Apparently the learned judges in the Court of Appeal thought that there was some evidence on this point which might properly have been submitted to the jury and it was for that reason that they gave the judgment which they did. With some hesitation, I come to the conclusion that I should not differ from them in this view. On the other hand, once this is admitted, I find it difficult to agree with the views of the Court of Appeal in respect to the personal injuries. The facts are extraordinary and anyone might very well come to the same conclusion as did the learned judges below. Still it is a question of fact whether or not the plaintiff acted reasonably under the circumstances and on this he was entitled to have an expression of the jury\u2019s views.\nI think the judgment appealed from should be set aside and a new trial directed\u2014costs to abide the event.\nAppeal allowed with costs; new trial ordered.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Weldon, Breuls & Arnold.\nSolicitor for the respondent: R.E.

On appeal:\nHeld: The proposed amendment, in the form in which it was put, was improper and was rightly rejected; but it should be open to defendants to apply to amend by proper and properly framed amendments.\nThe principle ex dolo malo non oritur actio (stated in Gordon v. Chief Commissioner of Metropolitan Police, [1910] 2 K.B. 1080, at 1098) is applicable to a case in which a plaintiff must necessarily, in order to establish his cause of action, prove that he is a party to an illegal conspiracy upon which his cause of action rests; and applies to an action for infringement of a patent; if the plaintiff's title is founded upon an agreement which amounts to a criminal conspiracy to which he is a party, and which, he must establish in order to prove his title, then he cannot succeed. And it cannot be said that in no circumstances can the existence of an illegal combine be an answer to such an action.\nIf at the trial it appeared that the plaintiff's case was founded upon an illegal transaction to which he was a party, in the sense above indicated, it would be the duty of the trial judge to take notice of it and dismiss the action. But here defendants are proposing to set up their objection in their pleading and in doing so they must observe the rules of pleading and allege the facts which constitute the illegality complained of and the connection of the plaintiff's cause of action with that illegality.\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, refusing certain proposed amendments to the statement of defence.\nThe action was brought against the defendants for alleged infringement of two patents of invention. The defendants moved for an order permitting them to amend their statement of defence by inserting therein the following:\n4. The defendants deny the allegations in paragraph 4 of the plaintiffs' amended statement of claim and put the plaintiffs to the strict proof thereof, and the defendants allege that the plaintiffs, or some of them, together or with others, have entered into an illegal conspiracy or combine contrary to the common and statute law of the Dominion of Canada, and, in particular, contrary to The Combines Investigation Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 26) and The Criminal Code (R.S.C., 1927, c. 36) and are disentitled to any relief in this action because:\n(a) The assignments, transmissions, agreements or other means whatsoever, by which rights in the patents in suit are claimed, were made in pursuance, or as a result, of the said conspiracy or combine and were ineffective to convey such rights; or\n(b) In the alternative, if any rights in the patents in suit were acquired, such rights have been used, in this action and otherwise, in pursuance of the said conspiracy or combine in such a way as to disentitle the plaintiffs to any relief.\nOn consent of counsel for plaintiffs and defendants given on the hearing of the motion, it was ordered that the question whether in an action for the infringement of a patent a defence such as that above set out could constitute a good defence should be treated as having been directed to be set down for argument as a question of law for decision by the Court in advance of the trial under the provisions of Rule 151 of the General Rules and Orders of the Exchequer Court of Canada. Maclean J, determined said question of law in the negative, holding that the proposed amendments could not be raised as defences in an infringement action. The defendants appealed.\nW. D. Herridge K.C. and E. G. Gowling for the appellants.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and R. S. Smart K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice\u2014There is one principle upon which it is conceivable that the defence discussed on the argument, if properly pleaded and proved, might be available: ex dolo malo non oritur actio. This principle is stated in the judgment of Buckley L.J. in Gordon v. Chief Commissioner of Metropolitan Police [1] in these words:\nIt is certainly the law that the Court will refuse to enforce an illegal contract or obligations arising out of an illegal contract, and I agree that the doctrine is not confined to the case of contract. A plaintiff who cannot establish his cause of action without relying upon an illegal transaction mus\/?\/ fail; and none the less is this true if the defendant does not rely upon the illegality. If the Court learns of the illegality, it will refuse to lend its aid. The rule is founded not upon any ground that either party can take advantage of the illegality, as, for instance, the defendant by setting it up as a defence. It is founded on public policy. Lord Mansfield in Holman v. Johnson [2] said \" Ex dolo malo non oritur actio. No Court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon an immoral or an illegal act.\"\nThe passage was quoted with approval by Lord Wright, M.R., in Berg v. Sadler[3].\nI do not see any reason why this principle is not applicable to a case in which a plaintiff must necessarily, in order to establish his cause of action, prove that he is a party to an illegal conspiracy upon which his cause of action rests; nor can I understand why the principle does not apply to an action for infringement of a patent. If the plaintiff's title is founded upon an agreement which amounts to a criminal conspiracy to which he is a party, and which he must establish in order to prove his title, then he cannot succeed. There is nothing, in my opinion, in the provisions of the Patent Act referred to on the argument that affects the application of this fundamental principle.\nI am not satisfied that in no circumstances can the existence of an illegal combine be an answer to such an action; A reference to a recent decision in the Supreme Court of the United States will illustrate my point. The first two paragraphs in the head-note to Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States[4] are as follows:\u2014\n1. The regulation of prices and the suppression of competition among purchasers of the patented article are not within the scope of the monopoly conferred upon a patentee by the patent laws.\n2. A system of licences employed by the owner of patents for an improved motor fuel, whereby jobbers who do not conform to the market policies and posted gasoline prices adopted by the major oil companies may be cut off from the list of those to whom refineries licensed to manufacture such fuel may sell it, and which has been used to coerce adherence to those prices and policies, is not within the monopoly conferred by the patents and operates as an unreasonable restraint of interstate commerce in such fuel, in violation of the Federal Anti-trust Act.\nNow, if the plaintiff in an action for infringement must, in order to make out his title, prove such a combine, and that he is a party to it, and if his alleged rights are founded upon it or \" directly result from it,\" I think he would find himself in great difficulties.\nI do not pursue the subject further. The doctrine laid down by the learned President in his judgment is too sweeping if it is inconsistent with this.\nI do not, however, think that the proposed amendment states that the respondents' cause of action is connected with the alleged illegal conspiracy in such a manner as to bring this fundamental, and indeed rudimentary, principle into play.\nIf B commits an indictable offence and the direct consequence of that indictable offence is that A suffers some special harm different from that of the rest of His Majesty's subjects, then, speaking generally, A has a right of action against B. As at present advised, I think it is not obvious that this well settled doctrine does not apply to indictable offences under section 498 of the Criminal Code; and it is not necessary to decide whether there are no circumstances in which the principle would not operate to prevent the owners of patents and the licensees under patents enforcing their prima facie rights against persons who are the objects and the intended victims of their criminal activities. There is nothing, however, in the proposed amendment to suggest the application of any such principle.\nIt ought to be remembered that the office of pleadings is to state the facts which are the constitutive elements of the cause of action or the defence. The proposed amendment does not profess to state the nature of the illegal conspiracy alleged beyond the vague allegation that it is contrary to the common and statute law of the Dominion. On this ground the application to put this amendment on the record ought to have been dismissed in limine. The learned President by consent treated this vague allegation as raising a question of law within rule 151. If at the trial it appeared that the plaintiff's case was founded upon an illegal transaction to which he was a party, in the sense above indicated, it would be the duty of the trial judge to take notice of it and dismiss the action; but the appellants are proposing to set up their objection in their pleading and in doing so they must observe the rules of pleading and allege the facts which constitute the illegality complained of and the connection of the plaintiff's cause of action with that illegality.\nI do not think myself that the proposed pleading raises any question of law which could usefully be considered. The function of rule 151 is to enable questions of law to be decided which arise upon facts alleged or admitted. Here, there are no such facts alleged in the pleading sense. There is a bald allegation, I repeat, of an illegal conspiracy in restraint of trade which is set up, an illegality because it is contrary to the law of the Dominion of Canada. The facts constituting the illegality are not set up. We are not told whether it is a conspiracy to enhance prices or to restrict competition, or what the particular nature of it is, or what the relation of it is to the respondents' cause of action. And the question seems to have been treated as the question whether in any circumstances the existence of an illegal conspiracy in restraint of trade, to enhance prices for example, could be an answer to an action for the infringement of a patent. That proposition includes the proposition that in such an action a plaintiff may succeed even though his title to sue is directly founded upon a crime to which he is a party, and is, therefore, too broad; but, for the reasons just given, the amendment was properly rejected.\nI think the proper course is to say that we do not think fit to pronounce upon any question of law except to say that the amendment is not a proper amendment and ought not to be allowed. It will be open, of course, to the appellants to apply to amend their defence by proper and properly framed amendments.\nThe costs of the appeal will be costs in the cause.\nAppeal dismissed without prejudice to right of appellants to apply to amend their defence by properly framed amendments. Costs of appeal to be costs in the cause.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Herridge, Gowling, MacTavish & Watt.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Smart & Biggar.\n[1] [1910] 2 K.B. 1080, at 1098.\n[2] (1775) 1 Cowp. 341, at 343.\n[3] [1937] 2 KB. 158, at 166-167.\n[4] (1940) 84 Law. ed. 559.\n"

Bussell and Others (Defendants) Respondents.\n1940: June 6, 7.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Crocket, Davis, Hudson and Taschereau JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nAutomobile Insurance\u2014Action under s. 205 of Insurance Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 256, to recover from alleged insurers the amount unpaid of judgment recovered against driver of motor car for damages for injuries\u2014Question whether driver was insured by \u201cowner\u2019s policy\u201d because driving with consent of \u201cperson named\u201d therein (s. 198 of said Act)\u2014\u201cOwner\u2019s policy\u201d (s. 183 (g))\u2014Question whether motor car \u201cowned\u201d by \u201cperson named\u201d in policy.\nThe action was brought under s. 205 of the Ontario Insurance Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 256, to recover from defendants, as insurers, the unpaid amount of a judgment recovered in a previous action by plaintiff against K. and J. for damages for injuries caused by a motor car. The insurance policy was issued in the name of S. The ground of the plaintiff\u2019s claim in the present action was that K., the driver of the motor car, though not named in the policy, is thereby \u201cinsured\u201d (within the meaning of said s. 205) in virtue of s. 198 of said Act.\nHeld: The dismissal of the action by the Court of Appeal for Ontario ([1940] 1 D.L.R. 97) should be affirmed. K. was not a person entitled by said s. 198 to indemnity under the policy. In considering the question of the application of s. 198 to the facts of the case, that section must be read as subject to the definition of \u201cowner\u2019s policy\u201d in s. 183 (g). Plaintiff\u2019s contention that K. came within s. 198 (1) by virtue of the fact that he was driving the car with the consent of S., the \u201cperson named\u201d in the policy within the meaning of s. 183 (g) (that is, \u201cnamed in\u201d the \u201cowner\u2019s policy\u201d under which the action is brought), rests, by the definition of \u201cowner\u2019s policy,\u201d upon the proposition that the car was \u201cowned\u201d by S. in the sense of that definition (s. 183 (g)); and, on the evidence, the decision of the Court of Appeal negativing such ownership by S. should not be reversed.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which (reversing the judgment of Kelly J. at trial) dismissed the action, which was brought under s. 205 of The Insurance Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 256, to recover from defendants (commonly known as Lloyd\u2019s), as insurers, the unpaid amount of a judgment recovered against certain persons for damages for injuries caused by a motor car.\nOne George Johnson bought from one Seaman a taxi-cab business at Fort Frances, Ontario, and his son, Fredolph Johnson, took charge of its operation. It was found that Fredolph Johnson could not have a licence from the town to operate the taxi-cab business, as he lived a short distance outside the town limits and therefore did not fulfil the town\u2019s residential requirements. Therefore it was decided to apply for a licence in Seaman\u2019s name and Fredolph Johnson went through the form of executing a transfer of the business to Seaman (a chattel mortgage being given by Seaman to the Johnsons for their protection), and the motor car in question and another motor car, both used in the said taxi-cab business, were registered under the Ontario Highway Traffic Act in Seaman\u2019s name.\nOn an application signed by Seaman an insurance policy of defendants was issued to him upon the motor car in question, agreeing to indemnify against liability for injuries to the person or property of others. The policy contained an agreement by the insurer\nto indemnify the Insured, his executors or administrators, and, in the same manner and to the same extent as if named herein as the Insured, every other person who, with the Insured\u2019s consent, uses the automobile, against the liability imposed by law upon the insured or upon any such other person for loss or damage arising from the ownership, use, or operation of the automobile within Canada, * * *\n(See also s. 198 of The Insurance Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 256, quoted in the judgment now reported).\nSubsequent to the transactions aforesaid the plaintiff was injured by the motor car in question which was at the time of the injury driven by one Kowaluk who was an employee in the said taxi-cab business. In an action for damages the plaintiff recovered judgment against Kowaluk and George Johnson[2], and later brought the present action under said s. 205 of The Insurance Act to recover from the present defendants the unpaid amount of his judgment.\nThe trial judge, Kelly J., gave judgment for the plaintiff. This was reversed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario[3], which dismissed the action. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nC.L. Yoerger for the appellant.\nC.K. Guild K.C. for the respondents.\nAfter hearing the argument of counsel for the appellant, the Court, without calling on counsel for the respondents, delivered judgment orally dismissing the appeal with costs.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014We do not think it necessary to call upon you, Mr. Guild. We desire to express our appreciation of the able argument on the part of the appellant by Mr. Yoerger; we are nevertheless of opinion that no purpose would be served by prolonging the argument.\nThis is a creditor\u2019s action under section 205 of the Insurance Act, the first subsection of which is as follows:\u2014\nAny person having a claim against an insured, for which indemnity is provided by a motor vehicle liability policy, shall, notwithstanding that such person is not a party to the contract, be entitled, upon recovering a judgment therefor against the insured, to have the insurance money payable under the policy applied in or towards satisfaction of his judgment and of any other judgments or claims against the insured covered by the indemnity and may, on behalf of himself and all persons having such judgments or claims, maintain an action against the insurer to have the insurance money so applied.\nThe appellant has no judgment against Seaman, who, it is argued, is the owner of the car within the meaning of certain other sections of the Statute.\nThe ground of the appellant\u2019s claim is that Kowaluk, the driver (against whom he has a judgment), though not named in the policy, is thereby \u201cinsured\u201d (within the meaning of section 205) in virtue of section 198; and that is the question of substance in this appeal.\nThere was no contractual relationship between Kowaluk and the Insurance Company, and, therefore, the provisions in the policy taken out by Seaman (apart from the enactments of the Insurance Act) could give Kowaluk no status to sue. Mr. Yoerger, of course, does not dispute this. The point is settled by the judgment of the Privy Council in Vandepitte v. Preferred Accident Insurance Corporation of New York[4].\nThe precise point to be decided is whether the driver, against whom the appellant has a judgment, is one of the persons entitled to indemnity under the policy by force of section 198. Section 198, in so far as pertinent, is in these words:\u2014\n(1) Every owner\u2019s policy shall insure the person named therein, and every other person who, with his consent, uses any automobile designated in the policy, against the liability imposed by law upon the insured named therein or upon any such other person for loss or damage,\u2014\n(a) arising from the ownership, use or operation of any such automobile within Canada or the United States of America, or upon a vessel plying between ports within those countries; and\n(b) resulting from\n(i) bodily injury to or death of any person; or\n(ii) damage to property; or\n(iii) both. 1932, c. 25, s. 2, part; 1935, c. 29, s. 32.\n(2) Any person insured by but not named in a policy may recover indemnity in the same manner and to the same extent as if named therein as the insured, and for that purpose shall be deemed to be a party to the contract and to have given consideration therefor. 1932, c. 25, s. 2, part.\nIt is obvious from inspection that by this section any person insured in a policy within the scope of subsection (1), though not named therein, may, by force of subsection (2), recover indemnity as if named therein as insured.\nIn order to apply these enactments to the facts of this case we must read them as subject to the definition of \u201cowner\u2019s policy\u201d given in section 183, subsection (g):\u2014\n\u201cOwner\u2019s policy\u201d means a motor vehicle liability policy insuring a person named therein in respect of the ownership, operation or use of any automobile owned by him and designated in the policy.\nIt is contended that Kowaluk, the driver, comes within section 198 (1) by virtue of the fact that he was driving the automobile with the consent of Seaman, who was the \u201cperson named\u201d in the policy within the meaning of section 183 (g); that is to say, \u201cnamed in\u201d the \u201cowner\u2019s policy\u201d under which the action is brought. By the definition of \u201cowner\u2019s policy\u201d that contention rests upon the proposition that the automobile was \u201cowned\u201d by Seaman in the sense of that definition (section 183 supra). The Court of Appeal has taken the view that this question must be answered in the negative. We are satisfied that the decision of the Court of Appeal on this point ought not to be reversed. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.R. Fitch.\nSolicitor for the respondents: A.G.

The appellant association was incorporated in 1916 by a special Act of the Quebec legislature (7 Geo. V, c. 110), its object being by section 3 \"to assure to its members personal development by means of study circles, and to devote itself to all works of public utility within the domain of charity, education and moral, social, national and economic questions.\" Then in 1932, this statute was amended (22 Geo. V, c. 136), and, amongst additional powers thereto granted, the association was authorized to \"install and equip, for the use of its members and of the public, establishments for the teaching and prac bice of physical culture and athletic and sporting exercises \"; and, by section 4, it was enacted that \"lands and other immoveables held as owner and occupied by the corporation for the above purposes are assimilated to the property of educational establishments as to exemptions from municipal and school taxes.\" Subsequently, the appelant association became owner of a property situated in the city respondent, it consisting of a large building in which there were offices, a theatre, a skating rink, badminton courts, billiard rooms, bowling alleys and restaurants. The theatre, two of the offices, and the skating rink were leased and a general admission fee was charged by the association for the privilege of using the other entertainment places, there being no difference in the fee depending on whether one of the public was a member of the association or not. But there were two offices used by the association, one being occupied by a priest acting as chaplain and co-manager and the other serving as library and meeting hall for the members. The respondent city sued the appellant association for $4,060.64 for municipal and school taxes imposed for the fiscal years of 1936 and 1937. The appellant took the ground that its property was exenc.pt from these taxes under the amended statute above mentioned; and it also urged that the chaplain's office and the library room, being used for the purposes of the association, and therefore not taxable, had been illegally assessed for taxation and that the whole valuation of the appellant's property was null and void; but, in its conclusions, the appellant merely asked for the dismissal of the respondent's action. Judgment was rendered by the Recorder's Court in favour of the respondent for the amount of its claim less the sum of $94.35, the Recorder exempting the two offices from taxation; and that judgment was affirmed by the appellate court. There was no cross-appeal in that Court or in this Court as to the partial exemption granted by the trial judge.\nHeld that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed and the respondent city's action maintained.\nPer Rinfret, Crocket, Hudson and Taschereau JJ.\u2014The theatre, the arena, the rented offices and the restaurants constituted for the benefit of the appellant association sources of revenues; and consequently the latter could not benefit from the exemption of taxes provided by the statute. The appellant's rights are the same as those of the religious institutions or educational establishments; and the clause creating an exemption from taxes has its application only when the properties are occupied by them for the purposes for which they have been established, and not solely to raise a revenue.\u2014The other ground of appeal raised by the association that the valuation was null in to for the reason that part of the building, not being taxable, had been assessed, must be dismissed, as there is no clear and positive evidence that these two offices were occupied by the association for the attainment of the purposes mentioned in the incorporating Act. Toronto Ry. Co. v. Toronto ([1904] A.C. 809), Donohue v. Paroisse de St. Etienne de la Malbaie ([1924] S.C.R. 511) and Montreal L.H. & P. Co. v. Westmount ([1926] S.C.R. 515) discussed.\nPer Davis J.\u2014The incorporating statute clearly enacts that the exemption is only while the property is owned and occupied by the appellant association for the purposes of the corporation. Moreover, the building cannot be assessed piecemeal; two or three rooms out of a large office building, for instance, cannot be left free from taxation and yet all the other rooms be subject to it; the building is either taxable or it is not taxable.\u2014Whatever may be said as to the occupation of several different parts of the building, it is not disputed that two portions are rented for private office use and the theatre portion is leased on a yearly basis. On a fair interpretation of the statutory provision, the corporation to be entitled to exemption must occupy the immoveable property for its own purposes and it cannot be said to occupy the immoveable property when any substantial portion of it is in the occupation of others. The statute is not satisfied by showing that the corporation occupies some portion of the building for its own purposes.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Recorder's Court of the city of Chicoutimi and maintaining the respondent city's action for the recovery of taxes on property owned by the appellant.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nPaul Leblanc and Jean Filion for the appellant.\nJ. C. Gagn\u00e9 K.C. and J. A. Gagn\u00e9 K.C. for the respondent.\nRinfret J.\u2014Pour les raisons que donne mon coll\u00e8gue, M. le juge Taschereau, et dans lesquelles je concours, je suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nDavis J.\u2014The appellant association was incorporated in 1916 by a special Act of the Quebec legislature, being 7 Geo. V, ch. 110. The object of the Association was by sec 3,\nto assure to its members personal development by means of study circles, and to devote itself to all works of public utility within the domain of charity, education and moral, social, national and economic questions. The preamble of the statute stated that the Association had been founded at Montreal in 1904, that it had existed since that date, and had a great many members grouped among over one hundred study circles.\nThen in 1932, by 22 Geo. V, ch. 136, the statute was amended. The preamble to this amending statute, after repeating the object of the Association, proceeded to state,\nThat, to realize the above purpose, it is necessary to develop in young men, members of the Association or not, besides intellectual and moral vigour, a robust physical constitution by sound and healthy athletic exercises.\nIt is to be noted that the words are \"members of the Association or not.\" The preamble proceeds to say\nThat such program demands that the (Association) found, in various parts of the province, establishments wherein will be taught and practised for purposes of education and of moral and physical training, all bodily exercises pertaining to physical culture and gymnastics; and that to attain such objects the Association needs to acquire and possess moveable and immoveable property of a higher value than that presently fixed by its Charter.\nThe preamble proceeds to state that the Association has acquired by deed certain immoveable property in the city of Montreal from the National Amateur Athletic Association which, with the furniture and various moveable things, may serve to utilize the immoveable property \"as a sporting and educational establishment\" ; and that, certain doubts having arisen as to the validity of the acquisition of this property, the validation of the deed of sale is required. Then follow in the preamble words that may be of importance in this case by way of explanation :\nThat, by its charter, the National Amateur Athletic Association benefited by certain privileges and tax exemptions:\nThat the (Association) by pursuing amongst other objects the work of the National Amateur Athletic Association, with a larger scope, needs the benefit of the same privileges;\nThat for such purposes the (Association) requires that more ample powers be granted in the exercise of its charter, and, particularly certain privileges and tax exemptions, and\nWhereas it is expedient to grant its prayer;\nThere is then enacted sec. 1, which repeals sec. 4 of the original Act and substitutes a new section 4; sec. 2 of the amending statute validates the deed of sale from the National Amateur Athletic Association; and sec. 3 enacts than the Act shall come into force on the day of its sanction. Reverting then to new sec. 4 with which we are concerned, it contains by repetition the general powers granted by the original statute but adds additional powers, amongst which is to be found one in these words:\nThe corporation * * * may * * * found, install and equip, for the use of its members and of the public, establishments for the teaching and practice of physical culture and athletic and sporting exercises ;\nThe words \" for the use of its members and of the public \" are to be noted. The omnibus clause is repeated:\nand, generally, exercise the powers vested in civil corporations and such powers as may aid it in attaining its object, or serve to put its means of action in operation and to carry out its undertakings.\nAs part of new sec. 4 and immediately following the enumeration of the powers of the corporation, are these words :\nAny law or by-law to the contrary notwithstanding, the buildings, lands and other immovables held as owner and occupied by the corporation for the above purposes are assimilated to the property of educational establishments as to exemptions from municipal and school taxes.\nSuch tax exemption shall not apply to the water tax nor to special taxes for sewers, paving, sidewalks and public lighting.\nIn this action the respondent, the city of Chicoutimi, sued the appellant Association for $4,060.64 for municipal and school taxes imposed for the fiscal years 1936 and 1937 in respect of the appellant's immovable property in the said city. The appellant took the ground that its said property was exempt from these taxes under the amending statute above mentioned but in its defence, while it pleaded that the entry on the valuation roll was null and void, merely asked for the dismissal of the action with costs. The position taken by the city was that the immovable property of the Association is only entitled to exemption when it is owned and occupied by the corporation for the purposes of the corporation.\nThe action was tried in the Recorder's Court of Chicoutimi and the Recorder gave judgment in favour of the city for the amount of its claim, less the sum of $94.35. The property in question is owned by the appellant and consists of a large building in which there are offices, a theatre, a skating rink, badminton courts, billiard rooms, bowling alleys and restaurants. Part of the building, the theatre, is leased for use for the exhibition of moving pictures as a rental of $2,000 per year plus a share in the profits. One of the offices is rented to a Mr. Murdock at $40 per month and another office is rented at $25 per month. The Arena is used in the winter for skating and hockey games and in the summer months is leased from time to time for professional wrestling at the rate of $40 per evening. A general admission fee to the public is charged for the skating rink, the bowling alleys, the billiard rooms, the badminton courts, etc. Apparently there is no difference in the admission fee depending on whether one of the public is a member of the Association or not.\nThe Recorder on the evidence came to the conclusion that the whole building was really used for commercial purposes and gain but he did think that two small rooms in the building might be regarded as used solely for the purposes of the Association;\nthough from a strictly legal point of view, in view of the absence of clear and positive evidence, these two rooms should not be exempt, I exempt them from taxation;\nand the Recorder accordingly reduced the respondent's claim by $94.35. The appellant Association appealed against this judgment to the Court of King's Bench which by a majority affirmed the judgment. The appellant has now appealed to this Court.\nIt is clear upon the statute that the exemption is only while the property is owned and occupied by the corporation for the purposes of the corporation. Now the building cannot be assessed piecemeal; you cannot take two or three rooms out of a large office building, for instance, leave them free from taxation and yet tax all the other rooms in the building. The building is either taxable or it is not taxable. The city very naturally, as its counsel states, did not appeal from the judgment which gave it its entire claim except $94.35. What the city says is that if it had any right of appeal, which it doubts, in respect of the amount of the small deduction, it was not worth the costs of an appeal and the city was quite content to let the small item go.\nWhatever may be said as to the occupation of several different parts of the building, it is not disputed that two portions are rented for private office use and the theatre portion is leased on a yearly basis. On a fair interpretation of the statutory provision, the corporation to be entitled to exemption must occupy the immovable property for its own purposes and it cannot be said to occupy the immovable property when any substantial portion of it is in the occupation of others. The statute is not satisfied by showing that the corporation occupies some portion of the building for its own purposes.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Crocket, Hudson and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014L'appellante, l'Association Catholique de la Jeunesse Canadienne-Fran\u00e7aise, \u00e1 \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9e par 7 Geo. V, chapitre 110. En 1932, en vertu du statut 22, Geo. V, chapitre 136, sa charte a \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9e et certaines exemptions de taxes municipales et scolaires lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9es.\nL'article 3 de la dite loi telle que revis\u00e9e se lit de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\u2014\n3. L'objet de la corporation est d'assurer \u00e0 ses membres un compl\u00e9ment de formation personnelle au moyen de cercles d'\u00e9tudes, et de travailler au succ\u00e8s des entreprises d'utilit\u00e9 publique qui se rapportent \u00e0 la charit\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation et aux questions morales, sociales, nationales et \u00e9conomiques.\nL'article 4 est ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9:\u2014\n4. La corporation aura succession perp\u00e9tuelle, et pourra:\nAvoir un sceau commun et le modifier \u00e0 volont\u00e9; ester en justice; fonder des cercles d'\u00e9tudes, organiser des cours, des conf\u00e9rences, des journ\u00e9es d'\u00e9tudes et des congr\u00e8s, pour la poursuite de son objet; fonder et maintenir des biblioth\u00e8ques et des salles de lecture; acheter, imprimer, \u00e9diter, publier et vendre des revues, livres, journaux, brochures et feuilles de propagande assortis \u00e0 ses desseins et \u00e0 son objet; fonder, installer et \u00e9quiper, pour l'usage de ses membres et du public, des \u00e9tablissements pour l'enseignement et la pratique de la culture physique et des exercices athl\u00e9tiques ou sportifs; accepter, acqu\u00e9rir et recevoir, par achat, donation, testament, legs ou autrement, et poss\u00e9der des biens meubles et immeubles, en retirer des revenus, pourvu que le revenu annuel des immeubles appartenant \u00e0 la corporation et poss\u00e9d\u00e9s par elle pour des fins de revenu n'exc\u00e8de pas deux cent mille dollars; les louer, vendre, \u00e9changer, hypoth\u00e9quer, c\u00e9der, ali\u00e9ner ou autrement en disposer; emprunter, \u00e9mettre des obligations (debentures) garanties par hypoth\u00e8ques, par gage ou nantissement, s'il y a lieu; percevoir de ses membres des cotisations, contributions, souscriptions et abonnements; encourager les \u00e9tudes et les \u0153uvres qui se rapportent \u00e0 l'objet de l'A.C.J.C.; organiser des concours, fonder des prix, attribuer des r\u00e9compenses; aider et soutenir, dans la mesure de leurs besoins et des ressources de la corporation, des entreprises propres \u00e0 r\u00e9pandre la culture de l'esprit et \u00e0 assurer la d\u00e9fense des int\u00e9r\u00eats religieux, sociaux et nationaux; et, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, exercer les pouvoirs qui appartiennent aux corporations civiles ordinaires, et les pouvoirs qui peuvent l'aider \u00e0 atteindre son but ou servir \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre de ses moyens d'action et \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution de ses entreprises.\nNonobstant toutes lois ou r\u00e8glements \u00e0 ce contraire, les b\u00e2timents, terrains et autres immeubles poss\u00e9d\u00e9s \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire et occup\u00e9s par la corporation, pour les fins susdites, sont assimil\u00e9s aux biens des maisons d'\u00e9ducation, quant aux exemptions de taxes municipales et scolaires.\nCette exemption de taxes ne s'appliquera pas \u00e0 la taxe d'eau ni aux taxes sp\u00e9ciales pour canaux d'\u00e9gouts, pavages, trottoirs et \u00e9clairage public.\nLa ville de Chicoutimi o\u00f9 est situ\u00e9 l'immeuble de l'appelante a institu\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures l\u00e9gales contre celle-ci pour lui r\u00e9clamer la somme de $4,060.64 repr\u00e9sentant les taxes municipales et scolaires pour les ann\u00e9es 1936 et 1937, ainsi que les int\u00e9r\u00eats. L'appelante a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle ne devait pas le montant parce que l'immeuble est poss\u00e9d\u00e9 et occup\u00e9 par elle pour les fins mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 la loi qui l'incorpore, et que les r\u00e8glements, r\u00e9solutions, ainsi que les r\u00f4les d'\u00e9valuation et de perception invoqu\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9e sont ill\u00e9gaux et ultra vires. Le Recorder de Chicoutimi devant qui la cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 instruite a partiellement admis cette pr\u00e9tention de l'appelante. Il en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion que la majeure partie de l'immeuble \u00e9tait taxable, que le reste ne l'\u00e9tait pas, et il a maintenu l'action pour la somme de $3,966.29 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats et d\u00e9pens.\nCet immeuble qui fait l'objet du pr\u00e9sent litige est connu sous le num\u00e9ro P. 233 et P. 234 du cadastre de la ville de Chicoutimi. L'appelante n'occupe pas cet immeuble en entier. Elle a lou\u00e9 un th\u00e9\u00e2tre \u00e0 un particulier qui l'exploite pour son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice personnel; elle a aussi lou\u00e9 une pi\u00e8ce \u00e0 un monsieur Murdock qui l'occupe comme bureau, une salle de 55 par 60 pieds au Syndicat Catholique, et quelques petits restaurants attenant aux pi\u00e8ces ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9es. Le reste de la b\u00e2tisse, comprenant le bureau de l'aum\u00f4nier, et la salle de l'Association ne sont pas lou\u00e9s et sont occup\u00e9s par l'appelante.\nDans l'immeuble se trouve \u00e9galement une patinoire. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que cette patinoire n'est pas lou\u00e9e et \u00e0 cet cet endroit, durant l'hiver, on y donne des exhibitions payantes de hockey, et durant d'autres saisons des s\u00e9ances de lutte.\nJe partage l'opinion du Recorder de Chicoutimi et celle de la majorit\u00e9 des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi qui en sont venus \u00e0 la conclusion que le th\u00e9\u00e2tre, l'arena, le bureau occup\u00e9 par monsieur Murdock, la salle du syndicat catholique ainsi que les trois restaurants constituent pour l'appelante des sources de revenus et ne sauraient en cons\u00e9quence b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de l'exemption de taxes pr\u00e9vue au statut. L'appelante n'a pas plus de droits que les communaut\u00e9s religieuses et les maisons de charit\u00e9, car l'acte l\u00e9gislatif qui l'incorpore la place sur le m\u00eame pied que celles-ci. La clause cr\u00e9ant l'exemption de taxes municipales et scolaires ne trouve son application que lorsque les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s sont occup\u00e9es par des institutions religieuses ou charitables, pour les fins pour lesquelles elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies, et non pas uniquement pour en retirer un revenu. (Vide loi des cit\u00e9s et des villes, art. 520; loi de l'Instruction Publique, art. 251.)\nIl en est ainsi de l'immeuble de l'appelante. Quand le statut d\u00e9cr\u00e8te que les immeubles poss\u00e9d\u00e9s et occup\u00e9s par elle pour les \"fins susdites\", sont assimil\u00e9s aux biens des maisons d'\u00e9ducation quant aux exemptions de taxes municipales et scolaires, je crois qu'il faut voir dans les mots \" fins susdites \" une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la section 3 de la loi qui d\u00e9finit les objets de l'A.C.J.C., et non pas \u00e0 la section 4 qui donne les moyens d'atteindre ces objets. Il semble clair que le th\u00e9\u00e2tre, l'arena et quelques autres pi\u00e8ces de l'immeuble constituent des sources de revenus, et ne sont pas occup\u00e9s par l'appelante pour les fins qui lui permettent d'atteindre les objets mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3 de sa charte. M\u00eame si les revenus sont vers\u00e9s au fonds g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'appelante, l'immeuble serait taxable, car c'est l'usage que l'on fait de l'immeuble qu'il faut consid\u00e9rer et non pas l'usage des revenus de cet immeuble.\nMais, nous dit l'appelante, le bureau de l'aum\u00f4nier et la salle de l'Association sont occup\u00e9s par elle et servent \u00e0 assurer \u00e0 ses membres un compl\u00e9ment de formation personnelle et \u00e0 atteindre ainsi l'objet de la corporation. Cette partie de l'immeuble n'\u00e9tait pas taxable, et a \u00e9t\u00e9 tout de m\u00eame impos\u00e9e par la ville. Cette imposition de taxe \u00e9tant ill\u00e9gale, il s'ensuivrait que tout le r\u00f4le quant \u00e0 l'appelante est nul, et on nous cite de nombreuses autorit\u00e9s pour appuyer cette pr\u00e9tention. C'est ainsi que dans son factum et \u00e0 l'argument l'appelante a cit\u00e9 les causes de Toronto Railway Co. v. Toronto Corporation[1]; Donohue v. La Corporation de la Paroisse de St-Etienne de la Malbaie [2] ; Montreal Light, Heat & Power v. Cit\u00e9 de Westmount[3]. Dans la premi\u00e8re de ces causes, Toronto Railway Co. v. Toronto Corporation[4], il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ce qui suit (p. 815) :\u2014\nIt appears to their Lordships that the jurisdiction of the Court of Revision and of the Courts exercising the statutory jurisdiction of appeal from the Court of Revision, is confined to the question whether the assessment was too high or too low, and those Courts had no jurisdiction to determine the question whether the assessment commissioner had exceeded his powers in assessing property which was not by law assessable. In other words, where the assessment was ab initio a nullity they had no jurisdiction to confirm it or give it validity.\nEt plus loin, \u00e0 la m\u00eame page:\u2014\nIn Nickle v. Douglas[5] the exact point arose. The appellant had unsuccessfully appealed to the Court of Revision, and it was held, after an elaborate anamination of the previous authorities in the English and Canadian Courts, that that Court had no jurisdiction to decide any question whether particular property was assessable, and also that the party was no: estopped by having previously appealed to the Revision Court. In London Mutual Insurance Co. v. City of London[6], the decision of the county court judge was treated as final, because the question was within the jurisdiction of the assessor.\nDans la cause de Donohue v. La Corporation de la paroisse de St-Etienne de la Malbaie[7], le juge Anglin dit \u00e0 la page 516 :\u2014\nThe appellants' machinery was non-assessable. In assessing the appellants in respect of it the assessors were dealing with something beyond their jurisdiction. The assessment was therefore a nullity and neither appeal from it nor action to question the roll for illegality in respect of it was necessary.\nEt plus loin.:\u2014\nIn the Shannon case [8] the subject-matter of the assessment was admittedly within the jurisdiction of the assessors; it was over-valuation that was complained of; that over-valuation was charged to be the result of a systematic disregard of the prescribed principles of assessment.\nDans la cause de Montreal Light, Heat & Power v. City of Westmount[9], il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par cette Cour que Taction de la cit\u00e9 de Westmount au montant de $8,226.86 devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e, parce que ce montant repr\u00e9sentait des taxes sur l'\u00e9valuation de compteurs \u00e9lectriques qui \u00e9taient install\u00e9s dans des maisons priv\u00e9es. La Cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que ces compteurs n'\u00e9taient pas des immeubles, et non seulement Taction a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e mais le r\u00f4le quant \u00e0 la Montreal Light, Heat & Power a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9.\nLe cas qui nous occupe est bien diff\u00e9rent. L'immeuble dans son ensemble constitue une source de revenus pour l'appelante, et m\u00eame s'il n'\u00e9tait pas productif de revenus, il serait encore taxable, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il sert \u00e0 atteindre l'objet de la corporation qui est, encore une fois:\u2014\nd'assurer \u00e0 ses membres un compl\u00e9ment de formation personnelle au moyen de cercles d'\u00e9tudes, et de travailler au succ\u00e8s des entreprises d'utilit\u00e9 publique qui se rapportent \u00e0 la charit\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation et aux questions morales, sociales, nationales et \u00e9conomiques.\nC'est \u00e0 cette seule condition que l'immeuble est assimil\u00e9 aux maisons d'\u00e9ducation. Il importait donc \u00e0 l'appelante de d\u00e9montrer l'application de la loi exceptionnelle qui la r\u00e9git. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le au contraire que dans le bureau de l'aum\u00f4nier qui, avec un monsieur Gagnon, est le g\u00e9rant de l'immeuble, se contr\u00f4lent les diverses op\u00e9rations financi\u00e8res, se per\u00e7oivent les loyers, et s'exercent la censure des vues cin\u00e9matographiques.\nQuant \u00e0 la salle o\u00f9 se trouve une biblioth\u00e8que, je partage l'opinion du Recorder, de M. le juge Barclay et de M. le juge Galipeault, qui ne sont pas satisfaits de la preuve apport\u00e9e par l'appelante pour soustraire cette partie de l'immeuble \u00e0 l'imposition des taxes fonci\u00e8res.\nEn quoi cette salle et le bureau de l'aum\u00f4nier serventils aux \"fins susdites\"? Il est possible qu'il en soit ainsi, et que dans cette salle et le bureau de l'aum\u00f4nier on pose des actes qui soient de nature \u00e0 aider la corporation \u00e0 atteindre les fins mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 sa charte. Mais il faut le prouver, et non pas se contenter d'affirmations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales et impr\u00e9cises qui ne nous \u00e9clairent pas sur la v\u00e9ritable nature des oeuvres accomplies.\nA d\u00e9faut de cette preuve positive qui incombe \u00e0 l'appelante, je ne puis me permettre de faire des conjectures, et je ne puis pas pr\u00e9sumer que ces pi\u00e8ces de l'immeuble servent \u00e0 des travaux d'utilit\u00e9 publique, d'\u00e9ducation, de charit\u00e9, ou \u00e0 des \u0153uvres o\u00f9 se discutent des questions morales, sociales, nationales et \u00e9conomiques. Il est vrai que le Recorder exempte rappelante des taxes payables pour le bureau de l'aum\u00f4nier et la salle, mais, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le tout doit \u00eatre tax\u00e9, il s'exprime de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nCependant, bien qu'au point de vue strictement l\u00e9gal, ces deux appartements tu l'absence d'une preuve claire et positive, ne devraient pas \u00eatre exempts, je les exempte de la taxe.\nEvidemment, le Recorder ne conclut pas suivant les faits prouv\u00e9s. Mais, parce qu'il r\u00e9duit la r\u00e9clamation de la ville de $94.35, ou de $47.17 par ann\u00e9e, devons-nous pour cela d\u00e9cider que tout le r\u00f4le est nul et que l'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu?\nJe ne le crois pas, et je ne suis pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 me rallier \u00e0 cette opinion, La ville de Chicoutimi n'a pas log\u00e9 de contre-appel.

That construction was to pass through the National Battlefields, which are the property of the Federal Government, and the National Battlefields Commission consented gratuitously to allow such construction on its land without relinquishing its right or ownership on behalf of the Dominion. The city of Quebec was made a party to the action, for the purpose of obtaining an order that the reservoir as well as the land itself should be declared subject to a privilege which would guarantee the payment of the sum due. Both the defendant and the mis-en-cause filed separate pleas. Before the case actually came to trial, La Compagnie de Construction and the Cone rote Column Clamps agreed to submit the lawsuit to arbitrators, and their decision was that the latter company was entitled to recover a sum of $25.622.74. This award of the arbitrators was deposited with the record of the case by order of Gibsone J. whose decision was affirmed by the appellate court. Then, after trial, the Superior Court, Pr\u00e9vost J., dismissed into the action of the Concrete Column Clamps against the Compagnie de Construction, rejecting therefore the award of the arbitrators, and also refused to grant the conclusion of that action against the city of Quebec to the effect that the reservoir and the land upon which it had been constructed were subject to a privilege. The Concrete Column Clamps appealed to the Court of King's Bench, and that Court dismissed the appeal on the question of privilege; but reversed the judgment of the trial judge and allowed this last company the sum of $25,622.74, being the amount awarded by the arbitrators. The ground raised in the first appeal is whether the appellant The Concrete Column Clamps is entitled to its claims against the city respondent on the ground that the reservoir and the land upon which it has been constructed were subject to a privilege; and the questions at issue are whether such privilege has been legally drafted, whether the necessary notices have been given within the prescribed delay and finally whether the reservoir and the land can be subject to a contractor's privilege. In the second appeal, the question at issue is whether the award of the arbitrators is valid and binding between the parties.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (Q.R. 67 K.B. 536) that the maintaining of The Concrete Column Clamps's action against La Compagnie de Construction de Quebec for $25,622.74 by the Court of King's Bench should be affirmed, as well as its decision dismissing the demand of the Concrete Column Clamps against the city of Quebec for a declaration of a privilege.\nHeld that the general rule, and it is an imperative one, that governs the registration of privileges (art. 2103 C.C.) and which stipulates that a notice or memorial to which a sworn deposition of the creditor is annexed mist be deposited at the registry office, also applies in the case of a claim by a sub-contractor. Although supplementary formalities are imposed by article 2013 (f) in the case of a sub-contract, the sub-contractor must nevertheless perform the other essential formalities prescribed by the general rule contained in article 2103 C.C.\u2014Sworn deposition must be given by the creditor whether registration is by way of notice or by way of memorial. In this case, no privilege could have been acquired by the claimant company as the latter has not accompanied its claim with the affidavit required by the Civil Code. Moreover, even assuming that the registration would be valid in law, no privilege could have been created, as there is no evidence in the record to establish that the amount awarded by the arbitrators were in payment of work done before or after the date on which notice of the contracts had been given to the city of Quebec.\nHeld, also, that although the land upon which the reservoir has been constructed cannot be made subject to a privilege, such land being the properly of the Crown, the reservoir itself may be so subject as a distinct immoveable. But, in this case, such reservoir, being connected with the municipal aqueduct then in operation, forms part of the public domain and consequently cannot be made subject to a privilege. Such reservoir, from the very beginning of the work, and not from the date of the completion of the work, was part of public domain by destination.\nHeld, further, that under the circumstances of this case, the award of the arbitrators should be declared to be binding upon the parties who have agreed to such submission.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming that part of the judgment of the Superior Court, Pr\u00e9vost J.[2] which had dismissed the demand of the appellant, Concrete Column Clamps Ltd., against the mis-en-cause, the city of Quebec, for a declaration of privilege; but reversing the other part of that judgment, which had dismissed the action of Concrete Column Clamps Ltd. against La Compagnie de Construction de Quebec, Limit\u00e9e, thus maintaining the same for a sum of $25,622.74 being the amount of an award given by arbitrators.\nThe appellant, the Concrete Column Clamps Limited, was a sub-contractor of the respondent company, La Compagnie de Construction de Qu\u00e9bec Limit\u00e9e, which latter had a contract with the city of Quebec relating to the construction of a municipal reservoir. The Concrete Column Clamps Limited appellant's claim is based upon two contracts with the respondent company, La Compagnie de Construction de Quebec, Limit\u00e9e, and the appellant sought to recover a balance alleged to be due under these contracts, which, with a further sum of \"extras\" agreed upon, amounted to the total sum of $75,173.55. The appellant further asserted a privilege upon certain immoveable property in connection with the reservoir and in relation to which the appellant had registered various claims for privilege. The action was contested by the respondent company, alleging that the work had not been completed by the appellant company but, in fact, had been abandoned; that no extras had been agreed upon, and the appellant had received more than it was entitled to. The respondent also contested the alleged claim for a privilege. The respondent mis-en-cause, the city of Quebec, by a separate plea, likewise contested the action on various grounds, and particularly contended that the immoveable property in question formed part of the public domain and was not subject to any such registration of privileged claims. The city respondent further alleged that the essential formalities for registering such a privileged claim had not been complied with, and it further alleged that, in any event, such registration as was effected was tardy. The present action was taken in May, 1933. Before the case actually came to trial, the Concrete Column Clamps Limited and La Compagnie de Construction de Qu\u00e9bec, Limit\u00e9e, entered into an arbitration agreement. The Concrete Column Clamps Limited, being the party of the first part, was therein described as,\nherein acting by Mr. Dominique Vocisano duly authorized by resolution of the board of directors, a copy of which is hereunto annexed to form part, adopted by the directors of the company on the 31st May, 1935.\nThe company respondent, La Compagnie de Construction de Quebec, Limit\u00e9e, is also therein described as,\nherein acting by Mr. 33\u00e9loni Poulin duly authorized hereto by resolution of the board of directors, adopted on the 1st December, 1932, a copy whereof if hereunto annexed.\nThis arbitration agreement, after having set out that the parties, were then engaged in litigation, and that the respective claims involved questions of law and facts, and that the questions of fact were complicated, proceeds to declare that the parties desired to submit these questions to experts who shall decide in a final and definitive manner, after having examined the contracts and the agreement and heard the witnesses, what sums may be respectively due to each, of the parties. The agreement further proceeded to name two civil engineers, Mr. Olivier Lefebvre and Mr. C. V. Johnson, as the arbitrators, and the parties agreed to submit to them all the documents that the experts considered necessary, and to produce their respective witnesses. It was further provided that no testimony would be taken by stenography, and no advocate would assist at the inquiry; the arbitrators were to make their report without being obliged to give any reasons for their decision; and the parties agreed, in advance, to accept the decision of the arbitrators as final. The award was to be rendered not later than thirty days after the date of the arbitration agreement. The arbitration agreement was signed as follows: B\u00e9loni Poulin; Concrete Column Clamps Limited, per Dominique Vocisano. The arbitrators accepted their appointment, and proceeded to execute their task, and on the 8th August, 1935, deposited their award with Mr. C. E. Taschereau, notary. In this award the arbitrators expressly mentioned that the two companies parties to the arbitration agreement had written letters extending the delay for rendering the award to the 15th day of August, 1935. The arbitrators had been duly sworn, and after hearing witnesses and examining the documents they agreed, in their decision, that the company appellant, the Concrete Column Clamps Limited, was entitled to the sum of $25,622.74 in final settlement of all claims due to one another: thus disposing of the counter-claim of the company respondent. The latter refused to abide by the award, or to pay the same, and ultimately the appellant company made a motion to be allowed to file a supplementary answer invoking the arbitration agreement and the award. This motion was granted, and on appeal to the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, the judgment allowing such supplementary answer was affirmed on the 19th March, 1936. The supplementary answer was accordingly produced, and a reply thereto filed by the respondent company. In opposition to this award the respondent company raised various objections, contending that certain formalities had not been complied with, but relying generally upon the contention that the arbitration agreement was intended to put an end to the litigation, and was therefore a \"transaction.\" The respondent accordingly submitted that the arbitration agreement was illegal and invalid as not having been legally executed by the company respondent, the respondent alleging that, although the arbitration agreement was signed by its president, B\u00e9loni Poulin, as appeared from the document itself, the latter had no authority, as such, to enter into a contract amounting to a transaction. The respondent also alleged that although it appeared in the preamble to the arbitration agreement that Mr. Poulin was duly authorized by resolution of the board of directors, a copy of which was declared to be annexed thereto, no such copy was in fact annexed to the arbitration agreement, and as a consequence the appellant had failed to establish that Mr. Poulin, the president of the respondent company, had the necessary authority to execute such an agreement, and accordingly the agreement itself was null and void and the award following thereon was valueless.\nGustave Mouette K.C. and B. Robinson K.C. for the appellant in first appeal and respondent in second appeal, The Concrete Column Clamps Limited.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and M.-L. Beaulieu K.C. for the respondent The City of Quebec and the appellant La Compagnie de Construction de Qu\u00e9bec, Limit\u00e9e.\nFIRST APPEAL\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014L'appelante a poursuivi la Compagnie de Construction de Qu\u00e9bec pour la somme de $75,173.55. Elle all\u00e8gue dans son action que ce montant lui est d\u00fb pour travaux qu'elle a \u00e9x\u00e9cut\u00e9s en vertu d'un sous-contrat qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti par la Compagnie de Construction de Qu\u00e9bec. Cette derni\u00e8re compagnie \u00e9tait le contracteur principal nomm\u00e9 par la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec pour construire un r\u00e9servoir municipal sur la Parc des Champs de Bataille. La cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec est mise en cause afin qu'il soit dit et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le r\u00e9servoir construit sur le lot 4437, de m\u00eame que ce lot, sont affect\u00e9s d'un privil\u00e8ge pour garantir le paiement de cette somme.\nLa Compagnie de Construction de Qu\u00e9bec Limit\u00e9e ainsi que la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec ont produit au dossier chacune un plaidoyer s\u00e9par\u00e9, et avant que la cause ne soit inscrite pour audition il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu entre la Compagnie de Construction et la Concrete Column Clamps Limited de soumettre le litige \u00e0 des arbitres.\nCeux-ci en sont venus \u00e0 la conclusion que la Concrete Column Clamps Limited avait droit \u00e0 $25,622.74. Par d\u00e9cision de M. le juge Gibsone confirm\u00e9e par la Cour du Banc du Roi, ce rapport des arbitres a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 au dossier et l'honorable juge Pr\u00e9vost, le 30 juin 1938, a rejet\u00e9 l'action de la Concrete Column Clamps contre la Compagnie de Construction, et il a \u00e9galement refus\u00e9 d'accorder les conclusions contre la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e0 l'effet que le r\u00e9servoir et le lot sur lequel le r\u00e9servoir est construit, \u00e9taient affect\u00e9s d'un privil\u00e8ge. La Concrete Column Clamps a appel\u00e9 de ce jugement. Par jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi, l'appel de la Concrete Column Clamps a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenu contre la Compagnie de Construction pour la somme de $25,622.74 d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par les arbitres, mais l'appel contre la cit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nNous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider dans la pr\u00e9sente cause si la Concrete Column Clamps Limited a droit aux conclusions qu'elle demande contre la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, c'est-\u00e0-dire si le r\u00e9servoir et le lot sur lequel il est construit sont affect\u00e9s d'un privil\u00e8ge.\nLes questions soumises sont donc de savoir si le privil\u00e8ge a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 suivant les formes l\u00e9gales, si les avis n\u00e9cessaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s dans le temps voulu, et si ce r\u00e9servoir, propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, peut \u00eatre affect\u00e9 d'un privil\u00e8ge de constructeur.\nLa r\u00e8gle qui gouverne l'enregistrement des privil\u00e8ges se trouve \u00e0 l'article 2103 C.C. Cet article nous dit qu'un avis ou bordereau accompagn\u00e9 d'un affidavit doit \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au bureau d'enregistrement. C'est la proc\u00e9dure qui doit \u00eatre rigoureusement employ\u00e9e pour que le privil\u00e8ge soit r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement conserv\u00e9, et la r\u00e8gle est imp\u00e9rative. Elle s'applique pour la conservation du privil\u00e8ge d'architecte, de constructeur, de fournisseur de mat\u00e9riaux, mais fait exception pour le privil\u00e8ge de l'ouvrier qui est conserv\u00e9 sans les formalit\u00e9s de l'enregistrement.\nLorsqu'il s'agit du sous-entrepreneur, l'article 2013 (f) C.C. exige des formalit\u00e9s suppl\u00e9mentaires. Il faut, nous dit l'article, que le sous-entrepreneur d\u00e9nonce au propri\u00e9taire l'existence de son contrat avec le contracteur principal et, \u00e0 cette condition, le privil\u00e8ge sera conserv\u00e9 pour les travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9nonciation. Mais le l\u00e9gislateur n'a pas dispens\u00e9 le sous-entrepreneur de remplir les autres formalit\u00e9s essentielles car l'article 2013 (f) C.C. ajoute \"pourvu qu'il fasse enregistrer avant l'expiration des trente jours qui suivent la fin des travaux un \u00e9tat de sa cr\u00e9ance. Ce privil\u00e8ge est soumis aux m\u00eames formali\u00e9s que celui du constructeur et de l'architecte, quant \u00e0 sa cr\u00e9ation et son extinction.\" Quelles sont ces formalit\u00e9s? Elles se trouvent \u00e9videmment \u00e0 l'article 2103 C.C. qui contient les r\u00e8gles g\u00e9n\u00e9rales concernant l'enregistrement de ces privil\u00e8ges. Cet article ne mentionne pas le mot \"sous-entrepreneur\", mais l'article 2013 (a) C.C. nous dit que le mot \"constructeur\" comprend \u00e9galement un entrepreneur et un sous-entrepreneur.\nOn a soutenu que l'affidavit n'\u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire que lorsque l'enregistrement se faisait par bordereau et qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas essentiel lorsqu'on proc\u00e9dait au moyen d'un avis donn\u00e9 au propri\u00e9taire. Je ne puis accepter cette proposition. \"Avis\" et \"bordereau\" doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s comme ayant un sens identique. La n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de l'affidavit est manifeste. Il a pour but d'emp\u00eacher un contracteur peu scrupuleux de grever d'un privil\u00e8ge frivole l'immeuble d'un propri\u00e9taire. Il serait \u00e9trange que l'affidavit f\u00fbt n\u00e9cessaire lorsque l'enregistrement se fait par bordereau, et qu'il ne le f\u00fbt pas lorsqu'on enregistre au moyen d'un avis. Comme la loi est imp\u00e9rative et que le privil\u00e8ge n'est conserv\u00e9 que par l'enregistrement d'un avis ou bordereau sous forme d'affidavit, il s'ensuit que dans la pr\u00e9sente cause soumise \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration de cette Cour, le privil\u00e8ge est nul vu que l'affidavit n\u00e9cessaire n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produit. Ce seul point pourrait disposer de la cause, mais il n'est pas sans int\u00e9r\u00eat de discuter \u00e9galement les autres questions soumises.\nLa demanderesse r\u00e9clame un privil\u00e8ge comme sous-entrepreneur, mais tel privil\u00e8ge, nous l'avons vu, ne peut exister en faveur du sous-entrepremenur que pour la valeur des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9nonciation de son contrat au propri\u00e9taire.\nL'appelante a notifi\u00e9 la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec une premi\u00e8re fois par lettre le 21 juin 1932, mais il est prouv\u00e9 et admis que cette lettre n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec que le 6 septembre 1932. Un second avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9 \u00e0 la ville le 28 septembre 1932, mais \u00e0 ces deux dates, la majeure partie de l'ouvrage \u00e9tait accomplie. Quant aux travaux suppl\u00e9mentaires, ils n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9nonc\u00e9s qu'apr\u00e8s leur compl\u00e8te ex\u00e9cution.\nIl n'y a aucune preuve au dossier nous permettant de conclure que les montants accord\u00e9s par les arbitres sont en paiement des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s avant ou apr\u00e8s les dates o\u00f9 les contrats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9nonc\u00e9s. A cause de cette incertitude, il me faut en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que les d\u00e9nonciations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tardives, et pour cette raison je crois que m\u00eame si l'enregistrement eut \u00e9t\u00e9 valide, le privil\u00e8ge serait inexistant. Enfin, une derni\u00e8re question se pr\u00e9sente. Ce r\u00e9servoir construit sur un terrain propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00e9tait-il susceptible d'\u00eatre affect\u00e9 d'un privil\u00e8ge? Ce terrain est connu sous le num\u00e9ro 4437 du cadastre officiel de la Division Montcalm dans la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec. Il est la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral mais est administr\u00e9 par la Commission des Champs de Bataille Nationaux. Le 3 juillet 1931, celle-ci, d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9e, donnait \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec le droit de construire un r\u00e9servoir sur le lot 4437 sans cependant en abandonner la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. La Commission consentait \u00e0 la ville un droit de superficie distinct du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. L'existence d'un semblant de droit de superficie a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue d\u00e9j\u00e0 par cette Cour dans une cause de Tremblay v. Guay[3]. Il a de plus \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9fini de la fa\u00e7on suivante par Fuzier-Herman R\u00e9pertoire Vo. Superficie, No. 1:\nLe droit de superficie consiste \u00e0 avoir la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9difices ou plantations reposant sur un terrain qui appartient \u00e0 autrui.\nBaudry-Lacantinerie & Chauveau, Bien, No. 372, s'expriment de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\u2014\nL'article 555 statue en vue de constructions faites \u00e0 l'insu du propri\u00e9taire du terrain. Si les constructions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites \u00e0 sa connaissance et surtout avec son autorisation, il ne pourra pas les revendiquer comme lui appartenant, ni forcer le constructeur \u00e0 les d\u00e9molir. Il intervient, en pareil cas, entre le propri\u00e9taire du terrain et le constructeur un contrat sui generis, en vertu duquel le propri\u00e9taire du sol autorise le constructeur \u00e0 jouir des constructions pendant un certain temps, autant qu'elles dureront. Il y a cr\u00e9ation au profit du constructeur d'une sorte de droit de superficie.\nSirey, 3i\u00e8me \u00e9dition, 1892, page 671, nous dit ce qui suit:\u2014\nLes constructions \u00e9lev\u00e9es sur un terrain d\u00e9pendant du domaine public, en vertu d'une permission de l'administration, constituent, bien que cette permission soit r\u00e9vocable, des immeubles qui peuvent \u00eatre valablement transmis, hypoth\u00e8qu\u00e9s et saisis comme tels, sous la condition r\u00e9solutoire de la r\u00e9vocation du dernier.\nIl est certain que le terrain propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la Couronne ne peut \u00eatre affect\u00e9 d'un privil\u00e8ge, mais le r\u00e9servoir, immeuble s\u00e9par\u00e9, peut l'\u00eatre s'il ne fait pas lui-m\u00eame partie du domaine public.

Cette cause n'est pas semblable \u00e0 celle qui nous est soumise, mais le procureur de l'intim\u00e9 rappelle ce que disait M. le juge Lamont \u00e0 la page 593 pour \u00e9tablir sa pr\u00e9tention que le mot \"immeuble\" comprend et la b\u00e2tisse et le terrain et en tire la conclusion que si le terrain ne peut pas \u00eatre affect\u00e9 d'un privil\u00e8ge, la b\u00e2tisse ne peut pas l'\u00eatre davantage. Voici ce que disait M. le juge Lamont:\u2014\nThe word ''immoveable\" here means the premises to which additional value is given by the work done or the materials used. That is the land and any building erected thereon forming in law a part thereof.\nJe concours dans cette expression d'opinion, mais dans cette cause qui nous est cit\u00e9e le terrain \u00e9tait susceptible d'\u00eatre affect\u00e9 d'un privil\u00e8ge. On ne peut pas cependant en conclure que si le terrain n'est pas susceptible d'\u00eatre affect\u00e9 d'un privil\u00e8ge, un immeuble dessus construit et qui constitue une entit\u00e9 diff\u00e9rente jouira de la m\u00eame exemption. Il ne faut pas donner au jugement dans cette cause de Gadbois[5] une port\u00e9e qu'il n'a a pas. Je n'ai pas d'h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 dire qu'un r\u00e9servoir raccord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'aqueduc municipal alors en op\u00e9ration, fait partie du domaine public et qu'il ne peut en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre affect\u00e9 d'un privil\u00e8ge. Vide: Aubry et Rau, Vol. 2, page 43, 5i\u00e8me \u00e9dition; Baudry & Lacantinerie, Vol. 6, \"Des Biens\" page 141, 3i\u00e8me \u00e9dition; Laurent, Vol. 6, No. 63, page 85; Dalloz, \"R\u00e9pertoire Pratique\", Vo \"Commune\" No. 3232; Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, Vo \"Domaine public\" No. 82; Hauriou, \"Pr\u00e9cis de Droit Administratif et de Droit Public\", page 828, 12i\u00e8me \u00e9dition; Dillon, Municipal Corporations, 5i\u00e8me \u00e9dition, Vol. 3, Nos. 992 et 993, page 1586; McQuillan, Municipal Corporations, 2i\u00e8me \u00e9dition, Vol. 3, No. 1263, page 789.\nL'appelante a soumis subsidiairement que m\u00eame si, en principe, un immeuble municipal fait partie du domaine public, il ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme tel qu'au moment de la prise de possession par la municipalit\u00e9. Or, comme la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec n'a pris possession du r\u00e9servoir que le 19 mai 1933, et qu'\u00e0 cette date les travaux \u00e9taient ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, il s'ensuivrait que lorsque le privil\u00e8ge a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 le r\u00e9servoir pouvait \u00eatre valablement affect\u00e9 d'un privil\u00e8ge. Cette prise de possession ou affectation au domaine public dont parlent les auteurs et qui rend un immeuble municipal \"extra commercium\" est n\u00e9cessaire lorsque l'immeuble en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 originairement la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'un individu. Si pendant cette possession l'immeuble est affect\u00e9 d'un privil\u00e8ge, celui-ci continuera \u00e0 subsister lors m\u00eame que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 serait subs\u00e9quemment incorpor\u00e9e au domaine public. Mais lorsque d\u00e8s avant la construction il y a une destination au domaine public, la situation l\u00e9gale n'est plus la m\u00eame. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, l'affectation aux fins municipales a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par la loi 20 Geo. 5, article 1er, chap. 110 et aussi par la r\u00e9solution de l'autorit\u00e9 municipale. Il s'ensuit donc que d\u00e8s l'origine le r\u00e9servoir, par destination faisait partie du domaine public et qu'il n'est pas susceptible d'\u00eatre affect\u00e9 d'un privil\u00e8ge.\nPour ces raisons, l'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nSECOND APPEAL\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014L'appelante, la Compagnie de Construction de Qu\u00e9bec Limit\u00e9e, a obtenu de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec un contrat pour la construction d'un r\u00e9servoir municipal situ\u00e9 sur le Parc des Champs de Bataille. Elle a consenti un sous-contrat \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, la Concrete Column Clamps Limited, qui a institu\u00e9 contre l'appelante une action au montant de $75,173.55 pour travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s et non pay\u00e9s.\nAu cours du proc\u00e8s, les parties ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de soumettre leurs difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 un arbitrage et le r\u00f4le des arbitres \u00e9tait de d\u00e9terminer le montant qui pouvait \u00eatre d\u00fb au sous-contracteur.\nLa sentence arbitrale a fix\u00e9 ce montant \u00e0 $25,622.74, et par d\u00e9cision de M. le juge Gibsone confirm\u00e9e par la Cour du Banc du Roi cette sentence a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e au dossier. L'honorable juge Pr\u00e9vost a rejet\u00e9 l'action, mais la Cour du Banc du Roi renversant la d\u00e9cision de la cour inf\u00e9rieure l'a maintenue pour cette somme.\nL'appelante soutient que le contrat d'arbitrage ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 entre les parties est ill\u00e9gal et nul parce qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par un de ses officiers ayant la capacit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale de le faire. Elle pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement que la sentence arbitrale est inop\u00e9rante parce qu'elle n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue dans les d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s au contrat intervenu entre les parties.\nSi l'appelante a raison, l'action doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e car ce rapport des arbitres est la seule preuve qui soit au dossier. L'article 1432 du Code de Proc\u00e8dure Civile se lit de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\u2014\nIl n'y a que ceux qui ont la capacit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale de disposer des objets compris dans le compromis qui puissent s'y soumettre.\nJe ne crois pas que l'on puisse contester le pouvoir d'une compagnie de se soumettre \u00e0 un arbitrage. Elle a la capacit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale de le faire et son acte n'est pas ultra vires de ses pouvoirs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux. On conteste cependant l'autorit\u00e9 de B\u00e9loni Poulin, le pr\u00e9sident de la compagnie appelante, de signer pour celle-ci le contrat soumettant ce litige aux arbitres. Dans l'acte qu'il a sign\u00e9, B\u00e9loni Poulin d\u00e9clare qu'il y a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9, et l'absence d'une copie de r\u00e9solution n'est pas, \u00e0 mon avis, suffisante pour entrainer la nullit\u00e9 de l'acte.\nOn pr\u00e9tend que la r\u00e9solution invoqu\u00e9e est ant\u00e9rieure au proc\u00e8s, vu qu'elle porte la date du 1er d\u00e9cembre 1932 et que l'action n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e qu'au cours du mois de mai 1933. L'explication fournie par le procureur de l'intim\u00e9 me satisfait. Il s'agirait d'une r\u00e9solution ant\u00e9rieure conf\u00e9rant au pr\u00e9sident le pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de signer des documents comme celui qui fait l'objet du pr\u00e9sent litige.\nD'ailleurs, il incombait \u00e0 l'appelante de faire la preuve du d\u00e9faut d'autorit\u00e9 de son pr\u00e9sident vu que c'est elle qui l'invoquait.\nIl est \u00e0 remarquer que c'est longtemps apr\u00e8s la signature du contrat que l'appelante prend l'attitude actuelle. Apr\u00e8s la signature de la convention, elle y a donn\u00e9 suite, elle a produit une preuve devant les arbitres, elle a fait venir ses t\u00e9moins, et lorsque l'intim\u00e9e a voulu verser au dossier le rapport des arbitres, elle a invoqu\u00e9 ce m\u00eame arbitrage qu'elle veut r\u00e9pudier maintenant pour pr\u00e9tendre que le proc\u00e8s \u00e9tait d\u00e9finitivement r\u00e9gl\u00e9. Cette pr\u00e9tention que le pr\u00e9sident de l'appelante n'\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9 vient, \u00e0 mon sens, tardivement et ne peut pas \u00eatre entretenue. Tout dans le dossier d\u00e9montre que l'appelante a ratifi\u00e9 les actes de son pr\u00e9sident et elle n'a jamais song\u00e9 \u00e0 le d\u00e9savouer.\nQuant au second point soulev\u00e9 \u00e0 l'effet que la sentence arbitrale n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue dans les d\u00e9lais stipul\u00e9s au contrat, je crois qu'il est mal fond\u00e9. L'appelante et l'intim\u00e9e ont toutes deux fait parvenir des lettres aux arbitres pour \u00e9tendre le d\u00e9lai et ceux-ci ont rendu leur sentence dans le temps mentionn\u00e9 aux consentements.\nPour les raisons donn\u00e9es lors de l'\u00e9tude du premier grief de l'appelante, je crois que les signataires de ces lettres avaient l'autorisation voulue et que l'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant in the first appeal and the respondent in the second appeal, The Concrete Column Clamps Limited: Robinson & Shapiro.\nSolicitor for the respondent in the first appeal and the appellant in the second appeal: Marie-Louis Beaulieu.\n[1] (1939) Q.R. 67 KB. 536.\n[2] (1939) Q.R. 77 S.C 543.\n[3] [1929] S.C.R. 29.\n[4] [1929] S.C.R. 587.\n[5] [1929] S.C.R. 587.\n"

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Pr\u00e9vost J. and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe appellant and the respondent, both directors of a limited company in insolvency, signed a promissory note in favour of a bank for a sum of $4,639.17 in payment of a debt due by the company to the bank. The appellant paid in full the amount of the note when due and brought an action against his co-debtor, the respondent, for $2,569.49 representing the latter's share or portion of the total amount paid to the bank for capital and interest. The last instalment paid by the appellant to the bank was in. 1927, and the writ was served upon the respondent in 1938. The respondent pleaded that the appellant's claim was subject to the prescription of five years provided by paragraph 4 of article 2260 C.C.; while the appellant contended that the rights of the parties were governed by the terms of article 2242 C.C., on the ground that any claim under the promissory note had been extinguished by the payment of the note which no more existed and that a new debt not commercial in its nature has been created by articles 1117 and 1118 C.C.[1].\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. A. Dion for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014L'appelant, demandeur en cour inf\u00e9rieure, et l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9taient tous deux directeurs de la Cie de Canots de Roberval Lt\u00e9e. Cette compagnie \u00e9tait incapable de rencontrer ses obligations, et les parties en cette cause ont alors sign\u00e9 en faveur de la Banque Canadienne Nationale un billet promissoire au montant de $4,639.17. L'appelant a pay\u00e9 seul la totalit\u00e9 du billet ainsi que les int\u00e9r\u00eats, moins ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par la vente de certaines garanties, et il a institu\u00e9 contre le d\u00e9fendeur une action pour la somme de $2,569.48, repr\u00e9sentant la part de responsabilit\u00e9 de son cod\u00e9biteur. L'action a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e le 4 mars 1938, et le dernier paiement \u00e0 la Banque fait par le demandeur Ta \u00e9t\u00e9 le 27 septembre 1927. Le d\u00e9fendeur a invoqu\u00e9 le plaidoyer de prescription, et la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi lui donnant raison ont rejet\u00e9 la demande.\nDevant cette Cour se soul\u00e8ve en outre la question de juridiction et il importe en premier lieu de la d\u00e9cider. Selon l'intim\u00e9, l'appelant aurait pay\u00e9 $2,888.00 de capital et $368.00 d'int\u00e9r\u00eat, formant un total de $3,256.00. On a produit \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate un \u00e9tat d\u00e9montrant en capital et int\u00e9r\u00eat d\u00e9bours\u00e9s, $4,256.00, mais ce chiffre comporte une erreur manifeste de $1,000.00. Cependant, \u00e0 cette somme de $3,256.00 il faut ajouter les int\u00e9r\u00eats se chiffrant \u00e0 $810.00, soit 5% sur $3,256.00 durant 5 ans, ce qui donne un montant global de $4,066.00. Comme l'appelant ne r\u00e9clame que la moiti\u00e9 de cette somme, son action serait donc r\u00e9duite \u00e0 $2,033.00, et ce montant serait suffisant pour donner juridiction \u00e0 cette Cour.\nL'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend cependant que l'appelant ne peut pas r\u00e9clamer d'int\u00e9r\u00eat sur l'item de $368.00 car, dans l'affirmative, il obtiendrait l'int\u00e9r\u00eat sur l'int\u00e9r\u00eat, ce qui est contraire aux dispositions du Code Civil. Je ne puis admettre cette pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9, car il ne s'agit pas de r\u00e9clamer l'int\u00e9r\u00eat sur de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat, mais bien l'int\u00e9r\u00eat sur des d\u00e9bours\u00e9s faits par l'appelant. Le montant en jeu est donc de $2,033.00 et il est, en cons\u00e9quence, suffisant pour donner juridiction \u00e0 cette Cour.\nLa question la plus importante qui se pose est de savoir si le plaidoyer de prescription de l'intim\u00e9 est bien fond\u00e9, comme l'ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 et la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi. Il s'est \u00e9videmment \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre la date du dernier paiement et la date de l'institution de l'action une periode de temps suffisante pour que la demande soit prescrite, si la prescription de 5 ans doit s'appliquer, mais si la prescription trentenaire doit r\u00e9gler les droits des parties, la situation sera bien diff\u00e9rente.\nL'appelant base ses pr\u00e9tentions sur les articles 1117 et 1118 du Code Civil qui se lisent de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\u2014\n1117. L'obligation contract\u00e9e solidairement envers le cr\u00e9ancier, se divise de plein droit entre les cod\u00e9biteurs qui n'en sont tenus entre eux que chacun pour sa part.\n1118. Le cod\u00e9biteur d'une dette solidaire qui l'a pay\u00e9e en entier, ne peut r\u00e9p\u00e9ter contre les autres que les parts et portions de chacun d'eux, encore qu'il soit sp\u00e9cialement subrog\u00e9 aux droits du cr\u00e9ancier. Lorsque le billet a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9, nous dit l'appelant, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9 en vertu des dispositions de l'article 139 de la Loi des Lettres de Change, qui dit:\u2014\n139. Une lettre de change est acquitt\u00e9e par paiement r\u00e9gulier fait par le tir\u00e9 ou accepteur ou pour lui.\n* * *\nToujours d'apr\u00e8s l'appelant, cet effet commercial \u00e9tant disparu ne peut servir de base \u00e0 l'action, mais celle-ci trouve son fondement sur les articles 1117 et 1118 C.C. qui donnent \u00e0 celui qui a pay\u00e9 le droit de r\u00e9clamer la moiti\u00e9 de ses d\u00e9bours\u00e9s en capital et int\u00e9r\u00eat. Il s'agirait, en cons\u00e9quence, d'une cr\u00e9ance nouvelle qui n'est pas assujettie \u00e0 la prescription de 5 ans pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 4 de l'article 2260 C.C. D'autre part, l'intim\u00e9 soutient que l'appelant ayant pay\u00e9 la totalit\u00e9 du billet est subrog\u00e9 dans les droits de la Banque Canadienne Nationale et a un recours contre son cod\u00e9biteur pour la moiti\u00e9 de ses d\u00e9bours\u00e9s, non pas en vertu de 1117 et 1118 C.C. mais bien en vertu du paragraphe 3 de l'article 1156 C.C. qui se lit ainsi:\u2014\n1156. La subrogation a lieu par le seul effet de la loi et sans demande:\n* * *\n(3) Au profit de celui qui paye une dette \u00e0 laquelle il est tenu avec d'autres ou pour d'autres, et qu'il a int\u00e9r\u00eat d'acquitter.\nIl n'y a pas de doute que l'appelant et l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9taient conjointement et solidairement responsables vis-\u00e0-vis la Banque pour le montant total apparaissant au billet promissoire. L'un n'\u00e9tait pas la caution de l'autre mais ils \u00e9taient bien tous deux responsables solidairement pour la totalit\u00e9 de la cr\u00e9ance, et la Banque pouvait exercer son recours contre l'un ou contre l'autre.\nM. Bergeron, le demandeur appelant, nous explique de la fa\u00e7on suivante comment cette dette a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e vis-\u00e0-vis la Banque:\u2014\nM. Lindsay et moi avions avanc\u00e9 pas mal d'argent \u00e0 la compagnie, et le seul moyen que nous avions d'esp\u00e9rer un remboursement partiel c'\u00e9tait de conserver les immeubles qui restaient \u00e0 la compagnie. Nous avions un double int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 la conservation de ces immeubles. D'abord, nous voulions en emp\u00eacher la vente judiciaire. Nous n'avions pas les moyens dans le temps de racheter pour nous prot\u00e9ger, et une vente judiciaire provoquait imm\u00e9diatement la demande d'une obligation de $10,000 en faveur de l'abb\u00e9 Joseph Savard, que nous avions cautionn\u00e9e, M. Lindsay et M. Armand L\u00e9vesque et moi, solidairement, par un billet. Alors une vente par le sh\u00e9rif nous mettait cette dette sur les \u00e9paules et nous enlevait toute protection possible pour notre remboursement. Les parties \u00e9taient donc toutes deux responsables vis-\u00e0-vis la Banque, et celui qui payait la totalit\u00e9 de cette cr\u00e9ance payait une dette \u00e0 laquelle il \u00e9tait tenu avec l'autre, et qu'il avait manifestement int\u00e9r\u00eat d'acquitter, pour \u00e9viter des proc\u00e9dures l\u00e9gales et une ex\u00e9cution possible. La question ne manque pas d'int\u00e9r\u00eat, et pour la r\u00e9soudre, il faut d'abord examiner la nature de la subrogation l\u00e9gale. Pothier la d\u00e9finissait de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\u2014\nC'est une fiction de droit par laquelle le cr\u00e9ancier est cens\u00e9 c\u00e9der ses droits, actions, hypoth\u00e8que et privil\u00e8ge \u00e0 celui de qui il re\u00e7oit son d\u00fb.\nMourlon nous dit que\nc'est la substitution plus ou moins compl\u00e8te d'une tierce personne dans les droits du cr\u00e9ancier qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e par elle.\nAinsi donc, l'on voit par ces d\u00e9finitions que non seulement les garanties sont transport\u00e9es au subrog\u00e9, mais \u00e9galement les droits et actions, et cela par l'op\u00e9ration de la loi sans qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire d'avoir recours \u00e0 aucune formalit\u00e9.\nLa cr\u00e9ance elle-m\u00eame est transport\u00e9e au subrog\u00e9, et c'est ce qu'enseignent Planiol et Ripert, Trait\u00e9 El\u00e9mentaire de Droit Civil, Vol. 2, page 179, o\u00f9, traitant de l'effet translatif de la subrogation, ils s'expriment de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\u2014\nDans son ensemble l'op\u00e9ration est une transmission de cr\u00e9ance. Le d\u00e9biteur a maintenant un cr\u00e9ancier nouveau, le subrog\u00e9, \u00e0 la place de l'ancien.\nLa subrogation fait acqu\u00e9rir au subrog\u00e9 tous les droits du cr\u00e9ancier pay\u00e9, non pas seulement les droits accessoires (privil\u00e8ge, hypoth\u00e8que, cautionnement, etc.) mais la cr\u00e9ance elle-m\u00eame, le droit principal auquel ces diverses garanties sont attach\u00e9es.\nCeci semblerait venir en conflit avec les dispositions de l'article 139 de la Loi des Lettres de Change cit\u00e9 plus haut, mais je crois qu'une distinction s'impose. L'article 139 lib\u00e8re sans doute la lettre de change qui est pay\u00e9e, mais l'obligation n'est \u00e9teinte par ce paiement qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du cr\u00e9ancier et elle ne l'est certainement pas \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du d\u00e9biteur. La Banque Canadienne Nationale, \u00e9videmment, ayant re\u00e7u son paiement, ne peut plus exercer aucun recours, mais le nouveau cr\u00e9ancier, l'appelant, subrog\u00e9 par une fiction de la loi pour une partie de sa cr\u00e9ance, peut sans doute exercer les droits que la Banque aurait pu exercer contre l'intim\u00e9. Pothier, cit\u00e9 par Mourlon, \"Subrogations Personnelles\", page 12, dit ce qui suit, en traitant du paiement avec subrogation:\u2014\nC'est, dit-il, un vrai paiement, car ce n'est que par une fiction de droit que le subrog\u00e9 est cens\u00e9 avoir plut\u00f4t rachet\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ance que l'avoir pay\u00e9e, \"magis emisse nomen quam solvisse intelligitur\". Mais cette fiction ne doit profiter qu'\u00e0 lui.\nUn autre auteur, Bigot de Pr\u00e9ameneu s'exprime ainsi:\u2014\nUne obligation peut \u00eatre \u00e9teinte \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du cr\u00e9ancier par le paiement que lui fait un tiers subrog\u00e9 dans ses droits, sans que cette obligation soit \u00e9galement \u00e9teinte, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du d\u00e9biteur.\nMourlon au m\u00eame trait\u00e9 nous dit \u00e0 la page 10:\u2014\nMais, dit-on, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il y a paiement il y a extinction de la dette; donc la subrogation ne peut pas transporter la cr\u00e9ance elle-m\u00eame. Pour vouloir trop prouver, ce raisonnement ne prouve rien; car s'il est vrai qu'il est de l'essence d'un paiement d'\u00e9teindre la dette, s'il est vrai que la subrogation qui l'accompagne ne l'emp\u00eache pas de produire ses effets ordinaires, comment se fait-il que les accessoires de la dette lui survivent? Quoi! la cr\u00e9ance est \u00e9teinte et ses garanties subsistent encore?\nIl s'ensuit donc que l'effet de la subrogation l\u00e9gale pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 3 de l'article 1156 est de transporter la cr\u00e9ance elle-m\u00eame avec tous ses accessoires. Pendant longtemps, la transmission de la cr\u00e9ance a \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e en France parce que l'on a pr\u00e9tendu que la subrogation avait seulement pour but de transmettre au subrog\u00e9 les garanties accessoires qui appartenaient \u00e0 l'ancien cr\u00e9ancier. Planiol et Ripert, Trait\u00e9 El\u00e9mentaire de Droit Civil, vol. 2, page 179, nous disent que cette opinion est aujourd'hui enti\u00e8rement abandonn\u00e9e parce qu'elle est contraire \u00e0 la tradition et surtout au texte du code qui dit que le subrog\u00e9 acquiert tous les droits du cr\u00e9ancier. S'il acquiert tous les droits, il acquiert \u00e9videmment la cr\u00e9ance qui est le plus essentiel des droits et sans lequel les garanties ne pourraient pas subsister. A la m\u00eame page de l'ouvrage d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9, le m\u00eame auteur s'exprime de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\u2014\nSi le subrog\u00e9 acquiert la cr\u00e9ance elle-m\u00eame, et non pas seulement ses accessoires, il pourra profiter de certains avantages attach\u00e9s \u00e0 cette cr\u00e9ance et distincts de ses garanties. Ainsi, si la dette pay\u00e9e \u00e9tait commerciale, il pourra poursuivre le d\u00e9biteur devant les tribunaux de commerce, etc. etc.\nCette derni\u00e8re citation d\u00e9montre bien que lorsque la dette pay\u00e9e \u00e9tait une dette commerciale, la cr\u00e9ance de celui qui effectue le paiement contre son cod\u00e9biteur a aussi le caract\u00e8re d'une r\u00e9clamation commerciale. Il importe maintenant de consid\u00e9rer la nature de la cr\u00e9ance originaire de la Banque Canadienne Nationale contre les signataires du billet. Il ne peut faire de doute que cette cr\u00e9ance bas\u00e9e sur un billet promissoire \u00e9tait une cr\u00e9ance commerciale, et que l'appelant ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 subrog\u00e9 par l'op\u00e9ration de la loi contre l'intim\u00e9 pour une partie de cette cr\u00e9ance, a \u00e0 son tour une r\u00e9clamation d'une nature commerciale \u00e0 exercer contre l'intim\u00e9, et que la prescription de 5 ans doit n\u00e9cessairement trouver son application, en vertu du paragraphe 4 de l'article 2260 C.C.\nLes articles 1117 et 1118 C.C. ne viennent pas en conflit avec cette th\u00e9orie. Il importe en effet, une fois que sont connus les droits du subrog\u00e9, de d\u00e9terminer quelle sera l'\u00e9tendue de ces droits. Or, c'est ici qu'interviennent ces deux articles du Code Civil et qu'ils nous disent que lorsqu'une obligation est contract\u00e9e solidairement, le cod\u00e9biteur qui a pay\u00e9 ne peut r\u00e9p\u00e9ter des autres que les parts et portions de chacun d'eux. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, ils ne font que limiter les droits du subrog\u00e9.\nJ'en viens donc \u00e0 la conclusion que la r\u00e9clamation de l'appelant contre l'intim\u00e9 est d'une nature commerciale, qu'elle est, en cons\u00e9quence, prescrite et que les jugements de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et de la Cour du Banc du Roi sont bien fond\u00e9s.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Roland Bergeron.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J. Alf. Dion.\n[1] Reporter's Note: The Court of King's Bench has rendered a previous decision on similar questions of law in L\u00e9vesque v. Bergeron (1939) Q.R. 66 K.B. 213.\n"

VI, c. 44, s. 3)\u2014Inadequacy of sum awarded by jury\u2014New trial for re-assessment of damages.\nPlaintiff\u2019s daughter, aged 23 years, was killed in an accident which he alleged was caused by negligence of defendant. Plaintiff sued for damages under The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 210, and also, as administrator of his daughter\u2019s estate, for damages for her pain and suffering and loss of expectation of life, under The Trustee Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 165, s. 37 (as it stood prior to the amendment by 2 Geo. VI, c. 44, s. 3). At trial the jury found defendant guilty of negligence causing the accident in the degree of 55%, and assessed the damages under each Act respectively at $500, and plaintiff recovered judgment for 55% thereof in each case. Plaintiff\u2019s appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed, and he appealed to this Court on the question of the quantum of damages.\nHeld: The jury\u2019s assessment of damages under The Fatal Accidents Act should not be disturbed. But there should be a new trial for assessment of damages under The Trustee Act. Cases dealing with awards for loss of expectation of life reviewed.\nPer the Chief Justice, Davis and Taschereau JJ.: It is impossible to say in this case that $500 can, in any view, be proper compensation for the loss of the expectation of life.\nPer Crocket and Hudson JJ.: Considering the age, state of health and prospects of deceased, the amount awarded was so small as to indicate clearly that the jury did not appreciate the nature of the remedy provided by the statute. APPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing his appeal from the judgment of McTague J.\nThe plaintiff sued for damages by reason of the death of his daughter, 23 years of age, who was killed in a motor car accident which the plaintiff alleged was caused by negligence of the defendant. The deceased was a passenger in a car driven by one Brady, with which the defendant\u2019s car collided.\nThe plaintiff brought an action on behalf of himself and his wife under the provisions of The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 210, and also an action as administrator of the estate of his daughter, claiming in the latter action damages for the deceased\u2019s shortened expectation of life and pain and suffering, under s. 37 of The Trustee Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 165 (as it stood before the amendment by s. 3 of 2 Geo. VI, c. 44, which amendment was subsequent to the commencement of plaintiff\u2019s action and therefore, under the provisions of said s. 3, did not apply). The two actions were consolidated. The consolidated action was tried before McTague J. with a jury. The jury, in answers to questions submitted to them, found that the accident was caused by the negligence of both the defendant and Brady, and ascribed the degrees of negligence as follows: against defendant 55%; against Brady 45%. They assessed the damages at $500 under The Fatal Accidents Act and at $500 under The Trustee Act; and plaintiff recovered judgment for 55% of said sums, namely, $275 in each case. Plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, complaining (inter alia) against the amount of damages awarded by the jury. His appeal was dismissed, and he appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, limiting his appeal to the question of the quantum of damages. During the hearing of the appeal this Court stated that it would not interfere with the amount of damages as assessed by the jury under The Fatal Accidents Act, and the reasons for judgment now reported deal with the question as to the amount of damages under The Trustee Act.\nR.A. Hughes for the appellant.\nJ.D. Watt for the respondent. The judgment of the Chief Justice and Davis and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014By sec. 3 of The Trustee Amendment Act, 1938 (2 Geo. VI, ch. 44), assented to April 8, 1938, the Ontario Legislature amended subsec. 1 of sec. 37 of The Trustee Act (R.S.O., 1937, ch. 165) by adding at the end thereof the words:\nprovided that if death results from such injuries no damages shall be allowed for the death or for the loss of the expectation of life, but this proviso shall not be in derogation of any rights conferred by The Fatal Accidents Act.\nThe amendment was expressly declared by subsec. (2) of said sec. 3 not to apply to pending litigation. The writs in these actions, one under The Fatal Accidents Act and one under The Trustee Act, were issued March 2, 1938, and the actions were consolidated by an order dated March 24, 1938. We have therefore in this appeal to consider the question of damages for the loss of the expectation of life as the law stood prior to the amendment to The Trustee Act on April 8, 1938.\nAlice Winnifred King, a young woman of 23 years of age, was struck by the respondent\u2019s motor car and died within a few hours from her injuries. The consolidated action went to trial before McTague J. with a jury. The jury found both parties to the accident at fault and apportioned fault, 55% against the respondent and 45% against the deceased. The jury assessed the damages under The Fatal Accidents Act at $500 and under The Trustee Act at $500. It is not disputed that the jury intended the $500 for loss of expectation of life to be in addition to the $500 under The Fatal Accidents Act. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario against the quantum of the damages but the appeal was dismissed. The appellant then appealed to this Court.\nAs to the amount of damages under The Fatal Accidents Act, counsel for the appellant did not press that branch of his appeal and the Court in any event stated during the hearing that it would not interfere with that amount. The other branch of the appeal, the amount of damages for the loss of the expectation of life, has occasioned our serious consideration. The appellant contends that $500 was plainly an erroneous estimate of the loss of the expectation of life by the young woman of twenty-three years. In Rose v. Ford[1] the deceased woman was about the same age and the House of Lords awarded \u00a31,000 for loss of expectation of life. In Shepherd v. Hunter[2], where a jury, after a proper summing up, had awarded \u00a390 in respect of the loss of expectation of life by a healthy child, aged three, who was killed in a road accident, the Court of Appeal considered the verdict was clearly erroneous and directed a new trial in order that the amount might be re-estimated by another jury. In Bailey v. Howard[3], the loss of expectation of life by a child of three years had to be valued. The jury awarded \u00a31,000 and the Court of Appeal refused to interfere. In Ellis v. Raine[4], a child of eight years had been killed by a motor car. The jury awarded \u00a3125 damages under The Fatal Accidents Act and no damages for loss of the expectation of life. The Court of Appeal sent the case back to be re-tried on the two issues of the amount of damages.\nIn the very recent case of Mills v. Stanway Coaches Ltd.[5], the deceased was a married woman thirty-four years of age and in good health. She survived the accident for only four days and for most of that time she was unconscious. The jury assessed the loss of the expectation of life at \u00a32,000 but the Court of Appeal reduced the amount to \u00a31,000.\nWe think that it is impossible to say in this case that $500 can, in any view, be proper compensation for the loss of the expectation of life. The learned trial judge, McTague J., appears to have taken the same view of the verdict in this regard because after the verdict he suggested to counsel that they endeavour to agree upon some compromise, stating that in his opinion it would be advisable to do so in view of the amount of damages that had been awarded. Counsel for both parties before us stated that they would be willing to have the Court re-assess the damages if we came to the conclusion that the amount awarded by the jury could not stand, but we think that the only safe course, if the parties themselves cannot now agree upon an amount, is to have the damages assessed by another jury.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed and a new trial should be directed, limited to the assessment of damages in respect of the claim sued upon under The Trustee Act. The appellant should have his costs both in this Court and in the Court of Appeal. The appellant will have his costs of the action down to and including those of the abortive trial; the costs of and consequent upon the new trial will be dealt with by the trial judge.\nThe judgment of Crocket and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nHUDSON J.\u2014There were two actions: the first arising out of the claim under The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O., 1937, chap. 210, and the second under The Trustee Act, R.S.O., 1937, chap. 165.\nThe plaintiff was awarded by a jury damages of 55% of $500 under the provisions of The Fatal Accidents Act. The plaintiff was also awarded 55% of $500 under the provisions of The Trustee Act. On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, this decision was not disturbed. From that decision the present appellant now comes to this Court, the appeal being limited solely to the quantum of damages.\nThe question of the amount awarded under The Fatal Accidents Act was disposed of at the hearing before us and need not now be further considered.\nThe provision of The Trustee Act applicable and in force at the time of the accident is section 37 (1):\n37. (1) Except in cases of libel and slander, the executor or administrator of any deceased person may maintain an action for all torts or injuries to the person or to the property of the deceased in the same manner and with the same rights and remedies as the deceased would, if living, have been entitled to do, and the damages when recovered hall form part of the personal estate of the deceased.\nMiss King lived for a very short time after the accident. The principle upon which damages should be awarded in this case has been the subject of a great deal of discussion both in Canada and in England. The most authoritative statement is in the case of Rose v. Ford[6]. The statute provides that the administrator may maintain an action for injuries to the person of the deceased in the same manner and with the same rights and remedies as the deceased would, if living, have been entitled to do.\nThe court whose business it is to fix the damages is given the very difficult task of postulating the situation of the deceased having brought an action herself for damages for the loss of what remained of her life. Inevitably opinions would vary within very wide range as to what should be awarded in a case of this kind. In a good many of the reported cases the amount awarded has been regarded as excessive in courts of appeal and that amount reduced. In some, where it was so small as to indicate that the trial court did not fully appreciate the nature of the action, the amount has been increased.\nI think, in the present case, considering the age, state of health and prospects of the late Miss King, that the amount awarded was so small as to indicate clearly that the jury did not appreciate the nature of the remedy provided by the statute. For this reason, I am of opinion that the matter should be sent back to the trial court for a re-assessment of damages on the issue under The Trustee Act. The appellant should have his costs here and in the Court of Appeal and also his costs of action in any event.\nAppeal allowed in part with costs, and a new trial ordered as to the amount of damages in respect of the claim under The Trustee Act.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hughes & Laishley.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Herridge, Gowling, MacTavish & Watt.\n[1] [1937] A.C. 826; [1937] 3 All E.R. 359.\n[2] [1938] 2 All E.R. 587.\n[3] [1939] 1 K.B. 453.\n[4] [1939] 2 K.B. 180.\n[5] [1940] 2 K.B. 334; [1940] 2 All E.R. 586.\n[6] [1937] 3 All E.R. 359; [1937] A.C. 826.\n"

Dion.\nLa preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que plus tard, soit au d\u00e9but de 1933, Brault, sur le point de faire un voyage en Europe, demanda \u00e0 Dion de lui transporter les actions de la Duval Motors Limited et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Varennes, en ex\u00e9cution de l'\u00e9crit du 16 janvier 1931. Brault voulait mettre ordre \u00e0 ses affaires avant son d\u00e9part.\nLe 13 f\u00e9vrier 1933, un acte de vente fut sign\u00e9 devant Joseph Romuald Cr\u00e9peau en vertu duquel la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Dion situ\u00e9e \u00e0 Varennes fut transport\u00e9e \u00e0 Brault. Cet acte n'est pas un simple acte de transport tel qu'on pourrait s'y attendre, mais bien un acte de vente dans lequel un prix de $2,000 est stipul\u00e9, et o\u00f9 l'acqu\u00e9reur s'engage \u00e0 payer les taxes \u00e0 partir du 1er janvier 1933. Le 21 f\u00e9vrier de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, les actions de Duval Motors Limited sont effectivement transport\u00e9es \u00e0 Brault, et un certificat nouveau pour cent actions est \u00e9mis en sa faveur. Apparemment, les choses en sont rest\u00e9es l\u00e0 jusqu'au d\u00e9but de 1935, alors que Dion sollicite de Brault un nouvel emprunt. Celui-ci refuse, mais pour des raisons que j'examinerai plus tard, il transporta \u00e0 la fille de Donat Dion, C\u00e9cile Dion, l'intim\u00e9e, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Varennes. L'acte sign\u00e9 par les parties est \u00e9galement un acte de vente, o\u00f9 le prix stipul\u00e9 est de $2,000 que le vendeur Brault reconna\u00eet avoir re\u00e7u le jour de la signature dudit acte, soit le 15 avril 1935.\nEnfin, le 30 janvier 1936, Donat Dion a fait cession de ses biens et l'appelant, Hermas Perras, a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 syndic aux biens du failli. Le 14 septembre 1936, il a institu\u00e9 devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de Montr\u00e9al une action pour faire annuler et r\u00e9silier le transport consenti par Dion \u00e0 Brault ainsi que celui consenti par Brault \u00e0 C\u00e9cile Dion. Il demande dans son action que ces actes soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s simul\u00e9s, qu'il soit dit et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le failli Dion a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble en question qui ne serait jamais sorti de son patrimoine.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure lui a donn\u00e9 raison, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 les deux transports simul\u00e9s, mais la Cour du Banc du Roi (MM. les juges Tellier et Barclay dissidents) a renvers\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision. C'est de ce jugement qu'il y a appel.\nIl importe de signaler d\u00e8s maintenant que l'action institu\u00e9e par le syndic \u00e0 la faillite n'est pas une action paulienne malgr\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations que l'on rencontre aux paragraphes 8, 9 et 16 de la d\u00e9claration. L'action paulienne doit \u00eatre institu\u00e9e avant l'expiration d'un an \u00e0 compter du jour o\u00f9 le cr\u00e9ancier a eu connaissance de la transaction frauduleuse, et elle ne peut \u00eatre institu\u00e9e que par un cr\u00e9ancier qui conna\u00eet l'insolvabilit\u00e9 de la personne avec qui il contracte \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux. L'action soumise \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration de cette Cour est bien diff\u00e9rente. Il s'agit d'une action en d\u00e9claration de simulation et le requ\u00e9rant syndic \u00e0 la faillite soutient que les actes attaqu\u00e9s sont inexistants, que l'immeuble qui fait l'objet du litige n'est jamais devenu la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'acqu\u00e9reur, mais a toujours demeur\u00e9 dans le patrimoine de Dion. Une semblable action, en cons\u00e9quence, n'est pas sujette \u00e0 la prescription \u00e9dict\u00e9e par l'article 1040 du Code Civil, et peut \u00eatre institu\u00e9e soit par les cr\u00e9anciers ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 l'acte attaqu\u00e9, soit par des cr\u00e9anciers post\u00e9rieurs.\nLes parties ne contestent pas que Dion a re\u00e7u les sept d\u00e9bentures de $1,000 chacune de la United Securities Co. Limited, et que Brault a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en possession des trois cents actions communes de Foreign & Power Securities Corporation Ltd. L'appelant pr\u00e9tend cependant que Brault n'avait pas droit de se faire transporter la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Varennes, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit \u00e9tabli que les actions de la Duval Motors Limited n'ont pu \u00eatre r\u00e9alis\u00e9es, ou qu'elles n'ont pas rapport\u00e9 suffisamment pour couvrir la dette de Dion vis-\u00e0-vis de Brault. Il n'y a pas de doute qu'\u00e0 la lecture de l'\u00e9crit du 16 janvier 1931 tel semble \u00eatre le cas. Il est clair que Brault n'aurait pas pu exiger de Dion que l'immeuble lui f\u00fbt transport\u00e9, \u00e0 moins que les conditions mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 l'acte ne soient r\u00e9alis\u00e9es. Mais les parties peuvent consentir, et ont \u00e9videmment consenti, \u00e0 ce qu'il en soit autrement, car effectivement Dion a transport\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps, et les actions de la Duval Motors Limited et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Varennes. Rien ne s'oppose \u00e0 ce que les parties modifient l'entente originaire intervenue entre elles.\nA cette date, o\u00f9 Dion a ainsi transport\u00e9 sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Brault, celui-ci \u00e9tait v\u00e9ritablement cr\u00e9ancier et il ignorait, c'est ce que la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le, que Dion avait d'autres cr\u00e9anciers ou qu'il \u00e9tait insolvable. Comme r\u00e9sultat du transport de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et des actions de la Duval Motors Limited, Brault a \u00e9t\u00e9 totalement pay\u00e9 de sa cr\u00e9ance. Voici ce que nous dit Donat Dion \u00e0 ce sujet:\u2014\nR. Non, je ne devais pas \u00e0 M. Brault, \u00e7a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9 en 1933, quand j'ai vendu la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nQ. Vous ne deviez plus \u00e0 M. Brault?\nR. Je ne devais plus \u00e0 M. Brault, non.\nQ. Vous n'avez rien donn\u00e9 en argent \u00e0 M. Brault depuis 1933?\nR. Absolument pas.\nL'intim\u00e9 Bernard Brault confirme ce t\u00e9moignage de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\u2014\nR. Je vous demande pardon, en 1933, lorsque l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9, la cession de la maison ainsi que la cession des actions de la Duval Motors, M. Dion me devait $7,000, \u00e0 ce moment l\u00e0.\nQ. Quand vous avez transport\u00e9 ou que vous avez fait cette suppos\u00e9e vente de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 mademoiselle C\u00e9cile Dion, M. Dion ne vous devait plus rien?\nR. Il ne me devait plus rien. Je crois donc que lorsque Facte de vente du 13 f\u00e9vrier 1933 a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9, Bernard Brault, comme cons\u00e9quence de l'acte du 16 janvier 1931 modifi\u00e9 par le consentement mutuel des parties, est devenu v\u00e9ritablement le propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble en question. On semble trouver extraordinaire que, malgr\u00e9 que Brault f\u00fbt devenu propri\u00e9taire de cet immeuble, Dion ait continu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'habiter. Ceci s'explique facilement si l'on tient compte que Brault et Dion \u00e9taient des amis de longue date, qu'ant\u00e9rieurement Brault avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00eat\u00e9 des sommes consid\u00e9rables \u00e0 Dion que celui-ci avait rembours\u00e9es, et que de plus, Dion avait \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause que Brault avait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire de tr\u00e8s heureuses sp\u00e9culations. Il est naturel que celui-ci, qui ne tenait pas \u00e0 habiter Varennes, laiss\u00e2t la jouissance de la maison \u00e0 son ami, et en conserv\u00e2t la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nCe transport n'avait donc pas pour but de porter atteinte aux droits des tiers, et il est impossible de dire que cet acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour soustraire l'actif de Dion \u00e0 ses cr\u00e9anciers, ou qu'il est un simulacre de vente pour d\u00e9pouiller en apparence Dion du gage commun de ses cr\u00e9anciers. Je ne vois dans cet acte aucun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9cessaires pour qu'il y ait simulation et pour permettre de dire que Dion n'avait pas l'intention de transporter et que Brault n'avait pas l'intention d'acqu\u00e9rir.\nCette transaction est la cons\u00e9quence d'une entente ant\u00e9rieure entre les parties, et n'est pas \u00e0 mon sens un acte fictif ou simul\u00e9.\nOn pr\u00e9tend qu'il y a une preuve de simulation dans le fait que Dion et Brault ont effectu\u00e9 ce transport sous la forme d'un acte de vente pour la somme de $2,000. Il est clairement prouv\u00e9 que lorsque le contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9, Brault n'a pas re\u00e7u la somme de $2,000 qui y est mentionn\u00e9e. Mais comme Brault avait droit d'obtenir la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, la forme sous laquelle elle lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9e ne peut pas affecter le r\u00e9sultat de cette cause et n'est pas une preuve de simulation. Il existait une cause r\u00e9elle et licite pour le transport de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et le fait d'intercaler dans un acte des choses fausses ne constitue pas n\u00e9cessairement des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de simulation. Fuzier-Herman, R\u00e9pertoire, Vo, Simulation, No. 11, page 235, dit ce qui suit:\u2014\nLa simulation d'un acte n'est pas par elle-m\u00eame une cause de nullit\u00e9 de cet acte, lorsque les parties ont fait sous une forme fictive ce qu'elles pouvaient accomplir sous une autre forme, et lorsque, malgr\u00e9 la cause \u00e9nonc\u00e9e qui est fausse, il en existe une r\u00e9elle et licite.\nAubry & Rau, 5\u00e8me \u00e9dition, T. 1, par. 35, page 175, dit\nque pour toute disposition ou convention dont le but peut \u00eatre \u00e9galement atteint, soit au moyen d'un acte indiquant sa v\u00e9ritable nature, soit \u00e0 l'aide d'un acte la repr\u00e9sentant sous l'apparence d'une disposition ou convention d'une autre esp\u00e8ce, les parties peuvent indiff\u00e9remment avoir recours \u00e0 l'une ou l'autre de ces formes.\nIl faut donc en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que ce que les parties ont fait sous l'apparence d'un acte de vente couvrait un acte r\u00e9el, et que l'intention des parties \u00e9tait bien d'effectuer le transport de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nEtant devenu le propri\u00e9taire d\u00e9finitif de l'immeuble, Brault pouvait en disposer comme il l'entendait. Aussi, pouvait-il en effectuer le transport \u00e0 la fille de Donat Dion, mademoiselle C\u00e9cile Dion, le 15 avril 1935.\nJ'en viens donc \u00e0 la conclusion que cet immeuble est sorti du patrimoine de Dion lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9 \u00e0 Brault le 13 f\u00e9vrier 1933, qu'il n'y a pas eu de simulation pouvant validement affecter le transport de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, que les jugements de la Cour du Banc du Roi sont bien fond\u00e9s et que les pr\u00e9sents appels doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gu\u00e9rin, Cousineau & Godin.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Beaulieu, Gouin & Tellier.\n[1] (1938) Q.R 66 K.B. 110.\n"

In December, 1938, in the course of her employment, she was asked to operate a new hand-embossing machine for making addressograph plates. The first morning she operated it she complained to the office manager that the machine was too heavy for a girl to operate, and that the first night she noticed a sore spot in her back, notwithstanding which she operated the machine again the next day. About two weeks or so later, she was again called upon to operate the machine and did so for two days or so. In the meantime, while employed about other office work, the sore spot continued. In consequence of her condition, she consulted several doctors and eventually had to undergo an operation. Section 7 of the New Brunswick Workmen's Compensation Act, ch. 36 of 1932, reads as follows: \"When personal injury or death is caused to a workman by accident, arising out of and in the course of his employment in any industry within the scope of this part, compensation shall be paid to such workman or his dependents, as the case may be, as hereinafter provided * * *.\" On June 5th, 1939, the respondent applied to the Workmen's Compensation Board for compensation. The Board disallowed the claim on the ground that there was not sufficient evidence that the injury claimed for had been caused by an accident. On the submission of a further statement, the Board held an investigation with the result that the Board, upon a reconsideration of the entire case, made a new ruling and found: \"1. That the personal injury of which the appellant (now respondent) complains arose out of and in the course of her operating their embossing machine in her employment within the scope of Part I of the said Act (The Workmen's Compensation Act, 1933, ch. 36 and amendments); and 2. That the said injury was not caused by accident.\" The respondent having obtained permission to appeal to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, that Court allowed the appeal and held that the injury caused to the respondent was caused by accident within the meaning of the Workmen's Compensation Act.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the appellate court (14 M.P.R. 499), that the personal injury, which the respondent suffered in the course of her operating the machine, was an accidental injury within the meaning of the statute. APPEAL from the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1], by special leave to appeal granted by that Court, reversing the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Board, which had disallowed the respondent's claim for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act of New Brunswick.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nJ.J. F. Winslow K.C. for the appellant.\nD. King Hazen K.C. for the respondent.\nCrocket J.\u2014The respondent was employed as a stenographer in general office work in the credit department of the head office of the Irving Oil Co., Ltd., at Saint John, N.B., from March, 1938, until the end of March, 1939. In December, 1938, in the course of her employment she was asked to operate a new hand-embossing machine for making addressograph plates. The machine, which worked stiffly at first, was operated by means of a lever, which required considerable exertion to make an impression. It was operated by different employees in the office as the occasion for making up new addressograph plates arose, and the credit manager admitted that he had complaints from other lady operators besides Miss Theed that it tired their muscles to operate it, explaining that its operation required the use of muscles not ordinarily used and that it would be liable to cause soreness in those muscles until they became accustomed to it. Miss Theed herself testified that the first morning she operated it she complained to the office manager that the machine was too heavy for a girl to work, and that the first night she noticed a sore spot in her back, notwithstanding which she operated the machine again the next day. It was about two weeks before she was called upon to operate it again and she did so for two days or so. In the meantime while employed about other office work the sore spot kept about the same and she consulted an osteopath, who told her she had twisted a rib and gave her about eleven treatments. Her condition showing no improvement, she obtained leave of absence and went to Montreal where she consulted Dr. Shannon, who told her she had torn some ligaments and would have to have operative treatment. Returning to Saint John, Dr. George F. Skinner operated on her on July 25th, 1939, and, having in the meantime secured a new position as secretary at the Rothesay Collegiate School, she was able to take up her work there on September 1st. Dr. Skinner, when asked to explain the nature of the injury, for which he had operated, described it as one of those soft tissue injuries that is really indefinable, and which, for lack of a better term, would come under the group of sprains and strains. There was, he said, apparently constant tenderness and constant pain over the spine at the eighth thoracic vertebra. Dr. Shannon, Dr. Skinner said, had previously demonstrated this numerous times and found her condition just as Dr. Skinner described it with a tenderness over this point on movement. The operation disclosed nothing more than what one might call thickening of the fibrous tissue of the region; that was again one of the rather indefinite undefinable things that they had to face in sprains and strains. Right over the spinous process the tissues were so thickened that he had a sensation of cutting through a definite bursa. Injury like that he described as tears in the ligaments. Dr. Shannon had instructed him to operate. Dr. McKay, who had been called in consultation and assisted at the operation, agreed that the only way they could define the injury was that the fibrous ligamentous attachments to that particular bone had been strained and in healing they had healed so as to give abnormal tensions. In the operation all the muscles and ligamentous attachments were freed from that part of the bone and the spinous process itself was removed.\nOn June 5th, 1939, the respondent applied to the Workmen's Compensation Board for compensation. The Board disallowed the claim on the ground that there was not sufficient evidence that the injury claimed for had been caused by accident. On the submission of a further statement the Board held an investigation upon which the claimant, Dr. Skinner and other witnesses were examined and cross-examined by counsel with the result that the Board, upon a reconsideration of the entire case, altered its prior ruling and found\n1. That the personal injury of which the appellant complains arose out of and in the course of her operating the embossing machine in her employment within the scope of Part I of the said Act (The Workmen's Compensation Act, 1933, ch. 36 and amendments).\n2. That the said injury was not caused by accident.\nThe respondent having obtained an order from a judge of the Supreme Court permitting her to appeal to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick on the question of law involved, that court unanimously allowed her appeal and on the application of the Board granted special leave to appeal to this court, Baxter C.J. dissenting as to the allowance of special leave.\nSection 7 of the New Brunswick Workmen's Compensation Act reads as follows:\nWhen personal injury or death is caused to a workman by accident, arising out of and in the course of his employment in any industry within the scope of this Part, compensation shall be paid to such workman or his dependents, as the case may be, as hereinafter provided, unless such accident was, in the opinion of the Board, intentionally caused by such workman, or was wholly or principally due to intoxication or serious and wilful misconduct on the part of the workman, or to a fortuitous event unconnected with the industry in which the workman was employed.\nIt will be seen from what I have already said that the only issue upon this appeal is as to whether the personal injury, which the applicant admittedly suffered in the course of her operating the machine, and which the Board expressly found arose out of and in the course of her doing so in her employment within the scope of Part I of that Act, was \"a personal injury caused by accident within the meaning of the above section.\" In my opinion we are bound to hold that it was. That that injury consisted of the straining of the muscles of; her back and the tearing of the ligamentous attachments to the eighth thoracic vertebra, causing pain and a distinct sore spot in that region, admits of no doubt. This was demonstrated beyond cavil by the operation which became necessary for its relief.\nDecisions of the House of Lords in a long line of cases from 1903 to 1935, it seems to me, are conclusive that such an injury as that described is an accident within the meaning of the provisions of the English Workmen's Compensation Act and of the corresponding New Brunswick Act imposing liability for \"personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of\" the employment of the injured person.\nIn Fenton v. Thorley[2], it was held that the word \"accident\" in this enactment is used in the popular and ordinary sense, and means a mishap or untoward event not expected or designed, and that a workman who in the turning of the wheel of a machine during the course of his employment over-exerted himself and thereby sustained an internal rupture, suffered an injury by accident within the meaning of the statute. Lord Macnaghten in delivering the leading judgment in that case referred to a decision of the Scottish Court of Session in Stewart v. Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co. Ltd.[3], in which he said he agreed entirely. That was a case where a miner strained his back in replacing a derailed coal hutch and in which all the learned judges of the Court of Sessions held that it was an accident in the sense of the Act.\nWhat the miner did in replacing the hutch (Lord Macnaghten said) he certainly did deliberately and in the ordinary course of his work. There was nothing haphazard about it.\nLord M'Laren of the Scottish Court said he considered that\nif a workman in the reasonable performance of his duties sustains a physiological injury as the result of the work he is engaged in * * * this is accidental injury in the sense of the statute.\nLord Kinnear observed that the injury was not intentional and that it was unforeseen.\nIt arose (he said) from some causes which are not definitely ascertained except that the applicant was lifting hutches which were too heavy for him. If (he added) such an occurrence as this cannot be described in ordinary language as an accident, I do not know how otherwise to describe it.\nLord Macnaghten observed that Fenton was a man of ordinary health and strength; that there was no evidence of any slip or wrench or sudden jerk; and that it might be taken that the injury occurred while the man was engaged in his ordinary work and in doing or trying to do the very thing which he meant to accomplish. He also said that the Court of Appeal in sustaining the decision of the arbitrator that there was no injury by accident within the meaning of the Act had followed an earlier decision of that court in Hensey v. White[4], (which Lord Macnaghten said was in its circumstances not distinguishable from the case he was then considering) that there was no accident because there was \"an entire lack of the fortuitous element.\" This, he pointed out, was not necessary to constitute an accident, and he added:\nIf a man in lifting a weight or trying to move something not easily moved, were to strain a muscle or rick his back or rupture himself, the mishap in ordinary parlance would be described as an accident.\nLords Shand, Davey, Robertson and Lindley all agreed that the decision of the County Court Judge and of the Court of Appeal refusing compensation for the internal rupture should be reversed, Lords Shand and Davey concurring in the reasons of Lord Macnaghten and Lords Robertson and Lindley delivering judgments of the same purport. The latter, referring to the Scottish decision in Stewart v. Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co.[5], said that the interpretation put upon the Act in Scotland in that case\nis to be preferred to the narrower construction occasionally adopted in this country.\nFenton v. Thorley [6] has ever since been treated as the leading case upon the meaning of the word \"accident,\" as it appears in the Workmen's Compensation Act. The principles there enunciated have ever since been consistently recognized by the Law Lords of the House. They subsequently held that infection developing from the entry of a bacillus into the eye of a workman from wool he was sorting was an injury by accident, as in Brintons Ltd. v. Turvey[7]; and that a strain suffered by a workman through exertion in the course of his employment is itself an accident, as in Clover, Clayton & Co. v. Hughes[8].\nIn Glasgow Coal Co. v. Welsh[9], a miner was bailing out water from the bottom of the pit, which necessitated his standing up to his chest in water for eight hours with the result that thereafter and for two or three days he felt great stiffness and cold and pain in his joints and contracted sub-acute rheumatism. The arbitrator in this case found that the rheumatism was caused by the extreme and exceptional exposure to cold and damp. Viscount Haldane and Lords Kinnear, Shaw of Dunfermlin, Parmoor and Wrenbury all held that it was a case of injury by accident. The first two Law Lords named distinctly held that the judgment in Fenton v. Thorley[10] was conclusive.\nInnes or Grant v. Kynoch[11] was the case of a workman's death from blood-poisoning, caused by his becoming infected through an abrasion on his leg by noxious bacilli contained in bone-dust which the deceased handled in the course of his employment. It did not appear when or how he received the abrasion, and it was impossible to say with certainty when the infection occurred. Lord Birkenhead, L.C., and Lords Buckmaster, Atkinson, Parmoor and Wrenbury all held that the fortuitous alighting of the bacilli upon the abraded spot constituted an accident within the Act; that there was evidence upon which the arbitrator was entitled to find that the injury arose out of and in the course of the deceased's employment; and that the provisions of the Act as to fixing the date of the accident are satisfied, if, having regard to the nature of the particular injury alleged, the date of the occurrence of the accident is reasonably fixed so as to connect the injury with the accident.\nIn Burrell v. Selvage[12], a girl worked for the respondents at a lathe, finishing shell adaptors, and in the course of that work constantly sustained cuts and scratches on her hands. In March, 1918, she showed symptoms of blood-poisoning from the pus formed in gatherings caused by the cuts. She continued to work until April 27th, during which time further cuts and scratches were caused. By that time the poisoning had so got into her system that she had to stop work and became totally incapacitated from arthritis. The arbitrator found that the last cut of April 27th was an accident, and that the incapacity thus resulted from injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment. The Court of Appeal affirmed his decision and the employers appealed to the House of Lords. Lords Buckmaster, Sumner, Parmoor, Wrenbury and Carson all held that, although there was no evidence to support the finding that the incapacity resulted from the wound on April 27th, there was conclusive evidence that it resulted from the accumulative effect of the series of accidents met with at her work, and that it was impossible to hold that because the incapacity was caused, not from a particular accident, but from a series of accidents, that that fact prevented the applicant from recovering compensation. In his reasons Lord Buckmaster said:\nIn the present case there is no dispute that the disease from which the respondent suffered, is a disease which distinctly arose out of the injuries that she received while in the course of her employment, and it cannot be disputed that her cut and abrased fingers were on each occasion what would be called an accident within the meaning of the statute. The only question, therefore, for consideration is whether, when the disease is due, not to one specific and definite accident, but to a series of accidents, though its actual influence on the resulting illness cannot be precisely fixed, the workman is disentitled to the benefit of the statute.\nMy Lords, I cannot find any words in the statute which permit of such a construction. In the present case personal injury was suffered, it was suffered by accident, and the accident is no less accidental because it occurred on a series of occasions instead of on one; it follows that the claim to compensation was properly established.\nI shall mention only one other of the House of Lords decisions, that of Walker v. Bairds[13]. In this case the workman, who was employed as an underground fireman in a colliery, was cleaning out a sump into which water had collected and for which purpose it was usually necessary to stand in cold water about waist-deep. On coming out on one occasion it was noticed that he was shivering; he contracted a chill, which within a short time developed into broncho-pneumonia from which he died. The arbitrator drew the inference that the broncho-pneumonia was caused by a chill, which he contracted through exposure to cold and water but found that in law the death of the workman was not caused by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. On these facts, as set forth in a stated case to the Second Division of the Court of Session, that court held that, since it was established that the chill, which caused the disease, had arisen out of and in the course of his employment, the workman's death from the disease was the result of an injury by accident within the meaning of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1925. On appeal to the House of Lords, Lords Tomlin, Thankerton, Macmillan, Wright and Alness held that the Court of Session in Scotland was right in this conclusion. Lord Tomlin after reviewing the previous decisions from Fenton v. Thorley[14] in 1903 to Partridge Jones and John Paton Ltd. v. James[15], said that these decisions inescapably led to the conclusion that upon the arbitrator's findings of fact the Court of Session was bound to hold that Walker's death was caused by personal injury by accident in the sense of the Workmen's Compensation Act.\nThe Compensation Board in the present case gave no reasons for its decision that the applicant's injury was not caused by accident, though it did specifically find that the injury \"arose out of and in the course of\" her operating the machine within the scope of Part I of the New Brunswick Workmen's Compensation Act. The learned counsel for the Board in his argument before us suggested that the decision proceeded on the ground that the injury was one which gradually developed during the period in which she was required to operate the machine, and was for that reason not the result of any one particular strain or any strain which it was possible to identify as having occurred on any particular day. If this were the basis of the Board's decision that the injury was not caused by accident, then I think with all respect for the reasons I have already indicated the Board misdirected itself as to the law.\nIt is true that there had been some decisions in the Court of Appeal since Fenton v. Thorley[16] to the effect that unless the injury be one of such a nature that its occurrence can be proved to have occurred at some definite time, it cannot properly be held to be an accident within the meaning of the statute in question. The learned counsel for the Board relied especially upon the decisions of the Appeal Court in Steel v. Camell, Laird & Co.[17] and Walker v. Hockney Bros.[18], but an examination of these cases shows that neither of them bears any analogy to the case now before us.\nThe Steel case (3) was the case of a caulker, who in the course of his employment had to use white and red lead which were smeared by him upon rope-yarn and worked in with the hands. He gradually accumulated lead in his system, with the result that he suffered from lead-poisoning, which produced partial paralysis and incapacity for work. Although the arbitrator found that personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment had been caused to the workman, Collins, M.R., in his reasons said he found that the injury to the applicant was lead-poisoning, which was brought about through the applicant being saturated with lead in consequence of his being in continuous contact with it and that in any case the result must have come about through long exposure to contact with the lead and gradually, not suddenly. He also said that it was not possible to indicate any precise time at which the mischief arose; and Cozens-Hardy, L.J., said the statute negatives the idea that it applied to a case like the one then under consideration, where the only suggestion was that the injury was due to some or all of a succession of accidents, and that injury by disease alone, not accompanied by an accident was expressly excluded, as pointed out by Lord Macnaghten in Fenton v. Thorley[19]. In so far as the possibility of indicating the precise time, at which the mischief arose, is concerned, the dicta relied upon, I think, must now be taken as subject to the qualification indicated in the decision of the House of Lords in Burrell v. Selvage19.\nIn Walker v. Hockney[20] the workman gradually acquired paralysis of his right leg through the strain of riding a heavy carrier tricycle for his employers during a period of about six years.\nAs to the dictum of Lord Birkenhead, L.C., in his speech in the House of Lords in Innes v. Kynoch[21], upon which the Board's counsel also relied, regarding the necessity of the accident taking place \"at some one particular time,\" if the whole context, in which this statement occurs, is read, it will be found that His Lordship's view was that, although in order to constitute an injury by accident there must be some particular occurrence happening at some particular time, what that particular time was was \"immaterial so long as it reasonably appeared that it was in the course of the employment,\" which is precisely the view adopted by the House of Lords in the Burrell case (1) of 1921.\nWhatever may be said of the judgment of the Appeal Court in Ormond v. Holmes[22], no support whatever can be found either in the reasons of Slesser, L.J. or Romer, L.J. or in those of Luxmore, J., for the proposition that a straining of any muscle or other organ of the human body cannot properly be held to constitute an accident within the meaning of the statute in any case where it appears that the incapacity for which compensation is claimed may have developed therefrom gradually, and not suddenly. Indeed as I read the several judgments their purport is quite to the contrary. The learned justices founded themselves entirely upon the specific findings of the arbitrator and in order that these may be clearly understood it should be explained that Ormond had been employed by the Holmes Company for a number of years as a blacksmith striker and had for a long time prior to 1935 been suffering from arterio sclerosis and very high blood pressure. While rising from his bed at home on the morning of September 27th, 1935, he had an attack of hemiplegia, commonly called a stroke, and was compelled to rest until October 9th, 1935, when he returned to his usual work against the advice of his doctor. On December 20th he started work at 7 o'clock, his usual time, but at 7.30 was observed to be looking ill, he was dragging his right foot and his mouth was drawn up on the right side. He also felt his right arm gradually losing power during the morning. Between 10 and 10.30 a.m., he collapsed from a second and severer stroke. Both attacks were due to thrombosis or clotting. In claiming compensation he alleged that his incapacity was caused by an accident which happened on December 20th, arising out of and in the course of his employment. The arbitrator found that the work upon which Ormond was actually engaged on December 20th neither caused nor contributed to nor accelerated the second stroke and that the thrombosis was coming on that morning and would have inevitably resulted in hemiplegia even if he had not done any work that day, but that all the work he had been doing since October 9th up to the time he began to work on December 20th, and indeed all muscular effort or exertion up to that time accelerated the second attack. Having stated that he could not associate the second attack with any particular work either on December 20th or on any particular day before then, and that in the circumstances he regarded the stroke as the final stage of a long standing disease accelerated by the general wear and tear of previous work and all other strenuous exercises up to but not including any work done on that morning, he held that the workman had failed to prove an injury from any accident within the meaning of the Act.\nThe decision of the Appeal Court proceeded entirely on the ground that the second stroke on December 20th, which was the alleged injury and accident, was solely induced by the disease (arterio-sclerosis and high blood pressure) and was not caused or contributed to by anything Ormond did on that morning, and that, although the wear and tear of his usual work and all other strenuous exertions between October 9th and that morning may have accelerated this stroke, it was not possible to point to any particular strain or occurrence in the performance of his work during this period of more than two months, to which the change in his condition could be attributed. The case was therefore held not to fall under the House of Lords decisions in Fenton v. Thorley[23], Brintons Ltd. v. Turvey[24], Clover, Clayton v. Hughes[25], Innes v. Kynoch[26], or any of the other House of Lords decisions I have mentioned, the principle recognized and applied in all of which, as Romer, L.J., pointed out, was precisely the same. In the view of all three of the Appeal Justices, the case was rather one of an injury resulting from gradual wear and tear as in Walker v. Hockney Bros.[27] and Steel v. Cammel, Laird & Co.[28] and other similar cases. Both Slesser, L.J. and Luxmoore, J. particularly referred to the judgment of the Lord Justice-Clerk (Aitchison) in Miller v. Carntyne Steel Castings Co. Ltd.[29] in the Scottish Court of Session as illustrating the distinction between a particular cause limited in point of time and a general cause extending throughout a period. \"When a workman,\" said the Lord Justice-Clerk,\ncollapses under a particular strain it may be and in many cases probably is the climax of a general strain to which he has been subjected throughout many years of employment and without which no collapse would have occurred. Again, when a workman becomes incapacitated without any definite physiological injury or alteration of phase in the disease from which he suffers * * * it may, none the less, be a physiological injury, although it may not be medically possible to isolate and define it. There is one other passage which I think applies particularly to the present case I would like to quote from the reasons of Romer, L.J. It is as follows:\nBut in the case of infectious diseases it is impossible as a rule to assert that there was any particular occasion on which the bacillus got introduced into the system. If it can be proved that an infectious disease was contracted at a particular time during the employment, even though the exact date cannot be specified, then on the principle of Brintons, Ltd. v. Turvey[30], the contracting of the disease may be an accident within the meaning of the Workmen's Compensation Act (see Grant or Innes v. Kynoch[31]).\nPerhaps I should have mentioned the decision of the Court of Appeal in McFarlane v. Hutton in 1926[32], where it was held that\nIf it appears that the work being done has probably caused an internal strain on the heart or the system generally, resulting in a physiological injury, such an injury is one resulting from an accident within the meaning of the Workmen's Compensation Act.\nI can find nothing in any of the judgments in the very recent case of Fife Coal Co. Ltd. v. Young[33], in the House of Lords, regarding which the respondent's counsel filed a special memorandum, that in any way detracts from the authority of its previous decisions in Brintons Ltd. v. Turvey30, Innes or Grant v. Kynoch31, Burrell v. Selvage[34] or Walker v. Bairds[35], or lends any support to the contention that compensation must be refused unless it is proved that the incapacity resulted, either from a particular strain, or the strain the applicant sustained on a particular day. The doctrine as to the necessity of dating the accident as having occurred on a particular day seems to have been founded on the provisions of the British Act regarding notice of the accident. No question as to the sufficiency of the notice arises in this case, as the findings of the Board on its original consideration and reconsideration of the respondent's application plainly show.\nWhere it is found that such an injury as Miss Theed sustained arose out of and in the course of her employment, as the Compensation Board has itself specifically found, and that injury is a physiological injury, as was incontrovertibly demonstrated by the operation which it necessitated, the injury itself constitutes an accident in the sense of a mishap or untoward event not expected or designed, s. 7 of the New Brunswick Act makes the payment of compensation compulsory, unless the Board is of the opinion that such accident was wholly or principally due to intoxication or serious and wilful misconduct on the part of the applicant or to a fortuitous event unconnected with the industry in which he or she was employed, of which there is of course no suggestion in the present case. Whether such an injury or mishap results from a particular strain, as of a single muscle or group of muscles, or from the culmination of a general straining of the muscular and ligamentous attachments of the particular joint affected, makes no difference, when the injury is identified, as it has been in this case, as a definite physiological one arising out of and in the course of the applicant's employment. The mishap of course necessarily implies a particular occurrence at some particular time, but, as Lord Birkenhead put it in the Kynoch case[36], what that particular time was is immaterial so long as it reasonably appears that it was in the course of employment.\nThe evidence in the case before us clearly proves that Miss Theed operated the addressograph machine only on two occasions, first, for a period of two or three days about the middle of December, and again, two or three weeks later, for a second period of two or three days, and that she felt the symptoms of her injury the night after she first operated the machine.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs, against which costs the appellant shall be entitled on taxation to credit for any moneys which it may have paid to the respondent under the terms of the order granting special leave to appeal.\nDavis J.\u2014The point in this case is, that the young woman sustained a definite physiological injury as the direct result of the work in which she was engaged; that is an accidental injury in the sense of the statute. The case comes clearly within the governing principle in the recent judgment of the House of Lords in Fife Coal Co. Ltd. v. Young36. We are not concerned in this appeal with the difficult questions which arise where there is a progressive disease which has not been expressly made, by statute or regulation, an industrial disease. In the numerous authorities under the English Workmen's Compensation Act the judges have always been careful to abstain from lending colour to the suggestion (except in the case of certain industrial diseases which have been expressly provided for) that a mere disease which one cannot say with any precision was contracted at any particular time or at any particular place, was an accident which entitled a workman to compensation. Lord Atkin said in the Fife Coal case[37] at p. 489:\nWhether to constitute an accident each employment bacillus or flight of bacilli must have its own day, or whether the gradual effect of a succession of them in poisoning the system can. be said to be injury by accident is the question reserved in this decision.\nOn the established facts in the case before us there was a definite physiological injury that can be traced without any doubt to the young woman operating by hand, in the ordinary performance of her work, a machine that was too hard for her to work. The particular days on which she worked the machine were very few and were proved with precision and the physical injuries suffered are clearly established to be the direct result of her working the machine. I can see no difficulty on the authorities in regarding this as an accidental injury within the meaning of the statute.\nI agree that the appeal must be dismissed.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014The respondent, Helen Elizabeth Theed, was a stenographer employed in general office work at Saint John, New Brunswick. While operating an addresso-graph or embossing machine in the course of her employment she tore certain ligaments in her back. A claim for compensation under The Workmen's Compensation Act of New Brunswick (chapter 26 of the Statutes of 1932 and amendments), made to the Workmen's Compensation Board, was disallowed, the Board's certificate stating that there was not sufficient evidence of injury by accident. Upon the respondent's application and in pursuance of certain provisions of the Act, the Board reconsidered its ruling and after the taking of oral evidence issued the following amended ruling:\u2014\n1. That the personal injury of which the applicant complains arose out of and in the course of her operating an embossing machine in an employment within the scope of Part 1 of the said Act.\n2. That the said injury was not caused fey accident.\nThe respondent obtained leave to appeal on a question of law, from the ruling, to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and the appeal was allowed. By special leave of that Court, the Board now appeals.\nThe question of law to be determined is whether the injury caused to the respondent was caused by accident within the meaning of the Act, and the determination of that question depends upon the proper construction of section 7, the relevant part of which is as follows:\u2014\n7. When personal injury or death is caused to a workman by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment in any industry within the scope of this Part, compensation shall be paid to such workman or his dependents, as the case may be, as hereinafter provided, unless such accident was, in the opinion of the Board, intentionally caused by such workman, or was wholly or principally due to intoxication of serious and wilful misconduct on the part of the workman, or to a fortuitous event unconnected with the industry in which the workman was employed.\nIn view of the reliance placed by the appellant upon certain decisions in England, there should also be noted the provisions of section 81. By virtue of the first subsection, presuming the necessary conditions were fulfilled, if the respondent's disability were a disease which had been declared by regulation of the Board to be an industrial disease, she would be entitled to compensation \"as if the disease was a personal injury by accident and the disablement were the happening of the accident.\" Her disability has not been included in the list of industrial diseases, but by subsection 2:\u2014\n2. Nothing in this section shall affect the right of a workman to compensation in respect of a disease to which this section does not apply, if the disease is the result of an injury in respect of which he is entitled to compensation under this Fart. In the present ease the respondent's disability is not a disease. Before the Board, Dr. Skinner testified as follows:\u2014\nQ. Would you explain to us just what the nature of the injury or trouble was?\nA. Miss Theed had one of those soft tissue injuries that is really undefinable. For a lack of a better term, she would come under the group of sprains and strains. There was apparently constant tenderness and constant pain over the spine at the eighth thoracic vertebra. Dr. Shannon had previously demonstrated this numerous times and I found her condition just as he described it with the tenderness over this point on movement.\nQ. Which side of the spine was this on?\nA. Over the tip of the transverse process: both sides of the spine: ligaments and muscles. The maximum pain was right in the middle line. On operation there was nothing more than what one might call thickening of the fibrous tissue of the region: that is again one of the rather indefinite, undefinable things that we have to face in sprains and strains. Right over the spinous process the tissues were so thickened that one had a sensation of cutting through a definite bursa. Injury like this is described as tears in the ligaments. Dr. Shannon really instructed me to operate. Dr. McKay was in consultation and it was the sort of thing that one hesitates to plunge in on until everything has been done. The only way we could define it to ourselves before that was that the fibrous ligamentous attachments to that particular bone had been strained and in healing they had healed so as to give abnormal tensions, so with the idea of releasing those tensions we went in. We freed all the muscle and ligamentous attachments from that part of the bone and removed the spinous process itself. I am more than surprised at the agreeable result we got.\nQ. Would you say the condition you found there, by your diagnosis and operation, could only result from injury?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Would you say that constant heavy work would cause it?\nA. I do not think constant smooth work would cause that condition. I think there has got to be a stimulus to muscle spasm and I think it is a question of constant jolts, constant irritation of that nature, to keep the muscle in spasm so that one muscle is pulling on another.\n* * *\nQ. In your opinion, would you say that any one jolt would be the one that would cause it or the continuous jolting?\nA. I cannot answer that question.\nQ. What would be your opinion?\nA. In operating a machine like that to the casual observer every operation is the same as every other operation and yet there are muscle actions in those operations that we cannot define and if she has thrown herself into a peculiarly tense position by the previous operation, she has made her muscles susceptible to injury.\nQ. Would you say, from Miss Theed's evidence, that this happened at any one strike of that lever or continuous operation of the lever?\nA. I think it is the continuous operation.\nThe respondent's disability being an injury, section 81 of the Act is really not relevant except to be borne in mind in considering the argument of the appellant. The determination of the Board of questions of fact is, of course, final and reading its certificate in the light of all the evidence, I agree that it must be taken that the Board has found that the injury was not caused on any particular occasion on which the respondent used the machine. This being so, counsel for the Board argued that respondent's disability having gradually developed over a period of time, there was no injury caused by accident. Numerous cases decided in England under the various Workmen's Compensation Acts there in force from time to time were cited. I do not propose to mention all of these because it must be borne in mind that the English Act of 1897 did not mention diseases and that the judgments in many cases decided under that Act would have to be carefuly considered. It was not until the Act of 1906 that provisions similar to section 81 of the New Brunswick Act were enacted.\nThe outstanding pronouncement as to the meaning of the word \"accident\" in the English Act of 1897 is the speech of Lord Macnaghten in Fenton v. Thorley & Co.[38], where he states that it is \"an unlooked for mishap or untoward event which is not expected or designed.\" That decision was subsequent to the decision in the Scotch case of Stewart v. Wilson & Clyde Coal Co.[39], where Lord M'Laren stated:\u2014\nIt seems to me that the question is, whether the word \"accident\" presupposes some external and visible or palpable cause (e.g., the breakdown of machinery) from which injury results to a workman, or whether there may be an accident when there is no derangement of the machinery or plant, or of the organization of labour, and when the injury is entirely personal to the sufferer. To limit the application of the statute to the first class of cases would be to exclude a very large number of occurrences which are usually known as accidents ...\n* * *\nI think it is impossible so to limit the scope of the statute, and if a workman in the reasonable performance of his duties sustains a physiological injury as the result of the work he is engaged in, I consider that this is accidental injury in the sense of the statute.\nLord Kinnear put the matter thus:\u2014\nIt (the injury) was not part of the design or scheme of operation in which the man was engaged; it was not intentional; and it was unforeseen. It arose from some causes which are not definitely ascertained, except that the appellant was lifting hutches which were too heavy for him. If such an occurrence as this cannot be described in ordinary language as an accident, I do not know how otherwise to describe it.\nBoth judges were quoted with approval by Lord Macnaghten in Fentoris case[40].\nNow in neither of these cases was there any question of disease but Clover, Clayton & Co. Ltd. v. Hughes[41], decided under the Act of 1906, was a disease case. Lord Loreburn there refers to the fact that all the Lords who took part in the decision in Fenton v. Thorley (1) agreed in substance with Lord Macnaghten's definition of \"accident\" and Lord Macnaghten himself points out (at p. 248):\u2014\nThere (in Fentoris case) (1) the Court of Appeal had held that if a man meets with a mishap in doing the very thing he means to do, the occurrence cannot be called an accident. There must be, it was said, an accident and an injury: You are not to confuse the injury with the accident. Your Lordships' judgment, however, swept away these niceties of subtle disquisition and the endless perplexities of causation. It was held that \"injury by accident\" meant nothing more than \"accidental injury\" or \"accident\" as the word is popularly used.\nThere are subsequent decisions in the Court of Appeal, in cases where disease was involved, holding that injury by accident cannot be established unless the applicant can indicate the time, date, circumstances and place in which the accident occurred which occasioned the disease (other than an industrial disease) but the House of Lords states the rule to be that even in disease cases the injury by accident will be established if having regard to the particular injury alleged, the date and circumstances of the accident are reasonably fixed so as to connect the injury with the accident.\nThis appears from their Lordships' decisions in Innis or Grant v. Kynoch [42] and Burrell v. Selvage[43]. During the course of his speech in the first case, Lord Birkenhead states at page 772:\u2014\nIt is no doubt the fact that in Brinton's case[44] a particular time was found as being that at which the contact had occurred. But all that is material is that the infection should have been the result of contact at some one particular time and that this one particular time should have been during the course of the employment. Some expressions, such as those referred to in the judgment of the Second Division, have been from time to time used, but none of them are binding upon this House; and indeed when these various expressions are examined in connection with one another they appear to me to come to no more than this, that it must be established that the disease is due to some particular occurrence, otherwise it cannot be the result of accident. That it should be some particular occurrence happening at some particular time is essential, otherwise it is not in the nature of an accident. What that particular time was is immaterial so long as it reasonably appears that it was in the course of the employment.\nIn the second case, the circumstances were that a girl in the course of her work continually sustained cuts and scratches on her hands. In March, 1918, she showed symptoms of blood poisoning from the pus formed in gatherings caused by the cuts. She continued to work until April 27th, during which time further cuts and scratches were caused. By that time the poisoning had so got into her system that she had to stop work and became totally incapacitated from arthritis. Lord Buck-master, speaking for the majority, if not all, of the peers, determined that whether the injury\narose by reason of definite cuts suffered by her towards the end of April or whether it arose by reason of a series of cuts extending over a longer period of time, in my opinion she is equally entitled to recover for the injury that she sustained.\nAt page 161 he continues:\u2014\nIt has been decided by your Lordships' house in the case of Grant v. Kynoch[45], and also in Brintons, Ltd. v. Turvey[46], that disease arising out of and in the course of an employment may in certain circumstances be regarded as an accident within the meaning of the statute, and be made the proper subject-matter of a claim for compensation. In the present case there is no dispute that the disease from which the respondent suffered is a disease which distinctly arose out of the injuries that she received while in the course of her employment, and it cannot be disputed that her cut and abrased fingers were on each occasion what would be called an accident within the meaning of the statute. The only question, therefore, for consideration is whether, when the disease is due not to one specific and definite accident but to a series of accidents, each one of which is specific and ascertainable though its actual influence on the resulting illness cannot be precisely fixed the workman is disentitled to the benefit of the statute.\nMy Lords, I cannot find any words in the statute which permit of such a construction. In the present case personal injury was suffered, it was suffered by accident, and the accident is no less accidental because it occurred on a series of occasions instead of on one; it follows that the claim to compensation was properly established.\nCounsel for the appellant referred to Fife Coal Co. Ltd. v. Young[47], the actual decision in which was that the workman was entitled to compensation for dropped foot. Stress was laid, however, upon the following passage in the speech of Viscount Caldecote (with whom Lord Thankerton and Lord Russell of Killowen agreed) where, after referring to three cases decided by the Court of Appeal after the decision in the House of Lords in Brintons Ltd. v. Turvey[48], the Lord Chancellor states at page 88:\u2014\nThere is no reason to doubt the correctness of the decisions in the three cases I have last mentioned. In all of them the facts were such as to make it impossible to identify any event which could, however loosely, be called an accident. In these cases, the workmen failed, not because a disease is outside the purview of the Workmen's Compensation Act altogether, but because the burden of proof that there had been an accident was not discharged.\nWhen the workman's claim is in respect of a progressive disease, the difficulty of pointing to a definite physiological change which took place on a particular day is, in general, likely to be almost insuperable, and in 1906 Parliament, in the case of certain diseases, and later, by an enlargements of the schedule of industrial diseases, relieved the workman in the specified cases of this obligation. However, if the circumstances of any claim in respect of incapacity due to disease are such as to make it possible to discharge this burden, I see no reason for thinking that what is called a disease is different in principle from a ruptured aneurism, as in Clover, Clayton & Co. Ltd. v. Hughes[49], or heart failure, as in Falmouth Docks & Engineering Co. Lid. v. Treloar[50].\nOur attention was also called to Lord Atkin's quotation, at page 90, of the following words of Lord Fleming:\u2014\nWhat happened to him on April 27th transformed him from a man who was not suffering from dropped foot into a man who was.\nAs to the extracts from the speech of Viscount Caldecote, it is to be noted that the first part of the quotation follows a statement in the same paragraph that each of the two cases in the Court of Appeal, referred to as subsequent to the decision in Brintons case (1), was decided in favour of the employer\non the grounds that the injury was the inevitable result of work long continued and was not anything which could be described as having happened on a particular duty;\nnot, it will be noticed, as having happened on a particular day. And later the Lord Chancellor remarks:\u2014\nThe claimant sustained a definite physiological injury in the reasonable performance of his duties, and as the result of the work he was engaged in at the time of the injury. The fact that, in the course of his work for a month before the day when he first suffered from dropped foot, he had felt some loss of the power of dorsiflexion of the right foot seems to me in no way to affect his right to compensation. As to the extract from the speech of Lord Atkin, it should be observed that he is careful to point out that while the distinction between accident and injury must be observed, it is hardly possible to distinguish in time between the two where a man suffered from rupture, an aneumism bursts, the muscular action of the heart fails, while the man is doing his ordinary work turning a wheel or a screw, or lifting his hand. In fact, as Lord Justice Atkin in Williams v. Guest[51], he had already said:\u2014\nIt also has to be remembered that the cumulative effect of a series of accidents may still entitle the workman to compensation, as in Selvage v. Charles Burrell & Sons Ld.[52], in which case the girl in the course of her employment contracted in the course of four months a series of small cuts or abrasions the effect of which was to cause an incapacity, and it was held that it was not necessary to be able to name and give evidence of the precise time at which the accident happened which had caused the incapacity.\nThe distinction referred to by Lord Atkin between accident and injury is emphasized in the New Brunswick Act and nowhere more particularly than in section 7. Until the amendment made in 1938 to the New Brunswick Act, the phrase \"unless such accident was in the opinion of the Board intentionally caused by such workman, etc.\" used the word \"injury\" instead of \"accident\" but it is now an accident wholly or principally due, in the opinion of the Board, to a fortuitous event unconnected with the industry in which the workman was employed that may prevent the workman seeking compensation. It seems advisable to point out that the case of an aggravation of a disease existing prior to an injury is dealt with specifically in the New Brunswick Act by paragraph (d) of section 7.\nThese matters are referred to to indicate the necessity of taking into consideration the whole of the Act in coming to a conclusion as to whether; in the circumstances of the present case, the injury to the respondent was caused by accident. The history of the Act shows that the statute should be construed liberally in favour of all workmen within its purview. In the instant case the respondent, in operating the machine in the course of her employment, sustained a definite physiological injury and as the result of the work she was engaged in at the time of the injury. In operating the machine she did the very thing she meant to do but that she should tear the ligaments in her back was an entirely unpredictable result. It is not possible to distinguish in time between the respondent's actions of pulling the lever and the injury she sustained, and that injury, even though arising by reason of a series of operations of the machine, should be held to have been caused by accident.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nHudson J.\u2014The respondent, Miss Theed, made a claim for compensation for injuries caused by accident, under the Workmen's Compensation Act of New Brunswick. The Board, after hearing evidence, held (1) that the personal injury of which the applicant complains arose out of and in the course of her operating an embossing machine in an employment within the scope of Part I of the said Act; (2) that the said injury was not caused by accident.\nFrom this decision of the Board an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court, Appeal Division, and her appeal was allowed. In concluding the judgment it was stated:\nThe appellant undoubtedly sustained physical injury by accident and there seems no lack of definiteness about the time at which it occurred.\nThe facts are fully set out in the judgment of the court below. Briefly stated, Miss Theed, who was employed originally as a stenographer, was put to work on an addressograph machine. On the first night after she had operated this machine, she felt a sore spot in the middle of her back and complained about this to the manager. However, she continued to operate it for two days and then did not do it for two weeks and did it again for a couple of days. On the second period of operation, she says that she still felt the sore spot. She did not feel any snap or anything like that and the sore spot did not seem to get worse. After it got to a certain point it kept about the same. Eventually she was operated on by a Doctor Skinner. In giving his evidence he said:\nInjury like this is described as tears in the ligaments. The only way we could define it to ourselves was that the fibrous ligamentous attachments to that particular bone had been strained and in healing they had healed so as to give abnormal tensions, so with the idea of releasing those tensions we went in. We freed all the muscles and ligamentous attachments from that part of the bone and removed the spinous process itself.\nDr. Skinner says that the condition could only result from injury. On the appeal coming before this Court, it was urged on behalf of the appellant that the injury sustained by Miss Theed was the result of continuous operations in the work on which she was employed and that it was impossible to point to any particular occurrence in point of time which gave rise to such injury. The case of Innes or Grant v. G. & G. Kynoch[53] was cited, and in particular the words of Lord Birkenhead at page 772:\nBut all that is material is that the infection should have been the result of contact at some particular time and that this particular time should have been during the course of the employment\u2014That it should have been some particular occurrence happening at some particular time is essential, otherwise it is not in the nature of an accident. What that particular time was is immaterial so long as it was in the course of the employment.\nMany other authorities were cited, but most of these are referred to in the judgment of the court below and I do not think it is necessary to further discuss them.\nI think it is clear from the evidence that the injury suffered by Miss Theed was initiated by her work on the first day that she started, and that on each succeeding day that she worked at the machine the amount of the injury was increased.\nThere is one case which I think is very closely in point, that is, Burrell v. Selvage[54]. In this case a workgirl had received a series of scratches and cuts on her hands during her work, extending over a period of some months, the combined effect of which produced a septic condition incapacitating her from work. It was held by the House of Lords that this was an injury by accident for which she was entitled to compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1906, although the times and places of the several scratches and cuts could not be fixed and her condition could not be attributed to any one particular injury. Lord Buckmaster, in giving the judgment, said at pages 1341 and 1342:\u2014\nThe statute provides that, if in any employment personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment is caused to a workman, his employer shall, in certain circumstances, be liable to pay compensation. The employer is bound to pay compensation. The employer is bound to pay compensation for the personal injury, the personal injury must be due to an accident, and the accident must arise out of and in the course of the employment. It has been decided by your Lordships' House in the cases of Innes (or Grant) v. Kynoch[55], and Brintons Ltd. v. Turvey[56], that disease arising out of and in the course of the employment may in certain circumstances be regarded as an accident within the meaning of the statute, and be made the proper subject-matter of a claim for compensation. In the present case, there is no dispute that the disease from which the respondent suffered was a disease which distinctly arose out of the injuries which she had received in the course of her employment, and it cannot be disputed that the cuts and abrasions on her fingers were on each occasion what would be called an \"accident\" within the meaning of the statute. Therefore, the only question for consideration is whether, when the disease is due not to one specific and definite accident, but to a series of accidents, each one of which is specific and ascertainable, although its actual influence on the resulting illness cannot be precisely fixed, the workman is not entitled to the benefit of the statute. I cannot find any words in the statute which permit of such a construction. In the present case personal injury was suffered, it was suffered by accident, the accident is no less accidental because it occurred on a series of occasions instead of on one. It follows that the claim to compensation was properly established.\nI think that the concluding words of Lord Buckmaster are directly applicable to the present case. Miss Theed suffered personal injury by accident and the accident was no less accidental because it occurred on a series of occasions instead of on one. I agree with the court below and would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J. J. F. Winslow.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.

The owner of respondent yacht refused an offer made by the master of the appellant vessel to haul the yacht off the shore on the next tide for $1,000. Later on the same day, the managing owner of the appellant vessel went in to the respondent yacht to negotiate with the yacht's master, knowing that the owner was staying at a hotel in Yarmouth, and offered to tow the yacht off and look to the insurance underwriters for his compensation, with the understanding that he would not hold the owner or the master of the yacht responsible for any charge. The master of the yacht accepted this offer. Unknown to either the owner or the master of the yacht, the policy of insurance did not cover her while in Canadian Atlantic waters. The yacht was floated easily at high tide, was towed to Yarmouth and, some days later, proceeded under her own power to Halifax where it was found she had sustained practically no damage. The trial judge found that the respondent yacht was in distress and danger, that the services rendered by the appellant vessel were voluntary and in the nature of salvage and he awarded compensation to appellant. On appeal, the Exchequer Court of Canada held that the respondent yacht was not, at the time the services were rendered, in any imminent danger or distress, and dismissed the appellant's action.\nHeld that the dismissal of the appellant's action by the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1935] Ex. C.R. 181) should be affirmed. According to the facts and circumstances of the case as found by the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, it has not been established that the respondent yacht was at the time the salvage services claimed by the appellants were rendered, in any imminent danger or distress within the meaning of the Admiralty rule; and, therefore, the appellants rendered no services which can properly be regarded as salvage services in the sense of that rule.\nThe Pretoria (5 Lloyd L.R. 112) disc. APPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Maclean J. President1, reversing the judgment of Carroll J., District Judge in Admiralty for the Nova Scotia Admiralty District, and dismissing the appellants' action for compensation for salvage services.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported,\nV. J. Pottier K.C. and D. J. Fraser for the appellants.\nF. D. Smith K.C. and W. H. Jost for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Crocket, Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nCrocket J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an action against the pleasure motor yacht Dr. Brinkley II for salvage services alleged to have been rendered to it by the plaintiffs appellants on Sunday, June 30th, 1935, at or near Chebogue Point on the southwest coast of Nova Scotia 4 or 5 miles northeast of Yarmouth.\nThe yacht having proceeded to Halifax from Yarmouth on the second day after the alleged salvage services had been rendered and there arrested and released on bail, the trial of the action was commenced on July 6th, 1935, before the late Mr. Justice Mellish, Local Judge in Admiralty for the Nova Scotia Admiralty District, when its owner, master, wireless operator and three other witnesess first gave their testimony. This comprised the whole of the defendant's case. The hearing was then stood over, no doubt on account of Mr. Justice Mellish's illness, and the action was retried before Mr. Justice Carroll as his successor in November, 1937, nearly two and one-half years later, when the managing owner and master of the Shanalian and one other witness were heard, and the evidence taken before the late Mr. Justice Mellish tendered and received with the consent of counsel.\nThe trial judgment was delivered on February 19th, 1938, and the formal entry thereof made on March 22nd. His Lordship held that salvage services had been rendered and made an award of $600 against the defendant yacht and its bail. The defendant appealed to the Exchequer Court of Canada, which set aside the trial judgment and dismissed the action with costs, the learned President having concluded upon his review of the evidence that the services claimed for were not in the nature of a salvage operation for the reason that at the time they were rendered the yacht was not in any imminent danger or distress within the meaning of the Admiralty rule. I am of the same opinion.\nThe yacht was a vessel of 211 tons with an overall length of 130 feet, equipped with two Diesel engines of 50\u00d2 horse power each. While proceeding at slow speed in a dense fog and calm sea she ran ashore on a smooth ledge shortly after 9 a.m. at approximately high tide. Her engines were immediately reversed and worked full speed astern in an effort to free her, but without effect, and as the tide receded she gradually settled on the rock with a starboard list, so that two or three hours later she was lying practically high and dry with but a foot or two of water under her stern. Everything possible was done by her own master and crew to prevent any further listing or the yacht's being carried farther forward on the next incoming tide. To this end both bow anchors were put out, carried to within 30 or 40 feet of the stern and made fast to the largest available boulders on either side by the use of an electric windlass.\nThis was the situation when the master of the Shanalian, who had immediately motored to the scene from Yarmouth on learning of the stranding from the latter's managing owner, made his first offer during the forenoon to pull the yacht off on the next tide for $1,000\u2014an offer which the owner of the yacht, who was himself present, as well as the yacht's master plainly gave him to understand they would not consider. They had already been informed by friendly neighbours, who had come to the shore, that they would have from one to three feet higher water on the night high tide, due around 10 p.m., and felt they would then require no assistance to get her out to sea again. Certainly everybody recognized, when the Shanalian's services were thus tendered during the forenoon, that it would be sheer folly for any tug boat to attempt to pull the yacht off the ledge before the night tide approached its highest level. That both the master and the managing owner of the Shanalian were fully aware of the intention of the owner and master of the yacht to await the higher night tide and see if the yacht could not come away under her own power before arranging for the assistance of any tug boat can scarcely be doubted. At all events it is clear when they went aboard the Shanalian in the late afternoon and proceeded to Chebogue Point they did so entirely on their own initiative and in the hope of prevailing on the master of the yacht to accept the service of their motor tug. When they went in to the yacht in the motor launch to negotiate with the yacht's master, knowing that the owner was staying at the Grand Hotel in Yarmouth 4 or 5 miles away, and obtained the master's permission to bring a tow rope from their motor tug and fix it around the stern of the yacht upon the understanding that they would not hold the owner or the master of the yacht responsible for any charge, and look to the insurance underwriters for their compensation for any assistance the Shanalian might render in towing the yacht off the ledge, the yacht had righted herself on the rising night tide, and there is not a particle of evidence to show that she was in any such imminent danger or distress as to require the proffered assistance. The fog was still thick. The sea was admittedly still calm with nothing but the usual ground swell, which could not possibly cause any damage in view of the yacht's crew itself having taken the precautions already indicated to hold her fast against any further forward movement. There was no wind and no indication of any approaching storm.\nIt is the yacht's situation at the time the assistance is tendered, with reference to which the question of imminent peril or distress, I think, must be decided. The mere fact that the yacht was stranded does not place her in imminent danger or distress. As Mr. Justice Hellish suggested in his question to Captain McKinnon, a well known pilot of wide experience, during his examination before him, stranding is not an unusual thing at all. Captain McKinnon replied: \"No, vessels very frequently strand all along the coast.\" The test, as I understand the cases, as to whether a ship is in such danger as to oblige the master to accept the service of another for its relief and safety is whether a prudent owner or master would have accepted the services of the other when proffered in the situation in which his ship is found at that time. Upon my examination of all the testimony bearing upon this point, I entirely agree with the view of the learned President that it was quite within the right of the owner at the time in question here to prefer his own means of releasing the Brinkley and reject the services of the Shanalian, if her aid in his judgment was not urgent and if the yacht was not then in fact in any real or sensible danger. The proffered service of the Shanalian was admittedly accepted upon the distinct understanding I have already mentioned, viz.: that the owner and master of the yacht would not be held responsible. While it is true, as Dr. Lushington put it in the case of The Charlotte2, that it is not necessary, in order to create a liability for salvage, that the distress should be actual or immediate, or that the danger should be imminent and absolute\u2014a dictum, which was approved by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in The Strathnaver3, and upon which Carroll, L.J.A., based himself in the case now before us, there must at least be some danger, which was apparent or probable at the time the services were rendered. Sir Robert Phillimore, who delivered the judgment in the case of The Strathnaver3, immediately after quoting and approving Dr. Lushington's dictum, proceeded to say:\nTheir Lordships are of opinion that there was neither actual nor imminent probable danger at the time these services were rendered.\nThe Pretoria4 affords I think a striking illustration of the application of the governing principle in a case of this kind. That ship was caught in the Thames Estuary by a sudden squall on the morning of April 15th and was laid on her beam ends. She shot her deck cargo. Her hatch covers were carried away and she shipped much water. Her anchor with 15 fathoms of cable was laid out. She settled down on the bottom of sand and mud, and her hull became wholly submerged, as the tide made. Her crew took to the boat and on arrival ashore telegraphed to Faversham, where the Pretoria was owned, that the barge had sunk off Warden Point. On the ebb-tide her crew returned and worked at the pumps but could not free her sufficiently to get her afloat, and when water flowed over her again on the evening tide they went ashore. On the morning of April 16th they went to Faversham and reported the position to C, a director of the owning company, who at once gave orders for the manning and fitting out of another barge (the Bertie) with pumps and sufficient men to pump out the disabled Pretoria. The Bertie was ready to go out that evening but did not do so, the wind being unfavourable. In the meantime the plaintiffs had seen the mast and top of the mizzen of the Pretoria while she was submerged and went out in a motor trawler, and tested the pumps, which they found in working order but nothing further could be done at that state of the tide. They telephoned C, reporting what they had done, and were informed that C. was sending another barge down and would lighten the Pretoria in the morning and that the plaintiffs' offer of assistance was therefore declined. Notwithstanding this, the plaintiffs returned to the Pretoria late in the evening, and in the early morning of April 17th when the tide was ebb, they pumped her out and towed her ashore. Hill, J., who tried the case, sitting with two of the Elder Brethren of Trinity House, found that the plaintiffs got the Pretoria off on the morning of April 17th, whereas the defendants would not have got her off until the evening of that day. He asked the Elder Brethren whether there was anything in the weather of April 17th, which made it important that she should be got off early on that day and they both said \"No.\" He also asked the Elder Brethren whether, having regard to the circumstances of the case and what might be anticipated at the time of year and in the locality an owner of reasonable prudence would have refused the assistance of the plaintiffs. Both answered \" Yes \" and gave it as their opinion that C. was acting with prudence in preferring his own means of recovering the Pretoria and in rejecting the offer of the plaintiffs. His Lordship entirely agreed and therefore dismissed the plaintiffs' claim with costs.\nI may add that, following the conversation between the owner and master of the Shanalian and the master of the Brinkley Sunday night, a tow-rope was in fact brought over from the Shanalian to the yacht, fastened around her stern, and carried to the tug boat. All hands then waited on the rising tide and at about 9.45 p.m.\u2014about half an hour before full high tide\u2014the yacht came off the ledge with the port engine of the yacht running full speed astern and both engines of the Shanalian running full speed ahead and was towed to a dock at Yarmouth.\nWhether the yacht came off under its own power, or whether the Shanalian rendered any real service in bringing her off\u2014a question regarding which there was some conflict of evidence\u2014is, in my view of the case, quite immaterial. The operation in bringing her off seems in any event to have occupied but a few minutes at most. When she backed out the tow-line was shifted from the stern of the yacht to the bow and she proceeded with the Shanalian ahead to Yarmouth and there docked. She remained in Yarmouth on Monday, where the crew that day tried her out with the owner aboard, and, having been found perfectly seaworthy, left Yarmouth about noon Tuesday under her own power and proceeded to Liverpool and Halifax. On being dry-docked at Halifax a few days later it was found she had sustained no damage beyond a slight bending of one of the blades of her propeller shaft, which had caused some vibration on the operation of her port engine.\nHaving regard to the admitted and undisputed facts above referred to, I have concluded with all respect that the plaintiffs rendered no services which can properly be regarded as salvage services in the sense of the Admiralty rule, and that the learned President of the Exchequer Court of Canada upon that ground alone had no other recourse under the authorities than to order the dismissal of the action as he did.\nWith regard to the contention that the appeal to the Exchequer Court of Canada was barred by the limitation prescribed by Admiralty Rule 172, not having been brought within 30 days from the day when the judgment was pronounced, I think the learned President has correctly interpreted the rule as providing a limit of 30 days in the case of a judgment or order in any matter which is not \"an action,\" and a limit of 60 days in the case of any judgment or order in a proceeding which is an action, and that the 30 days limitation runs from the date when the judgment or order is pronounced and the 60 days period from the date when the judgment is formally perfected. The appeal, though brought after the expiration of 30 days from the delivery of the trial judgment, was brought before the expiration of 60 days from its formal entry on March 22nd, and was therefore in time.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nDavis J.\u2014The appellants' case was mainly rested before us on the contention that the right to salvage is in no way dependent on contract and that a salvage contract only goes to amount. That may be so and no doubt is under certain circumstances but here the owner of the private yacht in question was on board himself at the time she got into difficulties. He did not consider the position of the yacht as one of any real danger and he definitely declined the assistance that the appellants offered him on certain monetary terms. In any event I agree with the conclusion of the learned President of the Exchequer Court, whose judgment is in appeal before us, that the evidence does not establish that the yacht was, in the practical sense, in any imminent danger or distress or that her position was so critical as to make it unreasonable for her owner to decide upon an attempt to float the ship by her own means at high tide, before seeking or accepting the assistance of a tug.\nThe services rendered by the appellants were not only declined by the owner of the yacht but were not rendered in such circumstances that they ought to have been accepted. See The Pretoria5, The Flora6.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nHudson J.\u2014This action was brought for salvage and, in order to succeed, it was necessary for the plaintiff to prove that the ship to which services were rendered was in imminent danger or distress. Mr. Justice Carroll at the trial held that it was, but he was not assisted by a nautical assessor, nor did he himself hear the evidence given on behalf of the defendant. A court of appeal is, therefore, more free to review his finding of fact than would otherwise be the case. Mr. Justice Maclean in the Exchequer Court of Canada has done so and come to the conclusion that the ship was not, at the time the services were rendered, in danger or distress. After careful review of the evidence, I am satisfied that Mr. Justice Maclean has come to the correct conclusion and I am also satisfied that the assistance given to the ship was given without the authority of Doctor Brinkley, the owner, and contrary to his specific instructions, to the knowledge of the plaintiff.\nUnder these circumstances, I do not think that the plaintiff is entitled to succeed. The discussion between the two captains as to insurance does not, even accepting the plaintiff's version, assist him, if the ship was not in danger. The relevant authorities have already been adequately discussed by my brother Crocket.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: V. J.

He was tried in 1937 by a church court on charges of broadcasting services in defiance of the consistory's ruling and of acts of disloyalty and disobedience to the archbishop. The court sustained the charges, whereupon the archbishop as bishop of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada excluded the respondent priest from the priesthood, of and membership in, the said church. The Congregation ignored the sentence and the respondent priest continued to act as such. An action was then brought in the name of the appellant, the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada and of two individual, co-appellants before this Court, who claim to be members of the respondent Congregation and to sue on behalf of a minority of these members who are opposed to the continuance of the ministry of the respondent priest. The appellant corporation was incorporated by a special Act of the Parliament of Canada in 1929 (19-20 Geo. V, c. 98) for the purposes \"of administering the property and other temporal affairs connected with the spiritual jurisdiction of the said Corporation.\" All the congregations, parishes, missions of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada \" which are now included and are a part thereof, and which may at any time in the future become a part thereof\" were by the Act constituted the Corporation. The respondent trustees are a body corporate registered under the Manitoba Church Lands Act (R.S.M., 1913, c. 31); they hold title to the church lands for the Congregation, by whom they are appointed for that purpose; but they have nothing to do with the appointment or maintenance of the clergy, nor do they exercise any spiritual jurisdiction or have any corporate concern with the. ecclesiastical functions of the bishop or the church court. The appellants' claim in the action was for an injunction restraining the respondent Mayewsky from officiating any longer or conducting, any further services as a priest of the appellant corporation or as a priest of the respondent congregation or parish or otherwise in the Cathedral; an injunction restraining the respondent trustees from procuring or permitting such officiating or conducting by the respondent Mayewsky; the return and delivery to the appellant corporation of what is called the antimins and an injunction restraining the respondent Mayewsky from wearing and using the said antimins. The antimins (a singular word) is a piece of linen about the size of a handkerchief which was given into the possession of the respondent Mayewsky at the time of his ordination as a priest of the appellant corporation for use in the ministration of the sacraments of the church. A counter-claim was brought by the respondent Mayewsky asking a declaration that he was a priest in good standing and that the purported disposition or expulsion of him as a priest was illegal, null and void, and for damages and other relief. The trial judge granted the injunction prayed for by the appellants and ordered the delivery of the antimins to the corporate appellant or to its Board of Consistory; and he also dismissed the counter-claim. The Court of Appeal, reversing that judgment in part, dismissed the appellants' action, but maintained the dismissal of the counter-claim. Both parties appealed to this Court by way of appeal and cross-appeal.\nHeld that the appeal should be dismissed with costs; and that the cross-appeal should also be dismissed, but without costs, subject to the terms of an agreement between counsel as to variation of the order of the Court of Appeal, so as to provide that the dismissal of the counter-claim shall not be deemed an adjudication on any of the issues raised thereby other than those adjudicated upon in the main action. Davis and Hudson JJ. dissenting in part and holding that the respondent Mayewsky should be ordered to deliver up the antimins to the appellant corporation.\nPer Crocket J.\u2014It was not intended by the federal statute of 1929 (by which the appellant corporation has been constituted) that the unincorporated church organization with all its congregations, priests and missions, together with their trustees as incorporated under provincial laws, should be merged in or absorbed by the corporate appellant, and the latter's so-called statutory charter has not deprived the trustees of the Cathedral of St. Mary the Protectress of its rights to hold the Cathedral property as trustees for the congregation, or the congregation of its right to manage its own temporal affairs. The antimins, having no substantial monetary value, the mere demand for their delivery to the Board of Consistory as the property of the corporate plaintiff would not, apart from all other considerations, be sufficient to justify the Manitoba Court in taking action by way of injunction. The manifest and sole purpose of this claim, as that of the whole action, was to enforce obedience to a purely ecclesiastical sentence or decree.\nPer Davis J.\u2014Under all the circumstances of this case, this Court should not interfere with the expulsion order of the Church Court by enquiring into the proceedings against the respondent priest, examining the nature of the charges and the character of the evidence and then setting aside such order. But it has not been proved that the Cathedral congregation at Winnipeg ever signified its intention to become a part of the appellant corporation as stipulated in the statute, or that the Consistory ever issued a certificate admitting such congregation to the corporation. That being so, the congregation never became a part of the corporation, and the corporation therefore has no legal right to interfere with the congregation in continuing the services of its present pastor. Nor has the appellant corporation the right to restrain the respondent Mayewsky from officiating in the charge of that congregation or from officiating elsewhere, so long as he does not officiate \"as a priest of the appellant corporation.\"\u2014As to appellant corporation's claim to the antimins: the property in it has at all times been in the appellant corporation, and the latter is entitled to the return forthwith of the same. Therefore, this Court should issue an order directing the respondent Mayewsky to deliver up forthwith the antimins to the appellant corporation and granting injunction against the respondent Mayewsky restraining him from officiating or conducting any services in Canada \"as a priest of the appellant corporation\" unless and until he may become reinstated in good standing as a priest of the said corporation, and, otherwise, the appellants' action should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin J.\u2014The minutes of the meetings of the several councils of the unincorporated Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada, held from 1918 to 1929 established that that Church never had any jurisdiction over the lands owned by the several congregations, the title to which, so far as concerns the Cathedral congregation, is vested by virtue of the provincial enactment in trustees; and, moreover, the terms of several sections of the Act of incorporation of 1920 indicate that the Federal Parliament did not ever purport to vest these lands in the Corporation; nowhere in the Act is there any grant of spiritual jurisdiction to the Corporation over the several congregations; the statute limits the power of the Corporation to temporal affairs over which alone it has any jurisdiction. Furthermore, while the respondent Mayewsky is a priest of the unincorporated Church, he never was a priest of the appellant Corporation as he never became a \"part\" of it or a \"member\" as defined in section 5 of the Act of 1929; and neither a declaration made to the Consistory of the Church by the respondent priest on September 17th, 1931, on his arrival in Canada nor the certificate issued to the priest the same day under the seal of the appellant corporation can confer upon the Corporation a power or jurisdiction that, according to the Special Act, it did not possess and was incapable of assuming; it was not legally competent to the respondent Mayewsky to give, or to the appellant corporation to accept or exercise, the jurisdiction claimed by the appellant corporation. Therefore, the appellants' action must fail. As to the question of the return and the delivery to the Corporation appellant of the antimins, the obligation of the priest in the undertaking was to return it to the Consistory of the unincorporated church in case he ceased to be a priest of that church; and that event not having occurred, the claim must also fail.\nPer Hudson J.\u2014The Cathedral congregation, respondent, never became a part of the corporate body, appellant, or subject to its control, either temporal or spiritual. As to the appellants' claim to prohibit the respondent Mayewsky from continuing to act as a priest of the congregation, it amounts to no more than a claim to have the Court enforce what is a purely ecclesiastical decree; no property right is involved so far as the appellants are concerned and the corporation makes no contribution to the salary of the priest, nor to the maintenance of the Cathedral Church. Moreover, this action is solely based on the powers of the appellant corporation, which is not shown to be vested with any authority to enforce spiritual discipline over priests or to disqualify them or to restrain any particular priest from officiating or any congregation from accepting his ministrations.\u2014The appellant Corporation is entitled to the return to it of the antimins, irrespective of the validity or invalidity of the decree of excommunication.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba (1)1 reversing in part the judgment of the trial judge, Donovan J., dismissing the appellants' action and maintaining the dismissal of a counter-claim.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nFred. Heap K.C. for the appellants.\nJ. S. Lamont K.C. and Wasyl Swystun for the respondents. Rinfret J.\u2014The appeal should be dismissed with costs and the order of the Court of Appeal should be confirmed, except that the counter-claim should be disposed of in accordance with the agreement arrived at between the parties.\nCrocket J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an action, which the plaintiffs brought in the month of May, 1937, in the Court of King's Bench of the Province of Manitoba, praying for an injunction against the defendant Mayewsky, restraining him from officiating any longer or conducting any further services as a priest of the plaintiff corporation or as a priest of the congregation or parish of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Cathedral of St. Mary the Protectress in the City of Winnipeg, and also an injunction restraining the trustees of the said Cathedral from permitting the said priest to so officiate as well as for the return and delivery to the corporation plaintiff's Board of Consistory of antimins worn or used by him as such priest.\nThe learned trial judge, Donovan J., granted the injunction prayed for and also ordered the delivery of the antimins to the corporate plaintiff or to its Board of Consistory. The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal, which dismissed the plaintiffs' action as well as a counter-claim of the individual defendant, which he had entered for damages against the corporate plaintiff and nine individuals, including the bishop, his administrator and other members of the corporate plaintiff's Board of Consistory.\nSo far as the plaintiffs' action is concerned, a perusal of the statement of claim shows that it is entirely founded upon two main pretensions: first, that the defendant corporation acquired the Cathedral in the year 1925 in trust for a congregation or parish of the unincorporated body known as \" The Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada \" and was made a component part of the plaintiff corporation by the latter's Act of Incorporation, ch. 98 of the Statutes of Canada, 1929, and subject to the lawful jurisdiction of the latter, and that the defendant Mayewsky thus became a priest of the latter corporation; and, second, that the corporate plaintiff, acting by and through its Board of Consistory, Archbishop, General Council and Church Court and having power and authority in that behalf from and under its charter and certain by-laws, decisions, canons and resolutions duly passed thereunder, duly expelled the said individual defendant from its priesthood. If the first of these pretensions is not made good the action cannot properly be maintained, for it is well settled that, unless some property or civil right is affected thereby, the civil courts of this country will not allow their process to be used for the enforcement of a purely ecclesiastical decree or order.\nIf there is any legal basis for the corporate plaintiff's assertion of civil or temporal jurisdiction over the Cathedral Church, there is no other source in which it can be found than the federal statute of 1929, by which it was constituted. The plaintiffs in this regard rely mainly on s. 2 of that statute. This section reads as follows:\nAll the congregations, parishes, missions, of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada, which are now included and are a part thereof, and which may at any time in the future become a part thereof, are hereby constituted a corporation, public and politic under the name of \"The Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada,\" hereinafter called \"the Corporation\" for the purposes of administering the property, and other temporal affairs connected with the spiritual jurisdiction of the said Corporation.\nIt will be observed that while this section purports to embrace all congregations, parishes and missions, which were included in the unincorporated body of the church at the time of the enactment of the federal statute, as well as those which might at any time in the future become a part thereof, in the new corporation as a body \"public and politic,\" the functions of that body are expressly limited to \"the purposes of administering the property and other temporal affairs connected with the spiritual jurisdiction of the said corporation.\" The section does not of course purport to confer spiritual jurisdiction upon the new corporation, nor does it purport to vest in it any property whatsoever.\nHaving regard to its constitutional limitation in relation to property and civil rights in the Provinces, it is scarcely conceivable that Parliament could have intended to legislate into the corporation thus constituted the whole membership of all the individual autonomous congregations and missions of an unincorporated body of Christians without their consent, together with all the property held in trust for them under provincial laws. That there was no such intention appears conclusively to my mind from sections 4 and 6 (1) of the Act. Section 4 provides that the objects of the corporation shall be * * * to administer in Canada\nsuch of the property, business and other temporal affairs of the said Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada as may be entrusted by the said Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada to the corporation.\nSec. 6(1) enacts that\nAny congregation or mission of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada, whether now in existence or which may be formed at any time in the future, shall signify its intention to become a part of the Corporation by a resolution passed at a duly called meeting thereof according to the constitution thereof.\nThe record discloses that no such resolution was ever passed by the congregation of the Cathedral Church. Each of these sections plainly visualizes the existence and continuation of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada as an unincorporated body or denomination of Christian people professing and adhering to its own recognized creed, polity, forms of worship, etc., and both seem to me unmistakeably to negative the proposition that the statute itself merges that church organization and all its congregations, missions and trust properties in the new corporation, whether the latter be regarded as a purely religious or a combined religio-civil corporation. The apparently studied obscurity and ambiguity of the language of par. 4 of the statement of claim would seem to indicate the hesitancy and doubt with which the corporate plaintiff itself puts forward the claim that the suggested merger or absorption of the unincorporated church with all its congregations and trust property was effected by the federal statute. It alleges that\nupon (or shortly after) the incorporation of the corporate plaintiff the unincorporated body of the same name * * * became (and it has ever since been) absorbed in and by the former (treating itself as so absorbed and being treated by the plaintiff as so absorbed).\nOne can only conjecture as to the purpose of the brackets, whether they are intended to indicate that the words contained within them may be eliminated at one's option. If one chooses to pass them over, it is perhaps possible to spell out of the truncated paragraph an allegation that the unincorporated church organization became incorporated in the corporate plaintiff in virtue of the enactment of chapter 98. If, however, one is disposed not to do this but to read the whole paragraph precisely as it is set out, it would seem to me to be reasonably capable of no other meaning than that the pretended merger or absorption of the unincorporated church in and by the corporate plaintiff was achieved, not by the latter's statutory incorporation, but by the very dubious and seemingly incomprehensible fact of the whole unincorporated denominational body comprising all its varied member congregations, and the corporate plaintiff itself having mutually assumed that it had been so absorbed irrespective of the provisions of the federal Act. It is therefore not surprising that the plaintiff corporation in bringing its action thus shrank from definitely relying upon the suggested statutory merger, inasmuch as the obvious result of the acceptance of such a proposition would be to place itself in the anomalous and impossible position of bringing an action against a corporation, which it was claiming was merged in itself and therefore non-existent, viz.: the trustees of the Cathedral Church.\nFor my part I have no hesitation in holding that it was never intended by the federal statute that the unincorporated church organization with all its congregations, priests and missions, together with their trustees as incorporated under provincial laws, should be merged in or absorbed by the corporate plaintiff, and that the latter's so-called statutory charter has not deprived the Trustees of the Cathedral of St. Mary the Protectress of its right to hold the Cathedral property as trustees for the congregation, or the congregation of its right to manage its own temporal affairs.\nAs to the antimins, which it is explained are consecrated linen or lace napkins used by a priest in the celebration of masses, and are alleged to belong to the corporate plaintiff, the claim against the defendant Mayewsky for the return and delivery of these to the plaintiff corporation's Board of Consistory depends entirely upon the allegation that he received them as a priest of the plaintiff corporation and his alleged expulsion as a priest thereof. This is clearly shown, I think, by par. 14 of the statement of claim. It rests, therefore, on precisely the same foundation as the claim for an injunction against the Trustees of the Cathedral and Mayewsky, viz.: that both the defendant corporation and its officiating priest had become absorbed in and by the corporate plaintiff in virtue of its incorporating Act of 1929, and must necessarily in my opinion stand or fall with it.\nIn any event the antimins, although of the highest importance as a badge and symbol of priesthood, have no substantial monetary value, as pointed out by Dennistoun, J.A., and I agree with him that the mere demand for their delivery to its Board of Consistory as the property of the corporate plaintiff, would not, apart from all other considerations, be sufficient to justify the Court in taking action by way of injunction. The manifest and sole purpose of this claim, as that of the whole action, is to enforce obedience to a purely ecclesiastical sentence or decree. For that reason I am of opinion that the Court of Appeal was fully justified in dismissing the plaintiffs' action.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAs to the cross-appeal from the dismissal of the counterclaim, counsel consented that this should be limited to such issues as are finally adjudicated upon in the main action and that its dismissal should be taken to be without prejudice to any action that might hereafter be brought in respect of any of the issues not so determined. Subject to the terms of this agreement, the order of the Court of Appeal, in so far as it concerns the counter-claim, should also be confirmed. There should be no costs on the cross-appeal.\nDavis J.\u2014The appellant corporation was incorporated by a special Act of the Parliament of Canada in 1929 (19-20 Geo. V, ch. 98) under the name of \"The Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada\" for the purposes \"of administering the property and other temporal affairs connected with the spiritual jurisdiction of the said Corporation.\" All the congregations, parishes, missions of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada, \" which are now included and are a part thereof, and which may at any time in the future become a part thereof\" were by the Act constituted the corporation.\nThe trustees of the Cathedral church in Winnipeg (who were registered under the Manitoba Church Lands Act) together with the parish priest Peter Mayewsky, are the respondents (defendants). Two individuals joined with the corporation as plaintiffs (and are co-appellants); they claim to be members of the Cathedral congregation and, while admitting they are in a minority in their opposition to the continuance of the ministry of the present priest, they assume to sue on behalf of the other members of the Cathedral congregation \"excepting such majority.\" The appellants' claim in the action was for an injunction restraining Mayewsky from officiating any longer or conducting any further services as a priest of the appellant corporation or as a priest of the congregation or parish or otherwise in the said Cathedral; an injunction restraining the respondent trustees, or officers, servants or agents, from procuring or permitting such officiating or conducting by the respondent Mayewsky; the return and delivery to the appellant corporation of what is called the antimins, and an injunction restraining the respondent Mayewsky from wearing and using the said antimins.\nThe basis of the appellants' action was that the respondent priest Mayewsky had become a priest of the appellant corporation in 1931 but that in 1937 he had been duly expelled from its priesthood and forbidden any longer to officiate as a priest of the appellant corporation or in the Winnipeg Cathedral; the appellant corporation claiming to have acted by and through its Board of Consistory, Archbishop, General Council and Church-court, having power and authority, it was alleged, in that behalf under the statute and certain by-laws, decisions, canons and resolutions. The antimins (said to be a singular word) was described to us as a piece of linen about the size of a handkerchief which was given into the possession of the respondent priest at the time of his ordination as a priest of the appellant congregation for use in the ministration of the sacraments of the Church.\nThere was a counter-claim by the respondents (?) asking a declaration that the respondent Mayewsky is a priest in good standing of The Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada and that the purported deposition or expulsion of him as a priest of the said Church and as a member thereof was and is illegal and null and void; and other relief. Both the action and the counter-claim stand dismissed by the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba and both parties appealed to this Court by way of appeal and cross-appeal.\nTwo issues may be disposed of at once. The cross-appeal from the dismissal of the counter-claim merely asked that its dismissal\nshall not be deemed to be an adjudication upon any of the issues raised in the said counter-claim, except to the extent that any of the said issues are finally adjudicated upon in the main action, and that the dismissal of the respondent's counter-claim is to be without prejudice to any action that may hereafter be brought in respect of any of the issues not so finally adjudicated upon.\nCounsel for the appellant consented to this variation and the cross-appeal should therefore be allowed.\nThe other item is the antimins. Like most church quarrels, there is obviously much bitterness on both sides and the parish priest has gone so far by his counsel as to refuse on somewhat technical grounds to return to the appellant corporation the antimins, although at the time he sought and obtained ordination from the appellant corporation he acknowledged in writing to that corporation the receipt of the antimins as having been received from the Archbishop through the Consistory of the appellant corporation and he declared that the said antimins \"is and shall remain to be the property of\" the appellant corporation,\nand as such shall be returned by me to the Consistory of the said Church in case I cease to be a priest of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada.\nIt is argued that the respondent Mayewsky has never ceased to be a priest of the Church at large as distinguished from the church corporation; that in any event he was never properly expelled from the appellant corporation; and, thirdly, that the intervention of the Court cannot be sought for the return of the article because it has little or no money value. The property in the antimins clearly has at all times been in the appellant corporation, and it is entitled to the return forthwith of the same, and to this extent at least the appellant corporation should succeed against the respondent Mayewsky.\nWe may now consider the claim of the appellant corporation to restrain the respondent priest from officiating as a priest of the appellant' corporation. It is perfectly plain on the evidence that he took ordination and accepted a certificate of good standing from the appellant corporation. He has been expelled after charges have been heard by the Church Court of the appellant corporation and unless the expulsion order can be set aside as asked, the appellant corporation is entitled to the injunction sought in so far as acting as a priest of its corporation is concerned.\nWe are invited to enquire into the proceedings against the priest and to examine the nature of the charges and the character of the evidence and to set aside the order of the Church Court. It is contended that the charges were frivolous and that the expulsion should not be recognized by the civil courts. But the charges in substance were insubordination in an effort to undermine the authority and position of the Archbishop; it is not suggested that there was any dishonesty or lack of good faith on the part of the Church Court. The priest was duly notified of the charges and of the hearing by the Church Court but failed to appear. He had under the church law a right to appeal but he did not take advantage of it. Under these circumstances the Court cannot go behind the expulsion order of the domestic tribunal.\nThere then remains the larger question. The congregation of the Cathedral, obviously by a large majority, stand by their pastor and resist the effort of the appellant corporation to expel him from the charge. One difficulty is that the congregation as such is not before the Court. The respondent trustees are merely those individuals in whose names as trustees the title of the property stands by registration under the local provincial law, the Manitoba Church Lands Act. If, however, the congregation as such was a component part of the Church as incorporated, it might well be unnecessary that the congregation as such should be made a party. The evidence, I think, makes it abundantly plain that the congregation acted in many respects as if it were a part of the incorporated Church; but the evidence is quite insufficient to establish the proposition upon which the main claim in the action rests, that is, that the Cathedral congregation was strictly a part of the incorporated Church body. It is not shown that the congregation or parish joined in the petition for incorporation. The statute itself provides that all the congregations, parishes and missions \" which are now included and are a part * * * and which may at any time in the future become a part\" of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada, constitute the incorporated body. (Sec. 2.) Any congregation or mission \"whether now in existence or which may be formed at any time in the future \" may signify its intention to become a part of the Corporation by a resolution passed at a duly called meeting thereof, according to the constitution thereof. (Sec. 6(1).) The copy of such resolution shall be certified by the chairman and the secretary of the said meeting, and shall be sent to the Consistory of the Corporation, and the Consistory may then issue a certificate admitting such congregation or mission to the Corporation. (Sec. 6 (2).)\nThat there is a difference between the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada and the corporation is shown by sec. 4 of the statute, which defines the objects of the corporation:\n* * * and to administer in Canada such of the property, business and other temporal affairs of the said Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada as may be entrusted by the said Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada to the Corporation.\nIt is not proved that the Cathedral congregation at Winnipeg ever signified its intention to become a part of the corporation as stipulated in the statute, or that the Consistory ever issued a certificate admitting such congregation to the corporation. That being so, the congregation never became a part of the corporation, and the corporation therefore has no legal right to interfere with the congregation in continuing the services of its present pastor. Nor has the appellant corporation the right to restrain the respondent Mayewsky from officiating in the charge of that congregation or from officiating elsewhere, so long as he does not officiate \"as a priest of the appellant corporation.\"\nThe appellants fail on their main ground of appeal but should succeed in part. The judgment of the Court should in my opinion be\n(1) An order directing the respondent Mayewsky to deliver up forthwith the antimins to the appellant corporation. (2) An injunction against the respondent Mayewsky restraining him from officiating or conducting any services in Canada \"as a priest of the appellant corporation\" unless and until he may become reinstated in good standing as a priest of the said corporation.\n(3) Subject to aforesaid, the action is dismissed.\n(4) On the cross-appeal in the counter-claim, the order as asked goes by consent.\nThe question of costs presents some difficulty. Upon the whole, I think the appellants should have one-third of their costs of the action and of the appeals in the action but there should be no costs to either party of the counterclaim or of the appeals in the counter-claim.\nKerwin J.\u2014The appellants, The Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada, Joseph Bohonos and George Bugera, were the plaintiffs in an action instituted in the Court of King's Bench in Manitoba against the respondents, The Trustees of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Cathedral of St. Mary the Protectress, in the city of Winnipeg, in the province of M'anitoba, and Reverend Peter Mayewsky. The Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada, one of the appellants, is a corporation incorporated by a Special Act of the Dominion Parliament, 19-20 George V, chapter 98, assented to May 1st, 1929. The two individual appellants are members in good standing of the congregation of The Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Cathedral of St. Mary the Protectress. The respondents, the trustees, are a body politic and corporate by virtue of a resolution of the congregation of the Cathedral and of the provisions of The Church Lands Act, being chapter 31 of the Revised Statutes of Manitoba, 1913. The exact status of the other respondent, Reverend Peter Mayewsky, is one of the main issues in the appeal, the appellants claiming that he had been a priest of the appellant corporation but that he had been removed as such by proper proceedings; the respondents, on the other hand, contending that while he was and is a priest of the unincorporated spiritual body known as The Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada, he never was a priest of the appellant corporation.\nBy the trial judgment, Reverend Mayewsky was restricted from officiating any longer or conducting any further services in the cathedral or otherwise; he was further restrained from wearing or using the antimins used by him in officiating in the cathedral, and he was ordered to forthwith deliver the antimins to the appellant corporation or its Board of Consistory; and the respondents the trustees, their officers, servants and agents were restrained from procuring or permitting such officiating or conducting by Reverend Mayewsky. A counter-claim by the present respondents was dismissed. On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba both the action and the counterclaim were dismissed. The plaintiffs now appeal by leave of the Court of Appeal. A notice of cross-appeal from that part of the order which dismissed the counter-claim was given but, on the argument, it was agreed between counsel that, whatever disposition might be made of the appeal, the counter-claim should stand dismissed without costs but such dismissal should not be deemed an adjudication upon any of the issues raised in the counter-claim except to the extent that any of those issues are finally adjudicated upon in the appeal, and that the dismissal of the counter-claim should be without prejudice to any action that may hereafter be brought in respect of any of the issues not so finally adjudicated upon.\nIn order to understand the respective contentions of the parties, it is necessary to commence with a meeting at Saskatoon on July 18th and 19th, 1918, of one hundred and fifty representatives of what are termed \"the Ukrainian Settlers in Canada.\" The minutes of that meeting and most of the documents appearing in evidence are in a foreign language but translations into English have been agreed upon between the parties, and it is to such translations that reference will be made. According to the minutes just mentioned, it is recited in a resolution passed at the meeting:\u2014\nWhereas the head of Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church of Canada demands complete transfer of property of church congregations, without reservation, to the corporation of Ruthenian Greek Catholic bishop, in which according to the Act of Incorporation the bishop is the sole corporation and all Ruthenian Greek Catholic parishes, missions, are under sole management and are solely represented by the bishop himself.\nWhereas in accordance with this Act of Incorporation the Ruthenian Greek Catholic parishes are deprived of all right to manage the properties of congregations; And whereas the said bishop denies spiritual jurisdiction to the Ukrainian married priests in Canada (which denials is contrary to the rights and privileges of our church rite), and in substitution establish a celibacy, that is to say, unmarried priests.\nThe resolution concludes:\u2014\nTherefore we the representatives of various Ukrainian settlements and communities in Western Canada resolve as follows:\u2014\nTo establish Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada upon the following principles:\n(a) This church shall be in communion with other Eastern Orthodox Churches and shall adhere to the same dogmas and to the same church rites.\n(b) The priests shall be married.\n(c) The church property shall belong to the congregations and such congregations shall manage it.\n(d) All bishops shall be elected by general church council, composed of priests and delegates representing church congregations and brotherhoods.\n(e) The congregations shall have right to engage and discharge priests.\nThe 1918 meeting was apparently considered the first meeting or convention of The Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada as the minutes of the next meeting referred to are headed \"Minutes of the Second Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church Convention at Saskatoon, December 11, 1919.\" In these minutes appears the statement:\u2014\nOur intention was and is to unite our regenerated \"Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church with the Kiev Metropolia. The Holy War, however, which our people is waging in Europe, does not allow as yet wider relations between us and Kiev, which are demanded by the union of our church with the Mother Church. As our church is unthinkable and impossible to exist with a bishop's supervision because we, once we came back to the Orthodox Church, have to adhere to her principles\u2014we thought that before the time of the union of our Church with the Kiev Metropolia, we shall keep our own bishop for a short time and go under a temporary protectorate of the Syrian metropolitan Germanos. We could go under the protectorate of the Greek bishop Alexander in the United States, Metropolitan Germanos, however, is adherent of democratic principles to such an extent that he left the Church administration in the hands of parishes, the brotherhood, our consistory and our Council so that we could not find a better protector for a short while.\nThe references to Kiev are, of course, to the city of that name in Ukraine.\nPresumably the second convention was adjourned to Winnipeg as in the minutes of what is called the second annual council held in that city on December 27th, 1919, appear the following resolutions, numbers 3 and 8:\u2014\n3.\u2014that all Ukrainian Greek Orthodox parishes and priests submit themselves from this date under temporary spiritual jurisdiction of Metropolitan Germanos, who undertakes to fulfill all the duties and requirements of the bishop of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church and supervise the spiritual side of the church life until the election and ordination of Ukrainian Orthodox bishop, with this reservation that the administrative right of the church remains with the church council, the brotherhood, consistory and the parishes.\n* * *\n8.\u2014Be it resolved by this council that from now on the Consistory of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada and the United States be formed with its temporary headquarters at Saskatoon and that such Consistory be composed of three priests and four lay members, president of the Brotherhood and of Church Council.\nFor reasons that will appear later, attention is here called to the \"Brotherhood\" mentioned in these minutes and in the minutes of later meetings.\nAt the third council, held in Winnipeg, Saskatoon and Edmonton on November 11th, 18th and 25th, 1920, it was decided that the Brotherhood and Consistory of the Church enter into an organic union with the Kiev Metropolia \"as soon as conditions of communication will permit.\" On December 24th and 25th, 1921, at a joint meeting of the executive of the Brotherhood and the Consistory, it was resolved that it was necessary to secure a Ukrainian Bishop for Canada as well as three Ukrainian priests.\nThe fourth council was held on July 1.6th and 17th, 1924, and in what is stated as the introduction in the minutes of this meeting appears the following:\u2014\nThe year 1924 shall become noted in the history of the Ukrainians in Canada for the reason that this year the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada obtained its Ukrainian bishop and thus united with all Ukrainian Orthodox Autocephalous Church which is under the leadership of old Ukrainian Metropolitan in Kiev Wasyl Lypkiwski.\nReference was then made at that meeting to the decision arrived at in 1919 that while\nthe Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada considers itself part of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church in Ukrainia,\nthere would be no opinion until the latter became autocephalous, that is, independent from the Russian or any other church. It was then pointed out that certain Ukrainians in the United States had succeeded in coming to an understanding with Kiev and had obtained a Ukrainian bishop from the Ukraine, namely, Archbishop John Theodorovich. The latter became the bishop of the newly formed Canadian Church and in September, 1925, at a conference of priests and the executive of the Brotherhood, the thanks of the meeting were expressed\nto His Grace Archbishop John Theodorovich for his care over the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Canada and declares to him their attachment as their head in America, at the same time the conference declares their unflinching allegiance to the Ukrainian Autocephalous Church with His Grace Metropolitan Wasyl Lupkiwsky.\nTurning now to the position of the congregation of the Cathedral in Winnipeg, we find that it was organized in 1923 as a parish of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church in Canada, the meetings of whose council we have been considering. From time to time communications were sent out on behalf of the congregation, asking for contributions from Ukrainians wherever they might be in Canada, and particularly those who considered themselves adherents and members of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church, in order to commence the building of a cathedral \"that would become the centre of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada.\" It is admitted that the first constitution of the congregation, although not produced, was adopted in 1924 and was handed, for revision, to Reverend Samuel W. Sawchuk, the first priest of the congregation. On September 13th, 1925, a resolution was passed at a meeting of the congregation which, while worded as if the congregation itself were to be constituted a body politic and corporate, was undoubtedly passed under the provisions of The Church Lands Act (R.S.M., 1913, c. 31). A copy of the resolution was filed within the prescribed time in the office of the Provincial Secretary, and by section 4 of the provincial enactment the trustees and their successors in office (not the congregation) became a body politic and corporate under the name of the\nTrustees of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Cathedral of St. Mary the Protectress, in the City of Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba,\nand\nand have perpetual succession and a common seal, and by such name shall have all the powers and privileges possessed by or given to trustees under this Act, and under said name may sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, answer and be answered in all courts and places whatever, and the said corporation shall have all the powers of corporations under The Manitoba Interpretation Act.\nTitle to the land upon which the cathedral was being erected was immediately taken and recorded in the names of the trustees. The revision of the congregation's first constitution being accomplished, what is known as the second constitution was adopted in March, 1926. By it:\u2014\nThe parish shall adhere to the dogmas and the rites of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada and shall foe under a joint spiritual supervision and jurisdiction of the Archbishop and the Consistory of the said. Church to the same extent as all other parishes forming the component part of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada.\nSpiritual leadership in the matters concerning services and church discipline is in the hands of Cathedral parish priest, which shall be appointed by the Archbishop and the Consistory of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada upon understanding with the executive of the parish.\n* * *\nThe church property belongs to the parish but the right of management of same shall be in (certain classes of members of) the parish.\nThe executive of the parish is to consist of the chairman, vice-chairman, recording secretary, financial secretary and treasurer (who are also the trustees) and two members of the executive and three members of the audit committee,\u2014to be elected by a majority vote of certain classes of members present at a general meeting properly called in that behalf.\nIn 1929 was passed the special Act incorporating the plaintiff corporation.\nThe preamble recites that a petition has been presented on behalf of the congregations and parishes of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada praying that it be enacted as thereinafter set forth.\nBy section 1 the Church declares that its faith and dogma are the same as that of the various already existing Greek Orthodox Churches and it adheres to the faith and dogma adopted by the first seven ecumenical councils of the Christian Church.\nBy section 2\nall the congregations, parishes, missions, of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada, which are now included and are a part thereof, and which may at any time in the future become a part thereof, are hereby constituted a corporation, public and politic, under the name of \"The Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada,\" hereinatfer called \"the Corporation\" for the purposes of administering the property and other temporal affairs connected with the spiritual jurisdiction of the said Corporation.\nSection 4 details the objects of the Corporation, i.e.,\nthe maintenance and carrying on of charities or missions, erection, maintenance and conduct of churches, cemeteries, schools, colleges or orphanages and hospitals in any of the provinces of Canada, the advancement in other ways of education, religion, charity and benevolence, and to administer in Canada such of the property, business and other temporal affairs of the said Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada as may be entrusted by the said Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada to the Corporation.\nSection 5 is a definition section. \"Member\" means any person who adheres to the faith, dogma and rite of the Church and who submits to the rules and regulations of the Corporation. \"Congregation\" means a group of members of the Corporation who already have organized and built a church which is officiated by a regular priest of the said church. \"Mission\" means a group of members of the Church who have declared themselves of the faith and dogma of the Church and who are in the process of formation of a congregation and have no church building. \"Parish\" means congregation or a group of congregations or missions officiated by one priest of the said Church.\nBy subsection 1 of section 6, any congregation or mission of the Church, whether now in existence or which may be formed at any time in the future, shall signify its intention to become a part of the Corporation by a resolution passed at a duly called meeting thereof, according to the constitution thereof. By subsection 2\nthe copy of such resolution shall be certified by the chairman and secretary of the said meeting and shall be sent to the consistory of the Corporation, and the Consistory may then issue a certificate admitting such congregation or mission to the Corporation.\nBy section 7,\nonly persons of the Ukrainian descent and of the faith dogma and rite of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada shall be eligible for the office of priests, bishops, metropolitans, or other spiritual and administrative offices of the Corporation.\nBy section 8 the Corporation is to be managed by a Board of Consistory of at least five members, composed of even numbers of clergy and laity, and the head bishop of the Church, if resident in Canada, shall be the president of the Board. In the absence of the head bishop, the administrator who must be a clergyman, elected at the last general council, shall act as the president of the Board. The supreme power in all temporal matters of the Corporation shall be vested in the General Council of the Corporation to be held and called according to the rules and by-laws hereinafter referred to. Each congregation, mission or parish shall have the right of representation at such General Council of the Corporation, subject to the said rules and by-laws. Every clergyman of any rank in good standing in the said Church shall have the right to be present at the General Council and vote and take part in the proceedings thereof.\nBy section 9 the Corporation is given power to make by-laws for the appointment, subject as provided in the Act, of a Board of Consistory for the administration, management, and control of property, business and other temporal affairs of the Corporation.\nIt is clear from the meetings of the several councils of the unincorporated Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada, held before 1929, that that Church never had any jurisdiction over the lands owned by the several congregations, the title to which, so far as concerns the Cathedral congregation, is vested by virtue of the provincial enactment in trustees. It is also clear from the Act of incorporation itself that Parliament did not even purport to vest these lands in the Corporation. There were meetings of a Council held after the Act came into force, and the minutes of those meetings continue the numerical designations adopted prior to May 1st, 1929. It is contended that the meetings subsequent to the Act were really meetings of the Board of Consistory of the Corporation only and indicate that the unincorporated church became absorbed in the appellant corporation. With this contention I find it impossible to agree.\nSection 2 of the Act refers to \"the spiritual jurisdiction of the said Corporation\" but nowhere in the Act is there any grant of spiritual jurisdiction; so that we may take it that none exists in the Corporation. My construction of the Act leads to the conclusion that what is meant in section 2 is really the spiritual jurisdiction of the unincorporated church, that that church exists side by side with the Corporation, that the latter is endowed with authority over temporal affairs only, and that the phrase \"other spiritual and administrative officers of the Corporation,\" in section 7, is used to describe the administrative officers who have dehors the Act some spiritual jurisdiction.\nSeveral considerations point to this as being the proper construction. First, the \"Brotherhood,\" many references to which appear in the minutes of the earlier councils, is not mentioned in the Act. Second, the concluding part of section 4 includes, among the objects of the Corporation, the administration in Canada of such of the property, business and other temporal affairs of the Church as might be entrusted by the Church to the Corporation. Third, subsection 5 of section 8 provides that every clergyman of any rank in good standing in the said Church shall have the right to be present at the General Council of the Corporation and vote and take part in the proceedings thereof. Fourth, if the Board of Consistory referred to in sections 8 and 9 has jurisdiction over temporal affairs only (as I think is clear) does that not infer that the Board of Consistory provided for by the General Councils of the Unincorporated Church should continue? In my opinion the Board of Consistory of the church did continue, with authority to exercise such spiritual jurisdiction as might, by consent have been conferred upon it. I construe subsection 3 of section 8:\u2014\n(3) The supreme power in all temporal matters of the Corporation shall be vested in the General Council of the Corporation to be held and called according to the rules and by-laws hereinafter referred to.\nas really limiting the power of the Corporation to temporal affairs over which, alone, it has any jurisdiction.\nConsiderable time was devoted to the question as to whether the Cathedral congregation was a \"part\" of the Corporation. The proper determination of this question is rendered difficult because of section 2 of the Act enacting that all the congregations, etc., of the Church, which are now included and are a part thereof, are constituted a corporation, and section 6, providing for the signification of the intention of \"any congregation or mission of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada, whether now in existence or which may be formed at any time in the future\" to become a part of the Corporation, by a resolution to be passed at a meeting of the congregation, and by the provisions of subsection 2 of section 6 that the Consistory \"may then issue a certificate admitting such congregation or mission to the Corporation.\" Counsel for the respondents argued vigorously that the Cathedral congregation took no part in the application for the Act of Incorporation and it may be that the general statement of Reverend Samuel W. Sawchuk, that the congregation did take part in such application, although not contradicted, cannot be accepted in the absence of any record of such action in the minutes of the meetings of the congregation.\nIt is unnecessary to express any opinion upon the point. Even if it be conceded that the congregation is a part of the Corporation, I have already indicated that in my opinion the latter acquired no spiritual jurisdiction. Furthermore, in my view, while the respondent Mayewsky is a priest of the unincorporated Church he never was a priest of the Corporation. While \"member\" is defined in section 5, nowhere in the Act is any liability imposed or right conferred upon a member; so that while Mayewsky is a person \"who adhered to the faith, dogma and rite of the Church,\" he did not submit to the rules and regulations of the Corporation.\nThe declaration signed by him on September 17th, 1931, and the certificate issued by the appellant corporation on the same day have not been overlooked. Attention should first be directed, however, to two letters addressed to Mayewsky in Galicia, from Reverend Samuel W. Sawchuk, who had by that time become \"President of Consistory.\" In the first of these, dated June 14th, 1930, it is stated:\u2014\nHis Grace Archbishop John Theodorpvich handed over to me your letter to him of the 18\/5, 1930, and requested to make arrangements to bring you to Canada as a priest of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. This they cannot be in United States of America owing to American immigration regulations.\nNew priests and candidates for priests with us are accepted by the conference of priesthood which will take place this year at the end of the month of July.\nand in the second letter, dated September 11th, 1930:\u2014\nThe governing body of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church in Canada, favorably considered your application to accept you into the ranks of the Ukrainian Orthodox priests in Canada and instructed me to take necessary steps to bring you to Canada.\nFrom these letters it appears that \"new priests * * * with us are accepted by the conference of priesthood\"; and that was the practice followed in the case of Mayewsky, who ultimately became the officiating priest of the Cathedral congregation. Nowhere in the Act of Incorporation of the appellant corporation is there any reference to a \"conference of priesthood\" so that the writer of the letter could not have been referring to the appellant congregation. Reverend Mayewsky arrived in Canada in 1931 and on September 17th of that year signed the following declaration:\u2014\nTo the Honourable Consistory of The Ukrainian Greek\nOrthodox Church of Canada,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nDeclaration\nI, the undersigned priest Peter Mayewsky hereby declare that I will honestly and conscientiously fulfill the duties as a priest of The Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada. That I will obey the Bishop and the Consistory of the said Church and will work for its welfare and development. I also declare that holy antimins which I have received from His Grace Archbishop John Theodorovich, through the Consistory of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada, is and shall remain to be the property of The Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada and as such shall be returned by me to the Consistory of said Church in case I ceased to be a priest of The Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada.\nDated Winnipeg, Manitoba, this 17th day of September, 1931.\n(Sgd.) Rev. Peter Mayewsky.\nSignature of the priest.\nWitness: S. W. Sawchuk.\nOn the same date a certificate was handed to him, reading as follows:\u2014\nConsistory of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada\nRev. S. W. Sawchuk, President,\n479 Andrews St.,\nWinnipeg, Canada.\nCertificate\nThis will certify that Reverend Peter Mayewsky is a priest of The Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada in good standing and as such is authorized to conduct Church services and to administer Holy Sacraments in accordance with the dogmas, teachings and rites of the said Church.\nDated at Winnipeg, Man., this 17th day of September, A.D. 1931.\nConsistory of The Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada.\nRev. S. W. Sawchuk, President.\nMyr. Stechishin, Asst. Secretary.\n(Seal reading: The Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada.)\nIt is principally upon these documents that the appellant corporation bases its contention that in 1931 Mayewsky became one of its priests. As to the declaration, I merely observe that it refers, in my opinion, to the unincorporated Church. Reverend Mayewsky never became a \"part\" of the Corporation, he never became a \"member\" as defined in section 5 of the Act, and the declaration merely calls upon him to obey the Bishop and Council of the unincorporated Church. The certificate is under the seal of the appellant corporation but the granting of such a certificate and the retention thereof by Reverend Mayewsky cannot alter the fact that he was a Ukrainian Orthodox priest, that he was accepted as a priest of the unincorporated Greek Orthodox Church of Canada by the conference of priests of that church, and that no certificate issued by the appellant corporation and accepted by him could alter his status. In short, neither the declaration nor the certificate can confer upon the appellant corporation a power or jurisdiction that, according to the Special Act, it did not possess and was incapable of assuming.\nOn this point it is sufficient to refer to In the Matter of the Petition of Complaint of the Right Rev. John William Colenso, D.D., Lord Bishop of Natal, a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council2. The particular extract to which I desire to draw attention is set out in Merriman v. Williams3. That also was a decision of the Judicial Committee, in which their Lordships referred to a still earlier judgment in Long v. Grey4. In the last mentioned case the judgment adopted the opinion of the Colonial Court that certain letters patent which had been issued after the establishment of constitutional government were ineffectual to create any jurisdiction, ecclesiastical or civil, within the colony. In the case of the Lord Bishop of Natal (1), Lord Westbury declared that it was quite clear that the Crown had no power to confer any jurisdiction or coercive authority upon the Metropolitan over the suffragan bishops, or over any other person, and the question then arose whether the Bishop of Natal had, by contract, given the jurisdiction claimed by Bishop Gray. It was on this point that Lord Westbury said in the extract referred to:\u2014\nEven if the parties intended to enter into any such agreement (of which, however, we find no trace), it is not legally competent to the Bishop of Natal to give, or the Bishop of Cape to accept or exercise, any such jurisdiction. Similarly, in this case it was not legally competent to Reverend Mayewsky to give, or to the appellant corporation to accept or exercise, the jurisdiction claimed by the appellant corporation. It need only be added that once it is admitted that the power of the corporation is confined to temporal affairs, no estoppel can, of course, be raised by reason of the congregation being represented, and Reverend Mayewsky being present, at meetings of the Consistory or Council after May 1st, 1929; and this is so whether those bodies be considered as consistories or councils of the unincorporated church or of the appellant corporation. In view of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to refer to the charges made against Mayewsky, except to state that they were heard by what is termed a church-court of the appellant corporation, upon whose findings was promulgated the sentence of expulsion, and that the charges involved no variation in faith or dogma on the part of Mayewsky from that of the unincorporated church.\nThe Corporation also asked for the return and delivery to its Board of Consistory of the antimins mentioned in the declaration of September 17th, 1931. We were told that this word, while plural in form, really denotes a consecrated napkin of linen or lace, without which there could be no celebration of Mass. Upon this point my view is that the obligation in the undertaking is to return the antimins to the Consistory of the unincorporated church in case Reverend Mayewsky ceased to be a priest of that church. That event not having occurred, this branch of the claim must fail.\nIt is beyond question that none of the appellants can have any valid claim against the respondent trustees. The provincial statute is clear that these trustees are a corporation merely to take and hold title to land, and the constitution of the Cathedral congregation is plain that the latter did not even purport to entrust that body with any power of management.\nWhatever may have been argued below, In this Court reliance was placed upon the fact that the individual appellants, Bohonos and Bugera, \"join in this suit not only on their own behalf but also on behalf of the other members\" of the Congregation, except the majority thereof. In fact the appellants divided the claim made against Reverend Mayewsky into two branches. The appellant corporation makes the only claim against him with respect to the antimins but, on the other hand, in respect of the other branch of the case (as to Reverend Mayewsky officiating in the Cathedral), the two individuals, it is stated, are the real plaintiffs. It is not admitted that the corporate plaintiff might not be also (or in the alternative) entitled to relief against the officiating in the cathedral but emphasis was placed upon what was alleged to be the undoubted right of the two individuals to succeed on that branch. From what has already been said, it is evident that there has been no departure by the congregation or Reverend Mayewsky from the belief and dogma of the unincorporated church, and for this reason, the claim of the individual appellants also fails.\nIt is perhaps advisable to point out that the Bishop is not a party to the claim and that the appeal fails to be decided on the basis of the claim advanced by the appellants. The alternative defence of the respondents, that if Reverend Mayewsky had ever been a priest of the appellant corporation, he was never legally expelled, need not be considered.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs and the order of the Court of Appeal confirmed, except that paragraph 3 thereof, dismissing the counter-claim without costs, should be amended so as to include the agreement with respect thereto, arrived at between the parties. There should be no costs of the cross-appeal.\nHudson J.\u2014In this action the plaintiff asked for, and at the trial before Mr. Justice Donovan, recovered a judgment as follows: (1) restraining the defendant Mayewsky from officiating any longer or conducting any further services in the cathedral in question in this action (namely, the Cathedral Church of St. Mary the Protectress in Winnipeg) as a priest of the plaintiff corporation or as a priest of the said congregation or parish for which the defendant corporation (trustees) holds the said Cathedral, or otherwise: (2) that the defendant trustees, its officers, servants and agents be restrained from procuring or permitting such officiating or conducting as aforesaid by the defendant Mayewsky; (3) ordering that the defendant Mayewsky be restrained from wearing or using the antimins used by him in officiating in the said cathedral, and that he do forth- with deliver the said antimins to the corporate plaintiff or its Board of Consistory. There was a further order dismissing a counter-claim by Mayewsky.\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, the appeal was allowed, the judgment at the trial set aside and the action dismissed with costs, and it was further ordered that the counter-claim be dismissed without costs.\nThere was a cross-appeal to this court in respect to the dismissal of the counter-claim which might be disposed of at once. It merely asked that it be provided that such dismissal shall not be deemed to be an adjudication upon any of the issues raised in the said counter-claim, except to the extent that any of the said issues are finally adjudicated upon and, in the main action, that the dismissal of the respondent's counter-claim is to be without prejudice to any action that may hereafter be brought in respect of any of the issues not finally adjudicated upon. Counsel for the appellant consented to this variation and that the cross-appeal should therefore be allowed to this extent.\nThe defendants, the trustees of the Cathedral, are title holders of the Cathedral property in the city of Winnipeg under the provisions of the Church Lands Act of Manitoba and, subject to the provisions of that Act, are trustees for the congregation of the Cathedral. They hold a certificate of title therefor dated the 29th December, 1925. The congregation had before that time been organized and still continues as an active religious body.\nThe defendant trustees have no right to interfere in connection with the selection and maintenance! of the priest of the Cathedral, nor the financial affairs of the congregation other than those arising out of ownership of the property.\nThe congregation itself is not made a party to this action by representation or otherwise.\nI am satisfied that no right of action exists against the defendant trustees because they have no right to remove the defendant Mayewsky and no right to represent the congregation before the court in this action. I would say at once that on this ground alone the action should be dismissed as against these defendants.\nAt the time the defendant trustees acquired title to the Cathedral property, the congregation adhered and still adheres to the dogmas and rites of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada, a voluntary church body having as its members similar congregations in various parts of Canada.\nThe defendant Mayewsky is a duly ordained priest adhering to the same faith and doctrines and was duly appointed and installed as a priest of the congregation and still retains that position, with the approval of all of the members of the congregation except the individual plaintiffs. So far as appears, Mayewsky has not been guilty of any heretodoxy.\nThe plaintiff corporation was organized under the authority of a special Act of the Parliament of Canada, 1929, chapter 98. The objects of the corporation are set forth in section 4 which reads:\nThe objects of the Corporation shall be the maintenance and carrying on of charities or missions, erection, maintenance and conduct of churches, cemeteries, schools, colleges or orphanages and hospitals * * * the advancement * * * of education, religion, charity and benevolence, and to administer in Canada such of the property, business and other temporal affairs of the said Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church' of Canada as may be entrusted by the said Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada to the Corporation.\nThis section recognizes the continued existence of the voluntary body as a spiritual church as distinguished from the statutory body which it proceeded to incorporate. Under section 6 congregations might by resolution affiliate with the statutory church if they cared to do so. If they chose to remain outside the corporate church, they were not affected by the statute. They retained their name and their spiritual and temporal rights unchanged.\nThe congregation of the Cathedral Church of St. Mary the Protectress never did by resolution become part of the Dominion corporation and although their representatives have on many occasions collaborated with the officers and representatives of the corporation, I can find nothing to justify holding that the Cathedral congregation ever became a part of the corporate body or subject to its control, either temporal or spiritual.\nThe corporation in effect sues to enforce a decree of excommunication of the defendant Mayewsky on grounds of insubordination. There were no charges made against his private character or orthodoxy. The charges against him were heard before a church court and the proceedings there have been fully discussed and criticized in the court below but, in the view I take of this case, it is unnecessary for me to come to any conclusion as to the validity of the trial or the sentence.\nThe individual plaintiffs claim to be members of the Cathedral congregation and at least one of them has been accepted as such. They rest their case on the position taken by the corporate plaintiff and their claim must stand or fall with it.\nIn respect of the claim to prohibit the defendant Mayewsky from continuing to act as a priest of the congregation, it seems to me that this amounts to no more than a claim to have the court enforce what is a purely ecclesiastical decree. No property right is involved so far as the plaintiffs are concerned. The corporation makes no contribution to the salary of Mayewsky, nor to the maintenance of the Cathedral Church. For this reason, I think that the action fails to this extent. Moreover, I agree with the statement of Mr. Justice Robson in the court below that:\nThis action is solely based on the powers of this corporation. I do not see where this plaintiff corporation is vested with any authority to enforce spiritual discipline over priests or to disqualify them or to restrain any particular priest from officiating or any congregation from accepting his ministrations. In my view we cannot go beyond the statement of claim and ascertain whether Rev. Mayewsky could have been excluded under the general canons or rules of the church. Even if it might in fact possibly be the case that disciplinary action of some kind would be in order, it is my view from a perusal of the statute, that this corporation was not established to see to the enforcement of such sentences.\nThere remains to be considered the question of the antimins. The \"antimins\" (singular) is a linen cloth of little monetary worth but of some special sacerdotal value. From the evidence, it appears to have been entrusted to the defendant Mayewsky by the corporate plaintiffs. It remains their property. The defendant does not profess obedience to the corporate body as distinguished from the voluntary church. The corporate body has demanded its return and I think is entitled to succeed on this part of its claim, irrespective of the validity or invalidity of the decree of excommunication. The mere fact that it has little monetary value is not sufficient to deprive the court of jurisdiction. Its sacerdotal value is something which can be estimated only by the ecclesiastical bodies concerned. My conclusion of the whole matter is that the judgment below should be amended by directing the return of the antimins to the proper representatives of the corporate body, that the dismissal of the counter-claim should be subject to the provision heretofore mentioned, and otherwise the appeal should be dismissed.\nAs to costs, I would allow nothing in respect of the antimins nor of the counter-claim. The general costs of the appeal I would award to the respondent.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nCross-appeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Heap, Arsenych & Murchison.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Lamont, Layton & Swystun.\n1 [1939] 1 W.W.R. 481.\n2 (1864) 3 Moore P.C.

The Municipality of the Town of Antigonish, [1940] S.C.R. 616\nDate: 1940-06-29\nMaritime Telegraph and Telephone Company Limited Appellant;\nand\nThe Municipality of The Town of Antigonish Respondent.\n1940: May 7; 1940: June 29.\nPresent: Crocket, Davis, Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA EN BANC\nAssessment and taxation\u2014Telephone company\u2014Personal property in town\u2014\"Actual cash value\"\u2014Basis on which assessors must estimate\u2014Rule 2 of section 17 of The Assessment Act, N.S. Statute of 1938, chapter 2.\nThe appellant company provides telephone service throughout the province of Nova Scotia, including the respondent town. This appeal involves the municipal assessment of that town for 1939 in respect of the personal property of the appellant company within the municipality. The personal property consisted of certain central office equipment, switch board and testing apparatus, telephone poles, wires, cables, etc., some 300 telephone stations in residences and business places and equipment of various kinds. The total cost as installed from time to time amounted to $32,505.67. The Assessment Act, chapter 2 of the Nova Scotia Statutes of 1938 enacts by section 17, rule 2, that \"all property liable to taxation shall be assessed at its actual cash value, such value being the amount which in the opinion of the assessor it would realize if offered at auction after reasonable notice.\" The assessors of the municipality fixed the value of the personal property in question at $10,800. Then the appellant company, pursuant to section 28(2) filed a sworn statement \"of the actual cash value\" of the property at a sum of $3,200 and the assessors, by section 29, were bound to adopt such valuation. But the municipal clerk, as entitled by the statute, appealed to the \" Assessment Appeal Court,\" which restored the assessors' valuation of $10,800. The appellant's appeals, first to the County Court and later to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, were dismissed, the latter Court holding that in assessing the personal property of a telephone company within a town the \" actual cash value \" thereof was to be estimated on the value of the property as it stands, an integrated system ready to operate within the town, dissociated from the rest of the company's system outside the town, and not at \"scrap-iron\" value. By special leave of the last mentioned Court, granted on terms, the appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc (14 M.P.R. 387), that the appeal should be dismissed and that the assessment fixed by the assessors at $10,800 which had been confirmed by all the Courts below, should be maintained.\nPer Crocket and Tascherea\u00fa J J.\u2014The property should be assessed as it stands and not as discarded junk. Moreover, the decision of the assessors should not be disturbed, as it has not been shown that they made their valuation without fully appreciating their duty under the statute.\nPer Davis J.\u2014Although it has always been a difficult problem to fix the value of such personal property as part of a telephone system within a given municipality, the three municipal assessors in this case were practical men engaged in assessment work for many years; and when their valuation has been confirmed by three successive courts the assessment should not be disturbed unless it has been plainly demonstrated to the Court that some error in principle has been applied and has resulted in an excessive amount; and this has not been shown.\nPer Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\u2014There is some evidence that; the appellant's personal property has been assessed at its actual cash value in accordance with rule 2 of section 17 of the Assessment Act. That value must be fixed without considering the property as an integral part of the appellant's system, and there is evidence from two witnesses that they had fixed the value on that basis. Therefore there should be no interference with the assessment.\nAPPEAL, by special leave to appeal granted on terms, from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, en banc[1], affirming the judgment of the County Court, MacDonald (Allan) J., and maintaining an assessment made under the provision of the Assessment Act of certain property belonging to the appellant company. The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nJ. G. Rutledge K.C. and C. B. Smith K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. S. Roper K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Crocket and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nCrocket J\u2014The main ground, upon which the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc has been challenged on this appeal, is that the impeached assessment was not made on the basis of the break-up or sale and removal value of the constituent parts making up the personal property in question, in accordance with the principle of assessment laid down in Bell Telephone Co. and The City of Hamilton[2], over 40 years ago. All the five judges of the Nova Scotia Court, sitting en banc, agreed that the Ontario so-called \"scrap-iron\" rule was not applicable to the assessment of the appellant's poles, wires, cross-arms, cables, etc., comprised in the appellant's telephone system within the Town of Antigonish, under the provisions of rule 2 of s. 17 of the Nova Scotia Assessment Act. This section provides as follows:\nAll property liable to taxation shall be assessed at its actual cash value, such being the amount which, in the opinion of the assessor it would realize in cash if offered at auction after reasonable notice, but in forming such opinion the assessor shall have regard to the assessment of other properties of its class in the Town or Municipality.\nI think the Nova Scotia Court was right in so holding and dismissing the appellant's appeal from the judgment of the County Court Judge of the District (Judge Allan MacDonald), who, on appeal from the Municipal Assessment Appear Board of the Town, confirmed the assessment of $10,800, made by the assessors of the town in respect of the appellant's personal property therein.\nThe above rule presents no difficulty when considered in its application to the assessment either of real estate or personal property in the sense in which these classes of property are ordinarily understood. There can be no doubt that it was intended to apply to both in the. same way, though it makes no mention of either real property or personal property. Its opening words are \"All property liable to taxation shall be assessed,\" etc. No one has suggested that any of the property of the appellant company within the limits of the Town of Antigonish, real or personal, is not liable to taxation. The whole difficulty here arises from the fact that the assessed property, including poles, fixed in the ground, and the cables, wires, etc., attached thereto, connecting with their telephone instruments in stores, business and private houses, were all part of the integrated system extending to and operated by the appellant company throughout many other municipalities in the Province under its franchise, and that the appellant itself in the inventory of its property, which it produced on the hearing before the County Court Judge, listed and valued these as personal property on the footing of their having been completely severed from its system and discarded as mere junk. If the rule applies at all to the assessment of such property\u2014and it has not been contested that it does\u2014it is impossible, I think, reasonably to spell out of its language an intention that the local assessors, when determining its value for assessment purposes, must regard it, not in the form or condition in which the property then exists, but as though all the poles, cables, etc., had first been removed and stripped of all value except that which it might possess as a collection of junk.\nWhile this rule unmistakeably makes the amount, which in the opinion of the assessors the property (whatever it may be) would realize in cash if it were offered at auction, the criterion for determining its \"actual cash value\" for assessment purposes, it lays down no other principle for the guidance of the assessors in determining that amount than that they \"shall have regard to the assessment of other properties of its class in the town or municipality.\" If there be no other property of the same class in the town or municipality, as all the judges below seem to have held in the present case, the assessors in forming their opinion as to what any particular property would realize on such a hypothetical auction are left perfectly free to consider any and all factors or elements which their own common sense dictates to them as likely to influence the auction price obtainable therefor. This may seem to be a very uncertain and unsatisfactory standard for the determination of the \"actual cash value \"of any property for municipal assessment purposes; especially when it has to be applied to the poles, cables, etc., forming part of an integrated telephone or telegraph system covering a number of municipalities; but it is the only standard the Legislature has prescribed. In doing so it apparently could do nothing else than leave the determination of the amount likely to be realized on such a hypothetical auction to the judgment of the local assessors, unhampered by any other principle than that of the exercise of their own common sense.\nIf it be true that the property must be assessed as it stands, and not as discarded junk, as I think it must be and as all the Judges below thought it must be, the decision of the Board of Assessors cannot to my mind well be disturbed unless it is clearly shown that they made their valuation without fully appreciating that it was their duty to do so upon the basis of what they honestly believed the property would realize if it were offered for sale at such an auction. There is nothing in the record which even suggests that the Board had not a clear conception of its duty in this respect. The fact that in determining that amount the assessors regarded the property as an integral part of the appellants entire provincial system, as it was then being operated, affords no ground for setting aside the assessment. Indeed with all respect, I cannot for my part see how the assessors, in appraising the property as it stood, could well do otherwise than regard it as such, for surely it was their duty to consider the existing condition of the property to be offered for sale, as well as all other matters which they might reasonably expect to affect its auction value.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDavis J.\u2014The appellant is a joint stock company which provides telephone service throughout the province of Nova Scotia, including the town of Antigonish. This appeal involves the municipal assessment of the town of Antigonish for the year 1939 in respect of the personal property of the appellant situate within the municipality. The personal property in question consists of certain central office equipment, switch board and testing apparatus, telephone poles, wires, cables, etc., some 300 telephone stations in residences and business places and equipment of various kinds. The total cost of the materials as installed from time to time amounted to $32,505.67.\nThe Assessment Act, now consolidated without material change as ch. 2 of the Nova Scotia Statutes of 1938, provides by sec. 17, rule 2, that\nAll property liable to taxation shall be assessed at its actual cash value, such value being the amount which in the opinion of the assessor it would realize in cash if offered at auction after reasonable notice but in forming such opinion the assessor shall have regard to the assessment of other properties of the like class in the town or municipality.\nThe assessors of the municipality fixed the value of the personal property in question at $10,800 and they gave notice in writing to the appellant corporation, as required by sec. 28(1), \"of the value at which they estimate\" the personal property of the appellant. If such valuation is objected to, then by sec. 28 (2) the managers or agents of the corporation may within fourteen days furnish to the assessors a written statement under the oath of such managers or agents \"of the actual value\" of the property assessed. By sec. 29 the assessors shall then adopt the valuation sworn to and such valuation shall be binding, subject only to appeal by the clerk of the municipality under the provisions of the Act.\nWhat purported to be, and appears to have been accepted as, a sworn valuation on behalf of the appellant as permitted by the statute was furnished by the appellant to the assessors. The amount given was $3,200. The municipal clerk, as entitled by the statute, appealed to the municipal appeal body constituted under the statute to hear assessment appeals and known as the \"Assessment Appeal Court.\" That Court restored the assessors' valuation of $10,800. The appellant then appealed to the County Court. That appeal was dismissed. The appellant then appealed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc. That appeal was also dismissed by the decision of the majority of that Court. By special leave of the last mentioned Court, granted on terms, the appellant appealed to this Court.\nCounsel for the appellant sought before us to appeal against the condition of the order granting it leave to appeal (that the appellant should pay in any event to the respondent its costs of and incidental to the appeal to this Court) but the appellant took advantage of the order and cannot now object to the condition on which the order was granted.\nIt is to be observed, at the outset, though the point does not appear to have been taken, that the manager's sworn statement was not a compliance with the statute. It was not a written statement under oath \"of the actual value\" of the property. It was a statement guardedly limited to the oath of its maker \"that the actual cash value of the personal property ... is, for the purpose of taxation as defined in the Assessment Act, the sum of $3,200.\" However no objection was taken.\nIt is always a difficult problem to fix the value of such personal property as part of a telephone system within a given municipality. But the three municipal assessors were practical men engaged in assessment work for many years and when their valuation has been confirmed by three successive courts an appellant has a formidable task in seeking to escape from the assessment; it must be plainly demonstrated to the Court that some error in principle has been applied and has resulted in an excessive assessment. This has not been shown, in my opinion, and I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKerwin J.\u2014I would dismiss the appeal with costs. I agree with the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia that there is some evidence that the appellant's personal property has been assessed at its actual cash value in accordance with rule 2 of section 17 of The Assessment Act:\u2014\nAll property liable to taxation shall foe assessed at its actual cash value, such value being the amount which in the opinion of the assessor it would realize in cash if offered at auction after reasonable notice but in forming such opinion the assessor shall have regard to the assessment of other porperties of the like class in the town or municipality.\nThat value, as stated by the Chief Justice, is to be fixed without considering the property as an integral part of the appellant's system. There being evidence from two witnesses who had fixed the value on that basis, we should not interfere with the assessment.\nHudson J.\u2014The appellant's personal property in the town of Antigonish was assessed for $10,800. From this assessment the appellants appealed to the Judge of the County Court for District No. 6 and such appeal was dismissed. The appellants then appealed from that decision to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc and that Court also dismissed the appeal.\nThe assessment was made under the authority of rule 2 of section 47 of The Assessment Act, as amended, which reads as follows:\nAll property liable to taxation shall be assessed at its actual cash value, such value being the amount which in the opinion of the assessor it would realize in cash is offered at auction after reasonable notice but in forming such opinion the assessor shall have regard to the assessment of other properties of the like class in the town or municipality.\nThe appellant provides telephone service throughout the province of Nova Scotia, including the town of Antigonish, and it has in the town a building used as a central station from which the telephone system is operated. The assessment of the building is separate and does not come into this controversy.\nThe contention of the appellant is that on a proper valuation its assessment would be the actual cash value of its poles, wire, cables and other items of a similar character, wholly dissociated as an integrated part of the whole plant and that when so dissociated the personal property is of a very inconsiderable value.\nThe value of this plant in the books of the company is placed at $32,505.67 but, due to depreciation through the years, this value has now been reduced by the company to somewhat over $3,000 and the company contends that this is the only amount for which it could properly be assessed.\nThe appeal before the County Court judge was in the nature of a hearing de novo. After taking evidence the learned County Court judge came to the conclusion that the assessment was proper. As to the argument on behalf of the company, he stated:\nIt is only such personal property of appellant as is situated within the town that may be assessed. But I think consideration of appellant's provincial franchise as excluding the right of a purchaser to operate, or of its earning or non-earning capacity within the town are beside the question in determining assessable value under the Act. And although there is some evidence on these matters I think the proper basis of valuation is to consider what should be the sale value of the personal property as it stands as an integrated system having a definite object and purpose and not taken apart with value limited to each constituent part. An auomobile, for example, would be so valued. To constitute personal, property it is not necessary that it should be reduced to its constituent parts.\nIt may thus be regarded as a going concern not, indeed, in the ordinary commercial sense where goodwill in a purchase is an element to foe considered, but as a system built for a definite purpose and capable of subserving that purpose.\nA majority of the Court en banc consisting of Chief Justice Chisholm, Smiley and Carroll JJ. were substantially of the same opinion as the County Court judge, although Chief Justice Chisholm was careful to point out that he gave his judgment\nbecause I find in the case some evidence that the value of the personal property of the appellant company has been rated at the cash value as defined in rule 2 of section 17 of the Assessment Act, namely, the actual value which in the opinion of the assessors it would realize in cash if offered at auction after reasonable notice. Two of the witnesses fixed that value without considering the property as an integral part of the whole system of the company. Only on that basis, in my opinion, should the assessment be made. If it were intended to assess the property as part of a larger system, one would have to look for a more definite statutory direction.\nMr. Justice Graham agreed in the main with the views expressed by the majority of the Court but was of the opinion that the evidence did not show the value of the property and that the matter should be sent back for rehearing. On this point Mr. Justice Archibald concurred with Mr. Justice Graham.\nIt seems to me that the learned County Court judge and the learned judges in Appeal are correct in their interpretation of this section, always bearing in mind the considerations mentioned above by Chief Justice Chisholm.\nOn the point of adequacy of the evidence, I do not feel that this Court should now interfere with the concurrent findings of the trial judge and the majority of the Court en banc. For this reason, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J. E. Rutledge.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J. S.

The concert was not provided by the appellant but by one S. with the permission of the appellant. A steamship company, a \" sister\" or subsidiary company of the appellant, which was transporting passengers to the resort, issued to the public an illustrated folder depicting and enlarging upon the attractions to be found on the grounds; and in it was a list of the recreations available and included in that list was a paragraph entitled \" Open-air entertainment\" with a detailed description of same. The area, known as the \" Shell \" area and comprised within the above No. 1 Picnic Grounds hereafter referred to, on which the concert was held, was free to the public and S's revenue was from collections which he took up from the audience. The appellant supplied the wooden benches and its employees placed them in position daily, but the appellant did not charge S. for the use of the stage or share in the collections, and S. was not an officer or employee of the appellant. The respondents were members of a picnic party composed mainly of employees of a company in Vancouver and were transported to the island by the steamship company. At their request, made some time previous to the latter, a small area known as No. 1 Picnic Grounds referred to in the folder had been set aside for their exclusive use as a common centre. No fee was charged the public for entrance to the resort: appellant's revenue was obtained from sale of food, hotel accommodation and boating, bathing and amusement facilities, although there was no evidence that respondents paid anything to the appellant for the use of such privileges. The trial judge held that the respondents were invitees of the appellant and awarded them damages; and that judgment was affirmed by a majority of the appellate court. Held, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal ([1940] 1 W.W.R. 209), that there was evidence to support the finding of the trial judge that in respect of the \" Picnic Grounds No. 1 \" the respondents were \"invitees\" and that the appellant, who was the owner in possession of that property, was responsible for the invitation; that there was also sufficient evidence to support his finding that the locus of the mishap in which the respondents were injured was within the locality to which the invitation extended; and, further, that that was sufficient evidence to support his finding, concurred in by the majority of the Court of Appeal, that the appellant failed in its duty to keep the bench reasonably safe for the purpose for which the respondents and other \"invitees\" were intended to use it.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1]affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Fisher J., and maintaining the respondents' action for damages.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nC.

There was also sufficient evidence to support his finding that the locus of the mishap in which the respondents were injured was within the locality to which the invitation extended\u2014\" the picnic grounds no. 1.\"\nThe passage in the judgment of Lord Selbourne in Walker v. Midland Railway Co.[2] cited by Lord Buckmaster in Mersey Docks v. Procter[3] is, I think, apposite.\nSo far as pertinent it is in these words:\n**** the duty is limited to those places to which a person may reasonably be supposed to be likely to go in the belief, reasonably entertained, that he is invited *** to do so. The folder is evidence against the appellants as well as against the steamship company. In the examination of the manager of the appellants on discovery this occurs:\n82. Q. I understand the whole thing is all your property? A. The whole thing is all our property.\n83. Q. What was bothering me is you see your advertisement under the heading of recreation in this document marked 2, it says that the stage or whatever it is, or the shell, is on No. 1 ground. You don't quarrel with that at all? A. No, you can call it No. 1 ground.\nThere was sufficient evidence also in support of the finding that the appellants failed in their duty to \"keep\" the bench \" reasonably safe \" (Letang v. Ottawa Electric Railway Co.)[4] for the purposes for which the respondents and other \" invitees \" were intended to use it.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014On July 3rd, 1938, Catherine L. Kennedy, Gladys McLeod and Sarah Brooks were injured by the collapse of a bench on which they were seated. They, and the husbands of the first two mentioned women, sued Union Estates Limited for damages for the injuries sustained and for the ensuing expenses. They succeeded before the trial judge, Mr. Justice Fisher, and, on appeal, the judgment was sustained by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia with two of the judges dissenting. By special leave of that Court, the defendant now appeals.\nThe accident occurred while the respondents, as members of a picnic party, were on that portion of Bowen Island, near Vancouver, in the province of British Columbia, owned and occupied by the appellant. It there operated a hotel, a cafeteria, a store, and provided facilities for picnics, boating, fishing, swimming, tennis, dancing, lawn bowling, and horseback riding. The usual rates were, of course, charged to anyone staying at the hotel and using certain of the recreational facilities but no charge was made for the use of the picnic grounds. The appellant also arranged for open air entertainments on a specially designed platform known as a concert shell but no fee was demanded from those who desired to listen to the programs, the entertainers relying upon voluntary donations for their recompense. Union Steamships Limited, not a party to this action, owned and operated a steamship plying, for hire, between Vancouver and Bowen Island. While that company and appellant are both subsidiaries of a third company, and while there is in evidence an agreement between the two whereby the shipping company agreed to pay the appellant, each year, such sum as should be mutually agreed upon by the directors and managers of each in respect of the use, by the shipping company and its passengers, of the appellant's wharves, terminal facilities, summer resorts and pleasure grounds at Bowen Island or elsewhere, the point is unimportant as undoubtedly the businesses of the two companies were operated jointly for their mutual advantage. While Mr. Rushton, to be referred to later, the traffic assistant of Union Steamships Limited, was not an officer or employee of the appellant, the latter's manager testified that Mr. Rushton \"devotes a good deal of his time to Union Estates,\" and that the three companies \"all work together.\" Even Mr. Rushton admitted that there was an arrangement between the appellant and the Steamship Company whereby the latter might allocate recreational facilities on the Island for such organizations as might desire them.\nUnder these circumstances, there can be no question as to the admissibility in evidence of an illustrated folder depicting and enlarging upon the attractions to be found on the Island, and this, notwithstanding the fact that it does not appear that any of the respondents ever saw the folder. In it is a list of the recreations available and included in that list appears the following:\u2014\nOpen-air Entertainments\u2014Frequent amusing shows, concerts and vaudeville entertainments are arranged in the evenings at the Bowen Island Concert Shell on no. 1 grounds. Other facilities include Children's swings, softball and outside checker\u2014board.\nPicnic Facilities\u2014Plenty of hot water (free) and stoves are always available for large or small basket picnic parties and family groups, with covered tables under shade trees.\nFive separate picnic grounds are available for reservation by organized parties, replete with modern equipment; running tracks for field sports, and splendid accommodation for softball and games.\nLight refreshments, lunches, tea, coffee and sandwiches, etc., any time at the Pavilion Cafeteria. All meals are also available for visitors at Bowen Island Inn. Supplies of all kinds can be obtained at the artistic general store. In one corner of the folder it is stated:\u2014\nFor information regarding all sailings, picnic reservations, accommodation at Bowen Island Inn and summer cottages.\nenquire\nUnion Steamships Ltd., Vancouver, B.C., Union Pier, foot Carrall street, phone Trinity 1321, or City Office, 793 Granville street, phone Seymour 9331, or E. A. Vosper, Superintendent Union Estates Ltd., Bowen Island, B.C.\nOn April 14th, 1938, Ida Mary Scott, a stenographer and switchboard operator of the International Harvester Company of Canada, Limited, applied to Mr. Rushton to secure a picnic ground at the Island for the Harvester Company's picnic, to be held on July 3rd, 1938. In accordance with the arrangement between the Steamship Company and appellant, and without reference to any of the appellant's employees, Mr. Rushton designated for the purpose no. 1 Picnic Grounds, referred to in the folder, and notified the appellant's Island Superintendent of the allotment. Tickets for the return trip between Vancouver and the Island were issued by the Steamship company and were sent and charged to the Harvester company. On the day appointed the picnickers journeyed to the Island, among them being the respondents. I deem it irrelevant whether the latter were, or were not, employees of the Harvester company and whether each of the respondents paid for his or her ticket, although in fact it appears that one of them was such an employee and that another testified that she purchased her ticket. The ticket for each respondent was paid for by someone and there can, I think, be no doubt that no. 1 Picnic Grounds were reserved for all those who might attend the Harvester company's picnic, whether employees of that company or not. It need only be added that there is no evidence that respondents paid anything to the appellant by way of purchase of goods or for the use of any of the privileges of the Island.\nThe picnic was held, some of the picnickers returned to Vancouver on the Steamship company's boat about six o'clock in the evening and others remained on the Island until a later boat. Several people, including the respondents, sat upon one of the benches provided for the purpose by the appellant, to watch an entertainment on the concert shell. The fact that the entertainers neither received anything from, nor paid anything to, the appellant, but relied upon voluntary donations has no significance, nor is it important that the respondents, or some of them, contributed to the collection. They were seated for ten to twenty minutes when one end of the bench collapsed, causing the injuries complained of.\nThe principal contention before us was that the respondents were licensees and not, as found by the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal, invitees, or, at least, licensees with an interest. Counsel for the appellant agreed that if the respondents had, for instance, gone into appellant's store to make a purchase, they would be invitees, but contended that they could not be so considered when on the picnic grounds for the use of which they paid no fee direct to the appellant. In my opinion that contention is unsound. The appellant was operating the resort as a commercial venture and the Steamship company must be taken as the agent of the appellant to invite (as that expression is used in the cases) the respondents to use the facilities provided on the Island. It is not necessary that there should be any contractual relationship between the appellant and respondents. It suffices that the respondents were upon premises owned and occupied by the appellant, on the business of the appellant, and with a common interest with it. It is true that in my view of the matter nothing was received by the appellant for the use of the picnic grounds but I agree with Mr. Justice M. A. Macdonald when he states:\u2014\nWhether patrons were attracted to tea rooms, the boat house, tennis courts, etc., or the \" Concert Bowl,\" one common purpose was served, viz.: profit for appellant and advancement for its commercial interests. Attractions of a varied character in their combined effect would induce the public to visit the Island, repeat the visit and cause others to do so. A patron might promote appellant's interest, even though no money was spent by him except payment of his fare.\nIt was also contended that the accident did not happen on the picnic grounds. Upon a review of the evidence, I have concluded that that submission is not well-founded but, even assuming that it is, the appellant was interested in the picnickers remaining on the Island as long as possible in the hope that they would make purchases or use the facilities for which a fee was charged. The principle of Indermaur v. Danes[5] applies, and the terms of the invitation by appellant to respondents did not restrict the latter to the picnic grounds. The accident arose by reason of the fact that one of the tenons that mortised the leg to the seat of the bench had decayed and rotted. The trial judge in effect so found although it is suggested that he was influenced by certain evidence admitted by him in reply. Scott, the director of the entertainment, was a witness for the appellant and in cross-examination denied having made a statement that he had previously warned the appellant of the condition of the benches generally. The evidence called in reply that he had made such a statement was not admissible to show that any such warning was actually given. However, disregarding it, there remains ample evidence to justify the finding of the trial judge, concurred in as it was by the majority of the Court of Appeal. With this established, I think it is beyond question that while the appellant did not set a trap for the respondents, its employees made no proper inspection of the bench and such an inspection would have disclosed the decayed condition.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nHUDSON J.\u2014The plaintiffs in these consolidated actions were injured through the collapse of a bench upon which they had been sitting. This bench was under the control and supervision of the defendants and on property owned and occupied by them. It was alleged that the bench was in an unsafe and dangerous condition, due to the negligence and default of the defendants, and further that being in such condition it was in the nature of a trap.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Fisher, without a jury. He found as a fact that the bench when it collapsed was in an unsafe and dangerous condition and that the defendants were negligent and responsible for this. He further held that the plaintiffs were under the circumstances of the case invitees of the defendants. On appeal, verdicts in favour of the plaintiffs were sustained.\nThere was evidence to support the findings of fact of the learned trial judge and, affirmed as they have been by the Court of Appeal, I think there is no reason why those findings should be disturbed.\nThe real question to be considered is whether or not the plaintiffs were \" invitees \" of the defendants under the circumstances. The bench in question was on recreation grounds of the defendants on Bowen Island, about an hour's journey by sea from Vancouver. On this island the defendants had various attractions provided for visitors, including, according to advertisements, swimming, boating and fishing, tennis, lawn bowling, dancing, open air entertainments and picnic facilities as well as an inn and a cafeteria. It is quite apparent that these sources of recreation were not provided by the defendants out of philanthropic considerations. Doubtless they derived revenues from charges which were made to visitors for services rendered on the island. In addition to this, there were indirect considerations which entered into the matter. The entire stock of the defendant company called Union Steamships of British Columbia, Limited, and this company in turn owned the capital stock of another company called Union Steamships Limited which operated a line of steamships, some of which ran between Vancouver and Bowen Island. The Union Steamships Company and the defendants have the same executive, the same office, the same directors and the same shareholders. A folder was put in evidence advertising the attractions of Bowen Island and purporting to be issued by Union Steamships, making it quite obvious that Union Steamships Limited and the defendants were engaged in a common enterprise for the benefit of both.\nThe plaintiffs' visit to the island on the occasion in question was in consequence of arrangements made by a Miss Scott, who represented some of the plaintiffs among others. Miss Scott had interviews and correspondence with the Union Steamships Company with a view of arranging for a picnic to be held at Bowen Island and, as a consequence, she received a letter which read as follows:\nDear Miss Scott,\nWe wish to thank you for confirmation of the Annual Picnic of the International Harvester Company of Canada to be held at Bowen Island this year on Sunday, July 3rd, and take pleasure in advising we have duly reserved our No. 1 Grounds for your exclusive use.\nAs advised we will make a special net quotation as last year, namely, 80c for adults and 40c for children five years of age and under twelve (under five free).\nA plentiful supply of hot water and all facilities will be immediately available on arrival and we would also mention that full course luncheons and dinners are served at Bowen Island Inn and light refreshments at the Pavilion Cafeteria for anyone desiring this service. Steamer will leave Union Pier at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. and returning will leave Bowen Island at 6 and 9.15 p.m.\nRegarding tickets, we will be glad to arrange a supply as last year, if you will kindly get in touch with us when convenient, nearer to the date.\nThanking you and wishing you a very enjoyable outing.\nYours very truly,\nG. A. Rushton,\nTraffic Assistant.\nFollowing this letter, the plaintiffs and a considerable number of other people went to Bowen Island and were accommodated on picnic grounds no. 1. Towards evening of the day of the picnic they took their seats on the bench which collapsed. This bench was at a place called the \" bowl,\" where open air entertainments were provided, and some question has been raised as to whether the place where these benches were formed part of picnic grounds no. 1 or not.\nIn the advertising circular of the Steamships Company it is stated:\nOpen-air entertainments\u2014Frequent amusing shows, concerts and vaudeville entertainments are arranged in the evenings at the Bowen Island Concert Shell on No. 1 grounds.\nThe manager of the defendant company, when the question was raised, answered: \"You can call it no. 1 ground.\" It is certain that the \"bowl\" was, if not actually on the picnic ground, immediately adjacent thereto and indistinguishable therefrom so far as the plaintiffs were concerned.\nThe fares of the plaintiffs were paid either by them or on their behalf. The business of conveying passengers to the Island and providing entertaining attractions for them there was really in the nature of a joint enterprise for the ultimate benefit of both companies. The evidence shows that nothing was paid by the plaintiffs for the actual use of the benches in question, and that the entertainment provided at the bowl was not given by the company, but the benches in question were under the supervision of the defendants, placed there and taken away from time to time by their employees.\nThe question then is whether or not these facts bring the case within the rule set up in Indermaur v. Dames[6]. Counsel for the defendants urged strongly that there was no common interest as between the defendants and the plaintiffs in respect of the use of this bench and that, for that reason, the defendants were under no liability. I am of the opinion that this contention cannot be sustained. As stated in Pollock on Torts, 14th Edition, page 410, it is not necessary that there should be any direct or apparent benefit to the occupier from the particular transaction, and here there were indirect benefits coming to the defendant company. I cannot distinguish between the situation of the defendants and a storekeeper whose customers may come into the store with the expectation of buying things and the storekeeper under the Indermaur v. Dames[7]rule is liable, whether or not the customer makes a purchase.\nThe defendants were looking forward to getting, and possibly did get, benefits from the presence of the plaintiffs on the Island, directly from money which they spent in respect of amusements there and, in any event, the Steamship Company was getting the money from the plaintiffs' fares and the defendants were providing the attractions which induced the plaintiffs to take the trip.\nReference might be made to Smith v. London & St. Katharine Docks [8]; Holmes v. North Eastern Railway [9].\nThe fact that the benches in question were owned and under the direct control and supervision of the defendants' employees distinguishes the case from that of Humphreys v. Dreamland [10].\nI am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. S. Lane.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H. E. M.

Tiffin (Defendant) Respondent.\n1940: March 6, 7; 1940: June 29.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Crocket, Davis and Kerwin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Physicians\u2014Arrangement between plaintiff and defendant, both physicians, for defendant to purchase practice of third physician (retiring) with moneys furnished by plaintiff and to practise for fixed time and pay share of profits to plaintiff\u2014Subsequent contracts for further periods of practice and division of profits\u2014Restrictive covenants against defendant practising within certain time and area\u2014Validity, severability, of the restrictive covenants\u2014Plaintiff suing for an accounting\u2014Nature of the agreements\u2014Consideration\u2014Statute of Frauds (R.S.O., 1937, c. 146), s. 4\u2014Question as to application of ss. 47, 50, of Medical Act (R.S.O., 1937, c. 225), in view of plaintiff becoming disentitled to practise.\nPlaintiff and defendant, both physicians, arranged that defendant should in defendant\u2019s name purchase from C., a physician retiring from practising in the same town in which plaintiff practised, C.\u2019s practice and certain equipment, plaintiff furnishing to defendant the money for the purpose; and this was done. Plaintiff and defendant entered into an agreement whereby defendant was to \u201cpractise for\u201d plaintiff for three years, plaintiff to pay to defendant $300 each month and expenses of the practice and 10% of the net proceeds of the practice (determined after deducting expenses including defendant\u2019s said \u201cmonthly salary\u201d). Defendant carried on the practice in the office formerly occupied as tenant by C., the building containing it having been purchased by plaintiff. Said three-year period began on May 1, 1930. On April 17, 1933, plaintiff and defendant entered into a second agreement whereby defendant agreed to continue the practice \u201cfor and on behalf of\u201d plaintiff \u201cand in his own name and with the same good will and co-operation between the parties as has existed in the past\u201d to May 1, 1936, defendant to receive 50% of the net profits. On September 6, 1935, plaintiff and defendant entered into a third agreement in terms similar to those of the second agreement, the period of the third agreement to last until May 1, 1939. Each of the agreements contained a covenant by defendant not to practise within a certain area within a certain time. On certain settlements of accounts, defendant gave to plaintiff two promissory notes dated respectively January 1, 1934, and May 1, 1935. In October, 1935, plaintiff\u2019s name was struck from the register under the Medical Act (R.S.O., 1937, c. 225). About September, 1937, defendant refused to recognize any claim of plaintiff on the promissory notes or under the agreements. Plaintiff sued for payment of the notes and an accounting. Defendant pleaded that the second and third agreements were nuda pacta and failed wholly (as did also the promissory notes) for want of any consideration, and that he had more than fully paid all moneys payable under the first agreement; he also attacked the agreements by reason of the restrictive covenants, and also pleaded the Medical Act aforesaid and the Statute of Frauds. At trial, McTague J.A. ([1939] O.R. 444) gave judgment to plaintiff for an accounting. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario (ibid), which dismissed the action. Plaintiff appealed.\nHeld (per Rinfret, Davis and Kerwin JJ.; the Chief Justice and Crocket J. dissenting): Plaintiff\u2019s appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nPer Davis J.: Whether or not the restrictive covenants made by defendant in the agreements are unenforceable, they are clearly severable; in any case there was nothing in the evidence to support the contention that either the second or third agreement was made by defendant because of any thought or fear of enforcement of the restrictive covenant. While it cannot be said that a trust was created by the first agreement, there was consideration for all the agreements, and the court is not concerned with the adequacy thereof. The plain intention of the parties, and it was fully carried out, was that defendant would practise by himself and in his own name, and it was only in the sense of sharing with plaintiff the earnings of the practice that the rather loose language in the agreements as to defendant practising \u201cfor\u201d or \u201cfor and on behalf of\u201d plaintiff were used. As to the Medical Act, plaintiff\u2019s name was not struck from the register until October, 1935, and in any case it was the earnings from defendant\u2019s practice, carried on by himself and in his own name alone, which were covered by the agreements.\nPer Kerwin J.: As to the second agreement, whereby defendant was to continue the practice \u201cfor and on behalf of\u201d plaintiff for three years, defendant\u2019s contention that, if any consideration existed, it did not appear in the written document and thus the agreement was not enforceable by virtue of s. 4 of the Statute of Frauds (R.S.O., 1937, c. 146), is sufficiently met (apart from other items of consideration suggested) by plaintiff\u2019s promise therein to pay defendant 50% of the net profits. By entering into the first agreement, defendant undertook in effect that he would at its expiration turn over to plainiff the practice which he had been enabled to commence with plaintiff\u2019s money, unless some new agreement was entered into. The new agreement being valid to the extent indicated, defendant is bound to account to plaintiff in accordance with its terms. Plaintiff did not contravene ss. 47 and 50 of the Medical Act and is not prevented because of those enactments from compelling an accounting. The validity of the restrictive covenants is not material in determining the present case.\nPer the Chief Justice and Crocket J. (dissenting): Plaintiff is not entitled to any rights as between himself and defendant on the footing that, in defendant\u2019s contract of purchase from C, plaintiff was the principal contracting through defendant as his agent, or that defendant\u2019s rights under that contract were held by him in trust for plaintiff; the contract between C. and defendant was a personal contract\u2014C.\u2019s patients were to be introduced to defendant (as to the true nature of the pith and substance of such a contract, May v. Thomson, 20 Ch. D. 705, at 718, referred to); further, it was well known to plaintiff and defendant that C. contracted in the full belief that defendant was contracting as principal and in particular in the full belief that defendant was not contracting as plaintiff\u2019s agent, and, in the circumstances, plaintiff could not have enforced the contract as a principal (Ferrand v. Bischoffsheim, 4 C.B., N.S. 710, at 717); further, the proposition of plaintiff\u2019s rights upon the footing aforesaid was really based on the assumption that plaintiff and defendant were inducing C. to enter into the contract by industrious concealment in circumstances which imparted to that concealment the character of misrepresentation; and it is not open to plaintiff to base his case upon his own wrong; he cannot set up a relationship in support of his claim which rests upon fraud upon third parties (Jackson v. Duchaire, 3 Term Rep. 551, and other authorities cited). It was definitely understood between plaintiff and defendant that the arrangement between them should be kept secret. The agreement between them did not contemplate the establishment of any such relationship as that of a partnership or that of principal and assistant. The patients treated by defendant in the course of his practice were his patients. If there was any vinculum juris which plaintiff could have invoked against defendant\u2019s resistance, it was that of debtor and creditor. The restrictive covenants were void in law; such a covenant in gross would be contrary to public policy and unenforceable; and such a covenant is not valid and enforceable as subsidiary to the contract between plaintiff and defendant\u2014a contract merely binding defendant to practise for three years and pay to plaintiff a share of the earnings. There was no consideration to defendant for his second and third agreements with plaintiff; at the expiration of the period of the first agreement, plaintiff had nothing to give to defendant. It was not competent in this action to go outside the writing to find consideration for defendant\u2019s promise, the agreement being within s. 4 of the Statute of Frauds. The promissory notes, which were given in settlement of moneys supposed to be payable under the second and third agreements, do not advance the matter. Though their production establishes a prima facie right, a presumption of valid consideration, yet the facts are all before the court and the only possible consideration was money supposed to be owing under defendant\u2019s promises given without consideration. A promise to pay money, unenforceable because not supported by a valuable consideration, can, itself, be no consideration for a promise to pay these sums, whether in the form of a promissory note or in any other form. Putting the point in another way: the direct and immediate cause of the making and delivery of the notes and the whole basis of the agreement embodied therein was the mistaken belief, common to both parties, that the amounts thereof were due and owing; and the notes are unenforceable because, by reason of such mistaken belief, they were void. The mistake was one in respect of particular private rights involving the application of general principles of law to the facts; a mistake due to ignorance in respect of a right which both parties supposed to exist. On the principle of Cooper v. Phibbs (L.R. 2 H.L. 149) and cases which have followed it, such a mistake vitiates the contract or the instrument under which it is given. (This sort of mistake is not the basis of a right to recover back money as paid under a mistake of fact, for there the mistake must be one of pure fact and not of mixed fact and law). APPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which (reversing the judgment of McTague J.A. at trial[2]) dismissed the action.\nThe action was brought for an accounting from defendant (and payment of moneys found due thereon) under three agreements entered into between the plaintiff and defendant, both physicians, in respect of the practice of medicine by defendant in the town of Wallaceburg, Ontario, and for payment of the amount of two promissory notes made by the defendant in favour of the plaintiff. The material facts of the case are dealt with in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported, and also in the reasons for judgment in the Courts below. The trial judge, McTague J.A., gave judgment to plaintiff for an accounting. This was reversed by the Court of Appeal (Henderson J.A. dissenting in part), which gave judgment dismissing the action. Plaintiff appealed to this Court, asking that the judgment at trial be restored. The appeal to this Court was allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored with costs throughout (the Chief Justice and Crocket J. dissenting).\nJ.R. Cartwright K.C. for the appellant.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and K.G. Morden for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Crocket J. (dissenting) was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014With great respect for the learned trial judge, I agree with the Court of Appeal that the appellant is not entitled to any rights as between himself and the respondent on the footing that in the contract of the 5th of November, 1929, he was the principal contracting through the respondent as his agent with Dr. Cowan.\nDr. Cowan and the appellant had been practicing medicine in Wallaceburg for many years. Dr. Cowan was about to retire from practice and the appellant conceived the design that he would have the respondent step into Dr. Cowan\u2019s place and take over his patients and his practice under an arrangement by which the appellant would receive the lion\u2019s share of the profits of the practice. It is plain from the evidence that it was essential to the success of the scheme that Dr. Cowan should be ignorant of any connection between the appellant and Dr. Cowan\u2019s successor. He knew that Dr. Cowan would have no dealings with him, or anybody associated with him. The respondent was a young man who had just finished his medical education and had been practising for some months in a place called Merlin, not far from Wallaceburg, and he was selected by the appellant as a suitable person to step into the shoes of Dr. Cowan. On the 31st of October, 1929, the appellant and the respondent entered into an agreement on the following terms:\u2014\nStanley A. Richardson, M.D.\nWallaceburg.\nMemorandum of agreement made this 31 of October, 1929. Between S.A. Richardson of the Town of Wallaceburg, physician herein called the party of the first part AND Eldon R. Tiffin hereinafter called the party of the second part.\nWitness that in consideration of Ten Thousand Eight Hundred Dollars paid in 36 equal monthly instalments of Three Hundred Dollars each by the party of the first part along with necessary expenses entailed while practicing for the party of the first part, also ten per cent. of all monies received from practice done by party of the second part after payment of all expenses of the said practice including his monthly salary, the party of the second part agrees to practice for the party of the first part to the best of his ability for a period of three years.\nThe party of the second part agrees to furnish his own car and all its upkeep except gasoline and oil used in practice.\nThe party of the second part also agrees not to practice in or within twenty miles of the town of Wallaceburg without the consent of the party of the first part under penalty of $10,000 as liquidated damages before May 1, 1939.\nThe respondent\u2019s agreement with Dr. Cowan is as follows:\u2014\nAGREEMENT made this 5th day of November in the year one thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine, BETWEEN R.D. Cowan of the Town of Wallaceburg, in the County of Kent in the Province of Ontario, Physician, hereinafter called the vendor of the First Part AND E.R. Tiffen, Physician, hereinafter called the Purchaser of the Second Part;\nWHEREAS the Vendor has for several years past exercised his profession of Physician and Surgeon at the said Town of Wallaceburg, and is now desirous of retiring from his practice in the said Town of Wallaceburg, and the purchaser is desirous of establishing himself as a Physician and Surgeon at the said Town of Wallaceburg.\nNOW THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSETH that the Vendor agrees to sell and the purchaser agrees to purchase all drugs and medicines now used therein exclusive of all medical books, private papers, medical bags and instruments (which said excepted articles shall be removed by the Vendor) also said practise and the good-will and benefits thereof from May the First, 1930, for the said sum of Twelve Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($1,250).\nTHE VENDOR HEREBY delivers over to the purchaser the said practice or business and the good-will thereof for his absolute use and benefit; and likewise the full and uninterrupted possession of the office in which the said practice now carried on by him together with the effects hereinbefore mentioned and described as being covered hereby.\nTHE VENDOR COVENANTS that he will not practise either as a Physician or a Surgeon or act directly or indirectly as partner or assistant to or with any other physician or surgeon either at the said Town of Wallaceburg or elsewhere within twenty miles thereof, under penalty of $5,000.\nSubsequently, some months after the execution of this agreement, Dr. Cowan insisted that the respondent should take over the furniture and equipment in his office and this was accordingly done and the respondent paid $250. These two sums of $1,250 and $250 were paid by the appellant to the respondent in order to enable the respondent to carry out the arrangement.\nIt was held by the learned trial judge that the appellant was the principal in the agreement between the respondent and Dr. Cowan and that the respondent\u2019s rights under that agreement were held by him in trust for the appellant, and it is upon that position that the respondent\u2019s counsel based his case in the argument before this Court. In considering this subject it is necessary to take account of the true nature of the pith and substance of an agreement such as that between Dr. Cowan and the respondent. It was discussed by Sir George Jessel in a case, May v. Thomson[3], and it is convenient, I think, to reproduce his words now:\u2014\nI pause there to consider what there was to sell. The main subject of the sale was, as I have said, a medical practice: the lease and furniture were only an adjunct of the practice. What is the meaning of selling a medical practice? It is the selling of the introduction of the patients of the doctor who sells to the doctor who buys: he has nothing else to sell except the introduction. He can persuade his patients, probably, who have confidence in him to employ the gentleman he introduces as being a qualified man, and fit to undertake the cure of their maladies; but that is all he can do. Therefore, when you talk of the sale of a non-dispensing medical practice\u2014of course, when a man keeps what is called a doctor\u2019s shop there is a different thing entirely to sell\u2014you are really talking of the sale of the introduction to the patients, and the length, the character and duration of the introduction, the terms of the introduction, are everything. And there is something more, according to my experience, in cases of the sale of medical practices\u2014I do not know how the evidence is with regard to it in this case\u2014there is always a stipulation that the selling doctor shall retire from practice either altogether or within a given distance. It is so always, and there is also sometimes a stipulation that he shall not solicit the patients, or shall not solicit them for a given time. They are both very important stipulations as regards keeping together the practice for the purchasing doctor.\nAs it seems to me, it is quite obvious, apart altogether from the exceptional circumstances to which I am about to refer, that an agreement of this kind is a personal agreement in this sense, that the introduction is to be an introduction to the purchaser, to the person who is the party to the agreement. It was thought by two great judges, Lord Eldon and Lord Langdale, that any agreement by one doctor to sell for money a recommendation of his patients to another was not compatible with the policy of the law (see Allan on Goodwill, p. 49). In 1803, however, a case of this kind was referred by Lord Eldon to the Court of King\u2019s Bench in the case of an attorney and that Court certified to the Lord Chancellor that the agreement was valid (Bunn v. Guy[4]). It seems plain that the judges in dealing with this subject were influenced by the circumstance that a contrary decision would have upset a great many arrangements which people made and acted upon. I have seen no case, however, in which it has been held that the law would sanction an agreement between a physician \u201cA\u201d with a physician \u201cB\u201d that he, \u201cA,\u201d would recommend his patients in consideration of a sum paid to him to any physician that \u201cB\u201d might name. However that may be, in my opinion this contract was a personal contract. The purchaser contracts ex facie as the real and only principal and there is nothing in the context to indicate a contrary intention. Furthermore, the circumstances of the case preclude the appellant from asserting that he was entitled to enforce the respondent\u2019s rights under the contract. It was well known to both of them that Dr. Cowan entered into the agreement in the full belief that the respondent was contracting with him as the only principal, and in particular in the full belief that he was not contracting as the agent of the appellant. In the circumstances, the appellant could not have enforced the contract as a principal (Ferrand v. Bischoffsheim[5]). Still again, the proposition we are considering is really based on the assumption that the appellant and the respondent were inducing Dr. Cowan to enter into the contract by industrious concealment in circumstances which imparted to that concealment the character of misrepresentation. It is not open to the appellant to base his case upon his own wrong; he cannot set up a relationship in support of his claim which rests upon fraud upon third parties (Jackson v. Duchaire[6]).\nSome attempt was made to draw a distinction between the contract of the 5th of November, 1929, and the subsequent agreement to pay $250 for office furniture and equipment. What I have said applies equally to both agreements.\nIt should, perhaps, be added that Dr. Cowan\u2019s patients were introduced and recommended to the respondent by Dr. Cowan; that they were never introduced or recommended to the appellant, and, moreover, it was definitely understood between them that it was an essential condition to the success of the plan that the arrangement between the appellant and the respondent should be kept secret. The appellant insisted upon this more than once in his evidence and there can be no possible doubt about it. The patients whom the respondent treated in the course of his practice were his patients. Both parties agreed that it was most important that no suspicion should arise that the appellant had any connection with the respondent\u2019s practice. Under the agreement of the 31st of October, therefore, the appellant acquired the right to be paid the respondent\u2019s earnings from his practice in Wallaceburg during the period mentioned less ten per cent. of the proceeds, after the deduction of $300 a month for the respondent and the expenses of the practice, the appellant guaranteeing the allowance of $300. The sole consideration for this agreement that the appellant should be paid the net proceeds of the practice was, in fact, the sum of $1,500 subsequently paid by him to the respondent to enable the respondent to acquire Dr. Cowan\u2019s practice and the equipment of his office. The respondent has not desired to raise any question as to the appellant\u2019s right to be paid the net proceeds of his practice during the term of this first agreement and it is, therefore, unnecessary to consider whether the appellant acquired any enforceable right in this respect.\nAs to the covenant not to practise for ten years without the sanction of the appellant in the area mentioned, the validity of which is disputed, I shall discuss that in a moment. Mr. Cartwright argued that the covenant by the respondent to \u201cpractise for\u201d the appellant for the specified period made the practice of the respondent that of the appellant in the sense, at all events, that the appellant was entitled at the expiration of the period to call upon the respondent to introduce and recommend his patients to him.\nNow it is not disputed, and it is overwhelmingly evidenced by the conduct of the parties, that they did not in entering into this agreement contemplate the establishment of any such relationship between them as that of a partnership; that is to say, what is ordinarily understood as a partnership between medical men, or that of principal and assistant. It is a common enough thing for a doctor to have an assistant who is known to the world as his assistant, and the patients expect and take the consequences of that relationship, and so with regard to partnership. I am unable to agree, however, that the agreement now before us contemplates any such relationship between the parties. The agreement must be read in the light of the circumstances just mentioned, the necessity for secrecy with regard to the arrangement between them, the fact that this arrangement had been concealed with great care from Dr. Cowan, the manifest and admitted intention, because this was essential to the success of the appellant\u2019s design, that the respondent should appear before the world as the rival practitioner of the appellant. Obviously a secret arrangement between the respondent and the appellant by which as servant, or agent, or partner, or contractor, the appellant had any right to exercise any control over the respondent in his manner of practising medicine and, above all, to possess himself of the confidences acquired by the respondent from his patients in the course of and in connection with his practice would be a base fraud upon the respondent\u2019s patients, some of whom, it is highly probable to the knowledge of the parties, would have been shocked at the possibility that their doctor had any such relationship with the appellant. The truth is that the appellant was only concerned about one thing and that is the profits from the practice. The respondent was to practise \u201cfor\u201d him in a very real sense, that is to say, to enable him to acquire the pecuniary benefits provided for by the agreement. I am satisfied that the relation of principal and agent, or trustee and cestui que trust, never arose. The relationship was one of debtor and creditor. If there was any vinculum juris which the appellant could have invoked against the resistance of the respondent, it was that of debtor and creditor. The respondent agreed with the appellant that he should practise medicine in Wallaceburg for three years and that the earnings received by him should be divided in the manner therein provided for.\nTurning then to the covenant, with which the agreement concludes, it is in these words:\u2014\nThe party of the second part also agrees not to practise in or within twenty miles of the town of Wallaceburg without the consent of the party of the first part under penalty of $10,000 as liquidated damages before May 1st, 1939.\nIt is, of course, well settled law that such a covenant as this in gross would be contrary to public policy and unenforceable. It seems equally clear that such a covenant is not valid and enforceable as subsidiary to the contract of the 31st of October when properly understood as a contract; that is to say, binding the respondent to practise medicine for three years and to pay to the appellant a share of his earnings, there being no contract of partnership, no relationship of master and servant, no contract of sale and purchase, nothing but a payment of $1,500 by the appellant in consideration of which the respondent is bound to practise for three years and pay the appellant ninety per cent. of his net earnings. The purpose of the appellant is, of course, plain. At the expiration of the three-year period the respondent would be in his clutches and could only continue to practise in Wallaceburg upon any terms the appellant might dictate, and so on at the expiration of any and every further period.\nAs regards the agreement we have been considering, the respondent, as already observed, does not deny his responsibility under it. The Court of Appeal has held that all moneys owing have been paid. The appellant sues on two other agreements, dated respectively the 17th of April, 1933, and the 6th of September, 1935. It is well, perhaps, to note in passing that the appellant sues on these two written agreements as well as on two promissory notes, dated respectively the 1st of January, 1934, and the 1st of May, 1935. The promissory notes were given in settlement of moneys supposed to be payable under these agreements. It seems very plain to me that there was no consideration for either of the agreements. The covenant not to practise without consent of the appellant in the agreement of 1929 was void in law for the reasons mentioned. At the expiration of the three-year period under that agreement, the appellant had nothing to give the respondent. The moneys paid to the respondent to pay Dr. Cowan were paid in order to get rid of Dr. Cowan, pursuant to the appellant\u2019s design. Dr. Cowan\u2019s covenant was personal to the respondent, and the appellant, for the reasons given, cannot get the benefit of that covenant by alleging the fraud on Dr. Cowan in order to establish a trust. The respondent was free to practise in Wallaceburg.\nI agree with the Court of Appeal that the agreement whereby fifty per cent. of the respondent\u2019s net earnings were to go to the appellant was entirely without consideration.\nThe covenant not to practise without the consent of the appellant is void in law for reasons similar to those already given in respect of the covenant in the first agreement.\nMr. Cartwright contends that there is consideration on four grounds: (1) Tiffin had his office rent free. (2) He had the use of the equipment. (3) He got his medicines paid for out of the receipts from the practice during the first three years. (4) At the termination of the first contract there was a compromise of a doubtful claim in respect of the respondent\u2019s right to practise. And he also argues that the respondent is estopped from denying the existence of consideration.\nAs to the estoppel, it is based upon payments made by the respondent when ignorant of his rights. I am quite unable to discover here the elements of estoppel. The respondent no doubt thought that the second and third agreements were legally binding upon him when he made those payments, as probably the appellant also did, but it is going a little too far, I think, to suggest that the appellant was in any way misled by what the respondent did, or that anything the respondent did in any way affected the appellant\u2019s course of conduct. The appellant acted, I have no doubt, entirely upon his own view of his own rights. There was mutual mistake, which is not without its bearing upon one point in the appeal, although, as Mr. Justice Middleton points out, it is not a mistake of such a character as entitles the respondent to recover back moneys already paid, because there the rule which distinguishes between the mistake of law and the mistake of fact is rigorously applied and mistake of law, or of mixed law and fact, is not sufficient, even although it is mistake as to particular private rights. That disposes of point number five on this matter of consideration.\nAs to point number four, there was no compromise of a doubtful claim; no such claim was made and no dispute arose of which there could be a compromise.\nAs to the equipment and the medicines taken over from Dr. Cowan, the appellant is precluded from alleging they were his for the reasons given, and at the trial no point was made as to their existence at the date of the second agreement. As to the medicines purchased subsequently, as well as equipment, they were the respondent\u2019s, being paid for out of his earnings.\nAs to the office, as well as the furniture and equipment, the evidence is that the whole building was rented by the respondent at a rent of $42 a month and partly sub-let by him, as the appellant admits.\nQ. Or about the time of second agreement; early in May, 1933?\u2014A. I can\u2019t tell you the date.\nQ. Just about the time the first agreement expired?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And about that time he took over the whole building and paid you $42 a month for it, from that time after?\u2014A. Yes.\nIndeed the appellant admits that the rent of the office would be chargeable to expenses under the first agreement. There is nothing in either of the agreements sued upon as to the occupation of the office. There is not a word about it in the documents, and the transaction by which the respondent rented the whole building at $42 a month must be taken to be an independent transaction. In my view of these documents, there is nothing in them by which the appellant had legal right to control the respondent in the selection of his office. There is an express stipulation that the respondent is to continue the practice of medicine in Wallaceburg, but there is not a word about the situation of his office. Furthermore, these agreements state explicitly what the consideration is and the net result of the stipulations is that the respondent is to pay to the appellant his net earnings from the practice of medicine in Wallaceburg for the period mentioned, after deducting all necessary expenses.\nIn an action on this agreement by one party against the other it is not competent to go outside the writing to find consideration for the promise relied upon. The agreement is within the fourth section of the Statute of Frauds and the memorandum in writing must show the consideration. The agreement, therefore, cannot be supported by any consideration which does not sufficiently appear from the memorandum. The action is upon the written agreement and there is no suggestion of quantum meruit in the pleadings. Part performance has obviously no application to an agreement such as this.\nAs to the promissory notes, they do not advance the matter. The appellant\u2019s position is that he sues upon a promise given without consideration by the respondent to pay moneys to him. The production of the promissory notes establishes undoubtedly a prima facie right in the appellant to recover on those notes; that is to say, there is a presumption they were given for a valid consideration. But the whole of the facts are before us and the only possible consideration was money supposed to be owing to the appellant by the respondent under his promises given without consideration. A promise to pay money unenforceable because not supported by a valid consideration can, itself, be no consideration for a promise to pay these sums, whether in the form of a promissory note, or in any other form.\nThere is another way in which the point can be put. There can be no doubt that both parties believed that the amounts mentioned in the promissory notes were at the dates of those notes, respectively, due and owing by the respondent to the appellant. This mistaken belief was the direct and immediate cause of the making and delivery of the promissory notes by the respondent to the appellant. It was the common mistake of both parties and it was the whole basis of the agreement embodied in the promissory notes. This belief, as will appear from what has been said, was a mistaken belief, and the promissory notes are unenforceable, because by reason of this belief they were void. The mistake was a mistake in respect of particular private rights involving the application of general principles of law to the facts; a mistake due to ignorance in respect of a right which both parties supposed to exist. On the principle of Cooper v. Phibbs[7], and cases which have followed it, such a mistake vitiates the contract, or the instrument under which it is given (Pollock, p. 445; 23 Halsbury, 2nd edition, p. 131). This sort of mistake is not the basis of a right to recover back money as paid under a mistake of fact, for there the mistake must be one of pure fact and not of mixed fact and law (Halsbury, p. 166; Pollock, p. 460).\nReturning to the allegation that the respondent in contracting with Dr. Cowan was contracting as his agent:\nWhere it appears that the object of such contract or transaction was to defraud third persons, whether specific individuals, or the public in general, or a class or section of the community,\nthe Court will treat the transaction as void (23 Halsbury, 2nd edition, p. 124).\nIn Farmers\u2019 Mart Ltd. v. Milne[8], Lord Dunedin says:\u2014\nNow taking it upon Scotch authority first, before coming to English authority, I find that the matter is very clearly dealt with, as it always is, by Mr. Bell in his \u201cPrinciples.\u201d After stating that there are such things as illegal and immoral contracts, he deals in s. 37 with contracts void at common law. He first sets forth contracts properly immoral, contra bonos mores, then certain rules as to pactum illicitum, and so on, and then he says this: \u201cContracts for indecent or mischievous purposes or considerations, or prejudicial or offensive to the public or to third parties, or inconsistent with public law or arrangements are invalid.\u201d * * * My Lords, I have so far kept only to Scotch authority. In English authority the matter is dealt with in precisely the same way. I note in the admirable work on Contracts by Sir Frederick Pollock, 8th ed., p. 292, that he expresses the matter in almost the same terms as Mr. Bell, where he says, \u201cAn agreement will generally be illegal, though the matter of it may not be an indictable offence, and though the formation of it may not amount to the offence of conspiracy, if it contemplates any civil injury to third persons.\u201d Leake on Contracts, p. 593:\nContracts made for the purpose of defrauding or injuring third parties are illegal and void; as a contract to publish a book with a title-page containing a false statement of the authorship, in fraud of the public; the sale of a fictitious patent right, the buyer to promote a company to work it, as being a fraud upon the intended shareholders; or the sale of mining and other properties at fictitious prices for the purpose of forming companies to buy them; or an agreement between two or more persons by means of fictitious purchases to induce intending buyers, contract to the fact, to believe that there is a market for shares, and that the shares are of greater value than is really the case.\nThe principle of these passages is not limited to contracts. \u201cThe Court will not interfere to protect the use of a deceptive trade mark\u201d on the principle ex turpi causa non oritur actio. (Kerly on Trade Marks, p. 486).\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRINFRET J.\u2014I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial with costs to the appellant throughout.\nDAVIS J.\u2014I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial with costs to the appellant throughout. As I differ somewhat from the grounds upon which the learned trial judge reached his conclusion, I shall state as briefly as I can my view of the case.\nThe respondent, Dr. Tiffin, a duly qualified physician, graduated from Queen\u2019s University in 1928 and after doing interne work until some time in the middle of 1929 (he was then only twenty-five years of age), went to Merlin, a small place in western Ontario (near the town of Wallaceburg) where he had been as an undergraduate in the summer of 1928. Shortly thereafter he was induced by the appellant, Dr. Richardson, who had been admitted to practice in 1913 and who had been practising the last ten years in Wallaceburg, a place of about 5,000 population, to take up practice there. A third doctor, a Dr. Cowan, was retiring from practice in Wallaceburg (he had been in practice there for seven or eight years and had a very extensive practice) and Dr. Richardson suggested to the young Dr. Tiffin that he take over Dr. Cowan\u2019s practice in Wallaceburg. Dr. Richardson had had an assistant with him up until July of 1929. Just what the motive was that led Dr. Richardson to induce Dr. Tiffin to go to Wallaceburg and take over Dr. Cowan\u2019s practice is not shewn other than it was expected that it would result to their mutual advantage.\nThere may be something in the suggestion that Dr. Cowan would not have sold his practice to Dr. Richardson; there may have been some unfriendliness between the two doctors. At any rate the young doctor, the respondent, apparently had no money and Dr. Richardson gave him the money to buy \u201cthe practice,\u201d together with the office equipment and medical supplies, steel operating table, desk, safe, chairs for the wating room, stove\u2014\u201d all that you would use in the way of ordinary equipment and for an office, and a considerable quantity of medicines,\u201d from Dr. Cowan. That took a sum of $1,500. It is not suggested that this sum was as such a loan or as such to be repaid. (The agreement between Dr. Cowan and Dr. Tiffin was dated November 5th, 1929.)\nNow the location of Dr. Cowan\u2019s office in Wallaceburg was obviously of real importance to any young doctor taking over the practice. The office was in residential property; but Dr. Cowan did not own the property\u2014he had been a tenant. And so Dr. Richardson purchased the property from its then owner so as to have the same office available for Dr. Tiffin. Counsel informed us that the price was about $5,000. The evidence is not explicit on the point but apparently it was a dwelling house that had been made into two living apartments separate from the doctor\u2019s office.\nThe young doctor had pressed Dr. Richardson in their negotiations in October, 1929, to what would appear to be a very good financial arrangement for a very recent graduate in medicine of twenty-five years of age. Dr. Tiffin asked and obtained a definite guarantee of $300 a month over and above expenses, together with ten per cent. of earnings in excess of the salary and the expenses. Even gasolene and oil for use in his motor car were included in expenses. A memorandum of the arrangement between them was put in writing on October 31st, 1929. It was for three years from the time Dr. Tiffin could take over Dr. Cowan\u2019s practice, which was anticipated as it actually happened to be, May 1st, 1930. Dr. Tiffin at the trial was asked as to the character of his practice during the first couple of years. He said that in a financial way it was very small. Asked as to how near he got to $300 a month and expenses during the first two years, his answer was, \u201cWell, I was beginning to approach it at the end of the second year.\u201d\nThe arrangement was carried out for the three years and at its expiration another memorandum of agreement was made between Dr. Richardson and Dr. Tiffin. This was on April 17th, 1933. By this memorandum Dr. Tiffin agreed to continue the practice of medicine in Wallaceburg to May 1st, 1936 (another three-year period) \u201cin his own name and with the same good will and co-operation between the parties as has existed in the past.\u201d The prior arrangement for a fixed salary and expenses and a ten per centum share of net earnings gave way to a fifty per cent. division of the net profits. At the date of the making of this second agreement the two doctors went over the books and settled the balance then due to Dr. Richardson, on the basis of the actual moneys that had come in, up to that time, at $816.53. The second agreement had provided that all moneys that might be paid in thereafter by the patients from time to time were first to be applied on accounts owing by them up to May 1st, 1933, and were to be divided on the basis of the share division which governed the first agreement.\nDr. Tiffin after the second agreement made monthly returns to Dr. Richardson regarding the earnings of the practice and from time to time made payments of money on account to Dr. Richardson. The payments did not equal the amounts to which Dr. Richardson was entitled, as shewn by the returns, and on January 1st, 1934, the doctors went over the accounts and made a settlement. There was a balance of over $3,000 in favour of Dr. Richardson, and Dr. Tiffin handed over to him some shares of stock in the Dominion Sugar Company of a then value of $1,185, and to cover the balance gave Dr. Richardson his demand note for $2,108.10. Subsequently, on May 1st, 1935, the doctors again settled their accounts and at that time there was a further balance owing to Dr. Richardson amounting to $1,368.16 (over and beyond the $2,108.10 note that had not been paid) and Dr. Tiffin gave Dr. Richardson at that time another promissory note for the balance as then settled upon, $1,368.16. The second agreement would not have expired until April 30th, 1936, but on September 6th, 1935, the doctors made another agreement. The written memorandum was in exactly the same language as the second memorandum except that the period for the continuance of the arrangement was fixed until the 1st of May, 1939, which would be three years from the expiration of the then existing agreement. Dr. Tiffin again agreed to continue the practice of medicine \u201cin his own name and with the same good will and co-operation between the parties as has existed in the past.\u201d Dr. Tiffin continued under these arrangements year after year from May 1st, 1930, until at least September, 1937. He kept making his monthly returns to Dr. Richardson regularly up to May 31st, 1937; the last payment was made June 19th, 1937. Dr. Tiffin, asked by the trial judge:\nQ. Why did you stop making payments in 1937?\nreplied:\nDr. Richardson\u2019s daughter went away for the summer, and before she was available again to make any more, Dr. Richardson came back himself in September, at which time I had a conversation with him, but we were not able to reach a settlement, and I got legal advice at that time.\nThen follow in the evidence these questions and answers under cross-examination:\nQ. When Dr. Richardson did come back in September, 1937, he did go to see you and asked you to make a settlement with him, didn\u2019t he?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did he not mention at that time the fact you owed him these two notes?\nA. At that time I think so, yes; he mentioned the whole thing.\nQ. And he asked you for payment of the notes, along with balances due for these payments?\nA. Yes.\nThe evidence is not precise as to how long Dr. Tiffin continued to carry on his practice in the building that Dr. Richardson had acquired and in which Dr. Cowan had had his office, but it is plain that Dr. Tiffin moved in on May 1st, 1930, and continued there until about July, 1937. It must be said that Dr. Tiffin, with much loyalty to Dr. Richardson, lived up to the terms of the agreements for over seven years and there is no suggestion on his part that Dr. Richardson did not give him at the same time the good will and co-operation agreed upon. Dr. Richardson at the trial stated that he had assisted and co-operated with Dr. Tiffin in the latter\u2019s working up of the practice; that he turned over patients from time to time to Dr. Tiffin and to him alone; that in cases such as confinements, after a certain period he would turn them over to Dr. Tiffin. There is not the slightest evidence from Dr. Tiffin that that was not so. It seems to me to have been a pity that Dr. Tiffin was legally advised, if he was as he so states, in September, 1937, to repudiate the agreements and the promissory notes and to deny any liability to Dr. Richardson. But whether he was given any such legal advice or not, he refused thereafter to recognize any claim of Dr. Richardson either on the promissory notes or under the agreements. Accordingly Dr. Richardson issued the writ in this action, on November 7th, 1938, claiming payment of the two notes with interest, and an accounting.\nDr. Tiffin pleaded that the second and third agreements (those of April 17th, 1933, and September 6th,1935) were nuda pacta \u201cand fail wholly for want of any consideration\u201d and that he had paid Dr. Richardson more money than he was entitled to under the first agreement. Dr. Tiffin further pleaded, with respect to the second and third agreements, that Dr. Richardson\u2019s name had been stricken off the Registry under the Medical Act (the date was October, 1935) and for that reason, even if the second and third agreements had been valid and subsisting agreements, that they had duly come to an end for the reason that Dr. Richardson could not then legally continue the practice of medicine himself. As to the promissory notes, Dr. Tiffin in his pleading took the position that in so far as one or both of them may originally have covered moneys owing under the first of the three agreements, they had been fully paid, and in so far as they may have covered moneys under the second and third agreements, no consideration was given for the said notes by Dr. Richardson and for that reason no moneys were owing thereunder. Dr. Tiffin further pleaded the Medical Act and the Statute of Frauds and further, by amendment at the trial, that the second and third agreements were null and void as being in restraint of trade, and that by reason of the restrictions therein contained all three agreements were \u201cunfair, oppressive and tyrannous\u201d and ought not to be enforced. Dr. Tiffin counter-claimed for the return of $3,177.71 which he claimed to have been overpaid by him under the first agreement, and for a declaration of the Court that the second and third agreements were never valid and subsisting agreements and never at any time became effective, and for the return of the two promissory notes for cancellation.\nThis may be a convenient place to refer to the restrictive covenants. In the first agreement the covenant was in these words:\nThe party of the second part (Dr. Tiffin) also agrees not to practice in or within twenty miles of the town of Wallaceburg without the consent of the party of the first part (Dr. Richardson) under penalty of $10,000 as liquidated damages before May 1\/1939.\nIn the second agreement the covenant was in these words:\nIn consideration of years of association in the practice of medicine in a similar manner and in further consideration of this agreement and the moneys herein provided the party of the second part (Dr. Tiffin) agrees not to practise medicine directly or indirectly by himself or through any person on his behalf within 25 miles of the Town of Wallaceburg for a period of six years from the date set for the expiration of this agreement, namely, May 1st, 1936.\nIn the third agreement the covenant was in exactly the same language as in the second agreement other than that the period of six years was to run from the date set for the expiration of the third agreement, namely, May 1st, 1939. All the agreements were apparently drawn up by the doctors themselves without the intervention of any solicitor. This probably accounts for the rather loose language in the first agreement, \u201cwhile practising for the party of the first part\u201d and \u201cagrees to practise for the party of the first part to the best of his ability\u201d; and in the second and third agreements the words \u201cagrees to continue the practice of medicine in the town of Wallaceburg for and on behalf of the party of the first part and in his own name.\u201d There is no doubt that the plain intention of the parties, and it was fully carried out, was that Dr. Tiffin would practise by himself and in his own name, and it was only in the sense of sharing the earnings of the practice with Dr. Richardson that these words were used. It may be observed that there was a restrictive covenant in the agreement of November 5th, 1929, between Dr. Cowan and Dr. Tiffin when the former sold his practice to the latter. The covenant there was:\nThe vendor covenants that he will not practise either as a physician or a surgeon or act directly or indirectly as partner or assistant to or with any other physician or surgeon either at the said town of Wallaceburg or elsewhere within twenty miles thereof, under penalty of $5,000.\nMcTague J.A., who tried the case, gave judgment in favour of Dr. Richardson but in view of the evidence as to periodic statements and payments on account he thought it better to give the parties a complete accounting from the beginning, May 1st, 1930. As to the Medical Act, he found that Dr. Richardson did not practise medicine after his name was stricken from the Registry in October, 1935, and that whatever rights he had against Dr. Tiffin arose out of contract, not prohibited in any way, that he could see, by the statute. The trial judge found that the agreements were not without consideration. As to the second and third agreements being invalid on account of the restrictive covenants, the trial judge passed no opinion upon the question of the validity of the covenants because in his view they were in any event severable and did not affect the validity of the other provisions of the agreements. Nothing was said in the reasons or in the formal judgment about the counter-claim.\nUpon appeal by Dr. Tiffin to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that Court allowed the appeal without costs and dismissed both the action and the counter-claim without costs. The majority of that Court took the position that the first agreement was invalid upon the ground that a trust on the part of Dr. Tiffin, which the learned trial judge had found, could not be established, and all the members of that Court decided that the second and third agreements were entirely without consideration. \u201cThe position of affairs is, therefore,\u201d said Middleton J.A., with whom Gillanders J.A. agreed, \u201cthat all moneys that have been paid under these agreements is payment in a mistaken view of the law, and that neither party can recover anything from the other.\u201d Henderson J.A., who dissented in part, took the view the first agreement was valid and he would have given Dr. Richardson a reference, at his own risk as to costs, to ascertain what moneys, if any, were still owing in respect of the three years covered by the first agreement. From that judgment Dr. Richardson appealed to this Court.\nDr. Tiffin did not appeal against the dismissal of his counter-claim.\nCounsel for the respondent, Dr. Tiffin, sought to support the judgment appealed from by a somewhat exhaustive review of many well known decisions on covenants in restraint of trade and on want of consideration. But in my view they had no real application to the facts of this case. Whether or not the restrictive covenants are enforceable is beside the question because if they are unenforceable they are clearly severable. In any case there is nothing in the evidence to support the contention that either the second or the third agreement was made by Dr. Tiffin because of any thought or fear on his part of the enforcement of the restrictive covenant. The only reference at all in the evidence on this point was when Dr. Tiffin was asked in cross-examination as to the third agreement whether he had not been interested in making some bargain with Dr. Richardson to prevent being restrained at the end of the second three-year period from practising in Wallaceburg. His answer was: \u201cHe (that is, Dr. Richardson) made that bargain.\u201d Dr. Tiffin added that he had been dissatisfied with the proposed extension to May, 1941, and he changed it to May, 1939, and then signed. While I cannot agree with the learned trial judge that a trust was created by the first agreement, I think the simple statement of the facts throughout shows that there was consideration for all three agreements. We are not concerned with the adequacy of the consideration. So far as the Medical Act is concerned, Dr. Richardson\u2019s name was not stricken from the Registry until October, 1935, and in any case it was the earnings from Dr. Tiffin\u2019s practice, carried on by himself in his own name alone, which were covered by the agreements.\nThe defence to the action had, in my view, no merit in fact and no foundation in law. I would therefore allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial with costs to the appellant both of the appeal to the Court of Appeal and of the appeal to this Court. KERWIN J.\u2014The facts in the present case are set forth in the reasons for judgment of the trial judge, Mr. Justice McTague, and the most important of them are referred to by Mr. Justice Henderson in the Court of Appeal. I do not delay, therefore, to repeat them in detail.\nThe first agreement between the parties, who were medical practitioners, is admitted by each to be valid and binding. By it the appellant (plaintiff) was to pay the respondent (defendant) three hundred dollars per month for thirty-six months, together with the necessary expenses connected with the practice of medicine, and also ten per cent. of the receipts from that practice, after payment of all expenses including the monthly salary: the respondent was to practise for that period for the appellant. The appellant paid to the respondent fifteen hundred dollars, which was used by the latter to purchase the practice and goodwill of a Dr. Cowan, together with certain of the latter\u2019s equipment. The appellant also purchased the premises in which Dr. Cowan had practised, and the respondent continued to practise there, using the said equipment down to the time he repudiated any obligations towards the appellant. The appellant claims there is a balance due him under that agreement, while the respondent claims to have overpaid.\nThe second agreement, dated April 17th, 1933, provides that the respondent would continue the practice for and on behalf of the appellant and that the latter would pay the respondent fifty per cent. of the net profits of the practice for three years. It is alleged that this agreement is not enforceable by virtue of that part of section 4 of the Statute of Frauds (R.S.O., 1937, c. 146) which provides that no action shall be brought upon any agreement that is not to be performed within the space of one year from the making thereof. The precise contention is that if any consideration existed, it did not appear in the written document. The promise of the appellant to pay the respondent is sufficient to dispose of this contention without reference to the other items of consideration suggested by the appellant.\nBy entering into the first agreement, the respondent undertook, in effect, that he would, at its expiration, turn over to the appellant the practice which he had been enabled to commence with the appellants money, unless some new agreement was entered into. The new agreement being valid to the extent indicated, the respondent is bound to account to the appellant in accordance with its terms.\nIn addition to the same defences being raised against the third agreement entered into by the parties on September 6th, 1935, the respondent sets up that, due to the fact that at the times that agreement became operative and the action was commenced, the appellant\u2019s registration under the Ontario Medical Act had been cancelled, the appellant cannot compel an accounting from the respondent because of sections 47 and 50 of that Act. I agree with the view of the trial judge that the appellant did not contravene these sections.\nThere was no material alteration in the second and third agreements by reason of the affixing of seals by the appellant on his own duplicates. In any event, no alteration was made in the duplicates in the possession of the respondent, and upon them the appellant is entitled to rely. It is unnecessary to express any opinion as to the validity of the restrictive covenants and that question should be left for determination when it arises. I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial, with costs throughout.\nI cannot part with the case without referring again to the respondent\u2019s plea of section 4 of the Statute of Frauds. The mere fact that it was thought advisable to set up this defence indicates to me, at least, that it is high time that steps be taken to consider the advisability of repealing the section. The Law Revision Committee in England in its sixth interim report (May, 1937) has already made a recommendation to that effect.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Smith, Rae, Greer & Cartwright.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fraser & Burgess.\n[1] [1939] O.R. 444; [1939] 3 D.L.R. 301.\n[2] [1939] O.R. 444, at 444-448.\n[3] (1882) 20 Chancery Division 705, at 718.\n[4] (1803) 4 East 190.\n[5] (1858) 4 C.B., N.S., 710, at 717.\n[6] (1790) 3 Term Reports 551.\n[7] (1867) L.R. 2 H.L. 149.\n[8] [1915] A.C. 106, at 112, 113.\n"

Cartwright (Defendants) Respondents.\n1940: March 18, 19; 1940: June 29.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Crocket, Davis and Kerwin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nReal property\u2014Action for reconveyance of land\u2014Claim by defendant in respect of improvements made thereon\u2014Right to relief\u2014Parties\u2014Joinder of defendant\u2019s wife as party defendant.\nUnder an arrangement between the executors of a deceased\u2019s will and C., the executors delivered a deed of conveyance (absolute in form but not intended to operate as an absolute conveyance) of certain land of deceased\u2019s estate to C., who, pursuant to the arrangement, mortgaged the land and turned over the proceeds to the executors for use in the administration of the estate. C. was given an option to purchase, but if he did not exercise it within the time fixed he was to reconvey the land to the executors. C. did not exercise the option as such; but, bona fide believing, though erroneously (as found at trial and by this Court), that the result of certain later negotiations was (or, per Davis J., was so close to as to make practically certain) a sale to him of the land, made considerable improvements thereon. He resisted the present action for a reconveyance, and alternatively claimed in respect of the improvements.\nHeld: (1) C. must reconvey the land and account as to rents, profits, etc.\n(2) C. should be paid from the estate such amount as the land had been enhanced in value by said improvements.\n(3) The action as against C.\u2019s wife, who, on the claim for reconveyance, had been made a defendant, should be dismissed.\nPer Crocket and Kerwin JJ.: The facts that C. had had the legal title in himself (though subsequently transferred to the mortgagee), and bona fide believed that he had become the purchaser, under which belief he made the improvements, brings him within s. 36 of The Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 152.\nPer Davis J.: Good faith (found to exist in this case) is at the basis and of the essence of a claim for compensation in respect of improvements such as those made by C. Plaintiff\u2019s action was plainly a claim for an equitable right in the land (the legal estate had been conveyed to C. for the purpose of putting on the mortgage and had then passed to and remained in the mortgagee, and it was the beneficial ownership that plaintiff sought to be established), and the relief given to C. in respect of the improvements was one which a court of equity had the power to give under all the facts and circumstances of the case. C.\u2019s wife could have no right to dower in the land, which was held by C. in trust for deceased\u2019s estate (the only basis upon which a reconveyance to the estate was sought), and therefore (on the plaintiff\u2019s own claim) was not a necessary party. APPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which allowed the appeals of the defendants H.L. Cartwright and Vera A. Cartwright from the judgment of Makins J. at trial.\nThe plaintiff and the defendant A.D. Cartwright are the executors of the will of Frances Jane Cartwright, deceased. The plaintiff sued for an order that the defendants H.L. Cartwright and Vera A. Cartwright (wife of the defendant H.L. Cartwright) do reconvey certain land to said executors in accordance with a certain agreement of February 16, 1932 (between the executors and H.L. Cartwright), and for an accounting from the defendant H.L. Cartwright of all moneys, rents or profits received by him from or in connection with said land. The defendant H.L. Cartwright pleaded that an option of purchase contained in said agreement had been exercised by him and that a subsequent agreement, in June, 1935, had been made providing for payment of the balance due by him on the purchase price, and alternatively that in or about May, 1935, an agreement had been made for sale to him of the land; that, relying on the agreement made in 1935, he, with the knowledge of plaintiff and his co-executor, had spent large sums of money in improving the property. He asked that the action be dismissed, and alternatively claimed a lien upon the land for the improved value thereof. He counterclaimed for a declaration that the agreement of 1935 is in full force and effect and for specific performance thereof. The defendant Vera A. Cartwright pleaded that at the time when she was married to the defendant H.L. Cartwright the said land was subject to a mortgage and that she had never been in possession of the land, and asked that the action as against her be dismissed.\nThe material facts of the case (as found by this Court) are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported.\nThe trial judge, Makins J., found that there was no binding agreement made in 1935 as alleged by the defendant H.L. Cartwright and that he did not exercise the option for purchase given him in said agreement of 1932, and gave judgment for plaintiff, ordering the defendants H.L. Cartwright and Vera A. Cartwright to reconvey the land to the executors, subject to a certain mortgage for $2,000 (the facts in connection with which are stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported), and directed a reference to take an account and report on all moneys, rents or profits received by the defendant H.L. Cartwright from said land, and ordered that he pay to the executors such amount as should be found due to the estate upon the taking of the account. But he found also that the defendant H.L. Cartwright had acted in good faith in making the improvements, believing that he had or would have an agreement for sale of the land to him; and the trial judge directed a reference to ascertain by what amount, if any, the land had been enhanced in value by the said improvements, and made an order for payment to said defendant of such amount.\nThe defendants H.L. Cartwright and Vera A. Cartwright appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and the plaintiff cross-appealed against the order in respect of the improvements. The Court of Appeal found and declared that on or about June 1, 1935, an agreement was made whereby the defendant H.L. Cartwright became the purchaser of the land from the executors; and allowed said defendants\u2019 appeals and dismissed the action; and dismissed plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal.\nThe plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The defendant H.L. Cartwright cross\u2011appealed for a declaration that a certain alleged agreement made on or about July 18, 1935, was a valid and subsisting agreement.\nR.L. Kellock K.C. for the appellant.\nH.L. Cartwright for himself and Vera A. Cartwright, respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I concur in the conclusions agreed upon by my brothers Davis and Kerwin as follows:\u2014\nThe appeal is allowed and the judgment at the trial restored with a variation by striking out the words \u201cand Vera A. Cartwright\u201d in the paragraph numbered 1 thereof and by adding a new paragraph numbered 12 thereto:\n\u201cThis Court doth further order and adjudge that the action as against Vera A. Cartwright be dismissed with costs.\u201d\nThe cross-appeal is dismissed without costs. The appellant R.C. Cartwright will have as against the respondent H.L. Cartwright his costs of the appeal to this Court and of the appeal to the Court of Appeal but is to pay the respondent H.L. Cartwright the costs of the cross-appeal to the Court of Appeal.\nThere will be no costs to or against A.D. Cartwright in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. Vera A. Cartwright is entitled to her costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court. The motion of the respondent H.L. Cartwright for leave to adduce further evidence is dismissed without costs.\nRINFRET J.\u2014The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at the trial restored with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Crocket and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014It was quite frankly stated in argument before us on behalf of H.L. Cartwright that he had considered he was dealing not with two trustees but with two executors, one of whom would be able to bind the estate, and that on that basis he thought he had made a definite agreement with A.D. Cartwright on the occasion of his telephone conversation with the latter on or about June 1st, 1935. That would dispose of any suggestion that he had determined to exercise the option but, even without that statement at bar, I find it impossible to agree with the Court of Appeal that H.L. Cartwright became the purchaser of the land at the option price.\nThe trial judge found that H.L. Cartwright had acted bona fide. With that I agree, and in my opinion H.L. Cartwright thought he had a concluded bargain with the estate through A.D. Cartwright, and upon that supposition proceeded to make the improvements. Having had the legal title in himself (although subsequently transferred to the first mortgagee), and bona fide believing that he had become the purchaser, brings him, in my opinion, within section 36 of The Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, R.S.O., 1937, chapter 152. The improvements were made under the belief that the land was his,\u2014subject only, of course, to the payment of the purchase price. A person who mistakenly believes that he has concluded an agreement to purchase the land and who acts bona fide is \u201cunder the belief that the land is his own.\u201d In Montreuil v. Ontario Asphalt Co.[1], the Company was in possession under a lease and had not exercised an option to purchase, and the case is quite distinguishable from the present.\nVera A. Cartwright was not a necessary party and the action against her should be dismissed with costs. With this variation, the judgment at the trial should be restored.\nThe appellant R.C. Cartwright should have as against the respondent H.L. Cartwright his costs of the appeals to this Court and the Court of Appeal but should pay H.L. Cartwright the costs of the cross-appeal to the Court of Appeal. The cross-appeal to this Court should be dismissed without costs. There should be no costs to or against A.D. Cartwright in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. Vera A. Cartwright is entitled to her costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court. The motion for leave to adduce further evidence should be dismissed without costs.\nDAVIS J.\u2014It is unfortunate that this family litigation should have gone without an amicable settlement. The judgment of the Court of Appeal might well have been accepted by the parties as a fair and reasonable disposition of the matter. But the parties chose to continue their litigation. The appellant (plaintiff) appealed from the judgment to this Court and the respondent H.L. Cartwright (one of the defendants and a plaintiff by counterclaim) gave notice of cross-appeal. The parties insist upon their strict rights and this Court must therefore now endeavour to determine what those rights are.\nThe litigation arises out of a dispute as to the beneficial ownership of a residential property near the city of Kingston in the province of Ontario which comprises some sixty acres of land and is known as \u201cCartwright\u2019s Point\u201d or \u201cThe Maples.\u201d The property was owned at the time of her death in 1920 by the widow of the late Sir Richard Cartwright. By her will she named two of her sons, R.C. Cartwright, the appellant (plaintiff), and A.D. Cartwright, one of the respondents (defendants), to be the executors and trustees, and to them probate was granted. Lady Cartwright by her will devised all her real and personal estate unto her executors and trustees upon trust to sell (subject to certain provisions with which we are not now concerned) with power to postpone sale for as long as they might think fit. Under date of November 30, 1931, the trustees delivered a deed of conveyance of the said property, absolute in form, to the respondent H.L. Cartwright for a consideration expressed on the face of the deed to be $10,000. The said H.L. Cartwright is a grandson of the testatrix and is a solicitor practising in Kingston. His uncle R.C. Cartwright, the appellant, lived in Toronto and his uncle A.D. Cartwright, respondent, lived in Ottawa. It is admitted by all parties that the document was not intended to operate as an absolute conveyance. The executors required money at that time for the continued administration of the estate (twelve years having passed since the death of the testatrix) and, there being no power in the will to borrow, the executors and the grandson H.L. Cartwright adopted the scheme of putting the property into the name of H.L. Cartwright personally so that he might raise money upon it for the purposes of the estate. This improper conduct on the part of the executors was the first step towards the unfortunate position of affairs which now exists. By a collateral agreement in writing dated February 16, 1932, between the executors and H.L. Cartwright it was agreed that H.L. Cartwright would put a mortgage on the property for $2,000 and turn the proceeds over to the executors for use in the administration of the estate. This he did. Subsequent to and in pursuance of this agreement, H.L. Cartwright managed the property and was in receipt of the rents and profits. The agreement further provided that H.L. Cartwright should have an option to purchase the property from the estate at any time during the term of the mortgage at the price of $10,000 \u201cby paying\u201d the difference between the then amount of the outstanding mortgage and the purchase price. But if the option was not exercised within the term of the said mortgage, H.L. Cartwright agreed\nto thereupon reconvey the said property to the said [trustees] on their request in writing so to do and the said property shall thereupon be revested in the said [trustees].\nThe term of the $2,000 mortgage having expired on February 1, 1937, and the respondent H.L. Cartwright having paid nothing to the estate and having refused to comply with a written demand from the trustees to reconvey the property in accordance with the agreement of February 16, 1932, this action was commenced by one of the executors and trustees, R.C. Cartwright, against the said H.L. Cartwright and his wife Vera Cartwright to compel the reconveyance of the lands and premises in question to the estate, free and clear from any encumbrance other than the $2,000 first mortgage above referred to. The other executor and trustee, A.D. Cartwright, though he had joined in a written demand for a reconveyance, did not join in the action and was consequently made a party defendant. Vera Cartwright (who is also a solicitor practising with her husband in Kingston) took the position that the action did not in any way lie against her because at the time she married H.L. Cartwright, February 2, 1935, the lands sought to be recovered were then subject to the $2,000 mortgage and remain so, and that she herself had never been in possession of the lands or of any part of them. Her position was that she had no interest in the property other than an inchoate right of dower, the property at all material times being subject to a mortgage. The other executor and trustee, A.D. Cartwright, as a defendant admitted in his pleading that there was an agreement of purchase and sale and that he on his part had always been ready and willing to carry out the same; although he submitted his rights to the Court he asked that the action be dismissed and that in any event no order as to costs should be made against him.\nThe action went to trial before Makins J. On the evidence it was plain that H.L. Cartwright never paid or tendered any money at any time; in fact he did not contend that he ever exercised the option as such. He testified that he never agreed to purchase the property on the terms of the option, i.e., $8,000 in cash. He did contend, however, that some time in 1935 an agreement was made with the estate whereby he was to become the owner of the property in question. The date when the alleged agreement was made and its terms were left in the vaguest sort of expression. It is difficult to put one\u2019s finger on any particular date or on any particular term of the agreement set up by H.L. Cartwright.\nMakins J. reached the conclusion that no enforceable agreement was ever made by the trustees, on the one hand, and H.L. Cartwright, on the other, for the purchase and sale of the property and the learned judge ordered H.L. Cartwright and his wife Vera Cartwright to reconvey the property to the trustees and directed a reference to take an account of the dealings of H.L. Cartwright with the property.\nEither believing that he had completed arrangements for the purchase of the property or, as more likely appears from the evidence, believing he was so close to the completion of the negotiations then pending as to justify him in proceeding with his plans to improve the property, H.L. Cartwright in June, 1935, had undertaken substantial renovations and improvements to the property which resulted in converting what was a summer house into an all-year-round residence at a cost which appears to have been about $6,000. At that time, on June 12, 1935, he put a second mortgage on the property for $6,000 to raise the money necessary to make the structural changes and improvements. By July 10, 1935, the building operations were substantially completed. Makins J. found that H.L. Cartwright had acted in good faith in expending the money on the property and allowed him on his alternative claim, by way of counterclaim, such sum, if any, as might be found on a reference to the Local Master to be the amount of the enhanced value of the property.\nThe parties then appealed and cross-appealed from that judgment to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. H.L. Cartwright appealed upon the ground that the order against him for a reconveyance of the property should not have been made and, alternatively, that the learned trial judge should have given him a lien on the property for the amount of its enhanced value. Vera Cartwright gave notice that upon the appeal she would contend, upon the ground that she had no interest in the property, that the judgment should be varied by dismissing the action as against her. The plaintiff, while supporting the trial judgment in so far as it ordered the reconveyance of the property, cross-appealed upon the ground that compensation should not have been granted to H.L. Cartwright in respect of the improvements made by him.\nThe Court of Appeal said that the proper conclusion of the whole matter was that \u201con or about June 1st, 1935,\u201d an agreement had been made between H.L. Cartwright and the trustees whereby H.L. Cartwright became the purchaser of the property at the price of $10,000, he to assume the existing mortgage for $2,000 and to be credited with the amount owing thereunder on account of the purchase price. The Court therefore allowed the appeal and dismissed the action, but the Court made no order as to the costs of either the action or of the counterclaim or of the appeal or of the cross-appeal. I venture to think that it was thought that the judgment might be accepted by all parties as a convenient and satisfactory disposition of the matter. But from that judgment the parties appealed and cross-appealed to this Court.\nDealing with the issues strictly, as we are not only invited by the parties but bound to do, I cannot find any evidence of an enforceable agreement for the purchase and sale of the property. In fact I think it very plain on the evidence that there never was any such agreement, and that the trial judge was fully justified in ordering a reconveyance to the estate. It is impossible for me to accept the conclusion that an agreement was made between H.L. Cartwright and the trustees \u201con or about the first day of June, 1935,\u201d when as a matter of fact all the parties had met at Kingston in the office of Mr. Farrell, a solicitor, as late as the 18th day of July, 1935, in an effort to see if some sort of an agreement could not be arrived at and subsequently, on the 22nd of July, Mr. Farrell had drafted an agreement for submission to the parties, an agreement which no one, however, except A.D. Cartwright ever signed. Moreover, the proposed agreement so drafted provided that the estate should sell the property to H.L. Cartwright in consideration of a five-year third mortgage for $5,000\u2014a transaction which the trustees of the property could have no power under the will to enter into. These facts are entirely inconsistent with an enforceable agreement having been made \u201con or about June 1st, 1935\u201d or at any time. I cannot see any escape from the position that H.L. Cartwright is bound to reconvey.\nThe appellant contends further that, notwithstanding that H.L. Cartwright spent probably $6,000 on the property during June and July, 1935, he is not entitled to any compensation in respect of this expenditure. The trial judge, however, found as a fact that H.L. Cartwright had acted in good faith. Good faith is at the basis and of the essence of a claim for compensation in respect of such permanent and substantial improvements to property. With this finding of good faith we cannot interfere. The trial judge gave merely the amount, if any, of the enhanced value of the property; he did not declare a lien upon the property for the amount and this was one of the grounds of the respondent H.L. Cartwright\u2019s appeal to the Court of Appeal. The learned trial judge, no doubt, recognized the difficulty that might lie in his way if he declared a lien for the improvements under sec. 36 of The Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, R.S.O., 1937, ch. 152:\n36. Where a person makes lasting improvements on land, under the belief that the land is his own, he or his assigns shall be entitled to a lien upon the same to the extent of the amount by which the value of the land is enhanced by such improvements; or shall be entitled or may be required to retain the land if the court is of opinion or requires that this should be done, according as may under all circumstances of the case be most just, making compensation for the land, if retained, as the court may direct.\nWhatever may be the full scope of the words \u201cunder the belief that the land is his own\u201d (the provision is a remedial one and should receive \u201csuch fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act.\u201d Sec. 10 of The Interpretation Act), the learned trial judge did not expressly put the compensation upon that ground or under that statute. It seems to me, although he does not say so, that he gave the relief which he thought ought to be given, under all the facts and circumstances, by a court of equity in a suit, such as this action, where a plaintiff claims to be entitled to any equitable estate or right. Sec. 15 (c) of The Judicature Act, R.S.O., 1937, ch. 100. This action was plainly a claim for an equitable right in the land and premises. The trustees had conveyed the legal estate to H.L. Cartwright in November, 1931, for the purpose of putting on the $2,000 mortgage. The legal estate passed from H.L. Cartwright to and remains in the first mortgagee. It was the beneficial ownership in the estate that the appellant (plaintiff) sought to be established in the action.\nThe trustees conveyed the property to the grandson H.L. Cartwright. They put him in possession. He was to have the collection of the rents and profits. He was not asked to pay any rent and he was given the option to purchase. The trustees left the property entirely in his hands for several years. R.C. Cartwright, one of the trustees, lived in Toronto at this time and his brother, the other trustee, A.D. Cartwright, lived in Ottawa at this time. The former left everything in the hands of the latter. Neither of them appears to have taken any interest in the property. A.D. Cartwright undoubtedly was ready and willing at all times to see the property sold by the estate to H.L. Cartwright on almost any terms; he it was who signed the draft agreement of July 22, 1935, to sell the property to H.L. Cartwright for the consideration of a five-year third mortgage of $5,000. A.D. Cartwright undoubtedly created or encouraged the belief in H.L. Cartwright that the latter would be able to enjoy the benefit of the substantial expenditures on the property that he made. H.L. Cartwright fell into the error of regarding his two uncles in relation to the property, not as trustees but as merely executors of the will, and as a result of that error thought as a matter of law that the word or act of A.D. Cartwright was binding upon R.C. Cartwright. A court of equity was not, under all the facts and circumstances of the case, without power to deal with the whole matter just as the trial judge did.\nWhile I think a cautious solicitor would, in an action of this sort, add as a party defendant the wife of the person in possession and asserting ownership of the property, it would be done at the risk of costs. The point is not that the husband did not have the legal estate in the property at the time of his marriage or at any subsequent time. H.L. Cartwright had been holding the property in trust for the estate; that was the only basis upon which a reconveyance to the estate was sought. His wife could have no right to dower in property held by her husband in trust for another, and was not therefore, on the plaintiff\u2019s own claim, a necessary party and the action should have been dismissed as against her.\nI would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the judgment appealed from and restore the judgment at the trial except that the said judgment should be varied by striking out the words \u201cand Vera A. Cartwright\u201d in the paragraph numbered 1 thereof and by adding new paragraph 12 thereto:\u2014\nAnd this Court doth further order and adjudge that the action as against Vera A. Cartwright be dismissed with costs.\nThe cross-appeal should be dismissed without costs.\nThe appellant R.C. Cartwright should have, as against the respondent H.L. Cartwright, his costs of the appeal to this Court and of the appeal to the Court of Appeal, but should pay to the respondent H.L. Cartwright the costs of the cross-appeal to the Court of Appeal. There should be no costs to or against A.D. Cartwright in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. Vera A. Cartwright is entitled to her costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court. The motion of the respondent H.L. Cartwright for leave to adduce further evidence should be dismissed without costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs; judgment at trial restored with a variation.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mason, Foulds, Davidson & Kellock.\nSolicitors for the respondents H.L. Cartwright and Vera A. Cartwright: Cartwright & Cartwright.\nSolicitors for the respondent A.D. Cartwright: Smith, Rae, Greer & Cartwright.\n[1] (1922) 63 Can. S.C.R. 401.\n"

The trial judge held that the contract alleged had been proven, that the appellant had broken it and the respondent was entitled to substantial damages, and that, having found that the appellant company had full knowledge of the circumstances under which the contract was made and that the loss by the respondent of its franchise granted it by the car manufacturers and the consequent destruction of its business and its loss on the sale of the assets were natural and probable results which must have been within the contemplation of the appellant, the trial judge held that the damages should be assessed accordingly. This judgment was affirmed by the appellate court.\nHeld that the appeal should be dismissed and that the respondent was entitled to the damages awarded by the trial judge.\nHadley v.

United Counties Bank ([1920] A.C. 102) discussed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Fisher J.[2] and maintaining the respondent's action for damages for breach of contract.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nAlfred Bull K.C. for the appellant.\nM. A. Manson for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014The facts in this case are stated in the careful judgment of the learned trial judge, Mr. Justice Fisher [3].\nIn October, 1937, and for something like four years before that, the respondents were, under an agreement of November, 1933, the retail distributors, and for some time the wholesale distributors, for the Studebaker Corporation of Canada, who manufacture and sell automobiles. In February, 1934, the appellants and the respondents entered into an agreement by which the appellants undertook to furnish such credit and advance such moneys as might be required from time to time to finance exclusively the respondent's purchases of automobiles and to supply working capital for the respondents' business. Pursuant to this agreement the appellants, during the years 1934, 1935, 1936 and 1937, furnished the respondents with credit and made advances. In the autumn of 1937 the respondents were contemplating the purchase of twenty-six automobiles from the Studebaker Corporation and the appellants agreed unconditionally with the respondents, as the learned trial judge finds, to finance the purchase of these automobiles, and in October of that year the respondents, relying upon this agreement with the appellants, contracted with the Studebaker Corporation to purchase these automobiles and made an agreement with the Vancouver-St. Lawrence Line for the transport of the same to Vancouver by water. In December the automobiles reached Vancouver and the bills of lading, with draft attached, were presented to the respondents for acceptance and payment. The appellants, on being requested to furnish funds for this purpose, pursuant to the agreements of 1934 and October, 1937, refused to do so. The respondents having endeavoured unsuccessfully to arrange elsewhere for funds to meet the draft, the Studebaker Corporation terminated its agreement with the respondents on the 10th of January, 1938, and sold most of the automobiles to persons appointed by the corporation as agents for British Columbia in place of the respondents. The learned trial judge finds that as a result the respondents were obliged to discontinue their business and that its assets had to be sold at a loss. The learned trial judge further finds as follows:\nIn the present case I find that at the time the contract was made as aforesaid in or about the month of October, 1937, the defendant had full knowledge of the circumstances under which the contract was made. The evidence conclusively proves that. The defendant kept in close touch with the plaintiff's business and had actual knowledge of the probable consequences of the breach. In my opinion loss of profits on the automobiles and loss of the plaintiff's franchise with the consequent loss of its business and loss on realization of its assets were under the circumstances natural and probable results which must have been and were within the contemplation of the defendant. The defendant is therefore liable to pay damages to the plaintiff accordingly.\nThe learned judge proceeds:\nI now come therefore to assess the damages and before doing so I pause here to say that I have noted paragraph 25 of the said franchise agreements providing for termination without cause on ten days' notice and I have tried to keep in mind the many contingencies that might have affected the matter. I am satisfied however that substantial damages have been caused to the plaintiff by the defendant's breach of contract as aforesaid and that they can and should be assessed under the headings as hereinafter set out after making allowances, as I have tried to do for contingencies to an extent reasonable in all the circumstances. After careful consideration of the evidence and the argument of counsel I think a fair assessment of the damages is as follows:\nI estimate the damages arising from the loss of profits on twentysix automobiles at $2,000, the damages arising from the loss of the franchise and the consequent loss of the business at $5,000 and the damages arising from the loss on realization of the assets at $1,000. Judgment accordingly in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant for the total damages of $8,000 and costs.\nThe Court of Appeal [4] concurs in the findings and conclusions of the learned trial judge.\nI have no doubt that the law is correctly applied to the facts of this case in this judgment and in that of the Court of Appeal. I think the rule with regard to damages for breach of a contract to advance money is accurately stated in the treatise on damages in Halsbury, 2nd edition, Vol. 10, p. 121, article 153:\u2014\nBut upon breach of a contract to lend money, the additional expense incurred in obtaining the loan elsewhere is a natural result of the breach and may be recovered, or such other substantial damage as was within the contemplation of the parties.\nThis case presents none of the difficulties that sometimes arise, touching the application of the second branch of the rule in Hadley v. Baxendale [5].\nThe appellants were fully aware of the material circumstances. In October when they agreed to finance the proposed purchase, pursuant to the existing agreement of 1934, they must have realized with the knowledge they had, if they gave a thought to the matter, that, if they refused to make the necessary advance on the arrival of the goods in Vancouver and the presentation of the draft, the respondents would be unable to take it up and that the Studebaker Corporation would (probably, if not certainly) sever their relations with the respondents, and that in consequence of such a severance it was highly probable that the respondents would be forced out of business and would suffer the pecuniary loss naturally resulting therefrom. The appeal is hardly an arguable one and should be dismissed with costs. DAVIS J.\u2014The respondent company carried on business in the city of Vancouver as wholesale and retail automobile dealers and distributors; in particular as a distributor for the Studebaker Corporation of Canada, selling and distributing in British Columbia automobiles manufactured by that company under what is commercially called \"a franchise.\"\nThe appellant company carries on a financial business in the city of Vancouver, and in particular the business of financing motor car dealers.\nThe appellant provided the respondent with all moneys required for the financing of the respondent's business from February, 1934, until the events occurred which are complained of in this action. It is admitted by the respondent that the appellant's approval was necessary before it purchased cars which it expected the appellant to finance. The contract set up in the statement of claim was made verbally in October, 1937, between Don Ingram, the president of the respondent company, and J. W. MacDougall, the manager of the appellant company. MacDougall died a few days after the writ was issued and consequently his evidence was not available. The appellant denied that there was any contract to finance the 27 automobiles referred to in the statement of claim, but owing to the death of MacDougall was unable to offer any evidence to contradict that of Ingram to the effect that such a contract had been made. There was evidence, therefore, upon which the learned trial judge could find as he did that the appellant agreed with the respondent unconditionally to finance the purchase of 27 automobiles. The learned trial judge [6] awarded damages for the breach of this contract at the sum of $8,000. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia but its appeal was dismissed[7]. The appellant then appealed to this Court but only in respect of the amount of damages.\nThe evidence is that Ingram between the 13th and 18th days of October, 1937, interviewed MacDougall and asked him if the appellant would finance the purchase of the cars. The reason the respondent wished to purchase so many cars at once was the imminence of an increase in railway freight rates which was expected on the 1st November, 1937, and the respondent then had an opportunity of bringing the cars by water through the Panama Canal at a rate much lower than the rail rate. Ingram says that MacDougall told him to go ahead and bring the cars in.\nThe cars were shipped in two lots by vessels leaving Montreal on October 30, and November 15, respectively. Ingram says that about the 20th November MacDougall called him on the 'phone and asked him to cancel the shipment of the cars; and that he, Ingram, explained that they could not be shipped back to the factory as the boats were on their way. About a week later MacDougall asked him to call at his office, which he did. He found MacDougall worried; MacDougall thought there was going to be a depression as things were very bad in the East; money was tightening up and the finance companies were very much loaded up with wholesale paper; the dealers had overstocked, and he did not know whether he could finance the cars. He painted a very blue picture, from the information he had acquired in Eastern Canada and the United States. Ingram says that at the conclusion of this interview he consulted his banker, and on his advice he went back to MacDougall and told him that \" we would lose our franchise and be put out of business.\"\nIngram says that MacDougall calmed him down some-what and said that he thought that everything would be all right, but he wanted as much time as he could have to raise the funds, and to leave it with him.\nIngram saw MacDougall again when the first shipment arrived on or about the 7th or 8th December. MacDougall wanted to know how long he could leave the cars on the dock, and Ingram told him up until the 17th December, after which demurrage would be charged. On the 15th December Ingram took the invoice of the cars and the freight bills to MacDougall's office. After a few days MacDougall definitely refused to finance the shipments.\nIngram then endeavoured to obtain the money elsewhere, particularly from other companies in the same line of business. He finally obtained a promise from one of the finance companies (hereinafter for convenience called the new finance company) to take over all the respondent's financing provided an additional $5,000 capital was put into the respondent's business. Ingram endeavoured to raise $5,000, and succeeded in making tentative arrangements to this end, but the basis of the loan was to be a chattel mortgage on the respondent's equipment, and when that was made known to the new finance company a discussion arose as to the terms of repayment of the proposed $5,000 loan. Apparently the new finance company was not satisfied, so Ingram went back to the proposed lender and arranged for twelve months' time within which to pay back the money. The new finance company had to put the proposition before its head office; head office did not think it was a suitable arrangement and declined to take over the financing.\nMacDougall's attitude appears to have been that Ingram should not worry about the matter as the Studebaker Company could not, in his opinion, find another local distributor, and would be forced to take care of the matter itself.\nThe respondent then received a letter dated January 10, 1938, from the Studebaker Corporation cancelling the franchise. After the cancellation of the respondent's franchise a new distributor was appointed, and the respondent was able to sell to him all the new unused cars at cost. price, and the parts in the stock room for the exact money paid to the factory, leaving only the equipment and furnishings, which also were sold to the new distributor for $3,100.\nThe learned trial judge allowed damages on the following basis:\n(a) Loss of profits on 26 automobiles.\n$2,000\n(b) Damages arising from the loss of the franchise and consequent loss of business.\n5,000\n(c) Damages arising from loss on realization of the assets.\n1,000\nThis amount of damages was confirmed by the Court of Appeal. Before this Court counsel for the appellant admitted liability for breach of a contract to loan money but contended that the respondent was not entitled to more than nominal damages or, alternatively, that the damages should have been limited to loss of profits on a re-sale of the motor cars.\nOn a contract to make a loan of money the measure of damages is the loss sustained by the breach. The damages may be merely nominal or at least not greater than the additional sum obliged to be paid for raising the money from some one else. The general rule was well stated by Armour J. in Mennie v. Leitch [8]. But here the respondent couldn't get the money elsewhere and the general rule does not cover the case. The respondent was entitled under the special circumstances to general and substantial damages for the breach of the contract; and the ordinary consequence rule is the only satisfactory test of remoteness. The courts below have agreed upon the amount of the damages and we should not interfere. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014This is an appeal by the defendant, General Securities Limited, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[9] which affirmed the judgment of Fisher J.[10] in favour of the plaintiff, Don Ingram Limited. I take from the reasons for judgment of the trial judge the following statement:\u2014\nThe plaintiff's claim against the defendant is for damages for breach of a contract alleged to have been made in or about the month of October, 1937, between the plaintiff and the defendant for financing the purchase of twenty-six automobiles and the carrying charges thereon from Windsor, Ont., to Vancouver, B.C.\nIt is or must be common ground that in or about the month of October, 1937, and for some four years prior thereto, the plaintiff was the retail distributor, and for part of that time had been also the wholesale\ndistributor, for the Studebaker Corporation of Canada Limited, selling and distributing in the Province of British Columbia or in certain designated portions thereof automobiles manufactured by the said Company, under what may be called franchise agreements with such Company effective upon the 29th day of November, 1933, and amended from time to time thereafter. By an agreement made in or about the month of February, 1934, the defendant agreed with the plaintiff to furnish the necessary credit and to advance such moneys as should be required from time to time to finance exclusively the plaintiff's purchases of automobiles and to supply working capital for the plaintiff's business, and pursuant to such agreement the defendant did during the years 1934, 1935, 1936 and during part of the year 1937 furnish the plaintiff with credit and advanced such moneys as were necessary for the purposes aforesaid.\nThe trial judge found that the contract alleged by the plaintiff had been entered into and the appellant does not now dispute that finding. The question is as to what, if any, damages are recoverable for the undoubted breach of the contract, and as to this Mr. Justice Fisher states:\u2014\nI come now therefore to assess the damages and before doing so pause here to say that I have noted paragraph 25 of the said franchise agreements providing for termination without cause on ten days' notice and I have tried to keep in mind the many contingencies that might have affected the matter. I am satisfied however that substantial damages have been caused to the plaintiff by the defendant's breach of contract as aforesaid and that they can and should be assessed under the headings as hereinafter set out after making allowances, as I have tried to do, for contingencies to an extent reasonable in all the circumstances. After careful consideration of the evidence and the arguments of counsel I think a fair assessment of the damages is as follows:\nI estimate the damages arising from the loss of profits on the twenty-six automobiles at $2,000, the damages arising from the loss of the franchise and the consequent loss of the business at $5,000 and the damages arising from the loss of realization of the assets at $1,000.\nLiability is disputed by the appellant for damages under any of the heads mentioned.\nIt was first argued that this was a mere contract to loan money and that, therefore, the damages should be nominal in accordance with decisions such as The South African Territories Limited v. Wallington [11]. However, this is not that kind of a case. Not only did the appellant know intimately the respondent's financial position but, as security for any advances that it might take, held a floating charge upon the assets of the respondent. The contract was not to advance money subject to its repayment being demanded at any time but was a special one to finance the purchase of the automobiles and to leave the money at interest until the automobiles should be sold in the usual course of business. Under these circumstances, if the damages were within the contemplation of the parties as the probable result of the breach of the contract, the principles enunciated in Hadley v. Baxendale [12]would apply. Prehn v. Royal Bank of Liverpool [13]; Manchester and Oldham Bank Limited v. Cook [14].\nIt was next argued that a deficiency in the amount of capital employed in respondent's business was the cause of the respondent being unable to secure the necessary funds elsewhere and that the damages flowed from that lack. Assuming it to be proved that in a business sense the respondent required further capital in its undertaking, one of the main objects of the bargain between the parties was the supplying of that capital and, in any event, the short time at the disposal of the respondent to make other arrangements shows that that circumstance was the compelling factor in respondent's inability to secure funds from other sources.\nThe third and fourth submissions were that even if the damages did result from the breach, they were not the natural and probable consequences thereof, nor were they contemplated by the parties at the time of the making of the contract. On the evidence, both of these contentions fail. As early as 1935 the appellant knew that the respondent would lose its franchise from the Studebaker Company if cash were not paid for ordered automobiles upon their arrival in Vancouver. It follows as a matter of course that if respondent did not have the automobiles, it would lose its profit on the retail sale and, lacking a franchise, a probable result would be that respondent would have to dispose of other Studebaker cars on hand, its stock of parts for Studebaker cars, and its used cars.\nFinally, to quote the words of Lord Atkinson in Wilson v. United Counties Bank [15], the damages in this case must have been\nin the contemplation of the parties when they entered into the contract as the result which would probably flow from the breach of it and that the damages therefore are not too remote.\nThe damages have been assessed on a proper basis and no question being raised as to the various sums, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nHUDSON J.\u2014The facts are fully set out in the judgment of the learned trial judge[16].\nHe found that when the original contract was made between the parties the defendant had full knowledge of the plaintiff's circumstances, and thereafter always kept in close touch with the plaintiff's business. He also found that the defendant knew that the probable consequences of a breach would be a loss of profits on the automobiles, a loss of the plaintiff's franchise and consequent loss of its business, and that the loss on realization of its assets were under the circumstances natural and probable results. The learned judges in appeal agreed with him (1).\nThe circumstances here are far different from the breach of a simple promise to lend the money and justify a substantial verdict. While the amount awarded appears somewhat large, it has been concurred in by all the judges of the Court of Appeal and I do not think it should be disturbed here. The relevant authorities are fully discussed in the judgments in the Court below.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Walsh, Bull, Housser, Tupper, Ray & Carroll.\nSolicitor for the respondent: M.

But, semble, the vendor may have a right of action against the purchaser for damages for breach of the covenant to pay the taxes.\nRoyal Trust Co. v. Kennedy, [1930] S.C.R. 602, applied.\nAPPEALS by the plaintiffs from the judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing their appeals from the judgments of Makins J.[1] dismissing the actions. The actions were similar and were tried together.\nEach action was brought to recover the balance of purchase price, and interest, alleged to be due and owing by the defendant under a covenant to pay contained in an agreement for sale of lands to defendant. The defendant had covenanted to pay taxes and had made default therein, to the knowledge (as found by the trial judge) of the plaintiffs; and the Township of Sandwich West (within which township the lands were situated), under its powers and rights under The Ontario Municipal Board Act, 1932 (22 Geo. V, c. 27), s. 109, had registered against the lands, or the greater portion thereof, a certificate vesting the title thereto in the said Township; and the lands were lost to the parties.\nThe trial judge, Makins J., on the authority of Royal Trust Company v. Kennedy[2], gave effect to the defendant\u2019s contention that the plaintiff, having lost title and ability to convey, cannot enforce the agreement, and he gave judgment dismissing the action without costs. He suggested that the proper procedure for the plaintiff would be to sue for damages for breach of covenant.\nOn appeals by plaintiffs to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that Court (without written reasons) dismissed the appeals without costs, \u201creserving to the plaintiff the right to bring an action for damages or to seek any relief except that which is specifically sought in this action.\u201d The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. By the judgment of this Court now reported the appeals were dismissed with costs.\nA.F. Gignac for the appellants.\nA.Racine K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014These are appeals from judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming, with a variation, the judgments of the Honourable Mr. Justice Makins. The latter are based upon Royal Trust Company v. Kennedy2. While in that case suit had been brought in Quebec, the law of the Province of Ontario applied, and, unless the decision can be distinguished, it is fatal to the appellants.\nIt is perhaps advisable to mention first certain other decisions, some of which were referred to on the argument. In Lebel v. Dobbie[3], Mr. Justice Hyndman determined that where a purchaser under an agreement for sale of land covenants to pay the taxes thereon but fails to do so and the land is forfeited because of their non-payment, the vendor, notwithstanding his lack of title, is entitled to recover the amount of the purchase price from the purchaser, as the latter cannot avail himself of his own default as a defence. It was argued that the vendor, if entitled to succeed at all, should have judgment for damages only, to the extent of the value of the land, but that argument was not given effect to. An appeal, heard by Harvey, C.J., Stuart, Simmons and McCarthy, JJ., was dismissed with costs, without written reasons being given.\nIn Broder v. Rink and McRadu[4], the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan dismissed an appeal from the trial judge, who had dismissed an action for specific performance by a vendor of land. The vendor had agreed to sell one, Toader Pahomi, lots 5 and 6 in block 29, Regina, for $1,500, payable in instalments. Pahomi agreed to sell these lots to the defendants and later released to the plaintiff, who was still the registered owner, all his right, title and interest therein. Subsequently, McRadu, one of the defendants, paid a certain sum on account to the plaintiff. The defendants failed to pay the taxes which in their agreement of sale with Pahomi they had agreed to pay, and in November, 1916, the lots were offered for sale for taxes. The plaintiff redeemed lot 5; the trial court found, and the Court of Appeal confirmed the finding, that the plaintiff purchased lot 6 at the tax sale, in the name of his wife. The Court of Appeal dealt only with one point, viz., whether the plaintiff, having bought lot 6 at the tax sale, and having subsequently put it out of his power to convey that lot to the defendants, was entitled to collect from them the purchase price.\nMr. Justice Lamont, speaking on behalf of the Court (consisting of Haultain, C.J.S., Newlands, Lamont and Elwood, JJ.A.), said it was not necessary to consider whether the Lebel case[5] was correctly decided. \u201cI do not suggest (he says at page 480) that it was not,\nfor I have not considered whether the failure of a purchaser to pay the taxes carries with it the results therein set out, or whether it exposes him merely to an action for damages for breach of covenant and the other remedies expressly provided for in the agreement of sale.\nMr. Justice Lamont pointed out that in the Lebel case5 the failure of the purchaser to pay the taxes resulted in the title passing out of the hands of the vendor and into the hands of the town, while in the instant case the failure of the defendants to pay the taxes had no such result. After the tax sale, Broder was still the owner of both lots and could have made title to the defendants had he so desired. In fact the statement of claim alleged both his ability and willingness to do so. Mr. Justice Lamont found no analogy between the case of a vendor buying in his property at a tax sale and that of a second mortgagee buying mortgaged property at a sale held under a first mortgage. He suggested that a much closer analogy would be the case of a first mortgagee buying in the mortgaged premises. He referred to Mutual Life Assurance Co. of Canada v. Douglas[6], as authority for his statement that if a mortgagee acquires title under a sale for taxes, he cannot hold the title under his tax title and at the same time recover the mortgage moneys under the mortgagor\u2019s covenant to pay. He also referred to the judgment of Mr. Justice Anglin in Sayre and Gilfoy v. Security Trust Company Ltd.[7] In the last mentioned case the judgment appealed from was affirmed in this Court on an equal division of opinion.\nIn Hutton v. Dent[8], suit was brought in Ontario on a judgment recovered in Saskatchewan and, in the alternative, on the original cause of action, which was a covenant to pay for lands agreed to be purchased. In the Saskatchewan action, judgment had been recovered upon this covenant and an order made for the sale of the lands and payment by the defendant of any deficiency after crediting the money realized at the sale. The plaintiff obtained the leave of the court to bid, and bought the property. Subsequently, the first mortgagee sold the property under the power of sale in its mortgage. In the Ontario Court of Appeal, Hodgins J.A., who delivered the main judgment, stated that if it were a case between mortgagee and mortgagor, the facts would bring it within the exception to the equitable doctrine set forth in Palmer v. Hendrie[9] and Walker v. Jones[10]. This exception (he states) allows recovery to be had in cases where the land has, by the default of the party liable to pay the debt, passed out of the hand of the mortgagee. After referring to Coote on Mortgages, etc., Mr. Justice Hodgins continues:\u2014\nI think the principle upon which this exception depends is one which obtains between vendor and purchaser, for it is one of reason and common sense. This is an ordinary action on a covenant and the rules as to contract apply and govern the rights of the parties.\nOn appeal to this Court (Dent v. Hutton[11]), Sir Louis Davies and Mr. Justice Anglin agreed with the present Chief Justice of this Court, who dismissed the appeal with a variation by compelling the plaintiff to allow the defendant the full amount of the purchase money payable under the sale by which the plaintiff acquired title to the property. There were two questions upon which no opinion was expressed. These appear at pages 722 and 723:\u2014\nThe first of these is the question whether an unpaid vendor who has, in proceedings to enforce his lien for the purchase money, obtained leave to bid and, pursuant to that leave, purchased the property, can after the property has passed out of his possession and power proceed to enforce the judgment for the unpaid residue. Whether the vendor in such circumstances is in the same position as a mortgagee is a question of general importance, and before deciding it adversely to the view advanced on behalf of the appellant, the weighty considerations which were urged and might be urged in support of that view would require the most careful examination. The other question is whether, the respondent having lost his title to the property in consequence of proceedings taken by the holder of a paramount security, he is in any view of the law, in consequence of the provisions of the agreement between him and the appellant, free from the operation of the principle which the appellant invokes. Upon neither of these questions, it must be understood, is any opinion now expressed.\nIt does not appear from the report of Royal Trust Company v. Kennedy[12] that any of these cases were cited in argument, and an examination of the factums discloses that they were not there mentioned. However, Mr. Justice Newcombe, speaking for the Court, after referring to the fact that the lands in question had been sold for taxes and not redeemed, says at page 608:\u2014\nA title in this condition is something very different from that which the purchaser contracted to receive upon payment of the purchase money, and the question is whether he is, nevertheless, bound by reason of his failure to pay the taxes as covenanted. Other points were taken and debated at the hearing; but in the view which I take, it is unnecessary to consider these.\nAt page 611 he continues:\u2014\nThe plaintiff, nevertheless, now denies the purchaser\u2019s right to object to the maintenance of the action after the property has been sold for taxes, and so has passed out of the plaintiff\u2019s power to convey; and it is said that, inasmuch as the purchaser failed in performance of his covenant to pay the taxes, the defendants are now invoking their own default or that of the deceased as a means of escape; but I do not agree. It would be, in my opinion, very unreasonable to suppose that the parties ever contemplated that, in addition, or in lieu of the indemnity for which the law provides by way of damages, the purchaser or his estate should lose the benefit of his contract while still remaining subject to its burden, which is the result now sought to be accomplished.\nIt is true that in the Kennedy case[13] the purchaser had not taken possession or accepted the vendor\u2019s title which was encumbered by a mortgage and a writ of execution, and that Mr. Justice Newcombe states (page 611):\u2014\nIt must be realized that the vendor, as the owner, is primarily liable for the taxes, and that the covenant, whereby the purchaser becomes bound to pay, while it serves to engage the purchaser\u2019s indemnity for the vendor, does not create any direct obligation as between the purchaser and the municipal authorities.\nBut the decision was not based upon any of these considerations and the ratio decidendi appears in the extracts from the judgment already set out. It can make no difference, therefore, if in the case at bar the respondent took possession and accepted the appellant\u2019s title, or even if there be a primary obligation on the purchaser to the municipality to pay the taxes. The evidence is not clear on all these points but from what does appear and from the length of time that elapsed they may be assumed in favour of the appellant. None of them can alter the fact that the decision in the Kennedy case13 was placed squarely upon the ground that in addition to a claim for damages for breach of the purchaser\u2019s covenant to pay the taxes, a vendor of land is not able to succeed in an action for specific performance where he is not able to give title to the purchaser. The appellant is entitled, under the variation of the judgment of Mr. Justice Makins, made by the Court of Appeal, to bring an action for damages, and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIS J.\u2014The action is not one in equity for specific performance; it is an action to recover money on a covenant to pay. The bare facts are these: A. agrees to sell to B. and B. agrees to buy from A. certain lands, the sale to be completed at a future date; B., the purchaser, expressly covenants to pay the taxes meantime; B. fails to do so and the lands become vested in and the property of the municipality for non-payment of taxes (by virtue of the provisions of the Ontario statute 22 Geo. V (1932), chap. 27, sec. 109); A. sues B. for payment of the balance of the purchase money; B. pleads by way of defence the equitable doctrine that he is not required to pay unless the lands are conveyed to him and that A. is unable to convey; A. replies, \u201cI am unable to convey only because of your own default in not paying the taxes you agreed to pay whereby the lands became by statutory authority vested in and the property of the municipality; consequently the rules of contract apply and govern the rights of the parties. No equity enters into the matter.\u201d\nWhile the equitable doctrine is plain that a vendor of land before he can recover judgment for the purchase money must have either conveyed or tendered a conveyance of the lands, there is an exception where the inability of the vendor to do so is the result of the neglect or default of the purchaser. But I can find no escape from concurring in the dismissal of this appeal in view of the decision of this Court in The Royal Trust Company v. Kennedy[14]. The action was dismissed by Makins J. because he felt bound by that decision and an appeal from his judgment to the Court of Appeal was dismissed without written reasons but the formal judgment was varied by reserving to the appellant (plaintiff) \u201cthe right to bring an action for damages or to seek any relief except that which is specifically sought in this action.\u201d\nIn Hutton v. Dent[15], the inability of the vendor to convey was due to the fault of the purchaser in allowing the land to be sold under a mortgage which he had assumed as part of the purchase price. Were I free to do so, I should follow the reasoning and conclusion of the late Mr. Justice Hodgins in the Court of Appeal for Ontario in that case, but I am not free to do so because though an appeal to this Court from that judgment was dismissed[16], the judgment of this Court was put on other grounds.\nHUDSON J.\u2014The decision of this Court in the case of Royal Trust Company v. Kennedy14 was unanimous. The principle enunciated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Newcombe, speaking for the whole Court, seems to me to be directly in point in this case. For this reason I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014These appeals are from the judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which affirmed judgments given by Mr. Justice Makins of the Supreme Court of Ontario. I believe that we are bound by the decision given in Royal Trust Company v. Kennedy14. In that case it was decided that the law ascertains the damage for breach of the covenant according to the method indicated by Lethbridge v. Mytton[17] and Loosemore v. Radford[18]: \u201cwhen a purchaser covenants to pay the taxes, the vendor may, at any time, when unpaid taxes are overdue, maintain an action against the purchaser for the amount.\u201d It was also decided that an action for the balance of the price of sale cannot be maintained when the vendor cannot give title to the property. In the present instance, the vendors, having lost title to the property, are unable to perform their covenants to convey and are, therefore, precluded from recovery of any moneys due under the agreements.\nI would dismiss the appeals with costs, reserving to the plaintiffs all the rights they may have to bring an action for damages.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: A.F.

The appeal to this Court was, by the judgment now reported, dismissed with costs, Crocket and Taschereau JJ. dissenting.\nR.L. Kellock K.C. and H. Beaumont for the appellant.\nT.N. Phelan K.C. and J.D. Watt for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nCROCKET J. (dissenting)\u2014The appellant, a widow of 38 years, who had been employed as city passenger and ticket agent of the Canadian National Railways at Prescott for several years, slipped on an icy sidewalk in Prescott on February 4th, 1937, and sustained such painful and serious comminuted or shattered fractures of both the tibia and fibula bones of her right leg that she was unable to return to her office to resume her duties until the first week in September, and then only with the aid of crutches, which she continued to use for a further period of three months. During the first three weeks of this period of nine months she endured all the pain and discomfort attending the binding of these shattered bones as well as her badly bruised and swollen thigh in a special metal splint. On its removal a plaster cast was applied to the whole limb up to the hip and kept her in further discomfort until March 22nd, when before her removal to her apartment another cast had to be applied and kept on until May 15th. Altogether she was confined to bed for 17 weeks. Although\u2014thanks to what seems to have been a very high order of surgical care and skill\u2014she made a remarkable recovery from such an injury, her limb at the time of the trial two years after the accident was not restored to its former natural condition. It then showed a permanent disfigurement due to the unavoidable formation of a callous lump at the fracture point and was one-half inch shorter than the left leg, producing a noticeable limp.\nThe accident happened at about 10.30 p.m. on the west side of West street, which runs southerly down hill from Park street across Dibble and Henry streets, when Mrs. Harper was returning from a public concert, which had been given in the schoolhouse, situated on the northeast corner of Dibble street. She brought this action against the respondent to recover damages for her injury and pecuniary loss, which she alleged was caused by the negligence of the municipal corporation, relying on the provisions of the Municipal Act, R.S.O., 1937, ch. 266. Subsections 1, 2 and 3 of sec. 480 of this. Act read as follows:\n(1) Every highway and every bridge shall be kept in repair by the corporation the council of which has jurisdiction over it, or upon which the duty of repairing it is imposed by this Act, and in case of default the corporation shall subject to the provisions of The Negligence Act be liable for all damages sustained by any person by reason of such default.\n(2) No action shall be brought against a corporation for the recovery of damages occasioned by such default, whether the want of repair was the result of nonfeasance or misfeasance, after the expiration of three months from the time when the damages were sustained.\n(3) Except in case of gross negligence a corporation shall not be liable for a personal injury caused by snow or ice upon a sidewalk.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Chevrier without a jury in February, 1939. He found on the facts established by the evidence adduced before him that the respondent\u2019s servants were guilty of gross negligence within the meaning of subs. 3 of s. 480 of the Act and directed the entry of judgment in favour of the appellant for $2,710.80 together with her costs.\nThe Court of Appeal, McTague and Gillanders, JJ.A. (Riddell, J.A., dissenting), reversed the trial judgment and directed the dismissal of the action with costs.\nWith all deference, I think the majority judgment on appeal is erroneous for the reason that it proceeds upon a misinterpretation of the term \u201cgross negligence,\u201d as used in s. 480 of the Municipal Act, and an unwarranted disregard of the specific findings of the learned trial judge upon essential questions of fact depending upon the credibility of evidence adduced before him.\nIn the reasons for the appeal judgment delivered by McTague J.A., His Lordship says that, while he is in agreement with the proposition laid down by Chief Justice Anglin in this Court in Holland v. City of Toronto[2], that there could be no a priori standard for determining when negligence should be deemed \u201cvery great negligence,\u201d as Sedgewick J. expressed it in City of Kingston v. Drennan[3], he thought that in general what a plaintiff had to prove under that standard was that there was a breach of the duty to keep the sidewalk reasonably safe for pedestrians using same reasonably, \u201cand that the breach of that duty approaches the wilful, the reckless, the wanton; the breach must be flagrant.\u201d\nThat the Legislature ever intended that a municipal corporation should not be liable for any personal injury caused by snow or ice upon a sidewalk without proof of such a standard of gross negligence as that laid down in this judgment I cannot for my part believe. While it is clear that the Legislature meant something more than the failure to exercise ordinary reasonable care and attention in maintaining and keeping its sidewalks safe for pedestrians, it is to my mind hardly possible to suppose that, in legislating this civil liability upon a municipal corporation, as it expressly does by subs. 1 of the above section, it had any thought in enacting subs. 3 of exempting all municipalities from such liability so long as they or their servants were not guilty of a degree of negligence which is only measurable by the standard of the Criminal Law.\nThere have been several judgments in this Court and also in the Ontario courts dealing with the meaning of \u201cgross negligence\u201d as used in this enactment. Not one of these judgments has ever ventured to suggest that the enactment requires the proof of either \u201cwilful,\u201d \u201creckless,\u201d \u201cwanton,\u201d or \u201cflagrant\u201d negligence as necessary to fix a municipal corporation with liability for personal injury caused by snow or ice upon a sidewalk.\nIn Holland v. City of Toronto[4], Anglin, C.J.C., pointed out that the term \u201cgross negligence\u201d in this statute was not susceptible of definition, and that the circumstances \u201cgiving rise to the duty to remove a dangerous condition, including the notice, actual or imputable, of its existence and the extent of the risk which it creates\u201d depends upon so many different elements as to make it impossible to lay down any dependable criterion of liability for all cases. Referring to the evidence in that case His Lordship said:\nThe highly dangerous condition of the sidewalk from Wednesday to Friday was fully proven. The risk of accident, having regard to the relatively heavy pedestrian traffic, was great. An intelligent person observing the conditions with any reasonable degree of care on the Thursday should have realized the risk of leaving the sidewalk uncleaned and unsanded. The duty of the city sectionman was simple and easy\u2014merely to give notice to the occupant to clear off the snow and ice or to sprinkle sand or ashes over it.\nThere was, in our opinion, on the part of Blackburn, the city sectionman, such \u201cvery great negligence\u201d that to hold it to be less than \u201cgross\u201d would be to encourage a reckless indifference on the part of municipal authorities to the safety of persons lawfully using the streets, and would, in effect, be to declare that municipal corporations in Ontario are immune from liability for personal injury caused by accidents due to snow and ice on sidewalks. We agree with Mr. Justice Riddell\u2014\u201con any definition of gross negligence\u201d we are unable to see that Blackburn\u2019s conduct \u201cdoes not come within the words.\u201d\nIn an earlier case in this Court, German v. The City of Ottawa[5], in which the majority of the court held that failure to sand or harrow a sidewalk before 9 a.m. of February 2nd, when the conditions calling for it only arose on that morning, was not gross negligence and that the city was not liable for personal injury caused at that hour by ice on the sidewalk, especially if it was not in a place of special danger, nor on a street of heavy traffic and did not call for immediate attention, Anglin J. based his judgment, in which Davies J. concurred, upon the fact that there was no direct evidence that the city\u2019s servants had any actual or specific notice of the existence of the danger at the locus of the accident, and that there was nothing in the record to suggest that this place was one of special hazard, which called for preferential care or treatment. (See p. 90). The vital question involved in that case, he pointed out at p. 89, was whether the failure of the city employees to prevent an admittedly dangerous condition amounted to gross negligence within the meaning of R.S.O., ch. 192, s. 460(3). \u201cIts solution,\u201d His Lordship said, \u201cmust depend upon the notice of the existence of the dangerous condition which the city authorities actually had, or which should be imputed to them, and their opportunity of remedying it.\u201d Duff, J., who with Davies and Anglin, JJ., constituted the majority, simply stated that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Fitzpatrick, C.J., and Idington, J., dissenting, held that, notwithstanding the city\u2019s servants had no actual or specific notice of the existence of the danger at the locus of the accident, the city officials should have realized from the sudden drop of the temperature on the afternoon preceding the accident that the sidewalks would be dangerous on the following morning, and that in such circumstances it was gross negligence to reduce the working staff and to fail to do work on the sidewalk where the accident occurred.\nIn Pierce v. City of Toronto[6], in which the County Court Judge of the County of York had held the city liable under the same enactment for personal injury to the plaintiff\u2019s wife caused by her falling on an icy street crossing, and awarded judgment in favour of her husband and herself, the Court of Appeal, per Latchford, Britton and Middleton, JJ. (Meredith, C.J. C.P., dissenting), dismissed an appeal from the County Court judgment. Latchford, J., in his reasons said that,\nAs found by the trial judge, the crossing at which Mrs. Pierce was injured was a particularly dangerous one, and was known to be such by the defendants, who had not taken effective measures to render it reasonably safe for persons lawfully using the street. . . . In this case the city authorities were well aware that the crossing was in a dangerous condition, but the means which they adopted to provide a remedy were insufficient and ineffective.\nMiddleton, J., in his reasons said that,\nThere was a condition full of peril known to the defendants, and an attempt to cope with the situation which was quite inadequate and which ought to have been appreciated as inadequate by those in charge. This constituted gross negligence.\nThe learned trial judge in his reasons for judgment in the present case refers to the above cases, as well as to that of Legris v. Town of Cobalt[7], in which it appeared that the slippery place where the accident occurred had been sanded in the morning but that most of the sand had been blown away by a high wind before Mrs. Legris slipped and was injured in the afternoon. In that case, following the Pierce case[8], the Appeal Court dismissed the municipality\u2019s appeal.\nIn Fletcher v. City of Calgary[9], the Appeal Division of the Alberta Supreme Court (Harvey, C.J., and Stewart and Beck, JJ.) held that,\nWhen a sidewalk is on a steep slope and is used, to the knowledge of city officials whose duty it is to put sand and ashes on the slippery places, by children with sleighs and toboggans, making it more than naturally slippery, there is a duty on the city to pay more attention to it than to others not so dangerous and failure to take extra precautions to prevent injury to pedestrians is negligence for which the city is liable. It is clear, I think, that the decisions and dicta, to which I have refererred, far from lending any support to, actually negative the premise upon which the majority judgment in the Appeal Court is based, viz.: that there must be proof of negligence measurable by the standard of that prescribed by the Criminal Law before there can be any recovery against the municipality under the provisions of the Municipal Act. This, in my respectful opinion, marks the judgment a quo as one which ought not to be affirmed by this Court.\nApart, however, from this fundamental objection, an examination of the record clearly shows that the majority judgment in the Appeal Court has disregarded and reversed specific findings of the trial judge upon questions of fact involving the credibility of witnesses, which it was his right and duty, and not that of the Appeal Court, to determine, as essential factors in the consideration of the degree of negligence imputable to the respondent corporation.\nFor instance, on the vital question as to whether the town street foreman had actual or specific notice of the existence of the dangerous situation which had been created at the locus of the accident by the school children sliding down the sidewalk, as their custom was on coming from school at 4 o\u2019clock, and his opportunity of remedying it, the learned trial judge specifically found that the defendants were in fact made aware in time of the dangerous condition of West street, and further, that the fact that the school children had brushed off the sand which the sanding crew had sprinkled upon the icy sidewalk before the dismissal of the school in the afternoon was known to one of the town\u2019s employees (Annable, the street foreman).\nAnnable, who gave evidence as a respondent witness, swore in cross-examination that a citizen, a Mr. Fretwell, who lived on that street, had told him about half past four in the afternoon that the kids had slid the sand off \u201cthe hill\u201d and that \u201cthe hill\u201d was dangerous and slippery. Yet the majority judges in the Appeal Court say that \u201cthere is evidence that the foreman of the street gang was notified by a citizen about 4.30 in the afternoon that there were slippery places that needed sanding due to children sliding,\u201d and that \u201cthe evidence is that no particular street was mentioned, but that the foreman took the statement to include West street\u201d; and further, that \u201cthe foreman\u2019s attention was not called to a particular part of West street, but to slippery conditions on a number of streets.\u201d It is true that later on in his evidence Annable attempted to get away from his earlier statement by saying he \u201cdidn\u2019t think\u201d West street had been mentioned to him, though admitting that in any event he knew the warning was directed to \u201cthat hill.\u201d It was surely for the trial judge, and not for the Appeal Court, to determine which of Annable\u2019s two apparently contradictory statements should be accepted as the true version in relation to this all important question of an actual and specific warning having been given to the street foreman in time to enable him to remedy a specially dangerous situation and make the hilly sidewalk safe for pedestrians. The trial judge further found that Annable about 8 o\u2019clock on the morning of the day of the accident told Roberts, who was in charge of the town\u2019s sanding crew, to sand West street sidewalk because there was to be a school concert that night at the school at the top of the hill. That clearly shows that Annable himself anticipated that there would be more than the usual number of pedestrians subjected to the peril of using this particular icy sidewalk that night. He himself admitted that West street was the steepest hill in the town, and the trial judge found that the accident happened at a point on the edge of the sidewalk about 118 feet below the top of the hill, where the down grade running south was between 6 and 7 per cent., and the grade of the four-foot wide concrete sidewalk from its inside to its outside edge was 6 per cent. There were several slides between the top of the hill and that point, and the one, on or beside which Mrs. Harper fell, according to the evidence of Annable, ran from near the west side of the sidewalk diagonally down and over the east side of the sidewalk and \u201cright on to the road.\u201d Notwithstanding that he had been notified about half past four in the afternoon that the sand, which had previously been scattered over the sidewalk on this hill, had been brushed off by the children sliding after school, and of the existence of dangerous slides, and knew that an unusual number of pedestrians would be passing up and down this particular sidewalk that night, he concerned himself no more about the matter that night, but continued on his way to his home for supper while the teams and men of the town sanding machine were still out and easily available. He went back to the town hall after supper, he said, in accordance with what he intimated was his usual custom during the winter season, so as to be available for any emergency calls, not so much as bothering to go down by West street, which it appears was little out of his way. When he got back to the town hall, he said, \u201cthe boys was there\u201d with the team and the sand. \u201cAnd did you send one of them right up to West street?\u201d he was asked. \u201cNo,\u201d he replied, \u201cthey said they had sanded West street.\u201d Further questioning brought from him the intelligence that it was at the fire barn where he saw \u201cthe gang\u201d when he went back to duty after supper; that \u201cthey had put their equipment all away for the night, and that after they went away he hung around there, went here and there and up on Dean street, in the pool rooms, and on the corners,\u201d and started for home between half past eight and nine o\u2019clock, going this time by way of West street, when, seeing the slide where, to quote his own words, \u201cthe kiddies had slid the sand off * * * I just took my foot like that and I just kicked some sand over it and went on\u201d\u2014sand, he explained, which he kicked off the sidewalk. When asked how he happened to go up West street he said that \u201che went up that way around to see the mayor,\u201d who, it seems, runs an hotel on Main street, denying that it was on account of any dangerous spots on West street. The accident claimed for happened two hours later. If this evidence, which I have quoted from the mouth of the respondent\u2019s street foreman, is itself not sufficient to warrant a finding of gross negligence on his part, then for my part I can conceive of no case in which any municipality could be held liable for a personal injury caused by snow or ice upon a sidewalk under the provisions of s. 480 of the Ontario Municipal Act.\nIn addition to this, however, the trial judge had before him the statement of Roberts, the man in charge of the sanding crew, another of the respondent\u2019s own witnesses, that if this sidewalk was sanded before 4 o\u2019clock it wouldn\u2019t do much good because of the unfailing habit of the school children to use it for sliding after the dismissal of school.\nThe purpose, of course, of all municipalities in sanding icy sidewalks is to make them safe for the use of pedes- trians. It is a matter of common knowledge that all populous cities and towns, which undertake to provide and maintain concrete or tarvia sidewalks, now recognize that pedestrians cannot be adequately protected against accidents on such sidewalks, when covered with dangerously slippery ice, by the use of cold sand, which will not take a firm hold upon the slippery ice surface, and that either hot sand, or sand which has been so mixed with salt or other material of like properties as to make it stick by eating into the glare ice, must be used if any real or effective protection against such danger is to be afforded. And it must be obvious, it seems to me, to anybody that the spreading of sand which cannot stick or produce any effect upon the icy surface of sidewalks\u2014particularly running down steep hills\u2014is more likely to create a trap than to provide a protection for pedestrians, who are thus invited to rely upon their safety and traverse them.\nIn the present case the learned trial judge has specifically found that the sand, which was scattered over the West street sidewalk earlier in the day, was cold sand, which was not properly mixed with the sodium chloride the town had provided for the purpose so as to cause it to adhere to or destroy the surface of these admittedly dangerous ice slides, and in my judgment the undisputed fact that it disappeared so quickly as the result of the sliding of the school children is itself ample evidence to warrant that finding. The appeal judgment, completely ignoring this finding, as well as the finding concerning actual notice of the existence of special danger in this particular locality in ample time to remedy it before the occurrence of this unfortunate accident, plainly suggests, as I read the reasons given for that judgment, that the mere fact that the street foreman had at 8 o\u2019clock in the morning of the day in question ordered West street to be sanded, presumably in the usual manner, precludes the fixing of any liability upon the municipality for \u201cgross negligence\u201d within the meaning of the Municipal Act, and that the manner in which that order was carried out, and the efficacy of the sanding to meet the dangerous conditions it was intended to remedy, was not a consideration which should be taken into account in the circumstances of this case, as the two learned Appeal Judges in their examination of the printed record believed them to be. I fully agree with the opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Kiddell in his dissenting judgment that there was gross negligence on the part of the municipality and its servants within the meaning of the Municipal Act. I would therefore allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge with costs throughout.\nDAVIS J.\u2014The Ontario Municipal Act, being R.S.O., 1937, ch. 266, expressly provides by sec. 480 (3) that a municipal corporation shall not be liable for a personal injury caused by snow or ice upon a sidewalk\u2014except in case of gross negligence. The appellant fell upon an icy sidewalk in the town of Prescott, Ont., and she sued the municipal corporation for damages for her personal injuries. I do not think the evidence discloses gross negligence on the part of the municipal corporation.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nHUDSON J.\u2014In this case there is no dispute about the material facts necessary to dispose of the matter. The sole question is whether or not on these facts it could properly be found that there was what the Ontario statute calls \u201cgross negligence\u201d on the part of the municipality. A trial judge held there was and the majority of the Court of Appeal held there was not.\nUnlike the facts in a number of cases cited, here the municipality had done nothing to create a dangerous condition, or increase the danger caused by natural forces, and it had taken some precautions to avoid danger to pedestrians by sanding the sidewalk on the very day of the accident. It was not until about 4.30 p.m. that its street foreman was told that there were some slippery places due to children sliding. At that time the sanding gang were at work in some other part of the town and were due to stop work at 5 p.m.\nTaking into account the climatic conditions at this season of the year, the brevity of time which elapsed between notice of the slippery condition and the accident, amounting at most to a few hours in the late afternoon and evening of a winter\u2019s day, it would seem to me that to hold the municipality liable would be imposing a burden upon it greater than could ever have been intended by the Legislature, when they provided that there should be liability only in the case of gross negligence.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs. TASCHEREAU J. (dissenting)\u2014The appellant, Mary Emmeline Harper, sued the Municipal Corporation of the town of Prescott for damages sustained when she fell on an icy sidewalk on the 4th of February, 1937.\nThe defendant except in case of \u201cgross negligence\u201d is not liable for a personal injury caused by snow or ice upon a sidewalk (s. 480, Municipal Act). The trial judge decided that there was \u201cgross negligence,\u201d maintained the action for $2,710.78, but the Court of Appeal came to a different conclusion and dismissed the claim.\n\u201cGross negligence\u201d is not defined in the Act, but in Holland v. City of Toronto[10], Anglin, C.J.C., says:\u2014\nThe term \u201cgross negligence\u201d in this statute is not susceptible of definition. No a priori standard can be set up for determining when negligence should be deemed \u201cvery great negligence\u201d\u2014a paraphrase suggested in City of Kingston v. Drennan[11], which for lack of anything better has been generally accepted. The circumstances giving rise to the duty to remove a dangerous condition, including the notice, actual or imputable, of its existence, and the extent of the risk which it creates\u2014the character and the duration of the neglect to fulfill that duty, including the comparative ease or difficulty of discharging it\u2014these elements must vary in infinite degree; and they seem to be important, if not vital, factors in determining whether the fault (if any) attributable to the municipal corporation is so much more than merely ordinary neglect that it should be held to be very great, or gross, negligence.\nIn German v. City of Ottawa[12], Anglin J. also says:\u2014\nWhether the failure of the city employees to prevent that condition arising or to remove it before 9 a.m. on Wednesday, the 2nd of February, amounted to \u201cgross negligence\u201d (defined by this court as \u201cvery great negligence\u201d; Kingston v. Drennan[13]); which is the statutory condition of the defendants\u2019 liability (R.S.O., ch. 192, sec. 460(3)), is, therefore, the vital question involved in this appeal. Its solution must depend upon the notice of the existence of the dangerous condition which the city authorities actually had, or which should be imputed to them, and their opportunity of remedying it.\nI believe that these principles should be applied to the present case. The evidence, in my opinion, shows that the respondent is guilty of \u201cgross negligence\u201d and not only of ordinary neglect. I find the elements of this negligence specially in the evidence given by the foreman of the municipality, Annable. It is true that the sidewalk where the accident happened on the night of February the 4th had been sanded during the morning but, before the accident, the foreman had been told at 4.30 o\u2019clock p.m. that the street was in a dangerous condition. He knew that many people that night would pass through that street to go to the High School, where there was an entertainment. Later, he saw the slippery condition of the sidewalk, which he admits in his evidence, but did nothing to make it safe for pedestrians. He had sufficient time to fulfill his duty which, under the circumstances, was to take the necessary steps to remove this dangerous condition.\nThere was on the part of Annable, the city foreman, as Anglin, C.J.C., pointed out in the Holland case[14] at page 637:\u2014\n* * * such \u201cvery great negligence\u201d that to hold it to be less than \u201cgross\u201d would be to encourage a reckless indifference on the part of municipal authorities to the safety of persons lawfully using the streets, and would, in effect, be to declare that municipal corporations in Ontario are immune from liability for personal injury caused by accidents due to snow and ice on sidewalks.\nI, therefore, come to the conclusion that the respondent is guilty of gross negligence and that it cannot escape liability.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Casselman & Beaumont.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Herridge, Gowling, MacTavish & Watt.\n[1] [1939] Ont.

Haszard, [1937] S.C.R. 354), the appellants were entitled. In administration proceedings in the Court of Chancery of Prince Edward Island, the Master of the Rolls made an order on March 22, 1939, affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Equity, directing the final distribution of R.'s estate, the order taking no notice of the fact of said overpayments of income to L. On appeal to this Court:\nHeld: In directing the final distribution of R.'s estate the Court of Chancery in the administration proceedings was not only entitled but was bound to take into account, in adjusting and settling the amounts for the final distribution between appellants on the one hand and L.'s estate on the other, the overpayments of income that had been made to L.; and according to such adjustment to make allowance to appellants in the distribution, to the extent that there were assets of R.'s estate, available for that purpose, being administered by the Court. (In the issues and circumstances of the case, it was not necessary to decide the question whether overpayments could be recovered and brought back to R.\u2019s estate in the administration proceedings, nor the question of the right to claim interest on over-payments)\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Equity of Prince Edward Island affirming the judgment or order of the Master of the Rolls as to final distribution of the estate of Edward Roberson, deceased.\nThe said Edward Roberson died in 1883, leaving his widow and three daughters, Georgianna, Hannah and Lucy. His daughter Georgianna died in 1885, ten days after the birth of her only child, who died within two months later, leaving the child's father, Alexander Cameron, as the child's next of kin. Alexander Cameron died in 1921. He had remarried, his second wife had predeceased him, and he left surviving him three sons by his second marriage. These sons, claiming through their father, and also two of them as executors of their father's will, are the present appellants. Of the other members of the family of said Edward Roberson, deceased, his daughter Hannah died in 1907, his widow died in 1909, and his daughter Lucy died in 1934. By a judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, given on March 19, 1937 ([1]), certain questions were decided involving the interpretation and effect of certain clauses in the will of said Edward Roberson. It is claimed on behalf of the present appellants that in the course of the administration of the estate of said Edward Roberson there were included in payments of income made to his daughter Lucy, from the time of her mother's death in 1909 to the time of Lucy's death in 1934, income to which, under the rights of the parties as determined in accordance with the subsequent interpretation of Edward Roberson's will by the Supreme Court of Canada as aforesaid, the said Alexander Cameron and, after his death in 1921, his sons (claiming through him) were entitled. The estate is now being administered in the Court of Chancery of Prince Edward Island, and the order now appealed from, made by the Master of the Rolls on March 22, 1939, and affirmed by the Court of Appeal, directed the final distribution of the estate of Edward Roberson and closed it out, the order taking no notice of the fact that Lucy Roberson had received overpayments of income as aforesaid. The material facts and circumstances of the case and questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported.\nDonald McKinnon K.C. and J. D. Watt for the appellants.\nL. A. Lovett K.C. and W. E. Bentley K.C. for the respondents the administrators with the will annexed of the estate of Lucy Jane Roberson, deceased.\nThe judgment of Crocket, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. (Taschereau J. also adopting the reasons) was delivered by\nDavis J.\u2014The litigation out of which this appeal arises is the aftermath of the judgment of this Court in Cameron v. Haszard ([2]). In the earlier appeal the proper interpretation of the will of the late Edward Roberson, who died in 1883, was in dispute. The difficulty had arisen out of the fact that one of the testator's surviving daughters died in 1885 leaving her surviving an infant ten days old, who died a few weeks later leaving his father, Alexander Cameron, as his only next of kin. This Court held, following the then recent judgment in the Privy Council in Browne v. Moody ([3]), that the daughter's child had acquired a vested interest in his grandfather's estate.\nIn the earlier appeal some questions were raised as to the payments of income that had been made over a period of many years on the basis that the grandchild had not acquired a vested interest. \"If the parties cannot now agree,\" we said,\nupon an adjustment and settlement of their differences in respect of the impeached payments of income, that part of the bill of complaint should be remitted to the Court of Chancery. The facts in connection with the payments of income from these funds are not at all complete in the record before us but there is sufficient to indicate that there may well have been such an acquiescence on the part of the late Mr. Cameron, the father of the grandchild, who was himself one of the executors of the testator's will, as to preclude those now claiming through him from recovering against the surviving executor income which has been actually paid out by him, though, perhaps, to persons for the time being not strictly entitled to this income upon the construction which we have now put upon the provisions of the will respecting the funds in question. A great many years have elapsed since many of the payments were made, the surviving trustee obviously acted throughout in absolutely good faith, and many matters of fact and questions of law may arise for consideration if the question of the actual payments of income is pressed. The evidence before us is quite insufficient to enable us to deal with the dispute.\nThe formal judgment of the Court in this connection was as follows:\nAnd this Court did further order and adjudge that in the event of the parties hereto failing otherwise to adjust and settle the claim of the appellants in respect of the alleged improper disposition of income received from and after the death of the respective life tenants thereof, from the bequests and share of residue which became vested in the said Edward Roberson Cameron, and which are set forth in paragraph two hereof, the said claim be referred back to the Court of Chancery of Prince Edward Island for further disposition.\nEdward Roberson Cameron was the name of the grand child. The parties could not adjust and settle their differences and the matter was proceeded with in the administration proceedings in the Court of Chancery of Prince Edward Island in connection with the grandfather's estate.\nWhat might have been and should have been a very simple proceeding is now to be found in a most confused and confusing record out of which with some difficulty a few simple facts, which appear to have been lost sight of in the mass of evidence and submissions of counsel through out, stand out boldly.\nIt is satisfactory to observe that the capital of the estate remains, after the deduction of all proper disbursements, at almost exactly the same figure at which it began in 1883. There is no suggestion of any neglect, much less wrongdoing, in the handling of the estate over a period of more than fifty years. But the fact remains that certain income from the estate was paid out over a period of approximately twenty-five years on a basis quite inconsistent with the rights of the parties as determined for the first time by the judgment of this Court in 1937.\nSo far as the capital of the estate is concerned, its division presents no difficulty. The whole controversy relates to the payments of income. There are now really only two contestants in relation to that income and they are both before the Court. On the one hand are the Camerons (the appellants), who take through the will of the father of the grandchild. On the other hand are those (respondents) who take under the will of Lucy Roberson, an unmarried daughter of the original testator Edward Roberson, who did not die until 1934. Her mother, the widow of the original testator, had died in 1909. The present appeal is concerned solely with the income that came into the estate and was paid out between the date of the death of the testator's widow on November 28th, 1909, and the date of the death of the daughter Lucy on January 13th, 1934. During those years the rate of interest on mortgages was high and the resultant income to the estate substantial. It is not in dispute that the total income during this period was over $30,000 and that most of this income was paid over to the daughter Lucy without regard to the Camerons. It apparently did not occur to anyone during that period that half of that income should go to those entitled through the grand child. The father of the grandchild was the latter's sole next of kin and was himself an executor of the original estate. He did not die until July 16th, 1921, and although entitled (though it was not so determined until the judgment of this Court in 1937) to half of this income as the sole next of kin of his child, was a party during his life time to handing most of the income over to the testator's daughter Lucy.\nThe estate of Edward Roberson is now being administered in the Court of Chancery in Prince Edward Island and the order appealed from, made by the Master of the Rolls and affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Prince Edward Island, directs the final distribution of the estate and closes it out. But the order takes no notice of the fact that the daughter Lucy received most of the income from the time of her mother's death in 1909 down to the time of her own death in 1934, although those claiming from time to time through the grandchild, Cameron, were entitled to one-half of it. That strikes one at once as something that is wrong where a court of equity is administering an estate and determining the final distribution of it. The issue, we are afraid, became beclouded by many different contentions and arguments. It was said that the Court had no jurisdiction in the administration proceedings to do other than deal with the assets that were still in the estate and to that extent under the control of the Court. It was said that if the Camerons wanted to get back the overpayments from Lucy's estate, some other separate and independent proceedings would have to be taken outside the administration proceedings. In any event, all sorts of defences were raised on behalf of Lucy's estate, such as the acquiescence of Mr. Cameron during his lifetime (he being both an executor and a beneficiary of the original estate), the statute of limitations and the law relating to payments made under a mistake of law as distinct from payments made under a mistake of fact. Without passing upon the question whether or not the overpayments could be recovered and brought back to the original estate in the administration proceedings (no such issue was formulated on behalf of the Camerons in these proceedings), it is plain that in directing the final distribution of the estate the Court of Chancery in the administration proceedings was not only entitled but was bound to take into account in adjusting and settling the amounts for the final distribution between the two groups of beneficiaries (the Camerons on the one hand and the Lucy Roberson's estate on the other) the overpayments that had been made to Lucy Roberson during her lifetime. Bullock v. Downes ([4]); Dibbs v. Goren ([5]); In re Robin son, McLaren v. Public Trustee ([6]). When it comes to the final distribution of the estate it does not matter whether overpayments were made out of income or out of capital. In the estate that is now being administered by the Court of Chancery certain securities and moneys remain to be distributed and if one beneficiary has already received $13,000 to $16,000 more than she was entitled to (the. exact amount it is unnecessary for us to determine), an evening up can and should readily be made. There is not enough in the estate to completely adjust the differences, but, to the extent that there are available assets being administered by the Court, those adjustments ought to be made. The amount not being sufficient to cover the principal of the overpayments, the question of the right to claim interest on the overpayments does not arise as a practical matter. The overpayments, without taking interest into account, amounted to between $13,000 and $16,000, and the amount to which Lucy's estate was held entitled by the order appealed from on the basis of a distribution of the capital of the estate without regard to the overpayments of income but including her share of income received since December, 1938, is far short of the amount of the overpayments received by Lucy during her lifetime. The appeal is allowed and the orders of the Master of the Rolls and of the Court of Appeal in Equity, Prince Edward Island, are varied so as to direct that the remaining assets of the Edward Roberson estate shall be transferred or paid over to the three named Camerons in equal shares, after payment thereout of the costs, expenses and compensation referred to in the order of the Master of the Rolls., The appellants shall have their costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court against the respondents, the Administrators with the will annexed of Lucy Jane Roberson, deceased.\nTaschereau J.\u2014For the reasons given by my brother Davis, I would allow this appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: A.

Plaintiff had purchased from defendant the acetylene gas, but when it was used was to return to defendant the tanks (which defendant had purchased from the manufacturer thereof) and (for retention after 30 days) pay a rental therefor. (A time limit was fixed for return but had not expired when the accident in question occurred). Some time after said delivery, one of said tanks, which tank had not been used since delivery, exploded (whether from defect therein or from some immediately prior volume explosion or other external cause in the garage, where plaintiff had been working at a welding operation, was a matter in dispute), and plaintiff was injured and his property damaged. He sued for damages. In his statement of claim he alleged that the explosion was caused by negligence of defendant \u201cin storing under compression acetylene gas in a defective and unsafe tank, the bottom part of which, not being properly and securely welded and affixed to the remaining portion, suddenly and violently separated from it with the resulting explosion.\u201d There was no proof of any such improper or insecure welding. By amendment allowed at the trial, plaintiff added in his statement of claim a plea that he purchased the gas and hired the tank, having made known to defendant the purpose for which they were required and relying upon defendant\u2019s skill or judgment, the gas and tank being goods which it was in the course of defendant\u2019s business to supply; that the gas was purchased and the tank hired by description; that \u201cthe said gas and\/or tank were not reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were sold and\/or hired and were not of merchantable quality\u201d and that plaintiff\u2019s damages were the direct and proximate result thereof. The trial judge found that the explosion \u201cwas due to some defect in the internal structure or set-up of the cylinder, using the words in their widest application\u201d and \u201cthat the cylinder exploded by reason of extremely high internal pressure only, due to some internal structural defect,\u201d and gave judgment to plaintiff for damages. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, ([1939] Ont. W.N. 367; [1939] 4 D.L.R. 199) which held, on their view as to the issue raised by the pleadings and the lack of proof to support plaintiff on that issue, it was not open to the trial judge to enter upon a consideration of all the possible causes of the explosion or \u201cto find that the explosion was due to some unknown defect in the cylinder not alleged by the plaintiff, and the nature of which the evidence does not disclose.\u201d Plaintiff appealed.\nHeld (Rinfret and Kerwin JJ. dissenting): Plaintiff\u2019s appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nPer curiam: Said amendment to plaintiff\u2019s pleadings at the trial was, having regard to the proceedings, discussions, and offering of terms to defendant, properly allowed, and plaintiff\u2019s pleadings, so amended, covered a claim founded in contract generally for breach of conditions implied under s. 15 of the Sale of Goods Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 180.\nPer Crocket, Davis and Hudson JJ.: Upon all the evidence there was warrant for the trial judge\u2019s finding as to the cause of the explosion and (though on the printed record a doubt as to such cause might exist in the minds of an appellate court) his finding should not be disturbed; and on that finding, and as the facts essential to give rise to the conditions implied by said s. 15 of the Sale of Goods Act were established, plaintiff was entitled to judgment for damages. Though the tank was not actually sold but only the acetylene gas contained therein, yet both were \u201cgoods supplied under a contract of sale\u201d within the meaning of said s. 15 of the Sale of Goods Act. Geddling v. Marsh, [1920] 1 KB. 668, cited.\nPer Rinfret and Kerwin JJ. (dissenting): Upon the evidence, the cause of the explosion of the tank in question was a prior volume explosion; and whether that was so or not, there was not sufficient in the evidence to warrant the inference that the tank (assuming, but not deciding, that said s. 15 of the Sale of Goods Act applied to it) and its contents were not reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were intended or that they were not of merchantable quality.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which (reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Chevrier J.) dismissed the action, which was brought to recover damages for personal injuries and damage to property caused by an explosion in the plaintiff\u2019s garage which the plaintiff alleged occurred by reason of defect in an acetylene gas tank delivered by the defendant to the plaintiff. The material facts of the case sufficiently appear in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported. The appeal to this Court was allowed and the judgment at trial restored with costs throughout, Rinfret and Kerwin JJ. dissenting.\nA.W. Beament K.C. for the appellant.\nT.N. Phelan K.C. and G.E. Edmonds K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Kerwin JJ., dissenting, was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014This is an appeal by J. Donat Marleau from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an action brought by him against The People\u2019s Gas Supply Company Limited and thereby reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Chevrier after a trial without a jury. The action should be dismissed, but as my reasons for that conclusion are different from those assigned by the Court of Appeal, it will be necessary to refer to the pleadings and the course of the trial and to state the facts in some detail.\nThe plaintiff was the owner of a building in the village of St. Isidore in the Province of Ontario, in which he conducted a garage business for the repair of motor cars, and he himself was a mechanic accustomed to doing acetylene welding. The defendant is a company engaged in the business of manufacturing and distributing acetylene and other gases. About the thirty-first day of March, 1937, the defendant delivered to the plaintiff, at his garage, two tanks of acetylene gas. There is no dispute as to the arrangement under which this delivery was made,\u2014the plaintiff purchasing the quantity of acetylene in the tanks and agreeing to pay a rental for the containers. The smaller of the two tanks (Exhibit 8) was placed on the garage floor against the north wall and was never used in any way. From time to time, as occasion required, the larger tank (Exhibit 13) was used by the plaintiff in connection with his welding operations. On the night of May 28th, 1937, while Exhibit 13 was so in use, Exhibit 8 exploded, injuring the plaintiff and damaging the building and contents.\nIn his statement of claim, the plaintiff alleged that the explosion was caused through the negligence of the defendant by\nstoring under compression acetylene gas in a defective and unsafe tank, the bottom part of which, not being properly and securely welded and affixed to the remaining portion, suddenly and violently separated from it with the resulting explosion.\nThe tank alleged to be \u201cdefective and unsafe\u201d was Exhibit 8. The defendant denied negligence and it was on that basis that the action proceeded and the trial commenced. The trial continued for some days until the plaintiff\u2019s case was practically completed when counsel for the plaintiff applied to amend the statement of claim by adding the following:\u2014\nThe Plaintiff purchased the acetylene gas contained in the said tank from the Defendant and hired the said tank and the contents thereof (other than the said acetylene gas) from the Defendant having made known to the Defendant the purpose for which the said gas and tank were required and relying upon the skill or judgment of the Defendant, the said gas and tank being goods which it was in the course of the Defendant\u2019s business to supply. The said gas was purchased and the said tank was hired by description. The said gas and\/or tank were not reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were sold and\/or hired and were not of merchantable quality. The damages suffered by the Plaintiff as herein set out were the direct and proximate result of the said goods not being reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were sold and\/or hired and not being of merchantable quality.\nThis application was opposed by the defendant but the trial judge allowed it. The question of terms was dis- cussed, including one as to whether the trial should be adjourned for the purpose of giving the defendant an opportunity to prepare to meet the case put forward by the statement of claim as amended. Counsel for the plaintiff also offered to recall any or all of his witnesses so that they might be further cross-examined. After consideration, counsel for the defendant determined to proceed with the trial without asking for any adjournment.\nUndoubtedly a trial judge has the right to grant an amendment during the trial of an action, and an appellate court may interfere with the judgment pronounced after such a trial, if the opposite party has suffered any injustice. In the present case the Court of Appeal considered that this had occurred but, in view of the facts that an adjournment was suggested and the privilege offered to counsel for the defendant to cross-examine again any, or all, of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, and that counsel then decided to continue with the trial, I am unable to agree. It is true that witnesses were present from a distance, including experts, but all these matters of expense could have been arranged. When counsel deliberately takes a stand under these circumstances, the party for whom he appears must abide by the consequences.\nIt was next argued that even with the amendment the defendant was only obliged to meet a claim of breach of contract confined to an allegation of negligence through a defective weld but the remarks of counsel for both parties on the motion to amend, and the amendment itself, are not, in my view, capable of that construction. As amended, the claim against the defendant is founded in contract, generally, as well as in tort.\nFrom the amendment and the argument at bar, it appears that reliance is placed upon section 15 of The Sale of Goods Act, R.S.O., 1927, chapter 163, the relevant provisions of which are as follows:\u2014\n15. Subject to the provisions of this Act and of any statute in that behalf, there is no implied warranty or condition as to the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract of sale, except as follows:\n(a) Where the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required so as to show that the buyer relies on the seller\u2019s skill or judgment, and the goods are of a description which it is in the course of the seller\u2019s business to supply (whether he be the manufacturer or not), there is an implied con- dition that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose, provided that in the case of a contract for the sale of a specified article under its patent or other trade name, there is no implied condition as to its fitness for any particular purpose.\n(b) Where goods are bought by description from the seller who deals in goods of that description (whether he be the manufacturer or not), there is an implied condition that the goods shall be of merchantable quality; provided that if the buyer has examined the goods, there shall be no implied condition as regards defects which such examination ought to have revealed.\nIt is said that these provisions clearly apply to the sale of the acetylene gas and that so far as the container is concerned, the plaintiff and defendant, as bailee and bailor for hire, are, in relation to the implied conditions, in the same position as vendee and vendor, citing Hyman v. Nye[2]; Vogan v. Oulton[3]. It is also contended that the tank, although not actually sold, falls within the meaning of the expression \u201cgoods supplied under a contract of sale\u201d as used in section 15 of the Act, citing a decision of a Divisional Court, Geddling v. Marsh[4], and a decision of the New York Court of Appeals, Haller v. Rudmann[5], where the Geddling case4 is referred to. There appears to be a difference of judicial opinion as to whether the obligation of a bailor is the same as that of a vendor but, in the view I take of the matter, it is unnecessary to determine the point.\nThe method of constructing tanks such as the one in question was described, and in fact the history of Exhibit 8 was given. It was not manufactured by the defendant but by a company in the United States. Steel plate of a certain specification was used to form a disc which was cut to the required length and a forged steel boss to carry a valve and a protecting cap was welded at the top. Through the bottom, the cylinder was next filled, under pressure, with an approved porous filler consisting of asbestos plug discs,\u2014this filler serving two purposes, (1) as a carrying or distributing agent for acetone, (2) to break up acetylene into small cells so that in the event of ignition taking place, propagation of the flame would be prevented. A convex bottom was next placed in position and welded. (It might here be interpolated that on the question of negligence the trial judge found no defect, as alleged, in this welding, and in this I agree). Acetone was put in through the valve opening in the head of the tank. It was then subjected to an internal pressure of five hundred pounds of air and one out of the lot of two hundred, or less, that included Exhibit 8, was subjected to an internal hydro-static test of seven hundred and fifty pounds per square inch. A special ring was attached by shrinking around the bottom of the cylinder to protect the weld from abuse in service. Finally, in the convex bottom of the tank were inserted three fusible plugs each containing a core of some material having a low melting point, the purpose of these being to release internal pressure in the cylinder that might be built up due to external heat.\nExhibit 8 was sold by the manufacturer to the defendant in April, 1931. The history of the tank thereafter shows that from time to time the defendant charged the tank with acetylene gas and sent it to its customers. The method of charging was described and no fault has been found with it.\nOn the night of the explosion, May 28th, 1937, Marleau was welding a piece of metal and for that purpose was using Exhibit 13 in conjunction with an oxygen tank, the two being strapped together on a carrier or holder. Marleau was standing, facing north and seven to ten feet easterly from Exhibit 8, which still stood on the garage floor near the north wall and which had never been used. He completed the welding operation, changed the torch from his right to his left hand, turned off the supply of oxygen, and was about to turn off the acetylene when he heard an explosion, \u201cfelt a kind of forced air\u201d on his left side, and became unconscious.\nThere was a pit in the garage that had been constructed in order to permit mechanics to work underneath motor cars. Marleau was found, after the explosion, in this pit,\u2014about twenty feet from where he had been standing. He was taken outside where it was discovered he had been burned on the hands and face, and the front part of his trousers and underwear had been torn away half way to his hips. An employee who had been working in the pit heard an explosion, felt a rush of air from the direction of the north wall and \u201csomething\u201d burned him. The roof was blown off the garage and part of the walls knocked down. One of two men who were standing near a motor car on the floor of the garage was killed. A dent was discovered in the cement floor just where Exhibit 8 had been standing; the weld-protecting ring that had been on the tank was found on the garage floor as was also the bottom of the tank but, instead of the latter being convex to the inside of the tank as it was prior to the explosion, it was concave. Two of the plugs from the bottom of the tank were picked up in the garage, not fused, and from the evidence it seems clear that they were forced out of their position when the bottom of the tank was deformed. The rest of the tank was found partly buried in the earth at a distance of about three hundred feet from the position it had occupied in the garage. The plugs in the bottom of Exhibit 13 had fused. This tank, Exhibit 13, and the oxygen tank that had been in use with it, were found on the floor but, except for the gauge on the oxygen tank and the hose, undamaged.\nThe theory of the plaintiff was that Exhibit 8 had exploded from some internal cause, while the theory of the defendant was that there had been a prior external volume explosion in the garage, which caused Exhibit 8 to explode. It is common ground that an acetylene tank such as Exhibit 8 would explode only from one of these two causes, or from external heat, and it is also common ground that in view of the fact that the plugs on Exhibit 8 had not fused, the last alternative was excluded.\nI agree with the trial judge that res ipsa loquitur does not apply. The tank was not under the control of the defendant at the time of the explosion as were the premises in question in United Motors Service Inc. v. Hutson[6]. In Donoghue v. Stevenson[7], there was no doubt about the snail being in the bottle. In Grant v. Australian Knitting Mills Ld.[8], it was shown that the woollen garment, when purchased from the retailer, was in a defective condition owing to the presence of excess sulphites.\nThe question remains as to what caused Exhibit 8 to explode. The trial judge decided that there was no prior volume explosion and that, therefore, there remained only the plaintiff\u2019s theory to account for the explosion, and that there must have been some defect in the construction of the tank or in the method of charging it with acetone or acetylene gas. The issue does not depend upon the credibility of witnesses but upon the inference to be drawn from undisputed facts. What the proper inference should be may give rise to a difference of opinion and, after anxious consideration of the evidence, I have concluded that there was a prior volume explosion.\nWe have not here a case of Exhibit 8 standing in the garage and with nothing else occurring in the building that could have no possible relevance to an explosion. The opinion of Mr. Hazen, an expert called by the defendant, that there was a flash-back in the hose stretching from the torch to Exhibit 13 is corroborated by other evidence. Even Stryker, a witness called for the plaintiff, admitted that there might have been a flash-back. Mr. Hazen was also definitely of opinion that following this flash-back, there was a volume explosion in the garage, although he could not say exactly what caused it. He pointed to the elliptical form of the sides of Exhibit 8 after the explosion, and I agree that it is impossible to believe that this deformation was caused when the shell hit the ground some distance away. In view of the condition of the top of Exhibit 8, I find it difficult to believe that that tank went through the roof of the garage before there had been a prior explosion causing the roof to be moved. There is also the evidence of the witness Dumas, who on the night in question was on the same street as the garage and about three hundred feet south of it, and who testified that he heard three detonations, the first two being not as loud as the last.\nI have not overlooked that Mr. Pitts, the manager of the defendant company, testified that the presence in the tank of acetone was not a safety factor. In this he is quite wrong, as Mr. Hazen was clear that the absence of acetone, or a sufficient quantity of it, would have a tendency to make the tank more liable to explode. But, as a practical matter, Mr. Pitt\u2019s erroneous opinion has no application. The presence of acetone allows the tank to be charged with a greater quantity of acetylene than would otherwise be the case, and from the records it appears that the weight of Exhibit 8, without any acetone, was ninety-three pounds; the acetone put in by the manufac- turer was twenty pounds; on each occasion that the tank was returned to the defendant, it was weighed in order to discover if it were deficient in acetone, and on three occasions acetone was added.\nAssuming that section 15 of The Sale of Goods Act applies to the container as well as the acetylene gas, my view is that there was a prior volume explosion which caused Exhibit 8 to explode. Whether that be so or not, there is not sufficient in the evidence to warrant the inference that the tank and its contents were not reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were intended or that they were not of merchantable quality. I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nCROCKET J.\u2014This action, as originally brought, claimed damages to the amount of $25,666.90, for the destruction of the plaintiff\u2019s garage and contents as well as other property and for personal injury suffered by the plaintiff in consequence of the explosion of an acetylene gas tank, through the alleged negligence of the defendant in storing acetylene gas in a defective and unsafe tank, the bottom part thereof \u201cnot being properly and securely welded and affixed to the remaining portion.\u201d\nThe respondent in its statement of defence admitted that it was the manufacturer and distributor of acetylene and other gases, but alleged that it did not manufacture tanks in which to distribute the gas but purchased them from a reliable manufacturer, and that if the tank in question was defective or unsafe it had no knowledge thereof. It also pleaded unavoidable accident and alternatively that the accident was due entirely to the negligence of the appellant.\nThe plaintiff joined issue on the statement of defence and gave notice that he desired the issues of fact to be tried by a jury, but when the case was called for trial at the L\u2019Orignal sittings of the court in March, 1938, the presiding judge (Chevrier, J.) granted a motion of the defendant\u2019s counsel to strike out the jury notice on the ground that the pleadings involved the consideration of technical questions and expert testimony relating to the cause of the explosion, and the action was consequently one that could better be tried without a jury. The action, therefore, was tried as a non-jury case. After the trial had continued for several days and the plaintiff\u2019s expert witnesses had been examined, cross-examined and re-examined as to the possible causes of the explosion, Mr. Beament, who had then joined Mr. Marion as the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, made an application to amend the statement of claim by adding a claim for breach of the implied conditions of the contract of sale and hire, under which the acetylene gas had been delivered to the plaintiff in the said tank, in that the said gas and\/or tank were not reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were sold and\/or hired, and were not of merchantable quality. Although Mr. Phelan, the defendant\u2019s counsel, strenuously objected to the allowance of the amendment upon the ground that it would shift the whole basis of the plaintiff\u2019s case from one of tort to one of contract and seriously prejudice the defendant if the trial were proceeded with upon that basis, inasmuch as he had in the preparation of the defence naturally considered the case only from the point of view of negligence, he stressed on the other hand the great expense already incurred by the defendant in connection with the attendance of its expert witnesses, which could not be fully compensated for by any terms that could well be granted on the suggested order for adjournment. At the same time he admitted that the facts involved were the same, whether the question of the defendant\u2019s liability were considered from the viewpoint of negligence or that of breach of contract. After a long discussion between His Lordship and counsel, in which it appeared that the plaintiff did not intend to adduce any further evidence and offered to recall any witnesses already examined in order that the defendant\u2019s counsel might cross-examine them further if he desired and to submit to any terms that might be imposed, His Lordship intimated that he would allow the amendment, and granted a recess for two hours to afford Mr. Phelan an opportunity of considering whether he should prefer to have the trial adjourned to the next court or to proceed. When the court reconvened Mr. Phelan announced his decision to proceed with the trial and expressly stated that he did not desire to further examine any of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses. The trial was accordingly proceeded with upon the pleadings as amended and con- tinued for another two or three days, which were mostly occupied with the evidence of Mr. Coakley, factory manager of the Pressed Steel Tank Co., of Milwaukee, from whom the defendant had purchased the alleged faulty tank and many other similar tanks, and that of two other expert witnesses. Practically the whole of the testimony of these three witnesses was directed to the defendant\u2019s claim that the explosion of the alleged defective tank, described in the case as Exhibit No. 8, was caused by a so-called external volume explosion, which had occurred in the garage immediately before in connection with a welding job, on which the plaintiff was engaged at his bench from 7 to 10 feet distant from that tank, though he was making no use of it for that purpose, and it had not been used since its delivery to the garage some weeks before.\nAt the conclusion of the evidence the learned trial judge heard the arguments of opposing counsel and reserved judgment thereupon. This he delivered some weeks later. While stating in his reasons therefor that he could not find that the weld was defective, as alleged in the original statement of claim, he did expressly find that the tank exploded through no fault of the plaintiff and that its explosion was \u201cdue to some defect in the internal structure or set-up of the cylinder, using the words in their widest application\u201d, and further \u201cthat the cylinder exploded by reason of extremely high internal pressure only, due to some internal structural defect,\u201d and that it was not of merchantable quality. He allowed the plaintiff $13,565.95 for the damages sustained thereby.\nThe defendant thereupon appealed to the Court of Appeal, which allowed the appeal and dismissed the action with costs on the ground that it was not open to the trial judge to enter upon a consideration of all the possible causes of the explosion or \u201cto find that the explosion was due to some unknown defect in the cylinder not alleged by the plaintiff, and the nature of which the evidence does not disclose.\u201d\nIt is quite apparent, I think, from the reasons given for the judgment on appeal that the court altogether ignored the amendment of the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, which the trial judge granted on the trial in the circumstances above stated, and treated the case as one which could only be determined upon the basis of the original claim for negligence in connection with the improper and insecure welding of the base to the remaining portion of the tank.\nWith all respect, I am of opinion that the Court of Appeal was not justified in so holding, in view of the course of the whole trial and particularly of the defendant\u2019s election in the circumstances above stated to proceed with its defence on the amended statement of claim rather than take the suggested adjournment on terms, and that the defendant was in no way prejudiced by the amendment. It was, to my mind, not only open to but the duty of the learned trial judge to determine the question of the liability of the defendant for breach of the implied conditions of the contract of sale and hire under the added claim, as well as that for the negligence first charged. Although founded on tort, the claim was one which manifestly arose out of the relationship of purchaser or lessee and vendor or lessor as between the plaintiff and the defendant, and necessarily involved proof of the existence of some fault in the tank in question, to which its explosion and the resulting damage was attributable. The defendant\u2019s own plea of unavoidable accident or, in the alternative, that the explosion of the tank was entirely due to the negligence of the plaintiff, called for the full investigation of all possible causes of the tank\u2019s explosion, and it was indeed to that issue, as the record discloses, that practically the whole of the evidence, apart from that bearing on the assessment of damages, was directed from the beginning to the end of the trial. The Court of Appeal having erroneously, as we think, concluded that, notwithstanding the allowance of the amendment, the case could not be considered as involving any claim for breach of the implied conditions of the contract of sale and hire beyond that charged in the original statement of claim, the question remains as to whether upon that branch of the case the learned trial judge was warranted in holding the defendant responsible for the explosion as having been caused by some internal structural defect in the tank, and for the damages the plaintiff sustained as a direct consequence thereof. Although the amendment itself does not say so, it is clear that the claim thereunder is based upon the law as declared in s. 15 of the Ontario Sale of Goods Act. This enactment is in its terms the same as that contained in s. 14 of the Imperial Sale of Goods Act, 1893, 56 & 57 Vict., ch. 71, and, like the latter, is a codification of principles long recognized by the common law of England. It cannot be questioned, I think, that the amendment sets up a good and valid cause of action. Whether there was a sale only of the acetylene and a mere bailment of the tank, there can be no doubt that the acetylene could only be supplied in a tank of a particular description nor that both the acetylene and the tank were supplied by the defendant under a contract of sale within the meaning of the law, as declared by s. 15 of the Ontario Sale of Goods Act. See Geddling v. Marsh[9].\nApart from the cause of the explosion, there was no serious dispute as to any of the factors essential to fix the defendant with responsibility as seller under the added claim. It was admitted that the defendant company was a manufacturer and distributor of acetylene and other gases, which could only be supplied to its customers in tanks specially designed and constructed in order to insure their safe transportation and storage when charged. The gas and tank, therefore, were clearly goods of a description, which it was in the course of the defendant\u2019s business to supply, and were in fact supplied to the plaintiff under its agreement of sale. That the defendant knew the particular purpose for which this and other similar tanks, charged with acetylene and oxygen, were required and, in the circumstances, that the plaintiff relied on the skill or judgment of the defendant, not only in relation to the manufacture of the gas, but the safety and security of the tanks in which the gases were delivered, can hardly be questioned upon the evidence as it appears in the record. The contract of sale, under which the defendant supplied these tanks and their contents to the plaintiff, must be taken, I think, to have carried with it an implied warranty that they were, not only of merchantable quality, but fit for the particular purpose for which they were supplied.\nBoth parties clearly recognized that the essential issue centred in the cause of the tank\u2019s explosion, and that the explosion could only have been brought about by one or other of three possible means. These were described as: 1st, the application of considerable external heat; 2nd, external violence or concussion such as a prior or contemporaneous volume explosion, and 3rd, internal defect in the tank itself. It was common ground that if the first two of these possible causes were negatived, the explosion was necessarily attributable to the third. Mr. Coakley, the factory manager of the Pressed Steel Tank Co., from whom the defendant purchased this and other acetylene gas tanks, was asked if it was fair to say that this cylinder, Exhibit No. 8, did not explode by reason of any locally applied heat. His answer was:\nA. The examination of it does not reveal evidence of any locally applied heat.\nQ. And, if it did explode by reason of any locally applied heat, it would not comply with the Canadian Railway Commission specification No. 8, would it? Isn\u2019t that correct? A. That is correct.\nQ. So that you would not suggest that it could be locally applied heat that caused this cylinder to explode? A. I don\u2019t see how it could be.\nQ. So that we have eliminated one possible cause? A. No, it could be in a fire and heat would explode it. Locally applied heat is heat applied at only one point.\nQ. There is no evidence of anything like that, is there? That external fire caused this explosion? A. I can\u2019t honestly say there is.\nQ. In point of actual fact, I notice from the base of the tank that it looks as though those fusible plugs had been forced out? A. That would happen due to the bottom being reversed, the holes becoming larger.\nQ. Whereas, if the cylinder had been subjected to heat, the plugs would have fused? A. Yes.\nQ. Rather than being forced out, as they appear to have been? A. Yes.\nQ. So that, in your opinion, would negative the theory that this cylinder exploded by reason of extraneous heat? A. I can\u2019t see any reason for that.\nQ. Now we are down to two possibilities, external shock or inherent vice in the cylinder itself? A. That is right.\nQ. And if the evidence were to satisfy His Lordship that this explosion of the cylinder, Exhibit No. 8, were not caused by external shock, then we would be left with one thing only, inherent vice? A. Yes, sir.\nThe following questions and answers on the same subject appear in the cross-examination of Mr. Pitts, the President and General Manager of the defendant company:\nQ. If a cylinder explodes without any abnormal external cause, would that be evidence that the cylinder was defective in some respect? A. I think so, yes.\nQ. That is, either the cylinder or its contents? A. Yes.\nQ. Should a proper cylinder of that kind, properly charged, explode? A. No. Q. And if, without any other cause, it does explode, that is evidence that either the cylinder or its contents are defective? A. Without any other cause, yes.\n* * *\nQ. And a cylinder that will explode without external cause, you would hardly say it is fit for the purpose for which it is intended? A. If it exploded without any cause, I would say it was an unfit cylinder.\nAnd from the cross-examination of Mr. Hazen, Vice-President of the Milton Hershey Co., Montreal\u2014the defendant\u2019s principal independent expert witness:\nQ. Now, talking of a cylinder in good condition and properly charged, you came to the conclusion that it can only be set off by one of two methods. I wrote them down as you gave them. The first one was violent concussion and the second one was the application of heat, and then you paraphrased \u201cViolent concussion\u201d by saying \u201cviolent shock.\u201d Is that right? A. Yes.\nQ. So that, if this cylinder exploded, and assuming that, as you have sworn, that it was a cylinder in good condition, it must either have been the subject of the application of considerable heat or it must have been the subject of a violent concussion. Is that correct, Mr. Hazen? A. I would say so, yes.\nQ. So that, if the evidence were to establish that, prior to the explosion of this cylinder, it had not been subjected to the application of considerable heat, nor had it been subjected to any violent concussion then we would be left with the only conclusion that it exploded by reason of some defect in the cylinder or in the contents themselves? A. That would be true, yes.\nWith external heat definitely eliminated as a possibility, as was conceded all around, there remained but one thing, other than inherent defect, to account for the explosion of the cylinder, Exhibit No. 8, viz.: that it had been subjected to concussion from a prior or contemporaneous volume explosion in the garage, whereby the internal pressure in this cylinder had been so increased as to cause it to blow up. Although Professor Jamieson of McGill University, another expert witness examined for the defence, testified that in his opinion an internal pressure must have developed of at least 1,350 pounds to the square inch before the cylinder blew up, and that a volume explosion such as Mr. Hazen had suggested could have increased the internal pressure in a cylinder to that extent, the defendant\u2019s whole case in support of the hypothesis of a prior volume explosion in the garage rested in the main on the suggestion of Mr. Hazen that a so-called flash-back had occurred in the oxygen tube of the welding apparatus the plaintiff was using at the time, from which flash-back a volume explosion might have developed in the garage by reason of its releasing gases, which subsequently became ignited. The oxygen tube, in which he suggested the flash-back occurred, led, of course, from the oxygen tank the plaintiff was using, and this naturally in conjunction with an acetylene tube leading from another tank containing acetylene, described as Exhibit No. 13, to the welding torch, in which the mixture of the two gases was controlled by valves. The oxygen and acetylene tanks were braced together on a rack situated a few feet east of the welding bench where the plaintiff was doing his welding job. Yet Mr. Hazen admitted that if gasolene fumes were the basis of the suggested volume explosion \u201cthey naturally did not come from the acetylene tank,\u201d and that, as far as gasolene fumes were concerned, the flashback had nothing to do with it. It is somewhat difficult to follow his varying statements in this connection, and I therefore quote from his evidence precisely as it appears in the record of his cross-examination:\nQ. Assuming for a minute that it was gasoline fumes that caused this volume explosion, that heat of the torch itself would have been sufficient to ignite those fumes, would it not? A. Yes.\nQ. And, therefore, the flash-back would have nothing to do with the ignition of gasoline fumes, if it were gasoline fumes that caused that explosion? A. I think not.\nQ. That is correct? A. I think so.\nQ. So that, if the explosion was caused by gasoline fumes, the flash-back has no relevancy? A. Not at all.\n* * *\nBy His Lordship: Q. Mr. Beament asked if your conclusion was that the only relevancy of the flash-back is if it was the cause of releasing from the acetylene tank in use sufficient acetylene to form an explosive mixture in the garage. A. It might have ignited them. I don\u2019t think it is likely, but it might have.\nBy Mr. Beament: Q. Would not the torch itself have ignited the gasoline fumes without any flash-back? A. The torch? It would probably be out when the flash-back occurred.\nQ. Mr. Hazen, please. If there were gasoline fumes in that room, they didn\u2019t come there suddenly, like that (snapping fingers)? A. No.\nQ. Then the torch was going, admittedly, or certainly up to the time when the flash-back occurred. Isn\u2019t that true? A. Yes.\nQ. A flash-back could not occur unless the torch was going? Isn\u2019t that true? A. Certainly.\nQ. Could a flash-back occur if the torch wasn\u2019t burning? A. Certainly not.\nBy His Lordship: You are going to leave me under the impression that there were gasoline fumes in the garage. I can assume for the sake of argument that there were. But I do not know whether there were or not. By Mr. Beament: I am trying to eliminate gasoline fumes as a possibility, my Lord. I am trying to get the witness to say if there had been gasoline fumes in that garage, they would have been ignited long before by the torch.\nBy Witness: That is so.\nBy Mr. Beament: Q. So that the flash-back has no relevancy to the ignition of the gasoline fumes? They would have been ignited anyway? A. Yes, they would.\nQ. And, when we finally get down to it, the only thing to give relevancy to the flash-back is that it might have caused the escape of acetylene from the cylinder, Exhibit No. 13. Is that the only Televancy of the flash-back, that it might have caused the escape of acetylene from Exhibit No. 13? A. Yes, the flash-back might have caused the release of gases from the cylinder in use, Exhibit No. 13.\nQ. That is the only relevancy of the flash-back? A. As far as that cylinder is concerned.\nQ. As far as anything is concerned? A. Yes, I think so.\nQ. Then the only relevancy of the flash-back was that it might have caused the release of acetylene fumes from Exhibit No. 13 which, on ignition, might have exploded?\nA. I think so.\nQ. You have examined the cylinder, Exhibit No. 13? A. Yes.\nQ. And you tell me that, as far as your examination would disclose, there was nothing defective about it? A. That is true, except that the plugs were melted out.\nQ. But that has no relevancy to our discussion at the present time? A. Not now.\nThen he admitted that the valve equipment that was on Exhibit No. 13 had not in any way been affected by the explosion and that there was no apparent place from which anything could escape, so that if there was an escape of acetylene consequent on the flash-back, if there was a flash-back, it must have taken place after the acetylene had passed through the valve. I may say here that both the acetylene and oxygen tanks, which the plaintiff was using in his welding job when the explosion occurred, admittedly were found intact on the floor of the garage after the explosion and also numerous pieces of burning asbestos saturated with liquid acetone containing acetylene in solution, which could only have come from the cylinder Exhibit No. 8 when it exploded. There was also evidence of portions of rubber oxygen and gasolene tubes of the welding apparatus having been burned in varying degrees while a length of about 7 feet of the rubber hose was entirely missing, which Mr. Hazen admitted might have been burned by an external flame.\nWhether the balance of probability lay on the side of the defendant\u2019s claim that Exhibit No. 8 blew up in consequence of a prior volume explosion caused by a flash- back in the welding apparatus or on the side of the plaintiff\u2019s claim that it exploded in consequence of its own internal defect was the problem which it was the special duty of the learned trial judge to determine. This involved a careful consideration, not only of the testimony of Mr. Hazen and the other expert witnesses for the defence, but of the whole evidence on both sides, which the record shews His Lordship followed with the closest possible attention throughout. Having concluded, as he did, \u201cthat the cylinder exploded by reason of extremely high internal pressure only, due to some internal structural defect,\u201d I am not, after anxious consideration of all the relevant testimony, prepared to say that that finding was wrong, or that there was not sufficient evidence to warrant it.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and restore the trial judgment with costs throughout.\nDAVIS J.\u2014The action out of which this appeal arises was brought by the appellant, the owner and operator of a garage and motor car repair shop, against the respondent company, which is a manufacturer and distributor of acetylene and other gases, for damages for personal injuries and property loss sustained by him as the result of an explosion on his premises. The explosion was a very severe one, as is shown by the amount of the damages, and assessed by the trial judge at $13,565.95.\nThat a particular steel tank filled with acetylene gas which the respondent had sold and delivered under contract to the appellant had actually exploded on the appellant\u2019s premises at the time and in the place complained of, is not in dispute. The base of the tank or container (commonly called \u201cthe cylinder\u201d) was found after the explosion on the floor of the garage, while the body of the tank, which had been blown through the roof of the garage, was found with its nose embedded in a field some 200 feet away from the garage. The explosion, whatever was its cause, practically demolished the garage building, killed a customer who was standing in the garage near an open door and caused serious and permanent injuries to the appellant himself.\nThe appellant in the ordinary course of his business carried on welding operations by the use of a mixture of oxygen and acetylene gases. The respondent manufac- tured and distributed both these gases and the appellant regularly purchased his supplies of these gases from the respondent. The respondent did not itself manufacture the tanks or containers into which it put the acetylene gas but it supplied and delivered the gas in tanks or containers which its customers were required to return when the contents had been used. The container was not to be retained for more than 90 days and a nominal charge per week was made for its retention after 30 days. When the explosion in question occurred the 90 days had not expired, though nothing really turns on that point.\nThere is no direct evidence as to how the explosion actually occurred and a mass of evidence was given, including much expert testimony, in an endeavour to indicate what really happened, but, as might well be expected under such circumstances, the real cause can only be inferred from the known facts.\nMr. Phelan, counsel for the respondent, in a very careful review of the evidence which extended to two large printed volumes, left me in a great deal of doubt as to what was the real cause of the explosion that did all the damage\u2014in fact I think I should lean to the view that the explosion of the particular tank in question may have been caused by something that occurred at the moment in the welding apparatus which the appellant had been operating some 10 or 15 feet away from the corner of the building in which the particular tank had been resting for some two months, awaiting use when the contents of another tank then in use had been exhausted. This welding operation was being done on a table and the apparatus consisted of a torch and two rubber tubes leading from two separate tanks on the floor, one tank of oxygen and the other of acetylene. The appellant had finished his welding and had turned off the supply of oxygen to his welding torch and was preparing to turn off the acetylene when the explosion occurred. It is difficult for me to believe that the unopened tank in question resting on its weight in the corner exploded of itself. But on the other hand, if the initial explosion occurred in the welding operation it is strange that the two tanks being used in the welding operation remained intact where they were on the floor near the welding table. From each of these tanks rubber hoses had led to the welding torch and the flow of gas was controlled by valves on the hoses. It is a question of fact, and the learned trial judge saw and heard a great many witnesses and, it is plain, very carefully followed the evidence. It requires more than a doubt or suspicion on my part, merely reading the printed evidence, to disturb the finding of fact of the trial judge. One thing is plain on the evidence and that is that the acetylene tank in the corner exploded and that it could not have exploded except from one of three causes: (1) external heat, or (2) external force, or (3) some inherent defect. No one suggested that there was any external fire or heat, and the trial judge has found definitely that the explosion was not caused by any external force, though the respondent\u2019s evidence was directed towards the theory that it was the force of an earlier explosion, called a \u201cflash-back,\u201d in the hose of the oxygen tank which the appellant had been using in his welding operation that had caused the unused and unopened acetylene tank in the corner to explode. There seems to me to be much to support that theory and I was impressed with it; but the trial judge, after seeing the witnesses and hearing all the evidence, expressly excluded this as the cause. The trial judge was very definite on that point:\nI am also convinced that the explosion of the cylinder was not due to what has been described as outside concussion, due to external violence, as for instance from a volume explosion.\nFurther, the trial judge found as a fact that the cylinder did not explode through any fault of the plaintiff.\nThat left only some inherent defect in the tank or its contents as the cause of the explosion. The properties of acetylene gas and the complex process of handling and transporting the gas are, with detailed references to the evidence, set out in the respondent\u2019s factum as follows:\nThe cylinders are made of steel plate, of a specified strength; drawn to produce a shell. Into the top of the shell is welded a boss which carries the valve and valve cap. Before the bottom is welded on, the cylinder is completely filled with an approved porous filler\u2014asbestos, which is put in under pressure of 80 to 100 pounds. This filler serves to break up the mass of acetylene gas which later is compressed into the tank, so that in the event that ignition takes place, propagation of the flame is confined to the small spaces in the porous filling: In the base of the tank are inserted three fusible plugs; the metal of which fuses at 212 degrees Fahrenheit, and thereby the compressed gases are released without explosive force. The bottom is then welded on to the cylinder. The tanks are then subjected to pressure tests of 500 pounds. * * * Into the porous filling of the tank so constructed is inserted a liquid known as acetone which dissolves the acetylene gas later forced into it under pressure. The acetone dissolves about twenty-five times its own volume of gas, thus increasing the economy of the container and furnishing at the same time a very definite safety factor because the acetone tends to prevent disintegration of the acetylene.\nThe learned trial judge in carefully considered written reasons gave judgment in favour of the appellant for the amount of the damages upon the finding that \u201cthe explosion was due to some defect in the internal structure or set-up of the cylinder, using the words in their widest application.\u201d The respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and its appeal was allowed and the action was dismissed with costs. From that judgment an appeal was taken to this Court.\nThe real difficulty in the appeal turns on the pleadings. The difference between the view of the case taken in the Court of Appeal and my own view of the case is a difference in what is to be taken as the proper interpretation of the pleadings. The appellant in the first place put his claim in tort, and solely in tort, in the statement of claim. I quote paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of the statement of claim:\n2. On or about the 31st day of March, 1937, the defendant delivered or caused to be delivered to the garage of the plaintiff two tanks of acetylene gas required by the plaintiff.\n3. The plaintiff carefully put aside, for future use, one of those tanks in the exact condition in which it was received from the defendant and proceeded to use the other tank for welding operations and was still using it for that purpose in the evening of May 28th, 1937, when the unused tank, through no interference or fault whatsoever on the part of the plaintiff or anyone in or near the garage, suddenly exploded.\n4. The plaintiff alleges that the explosion was caused or brought about by and through the sole negligence of the defendant, its servants and employees, in storing under compression acetylene gas in a defective and unsafe tank, the bottom part of which, not being properly and securely welded and affixed to the remaining portion, suddenly and violently separated from it with the resulting explosion.\nAt the trial, after the plaintiff had put in all his evidence over a period of some six days, his counsel moved the trial judge to grant an amendment to the statement of claim. The amendment asked for was in the following words:\n5. (a) The plaintiff purchased the acetylene gas contained in the said tank from the defendant and hired the said tank and the contents thereof (other than the said acetylene gas) from the defendant having made known to the defendant the purpose for which the said gas and tank were required and relying upon the skill or judgment of the defendant, the said gas and tank being goods which it was in the course of the defendant\u2019s business to supply. The said gas was purchased and the said tank was hired by description. The said gas and\/or tank were not reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were sold and\/or hired and were not of merchantable quality. The damages suffered by the plaintiff as herein set out were the direct and proximate result of the said goods not being reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were sold and\/or hired and not being of merchantable quality.\nThe application for the amendment was opposed by counsel for the respondent and there was considerable argument by counsel for both parties as to the amendment sought to be made. The appellant\u2019s counsel made it plain that he did not desire to offer any further testimony in the case even if the amendment were granted but simply desired to set up on the facts that had been already proved a case against the respondent in contract upon the ground that the acetylene gas and tank which had been supplied under a contract of sale were not reasonably fit for the purpose for which they had been supplied and were not of merchantable quality, and that the damages suffered by the appellant as disclosed in the evidence were the direct result. During the discussion on the application for the amendment Mr. Phelan said very properly that\nthe object of [the proposed amendment] is to shift the whole basis of the plaintiff\u2019s case from one of tort to one of contract. It is true that the facts are the same, as my friend says, but the application of those facts to the law is quite a different problem.\nThe trial judge expressed the view that, the trial having then gone on for so many days and the amount claimed being a large amount, he was inclined to allow the amendment. \u201cI think a very great hardship would be occasioned if I limited the scope of the action.\u201d After a couple of hours\u2019 adjournment in which the respondent\u2019s counsel was given time to consider whether he would go on with the defence or take advantage of the trial judge\u2019s offer that the case could stand over till the next sittings of the Court (the case was being tried at L\u2019Orignal without a jury), Mr. Phelan stated that the defence would go on rather than have the case stand over. The amendment was treated as duly made to the pleadings, and the trial proceeded.\nThere was no proof at the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case when the amendment was asked for, nor any proof on the whole of the evidence, of the act of negligence alleged in the original pleading that \u201cthe bottom part\u201d of the tank had not been \u201cproperly and securely welded and affixed to the remaining portion.\u201d And it is not contended by counsel for the appellant that there was any such proof. Obviously that was apparent to counsel for the appellant at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence and was the practical reason for the amendment to put the case on the contractual relationship that existed between the parties on the sale of the acetylene gas. But when the case got to the Court of Appeal that Court took the view that the amendment must be treated as limited to the particular cause of complaint set out in the original statement of claim, that is, that the bottom part of the tank had not been properly and securely welded and affixed to the remaining portion, and that that was the only issue which the Court could consider. There being no evidence to support a claim based on that narrow ground, and that feature of the case being really conceded by the present appellant, the Court of Appeal appear, as stated by counsel to us, to have taken the view that the whole evidence could not properly be reviewed and considered by the Court on the wider basis of a claim in contract for failure to supply the goods reasonably fit for the purpose for which they had been sold. When the case came before this Court, without deciding at the time whether the amendment should be treated as so limited or not, we heard argument upon the whole of the evidence as if the amendment were wide enough to found the action in contract on the ground of failure by the vendor to supply the goods under the contract to the purchaser in reasonably fit condition. I think we are all of the opinion that the amendment cannot properly be read as limited to a claim in contract based solely on the allegation that the bottom part of the tank had not been properly secured to the upper portion. It must be apparent that such an amendment would have served no practical purpose, because, if it could not be proved as a fact that the welding at the base of the container had been defective and that that caused the explosion, then it did not matter that proof of negligence in that respect might not be necessary in an action on a contract for the sale of goods though it would be necessary in an action in tort, or, to put it another way, if you proved as a fact that the welding at the base of the container had been defective it would, in the case of a highly explosive liquid, be per se evidence of negligence and you would not need to fall back on a claim in contract. The practical view of the amendment, as it suggested itself to the trial judge as well as to counsel for the respondent was, in the words of Mr. Phelan during the discussion of the proposed amendment as above referred to, \u201cto shift the whole basis of the plaintiff\u2019s case.\u201d\nIt is to be regretted that we have not had the advantage of a consideration of the case by the members of the Court of Appeal on the basis of the amendment being wide enough to cover a case of goods supplied under a contract of sale. The provisions of sec. 15 of the Ontario Sale of Goods Act (R.S.O., 1937, ch. 180) follow the Imperial Act, 56 and 57 Vict., ch. 71, sec. 14, in that where a buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required so as to show that the buyer relies on the seller\u2019s skill or judgment and the goods are of a description which it is in the course of the seller\u2019s business to supply, whether he be the manufacturer or not, there is an implied condition that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose. And, further, when goods are bought by description from the seller who deals in goods of that description (whether he be the manufacturer or not), there is an implied condition that the goods shall be of merchantable quality.\nThere can be no doubt on the evidence that the appellant as a motor car repair man was a regular customer of the respondent in the purchase of oxygen and acetylene gases for the purpose of his business, and that the respondent was a manufacturer and distributor of these gases and knew the particular purpose for which the gases were required and that the buyer relied on the seller\u2019s skill and judgment. That being so, and the facts in evidence being found by the trial judge to establish that the explosion of the acetylene tank in question was not caused by any external heat or by any external force or concussion but was caused by some inherent defect, the appellant was entitled to succeed in his action on the basis that the goods \u201csupplied under a contract of sale,\u201d to adopt the exact words of sec. 15 of the Sale of Goods Act, were not reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were sold and that the breach of the statutory condition was the direct cause of the appellant\u2019s damages.\nSomething was said during the argument that, the tank or container not being sold but only its contents, the Sale of Goods Act could not apply to the container. But both the container and its contents were \u201cgoods supplied under a contract of sale.\u201d Geddling v. Marsh[10].\nSome of the items in the assessment of damages, particularly with reference to the wife\u2019s illness, may be doubtful, but no serious objection was taken before us to the amount of damages assessed by the trial judge, and I do not think, in any event, that we should be justified in considering any revision of the items upon which the learned trial judge reached his ultimate amount.\nFor the reasons above given, the appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed and the judgment at the trial restored with costs throughout.\nHUDSON J.\u2014I am in general agreement with the views expressed by my brothers Crocket and Davis. My chief difficulty was to ascertain, if I could, the immediate cause of the explosion of the cylinder supplied by the defendant. On this question, the learned judges of the Court of Appeal did not find it necessary to come to a conclusion.\nConsideration of the evidence in the record leaves me in considerable doubt and, under these circumstances, I deem it my duty to accept the decision of the learned trial judge. See remarks of Lord Esher in Colonial Securities v. Massey[11]; Bigsby v. Dickinson[12].\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L.P.

No retail druggist shall sell or supply straight Codeine, whether in powder, tablet or liquid form, or preparations containing any quantity of any of the narcotic drugs mentioned in Parts I and II of the Schedule to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, mixed with medicinal or other ingredients, except upon the written order or prescription therefor signed and dated by a physician, veterinary surgeon or dentist whose signature is known to the said druggist, or, if unknown, duly verified before such order or prescription is filled. No such order or prescription shall be filled upon more than one occasion, and it shall be filed by such retail druggist and be available for subsequent inspection.\n3. Any person found in possession of Codeine or preparation containing narcotic drugs mentioned in Parts I and II of the Schedule to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, mixed with other medicinal ingredients, save and except under the authority of a licence from the Minister of Pensions and National Health first had and obtained, or other lawful authority, shall be liable to the penalties provided upon summary conviction under the provisions of Section 4 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act.\nThe Opium and Narcotic Drug Act referred to in the above quoted paragraphs of the Order is a Dominion statute (R.S.C., 1927, c. 144) which, as stated, contains a schedule wherein certain narcotic drugs are enumerated and which, up to the date of the Order, did not include Codeine.\nUnder the provisions of that Order, on November 6th, 1939, a charge was laid against the respondent, a retail druggist of the city of Montreal, for that\nhe did, without lawful excuse, disobey an Act of the Parliament of Canada for which no penalty or other mode of punishment is expressly provided, to wit: Paragraph two of regulations dated 11th day of September, 1939, of the War Measures Act, Chapter 206 of Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, by wilfully selling Codeine, a narcotic drug mentioned in Part Two of the Schedule to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act without first having had and obtained a written order or prescription therefor signed and dated by a physician, the whole contrary to Sec. 164 Criminal Code of Canada.\nAs must have been noted, the charge stated that \"no penalty or other mode of punishment is expressly provided\"; and it is a fact that the order or regulation under which the charge was laid does not contain any provision for a \"penalty or other mode of punishment.\"\nOn this charge, the trial judge (C. E. Gu\u00e9rin, Judge of Sessions of the Peace) liberated the accused and dismissed the complaint on the ground that the order or regulation, as a consequence of which the charge was laid, was not an \"Act of the Parliament of Canada or of any legislature of Canada,\" and that, therefore, section 164 of the Criminal Code did not apply.\nUpon appeal, this judgment was affirmed (Tellier, C.J., St. Germain and Bond, JJ. forming the majority; Barclay and Franc\u0153ur, JJ. dissenting). The formal judgment specifies as follows the ground in law on which the dissent is based:\nSur le motif qu'en loi le r\u00e8glement en question doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme faisant partie de la Loi des Mesures de Guerre, et que partant il y a lieu \u00e0 l\u2019application de l\u2019article 164 C. Cr.\nThe Attorney-General is now before this Court under section 1023 of the Criminal Code on the question of law over which there has been dissent in the court of appeal. Section 164 of the Criminal Code enacts specifically that the offence must consist in wilfully doing any act which is forbidden, or omitting to do any act which is required to be done by an \"Act of the Parliament of Canada.\"\nIt is an Act of the Parliament of Canada which the guilty person must have disobeyed without lawful excuse. And under those circumstances, if some penalty or other mode of punishment has not been otherwise expressly provided by law, the person found guilty is declared to be \"liable to one year's imprisonment.\" In the present case, although the respondent was charged of having disobeyed an Act of Parliament for which no penalty or other mode of punishment was expressly provided, it is stated in the information and complaint that the disobedience complained of was in reality a disobedience to paragraph 2 of the regulation already referred to in this judgment.\nThe information is, therefore, for having disobeyed not an Act of Parliament, but a regulation made under an Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nI agree with the trial judge and with the majority of the court of appeal that, in the premises, section 164 of the Criminal Code has no application.\nOf course, the War Measures Act enacts that the orders and regulations made under it \"shall have the force of law.\" It cannot be otherwise. They are made to be obeyed and, as a consequence, they must have the force of law. But that is quite a different thing from saying that they will be deemed to be an Act of Parliament.\nAn Act of Parliament is defined in the Criminal Code (sec. 2-1). It is there declared to include\nan Act passed or to be passed by the Parliament of Canada, or any Act passed by the legislature of the late province of Canada, or passed or to be passed by the legislature of any province of Canada, or passed by the legislature of any province now a part of Canada, before it was included therein.\nIn terms, therefore, the words: \"Act of the Parliament of Canada\" do not include regulations made under the provisions of such Act. It is clearly indicated in section 2 (1)\u2014which is the Interpretation clause of the Criminal Code\u2014that, in order to come under the appellation of an Act, the enactment must have been \"passed by the Parliament of Canada\" or \"by the legislature of any province of Canada,\" etc. A regulation made under an Act, and in particular a regulation under the War Measures Act, is not an enactment passed by Parliament; it is an enactment made by the Government.\nAn Act of Parliament, in order to become law and to form part of the statutes of Canada, must be adopted by the House of Commons, the Senate and receive the Royal Assent. It is debated publicly, to the knowledge of the public, and it comes into force on the day of its sanction by Royal Assent, which is given publicly.\nThe regulation takes the form of an Order in Council, debated secretly by the Privy Council and, generally speaking, will come into force as soon as it is signed by the Governor General, without there being any essential requirement for its publication.\nThese circumstances show the great difference between the Act of Parliament and the Order in Council, in so far as the people is concerned; and the difference takes even more importance when it is applied to section 164 of the Criminal Code, which requires for the guilt of an accused that he should have been doing or omitting any act \"wilfully\" and \"without lawful excuse.\"\nAn additional point in respect of the difference between an Act of Parliament or a statute and an Order in Council may be found in the Act respecting the Publication of the Statutes (ch. 2 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927) and in the Canada Evidence Act, with regard to evidence and to judicial knowledge.\nIt should be further noted that the delegation of powers to the Governor in Council, as expressed in the War Measures Act with regard to orders and regulations, merely enacts that these orders and regulations\nshall have the force of law, and shall be enforced in such manner and by such courts, officers and authorities as the Governor in Council may prescribe,\nwith further power given to the Governor in Council to \"prescribe the penalties that may be imposed for violation\" etc. These provisions in the Act are far from being as strong, for the purpose of the appellant's argument, as the similar provision contained, for example, in the Bankruptcy Act (c. 11, R.S.C., 1927): \"Such rules shall be judicially noticed and shall have effect as if enacted by this Act\" (s. 161, par. 3), or in the Explosives Act (c. 62, R.S.C., 1927):\nAll regulations made under this Act * * * shall have the same for.ce as if they formed part of this Act (s. 5, par. 2),\nor in the Fisheries Act (c. 73 of R.S.C., 1927):\nEvery offence against any regulation made under this Act may be stated as in violation of this Act (s. 46).\nor in the Meat and Canned Foods Act (c. 77, R.S.C., 1927):\nSuch orders and regulations shall have the same force and effect as if embodied in this Act (s. 4, par. 2).\nIn the statute now under consideration, provisions equivalent to those just quoted are nowhere to be found; and, on the contrary, the clear distinction between the Act itself and the regulations made under the Act is recognized.\nOne would think that if Parliament intended the regulations under the War Measures Act to be considered by the courts as forming part of the Act and, therefore, to be susceptible of the application of section 164 of the Criminal Code, Parliament would have said so at least in similar language to that employed in the several Acts just above referred to.\nFar from it, in paragraph 3 of the regulation made on the 11th day of September, 1939, the Governor in Council provides for penalties, and it is said therein that these penalties will be imposed \"under the provisions of section 4 of the Opium and Narcotics Act,\" thus relieving any offence against paragraph 3 of the regulation from the application of section 164 of the Criminal Code.\nThat indeed would lend colour to the respondent's argument that the regulations now under discussion, although in terms passed in virtue of the powers given to the Governor in Council by the War Measures Act, were, in fact, meant to affect the schedule of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, to which both the preamble of the Order in Council and paragraphs 2 and 3 thereof specifically refer. And it is interesting to note that, under that Act, the Governor in Council may make such orders and regulations as are deemed necessary or expedient for the carrying out of the intention of the Act, or may from time to time add to the schedule of the Act; but every Order in Council in that behalf must be published in the Canada Gazette and shall take effect only at the expiration of thirty days from the date of such publication (ss. 21 & 22).\nThe question is not whether the consent of Parliament may be expressed by delegated authority and that consequently it is not necessary that an Act should be complete when it emerges from the debates in Parliament or at the time it leaves the hands of the legislative body; but the only question we have to decide in this case is whether the Orders in Council made by force of the delegated authority are to be deemed equivalent to an Act of Parliament within the meaning of section 164 of the Criminal Code. It is not to the purpose to call them \"subordinate legislation\" or the \"complement of the legislation,\" for there is no denying the fact that the regulations provided for in the War Measures Act are not declared by Parliament to form part and parcel of the Act itself; and whether they are as effectual for the purpose of obedience and disobedience of the subject, they are not assimilable to the Act itself; and so far as concerns the application of section 164 of the Code, they may not be treated as if they had been enacted and were incorporated in the War Measures Act.\nThis view, it seems to me, is further strengthened by the fact that, by force of the Act itself, Parliament put it in the hands of the Governor in Council to prescribe the penalties that may be imposed for violation of the regulations, thus indicating further its intention that the matter should not be left to the general provisions contained in section 164 of the Code.\nWe have not here a statute such as was under consideration by the House of Lords in the case of Chartered Institute of Patent Agents v. Lockwood[3], where the words of the Act were that the rules \"shall be of the same effect as if they were contained in this Act and shall be judicially noticed.\" The distinction between that Act and the War Measures Act is abundantly clear.\nSo, in the case before the House of Lords in Minister of Health v. The King (on the prosecution of Yaffe) [4], where the language was:\nThe order of the Minister, when made, shall have effect as if enacted in this Act. It was held there that this enactment did not preclude the Court from calling in question the order of the Minister, where the scheme presented to him for confirmation is inconsistent with the provisions of the Act, although in the particular case the scheme, whatever its defects, was found to be an improvement scheme within the meaning of the Act. However, it is evident that the wording of the statute discussed in that case was far different from the wording of the War Measures Act, in so far as it concerns the point now submitted to this Court.\nWe have been referred also to a number of other decisions rendered in English cases. I have very serious doubt whether, in any event, these decisions could be allowed to prevail against our Criminal Code and the plain language of section 164. But, moreover, in those cases, the English courts were called upon to interpret statutes differing in language and in aim from the Acts now before this Court (see Lord Davey in Commissioners of Taxation v. Kirk[5]; and there is a clear distinction to be made between the present case and those in which the decisions referred to were rendered. In the latter, the offences against the regulations were common law misdemeanours before the statutes or the regulations prohibited them; in the matter now before us, the sale of Codeine never was in itself a misdemeanour; it was not even prohibited by the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act before the regulation of the 11th of September, 1939, came into force under the provisions of the War Measures Act, and for purposes which are there stated as being due to the existence of war. As I read the decisions, where an act, heretofore a misdemeanour at common law, is subsequently made an offence under the Criminal Code or under a statute or by virtue of the regulations made thereunder, if the code or the statute provides for no penalty as a consequence of the doing of the act which it prohibits, or of omitting the act which it requires to be done, the law steps in and establishes the mode of punishment; but if the act is made an offence merely as a result of the regulations and, I repeat, was not, up to the coming into force of the regulation, a common law misdemeanour, then the penalty must be found either in the regulation itself or must have been provided for by the Act of Parliament or the statute under which the regulation is made, or otherwise the regulation is inoperative for want of any sanction.\nFor all these reasons, I am of the opinion that section 164 of the Criminal Code does not apply to a charge such as that brought against the respondent and that, under the circumstances, the information and charge was rightly dismissed by the trial judge and by the Court of King's Bench.\nThe appeal to this Court should, therefore, be disallowed.\nThe judgment of Davis and Hudson JJ. (dissenting) was delivered by\nHudson J.\u2014The question for decision in this case is whether or not the breach of a duty validly created by an Order in Council passed under the War Measures Act is a breach of that statute itself, within the meaning of article 164 of the Criminal Code.\nThe power of Parliament to pass the War Measures Act is not now open to question; nor is there any doubt about the power of the Governor in Council under the provisions of this Act to pass the particular order under consideration: see In Re Gray[6]; Rex v. Halliday[7].\nThere is, however, in the Order in Council in question no provision for punishment in case of violation of its orders or regulations, although by the statute the Governor in Council were given express powers to impose penalties within prescribed limits.\nIn view of the absence of such a provision, the prosecution in this case was based on article 164 of the Criminal Code, which reads as follows:\nEvery one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to one year's imprisonment who, without lawful excuse, disobeys any Act of the Parliament of Canada or of any legislature in Canada, by wilfully doing any act which it forbids, or omitting to do any act which it requires to be done, unless some penalty or other mode of punishment is expressly provided by law.\nThe matter was heard in the first instance before Judge Gu\u00e9rin, Judge of the Sessions of the Peace at Montreal, who gave a considered judgment, in which he came to the conclusion that article 164 did not apply on the ground that the offence charged was a violation of an Order in Council and not of a statute. On appeal to the Court of King's Bench, this was affirmed by a majority of the court, Mr. Justice Barclay and Mr. Justice Franc\u0153ur dissenting.\nAt common law it was well settled that either a breach of a statute which concerns the public or any part of the public even where no penalty was prescribed, or a breach of an order or regulation passed under the authority of such a statute, was indictable: see Hawkins' Pleas of the Crown, 1824 edition, page 65, and The King v. Harris[8]. The general rule as stated in Stephen's Digest of the Criminal Law, article 166, is as follows:\nEvery one commits a misdemeanour who wilfully disobeys any statute of the realm by doing any act which it forbids, or by omitting to do any act which it requires to be done, and which concerns the public or any part of the public, unless it appears from the statute that it was the intention of the Legislature to provide some other penalty for such disobedience.\nand in support of this article the learned author refers to the common law authorities above referred to, as well as others. The article as drawn by him in this Digest appeared in substantially the same form in the draft Bill attached to the Report of the English Royal Commission on Criminal Law, 1880.\nA similar statement is made by the late Mr. Justice Burbidge in his Digest of Criminal Law of Canada, 1890, at page 115, in the following language:\nEvery one commits a misdemeanour who wilfully disobeys any statute by doing any act which it forbids or by omitting to do any act which it requires to be done, and which concerns the public or any part of the public, unless it appears from the statute that it was the intention of the Legislature to provide some other penalty for such disobedience.\nThe Canadian Criminal Code, as will be seen, follows very closely the language of this article. Beyond this and the statutes referred to by Judge Gu\u00e9rin and the Interpretation Act, there seems to be nothing bearing on the history of the present article 164 of the Code.\nSection 2 of the War Measures Act provides that \"all orders and regulations made under this section shall have the force of law.\"\nParliament has said to residents of Canada: \"You must obey what is prescribed by the Governor General in Council within the limits of the authority we here give them.\" If a person fails to observe the requirements of an Order in Council legally passed under this Act, he, in my opinion, disobeys the requirements of the statute itself, and in support of this, reference might be made to the case of Willingale v. Norris[9]. The head-note is:\nWhere a statute gives power to an authority to make regulations, a breach of the regulations so made is an offence against the provisions of the statute.\nA breach of regulations made under s. 4 of the Hackney Carriages Act, 1850, for enforcing order at standings for hackney carriages, is subject to the penalty of 40s. provided by s. 19 of the Hackney Carriage Act, 1853, for offences against that Act; inasmuch as the effect of s. 21 of the Act of 1853, which provides that the Acts of 1850 and 1853 are to be construed as one Act, is that s. 4 of the Act of 1850 has the same operation as if it were in fact contained in the Act of 1853, and therefore an offence against regulations made under s. 4 of the Act of 1850 is an offence against the Act of 1853.\nLord Alverstone, C.J. said at page 64:\nI am of opinion that the effect of the provision contained in s. 21 of the Act of 1853 was to make one code or statute for the regulation of hackney carriages, and that therefore a general penal clause for breach of the provisions of the Act of 1853 would apply to any provision contained in the three Acts of 1843, 1850, and 1853. That is the natural effect of this legislation where there are amending Acts intended to be read as one statute. If it be said that a regulation is not a provision of an Act, I am of opinion that R. v. Walker[10] is an authority against that proposition. I should certainly have been prepared to hold apart from authority that, where a statute enables an authority to make regulations, a regulation made under the Act becomes for the purpose of obedience or disobedience a provision of the Act. The regulation is only the machinery by which Parliament has determined whether certain things shall or shall not be done.\nand Mr. Justice Bigham at page 66:\nIn my opinion, to break the regulations made under the authority of a statute is to break the statute itself.\nand Mr. Justice Walton at page 67:\nUpon the second question, again not without some difficulty, I have come to the conclusion that in the present case there was charged against the respondent an \"offence against the provisions of this Act\" within the meaning of s. 19 of the Act of 1853. It seems clear that the Act of 1850 must be read as one\u2014construed as one\u2014with the Act of 1853, and therefore s. 4 of the Act of 1850 has now exactly the same effect as if it were in fact a section contained in the Act of 1853, and I have come to the conclusion that, if the facts should be proved hereafter, there was a breach of the provisions of s. 4 of the Act of 1850. That section gives power to make regulations, and I think there is involved in this that regulations so made must be obeyed, and if so it follows that a breach of such regulations is a breach of the law contained in that sect- ion. Section 4 of the Act of 1850 is made a provision of the Act of 1853, and therefore I think that the alleged offence was one \"against the provisions of this Act\" within the meaning of s. 19 of the Act of 1853. My difficulty has been\u2014and I had considerable doubt about it at first\u2014as to whether the words \"provisions of this Act\" can be read as meaning or including \"regulations made under this Act,\" assuming that the regulations were made under this Act, i.e., under the Act of 1853; whether there is not a distinction between provisions of the Act and regulations made under the Act; and whether one can read s. 19 of the Act of 1853 as if the words were \"for every offence against the provisions of this Act, or regulations made under this Act.\" The doubt largely arises from the fact that in the Act of 1853 there is a series of provisions, e.g., in ss. 14, 15 and 16, which are express provisions of the Act, and to which directly, and naturally, the words of s. 19 apply. My doubt is whether s. 19 was intended to apply to anything beyond offences against express provisions contained in the Act of 1853. However, on the whole I have come to the conclusion that it applies to any breach of what must be construed as being a provision of the Act of 1853. In my judgment an offence against s. 4 of the Act of 1850 is an offence within the meaning of s. 19 of the Act of 1853.\nThis case was followed in the case of Hart v. Hudson[11], and is accepted by all of the text books as stating the law.\nAnother argument was also put forward, which is best stated in the language of Mr. Justice St. Germain as follows:\nLe Parlement a donc d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 tous ses pouvoirs au gouverneur en conseil pour la mise en ex\u00e9cution des arr\u00eat\u00e9s minist\u00e9riels pass\u00e9s en vertu de la dite loi, sauf la restriction ci-dessus quant \u00e0 la peine, et il appartenait par cons\u00e9quent au gouverneur en conseil de mentionner dans le d\u00e9cret en vertu duquel l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en accusation que quiconque contreviendrait \u00e0 ce d\u00e9cret serait sujet \u00e0 telle peine fix\u00e9e par le dit d\u00e9cret; bien plus, il appartenait aussi au gouverneur en conseil de d\u00e9clarer que les peines qui seraient impos\u00e9es pour infractions aux arr\u00eat\u00e9s et r\u00e8glements \u00e9tablis sous la dite loi seraient ainsi impos\u00e9es, soit apr\u00e8s d\u00e9claration sommaire de culpabilit\u00e9 \"upon summary conviction\", ou soit par voie de mise en accusation \"upon indictment.\"\nIt seems to me, however, that article 164 of the Criminal Code was passed for the very purpose of providing for cases where penalties were not otherwise imposed by the law, and applies to violation of the provisions of such orders as form part of the law authorized by a statute, as in this case.\nWith all respect to those who take a different view, I agree with the views of Mr. Justice Barclay and Mr. Justice Franc\u0153ur in the court below, and would allow the appeal. Taschereau J.\u2014The respondent, a druggist, was acquitted by Mr. Justice Gu\u00e9rin, of Montreal, of the charge of having without lawful excuse disobeyed an Act of Parliament for which no penalty is expressly provided, to wit, paragraph (2) of Regulations, dated the 11th day of September, 1939, of the War Measures Act, by wilfully selling codeine, a narcotic drug, without first having obtained a written order or prescription signed and dated by a physician, thus, committing an offence against section 164 of the Criminal Code.\nThe Court of King's Bench of the province of Quebec (Barclay and Franc\u0153ur JJ. dissenting) affirmed the judgment of the trial judge and the Crown has appealed to this Court.\nThe reason given by the trial judge, and the Court of King's Bench, is that there is an offence under section 164 of the Criminal Code, only when the Act complained of is forbidden by an Act of the Parliament of Canada, or of any legislature of Canada, and that a regulation passed under the War Measures Act, is not an Act of Parliament. Section 164 of the Code reads as follows:\n164. Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to one year's imprisonment who, without lawful excuse, disobeys any Act of the Parliament of Canada or of any legislature in Canada, by wilfully doing any act which it forbids, or omitting to do any act which it requires to be done, unless some penalty or other mode of punishment is expressly provided by law.\nSection (3) of the War Measures Act confers special powers to the Governor General in Council and amongst other things says:\u2014\nThe Governor in Council may do and authorize such Acts and things and make from time to time such orders and regulations as he may, by reason of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection, deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, order and welfare of Canada.\nThe same section has also the following provisions:\u2014\nAll orders and regulations made under this section shall have the force of law and shall be enforced in such manner and by such courts, officers and authorities as the Governor in Council may prescribe, and may be varied, extended or revoked by any subsequent order or regulation.\nSection 4 of the same Act empowers the Governor in Council to prescribe the penalties that may be imposed for violations of orders and regulations made under this Act, and (to) also prescribe whether such penalties shall be imposed upon summary conviction or upon indictment, but no such penalty shall exceed a fine of five thousand dollars or imprisonment for any term not exceeding five years, or both fine and imprisonment.\nPursuant to these powers given by Parliament, the Governor General in Council passed regulations forbidding the sale of codeine without a written prescription signed by a physician, but these regulations do not contain any provisions for a penalty.\nIt is beyond all dispute that Parliament has power to authorize the making of such regulations. The only question is whether the Order in Council can be interpreted as meaning an Act of Parliament. There is no doubt that all orders and regulations made under section 3 of the War Measures Act have the force of law, and may be enforced as the Governor General may prescribe, but, can it be said that a disobedience to the Order in Council is a disobedience to the statute itself?\nIt has been submitted by the Crown that an Order in Council issued in virtue of the War Measures Act becomes an integral part of the Act and that a violation of the Order in Council is a violation of the War Measures Act itself, and, therefore, of an Act of Parliament.\nThe War Measures Act does not, like other Acts enacted by the Parliament of Canada, provide that the regulations passed by the Governor General in Council shall form part of the Act nor does it say that every offence against such regulations shall be considered as a violation of the Act. Such provisions may be found in the Bankruptcy Act, the Explosives Act, the Fisheries Act, etc., but nothing of the kind is incorporated in the War Measures Act, and we find no provisions analogous to those which are in the Acts above mentioned.\nI cannot come to the conclusion that in the present instance the violation of the Order in Council is tantamount to the violation of the War Measures Act. An Order in Council is passed by the Executive Council, and an Act of Parliament is enacted by the House of Commons and by the Senate of Canada. Both are entirely different, and unless there is a provision in the law stating that the Orders in Council shall be considered as forming part of the law itself, or that any offence against the regulations shall be a violation of the Act, it cannot be said that the violation of an Order in Council is a violation of an Act of Parliament within the meaning of section 164 of the Criminal Code.\nFurthermore, the word \"Act\" is defined in the Criminal Code as follows:\u2014\nSection 2, paragraph (1):\n\"any Act,\" or \"any other Act,\" includes any Act passed or to be passed by the Parliament of Canada, or any Act passed by the legislature of the late Province of Canada, or passed or to be passed by the legislature of any province of Canada, or passed by the legislature of any province now a part of Canada before it was included therein.\nIt is to my judgment impossible to stretch the meaning of the word \"Act\" to such an extent so as to include an Order in Council.\nI would, therefore, dismiss this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Omer Legrand.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Gendron, Monette & Gauthier.\n[1] (1940) Q.R. 69 K.B. 121; 74 Can.

The testatrix died on November 30, 1934. No dividends were earned or declared by the company in 1934 or 1935. The dividends on the preferred shares were at a fixed rate and cumulative, but payable only out of profits, and there were no profits sufficient to justify any dividend in those years.\nBaxter C.J. held (14 M.P.R. 306) that the shares vested in the legatees at the death of the testatrix; that the dividends, until the payment of which the shares were to remain in the estate, had never accrued, and the time fixed by the will for the shares to remain in the estate had elapsed, and the legatees were entitled to receive them. The Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick held (15 M.P.R. 130) that the legatees had a vested interest in the shares subject to a charge thereon in favour of the executors and trustees to the amount of two years' dividends on the preferred shares bequeathed, and that the legatees were entitled to delivery of the shares when the amount of the charge had been paid to the estate or the charge released. The specific legatees of shares appealed to this Court. In this appeal it was not disputed that the shares vested in the legatees on the death of the testatrix; but the respondents (residuary legatees) contended that the judgment of the Appeal Division was right.\nHeld: The judgment of Baxter C.J. should be restored. No dividends could be said to have \"accrued due\" or to be \"accruing due\" within the intendment of the reservation in the codicil. The shareholders acquired no right to payment of any dividends until there were profits and until the directors determined they should be paid (Bond v. Barrow Haematite Steel Co., [1902] 1 Ch. 353, at 362; In re Wakley, [1920] 2 Ch. 205, at 217). The reservation in the codicil was directed wholly to the payment of dividends on the bequeathed preferred shares during the anticipated period of the administration of the estate and could only apply to the payment of dividends as such to the executors and trustees of the estate, as the registered holders of the shares, by the company itself as a going concern, and clearly excluded any payment in lieu thereof by the beneficiaries, in whom the shares themselves were vested. The executors and trustees, as the registered holders of the shares, had never acquired the right to demand payment from the company of any dividends to cover either the year 1934 or the year 1935. It could not be said that the testatrix intended that the transfer of the shares to the legatees should be withheld indefinitely until the actual payment of the deferred dividends, which might possibly never happen. If such were the interpretation, the reservation (whether or not the words \"whether earned or declared or not\" be eliminated as repugnant) would have to be held void for uncertainty. The uncertainty would go, not to the validity of the bequests, but to the validity of the reservation (Egerton v. Earl Brownlow, 4 H.L.C. 1, at 181; Hancock v. Watson, [1902] A.C. 14, at 22; Fyfe v. Irwin, [1939] 2 All E.R. 271). The intention of the testatrix must be taken to be that the executors should not withhold transfer to the legatees beyond a year after her death and to withhold from them their right to receive the unearned and undeclared dividends only in the event of their being paid by the company to the executors, as the registered holders of the shares for the purpose of administering the estate, within a period of one year following the death of the testatrix.\nAPPEAL by certain legatees under the will, or codicil thereto, of Maria Famicha Ganong, deceased, from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division [1], which allowed (per Harrison and Fairweather JJ.; Grimmer J. dissenting) an appeal by the residuary legatees (the present respondents) from the judgment of Baxter C.J. [2].\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported and also in the reasons for judgment in the Courts below. Proceedings were begun by originating summons dated December 1st, 1939, for the determination of the following questions:\n1. Who are entitled to the shares in the capital stock of Ganong Bros., Limited, either common or preferred, bequeathed under any clauses of either the Last Will and Testament of Maria Famicha Ganong or the second codicil thereto?\n2. When are the beneficiaries of the said shares entitled to delivery thereof?\nBaxter C.J. held that the shares vested in the legatees at the death of the testatrix but that the executor could not transfer them upon the books of the company until certain dividends were paid; that no such dividends ever accrued; that the time fixed by the will had elapsed and that the legatees were entitled to receive their legacies. The Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick held that the legatees had a vested interest in the shares subject to a charge thereon in favour of the executors and trustees to the amount of two years' dividends on the preferred shares bequeathed and that the legatees were entitled to delivery of the shares when the amount of the charge had been paid to the estate or the charge released. (Grimmer J. dissented, agreeing with the judgment of Baxter C.J.). From that judgment the present appellants, who were legatees of shares in the said company under specific bequests thereof in the will or codicil appealed to this Court.\nJ. H. Drummie for the appellants.\nO. M. Biggar K.C., C. F. Inches K.C. and W. J. West for the respondents, residuary legatees.\nR. B. Hanson K.C. for the executor and trustee (respondent).\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCrocket J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, varying the judgment of Baxter, C.J., on an originating summons taken out by the sole executor of the estate of Maria Famicha Ganong, late of the town of St. Stephen, N.B., widow, deceased, for the interpretation of certain provisions of a codicil to her will concerning the disposition of some 4,800 and odd preferred shares and 4,000 and odd common shares of the capital stock of Ganong Bros. Ltd.\nThirty-seven hundred and ninety (3,790) of these preferred shares and 3,600 of the common shares had been bequeathed to her by her late husband, Gilbert W. Ganong, who died as Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick in the year 1916. All these shares she assigned to the Eastern Trust Company on March 15th, 1918, by a trust indenture made between herself as party of the first part, the said Trust Company as party of the second part, and William F. Ganong, James E. Ganong, Walter K. Ganong and Arthur D. Ganong, four nephews of her late husband, as parties of the third part. The indenture provided that all dividends payable thereon should be paid direct by the company to her \"under a sufficient order or orders therefor to be deposited by the trustee with the company,\" and that upon her death, provided there should not theretofore have occurred any default thereunder, the trustee should assign and transfer to the said four nephews all the said common shares to be divided amongst them as they should think proper, and the preference shares to a sister and fourteen nephews and nieces, including the said four nephews of her late husband, in the numbers respectively specified in a schedule annexed to the trust indenture, or to their legal representatives in the event of the death of any of them.\nThis indenture Mrs. Ganong expressly confirmed by par. 15 of her will, executed on September 25th, 1924, and declared to be binding on herself and her estate. At this time she was possessed of several hundred additional preferred and common shares of the capital stock of Ganong Bros. Ltd., of which she bequeathed 600 preferred shares to her brother, Edgar M. Robinson, in trust for his three children and 200 more to the children themselves. One hundred more preferred shares were to go to an Old Folks Home fund, 20 to the Chipman Memorial Hospital, while a further number of 120 were to be distributed as bequests to four named beneficiaries. No specific mention is made in the will of her common shares, and they would consequently fall into the residue of the estate, which was devised and bequeathed to her brother and sister in equal shares.\nThe trust deed provided for its revocation in the event of default in payment of the dividends, and, the company having failed in the years 1933 and 1934 to earn and declare the customary dividend upon the preferred shares, Mrs. Ganong, on September 29th, 1934, gave the necessary notice of default and of her intention to revoke the trust. Two weeks later, in anticipation of the reversion to her or her estate of these trust shares, she executed the codicil, which created the difficulty it became necessary to submit to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick for solution. Shortly after doing so Mrs. Ganong went to Florida, where it had been her custom for some years to spend the winter months, and there contracted pneumonia, from which she died on November 30th, 1934, and the Trust Company some time later returned the trust shares to the executors of her estate. The principal change the codicil made concerning the disposition of the 3,790 preferred and 3,600 common shares, which were still in the hands of the Eastern Trust Company at that time, was the revocation of par. 15 of the will, by which the testatrix had confirmed the trust assignment of March 15th, 1918, and their distribution among the beneficiaries named in pars. 14, 15 and 16 of the codicil. Of the 3,790 preferred shares, which were allotted by the schedule of the trust deed to the testatrix's deceased husband's sister, seven nephews and seven nieces, 3,290 were apportioned by par. 14 among the same nephews and nieces, except that one of the nephews, Frank Ganong, was replaced by his son, Edwin M. Ganong. The sister, Mrs. Perkins, to whom 583 shares had been allotted by the schedule of 1918, was not named. Par. 15 of the codicil, however, provided for the handing over of the remaining 500 of the 3,790 preferred shares to the Trustees of the Maria F. Ganong Old Folks' Home, as an additional endowment, when that institution should be incorporated by a proposed provincial statute, as \"The Gilbert White Ganong Memorial.\" Thus did pars. 14 and 15 of the codicil provide for the disposition of the full 3,790 preferred shares, then in the hands of the Trust Company. Two thousand of them were divided between the nephew Arthur D. Ganong and three of the surviving nieces, Mrs. Hyslop, Mrs. Christmas and Mrs. Caldwell, the last named being a daughter of Mrs. Perkins, and the remaining 1,290 among the other surviving nephews and nieces in varying lots of from 200 to 90 shares.\nPar. 16 of the codicil provided for the disposition of the common shares, then in the hands of the Trust Company. Of these the testatrix bequeathed 2,694 shares to the four nephews, who joined her in the execution of the trust deed of 1918, and 250 to Arthur D. Ganong's son. The remainder of the 3,600 shares were bequeathed to old employees and representatives of the company throughout Canada.\nAs regards the 1,040 additional preferred shares, which the testatrix held independently of the trust, the codicil made no material alteration in the provisions of her will of September 25th, 1924, for their disposition, except that she expressly revoked one of the bequests for 50 of these shares and directed her executors to purchase in lieu thereof a government annuity sufficient to yield an annual income to the legatee named of $400 for the term of her natural life.\nThe rights and interests of every beneficiary, to whom any lot of either the preferred or the common stock of the company was bequeathed, whether by the original will or by the codicil, are, however, materially affected by the provisions of par. 20 of the codicil. This paragraph revokes par. 17 of the will of September 25th, 1924, and provides in lieu thereof that her executors and trustees\nshall pay out of my personal estate any and all succession duties which may at my death become payable upon any of the bequests made in my said last will and testament or in any codicil thereto, including this codicil, it being my intention that all gifts and bequests, including gifts of shares in the capital stock of Ganong Bros. Limited, either preferred or common, to any nephew or niece of my late husband, shall be free from succession duty.\nPar. 17 of the original will, while providing that her executors should pay out of her personal estate all succession duties payable upon the bequests made thereby, distinctly provided that her estate should not be liable\nfor any succession duties or other dues, duties, taxes or other charges or expenses of any kind payable * * * upon or in respect of any moneys, stocks, shares of stocks, gifts or other benefits which have passed or which may hereafter pass under the provisions of the said trust agreement\nof March 15th, 1918. Having thus declared that all bequests of shares in the capital stock of Ganong Bros. Ltd., either preferred or common, to any nephew or niece of her late husband should be free from succession duty, as well as all other bequests, whether made by the original will or by the codicil, par. 20 of the codicil goes on to say:\nBut while I make the aforegoing provision with respect to succession duty it is my express will and intention and I hereby direct that notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained any and all of the shares of the capital stock of Ganong Bros. Limited, in and by my said last will and testament and in and by this second codicil to my said last will and testament bequeathed by me, shall be and remain the property of my estate and be held by my executors and trustees as part of my estate until all dividends on the preferred shares accrued to the date of my death have been paid in full and also until the two half yearly dividends which shall accrue immediately subsequent to the date of my death shall have been paid in full to my estate for the benefit thereof, it being my intention by this paragraph of this second codicil to my will that all dividends on said preferred shares accrued due to the date of my death, whether earned or declared or not, together with a full year's dividends accruing due after my death, whether earned or declared or not, shall be paid to my executors and trustees for the benefit of my estate before making any transfers of the stock or shares of Ganong Bros. Limited, common or preferred, devised and bequeathed under my said last will and testament and under this second codicil thereto.\nThese last provisions of par. 20 of the codicil were clearly intended as a substitution for par. 20 of the original will, which applied to \"any and all of the shares of Ganong Bros. Limited,\" bequeathed by the will, and not to any of the shares which the testatrix had assigned to the Trust Company six years before she made the will. The codicil, however, did not expressly revoke par. 20 of the will, the provisions of which must be examined closely for the purpose of determining whether any and what portions thereof are inconsistent with and consequently replaced by the provisions of clause 20 of the codicil, the testatrix having declared by the concluding paragraph of the codicil that she ratified and confirmed her said last will and testament \"save in so far as any part thereof shall be revoked or altered by this codicil thereto or any previous codicil.\" Par. 20 of the will read as follows:\nI hereby further will and declare that it is my intention and purpose that any and all of the shares of Ganong Bros. Limited, so hereby bequeathed as aforesaid, shall be and remain the property of my estate and be held by my executors and trustees as part of my estate until after the first annual meeting of Ganong Bros. Limited, shall have been held subsequent to my decease and until all dividends accruing on said shares of stock from the business of the year in which my decease may occur shall have been paid to my estate for the benefit of my estate intending by this section of my will to show that both semi-annual dividends on the preferred shares that will be paid during the fiscal year subsequent to my decease but which will have been earned during the fiscal year my decease may occur must be paid to my estate before making any transfers of the stock, shares devised and bequeathed as aforesaid.\nWhen one compares the language of these provisions of the codicil with that of par. 20 of the will, it is not surprising that the sole remaining executor and trustee, who was responsible for the administration of this estate and who more than five years after the death of the testatrix still held in his possession all the bequeathed preferred and common shares of Ganong Bros. Ltd., should have sought the intervention of the Supreme Court to straighten out the apparent confusion, and proposed the following questions on his application for an originating summons: 1. Who are entitled to the shares in the capital stock of Ganong Bros., Limited, either common or preferred, bequeathed under any clauses of either the last will and testament of Maria Famicha Ganong or the second codicil thereto?\n2. When are the beneficiaries of the said shares entitled to delivery thereof?\nDuring the argument another question was added as follows:\n3. Under the circumstances of the present case are any dividends and if so, what, apportionable?\nOn the hearing, which took place before the learned Chief Justice on documentary evidence only, it was contended in behalf of the residuary legatees that there was no vesting of the shares in the persons to whom they were given until after the payment of two years' dividends, and that, no dividends having yet been paid and as no one could tell that any ever would be paid, the rule against perpetuities applied and the shares consequently passed into residue. The Chief Justice, however, held that this contention could not prevail and that the persons and institutions named in the will and codicil were entitled to delivery of the shares immediately. He also held that no question of apportionment arose.\nOn an appeal from this judgment to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court, which was heard by Grimmer, Harrison and Fairweather, JJ., all three of the learned justices agreed that the shares vested in the beneficiaries on the death of the testatrix; but Harrison and Fair-weather, JJ., Grimmer J. dissenting, held that the Chief Justice was in error in holding that the beneficiaries, to whom the shares had been bequeathed, were entitled to their delivery immediately. They took the view that par. 20 of the codicil created a charge upon these shares in favour of the executor and trustee to the amount of a sum of money representing two years' dividends at 7% on the bequeathed preferred shares, which they calculated at $68,460, and that the beneficiaries were not entitled to their delivery until that amount of money had been paid to the estate or the charge released. No contention is now made on this appeal that the shares did not vest in the beneficiaries, to whom they were bequeathed, but the respondent residuary legatees contend that in the light of other provisions of the will and of the circumstances, as they existed at the time of the execution of the codicil, no other construction can consistently be placed upon the relevant language of the codicil than that adopted by Harrison, J., in the majority judgment of the Appeal Division. Having conceded that all the shares vested in the several beneficiaries on the death of the testatrix, it is obvious that this is the only position they could possibly take.\nThere is no ambiguity whatever regarding the bequests of the preferred shares as made in pars. 14 and 15 of the codicil or of the common shares as made in par. 16. Each one of them is distinct and definite as to the number of shares bequeathed and the persons and institutions to whom the shares are given. The whole difficulty has been created by the language of par. 20 of the codicil, which, while indicating clearly enough an intention to postpone the transfer by the executor and trustee of the bequeathed shares to the various beneficiaries pending the payment to him of dividends accrued to the date of the testatrix's death and two prospective half-yearly dividends during the following year, enshrouds the intended reservation in such apparent ambiguity and uncertainty as to endanger its entire validity. The difficulty arises primarily from the insertion of the phrase \"whether earned or declared or not\" in reference first to the payment of \"all dividends on said preferred shares accrued due\" to the date of the testatrix's death, and its repetition in reference to \"a full year's dividends accruing due\" after her death.\nThe words \"all dividends accrued due\" can surely only mean dividends which have become payable by the corporation to the shareholder, as the words \"dividends accruing due\" during any stated period can only mean dividends as they become payable by the corporation to the shareholder. The share certificates by a condition endorsed thereon state that the holders shall be entitled out of the net profits whenever ascertained to a fixed cumulative preference dividend at the rate of 7% per annum in priority to any payment of dividend upon the common stock, such dividend to be paid at such times as the directors may determine but to be payable only out of the profits, and the holders shall not be entitled to participate in further dividends or profits.\nThis condition is in accordance with the provisions of the by-law of June 28th, 1916, under which these shares were issued. This by-law provides that the preference shares shall have a fixed cumulative preference dividend of 7% per annum, payable as may be convenient half yearly, and that such dividend\nshall be payable only out of the net profits of the company, but they shall be cumulative dividends, that is to say, if not earned fully and paid in each year, the amount of such dividend or any portion thereof remaining unpaid from time to time shall be paid out of the first net prof\u00ects of the company accumulated or earned thereafter.\nThe by-law also provides that the said dividend shall begin to run from July 1st, 1916.\nA preferential dividend at a fixed rate may be said, of course, to be always running between fixed dividend periods and perhaps in that sense to be accruing from day to day, but how can these dividends in the face of the express terms of the share certificates and of the by-law, in pursuance of which they were issued, possibly be said to have \"accrued due\" or to be \"accruing due\" when no profits have been earned to provide for their payment and no declaration has been made by the directors fixing any date therefor? The shareholders acquire no right to payment of any dividends until there are net profits, out of which alone they can be paid, and until such time as the directors determine they shall be paid. See judgment of Farwell, J., in Bond v. Barrow Haematite Steel Co.[3]; also judgment of Lord Sterndale, M.R., in In re Wakley [4].\nThat the clause is directed wholly to the payment of dividends on the bequeathed preferred shares during the anticipated period of the administration of the estate cannot be doubted, now that it is conceded that it was the testatrix's intention that the shares themselves should vest in the various legatees at her death. This can only apply to the payment of dividends as such to the executors and trustees of the estate, as the registered holders of the bequeathed preferred shares, by the corporation itself as a going concern, and clearly excludes, to my mind, the payment of any sum or sums of money in lieu thereof by or in behalf of the beneficiaries, in whom the shares themselves were vested. The qualifying phrase is so obviously repugnant to the principal phrase that one or the other must be disregarded and the whole clause recast in order to express any such intention as that contended for by the residuary legatees.\nIf the clause be read without the qualifying phrase, and the words\nall dividends on said preferred shares accrued due to the date of my death * * * together with a full year's dividends accruing due after my death * * * shall be paid to my executors and trustees for the benefit of my estate before making any transfers * * *\nbe given their ordinary meaning, they clearly contemplate only the payment of dividends which the directors of the corporation might legally declare to be payable thereon on definitely appointed dates. The corporation admittedly never having since earned sufficient profits to justify the declaration of any dividend to cover 7% of the par value of the preferred shares remaining unpaid at the time of the testatrix's death in November, 1934, or any part thereof or any proportion of the two half-yearly dividends, which ordinarily would have matured during the following year, the executors and trustees of her estate, as the registered holders of all the bequeathed shares, have never acquired the right to demand payment from the corporation of any dividends thereon to cover either the year 1934 or the year 1935. They have consequently never \"accrued due\" within the intendment of the reservation.\nBut how upon this basis does the non-payment of the dividends affect the condition prescribed by the concluding lines of the paragraph as a prerequisite to the executors' right to transfer the shares? Did the testatrix intend that the executors should not withhold their transfer to the legatees for more than a year after her death in the event of the company's failure up to that time to earn the necessary profits to enable them to declare dividends to cover the arrears for the two years 1934 and 1935, or did she intend that the condition should continue, unlimited as to time, with the inevitable result of indefinitely tying up the administration of her estate until the actual payment of the deferred dividends, which might possibly never happen? The latter hypothesis may at once be dismissed, I think, as wholly inadmissible. The former, though not entirely consistent with the testatrix's undisputed intention to vest the shares in the various legatees at her death, may surely be more reasonably harmonized with it as a modification of the absolute bequests to the extent of withholding from the legatees their right to receive the deferred dividends for the two years in question in the event, and only in the event, of their being paid by the corporation to the executors and trustees as the registered holders of the shares for the purpose of administering the estate, within a period of one year following the death of the testatrix.\nIf no limitation of the prescribed condition for the transfer of the shares to the legatees can reasonably be inferred from the clause as framed, the reservation itself, in my opinion, must be held to be void for uncertainty, whether the alleged qualifying phrase be eliminated or not. As already pointed out, the residuary legatees contended before the learned Chief Justice below that the bequests of the shares were themselves void for uncertainty for the reason that no one could tell when the dividends would be paid or indeed whether they ever would be paid at all. This uncertainty, however, goes, not to the validity of the bequests, but to the validity of the reservation. As Lord Truro expressed it in Egerton v. Earl Brownlow [5],\nWhere a gift is good in itself, but is followed by an unlawful or repugnant condition, or qualification in a distinct clause, the gift is upheld and the condition or qualification, which alone is obnoxious, is rejected.\nIn Hancock v. Watson [6], Lord Davey said:\nIt is settled law that if you find an absolute gift to a legatee in the first instance, and trusts are engrafted or imposed on that absolute interest which fail, either from lapse or invalidity or any other reason, then the absolute gift takes effect so far as the trusts have failed to the exclusion of the residuary legatee or next of kin as the case may be.\nThis statement was expressly reaffirmed by the House of Lords in Fyfe v. Irwin (3)[7].\nThe learned majority judges in the Appeal Division apparently agreed with the Chief Justice and Grimmer, J., that the clause should be read as indicating that the condition was intended to lapse upon the expiration of one year after the death of the testatrix, but in their natural anxiety to give some effect to the phrase, \"whether earned or declared or not,\" sought very properly to solve the perplexing problem by deducing from it and the language of the entire par. 20 of the codicil and other provisions of the will an intention to impose a charge in favour of the estate, either upon the bequeathed preferred shares themselves, or upon the donees, to the amount of the unpaid dividends for the years 1934 and 1935. They relied especially upon the change made by the opening clause of the paragraph, providing for the payment out of the testatrix's personal estate of all succession duties in respect of the gifts of all shares in the capital stock of the corporation as evidencing an intention to accumulate a fund, equal to two years' dividends on all the bequeathed preferred shares, for the special purpose of compensating the estate for relieving them of the payment of succession duties.\nWhile the opening lines of the long clause immediately following the succession duties provision would seem to impart no little colour to this view, I find myself, after anxious consideration of the entire will and codicil, quite unable to adopt it. In the first place, par. 20 of the codicil contains nothing in the nature of a direction to the executors and trustees to collect the two years' unpaid dividends from the beneficiaries, in whom the shares were vested, or to fund them, if and when collected, for any such purpose. The creation of such a charge seems to me to be wholly inconsistent with her wish to relieve all gifts and bequests made in both the will and the codicil from any and all succession duties at the expense of her personal estate, including gifts of shares in the capital stock of Ganong Bros. Limited, either preferred or common, as so explicitly stated in the opening clause of the paragraph. Having thus clearly indicated her desire to relieve the bequeathed shares from any and all liability for the payment of succession duties and thus place them on a footing of equality with all other gifts provided for in the will and codicil, I cannot believe that she intended by the succeeding clause, not only to immediately cancel this additional bounty to the specific legatees of the preferred shares, including her late husband's nearest relatives, and her own brother and his wife and children and such institutions as the Old Folks Home and the Chipman Memorial Hospital, but to charge them $14 a share in the event of the corporation's inability to earn sufficient profits to pay anything on account of the deferred dividends, and this for no other apparent purpose than that of increasing the value of the residuary estate.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned Chief Justice on the originating summons restored. We were informed that practically all the estate had been distributed apart from the shares of the company. We think in the circumstances the costs of the appellants on this appeal and of the executor should be paid by the executor and charged by him against the residue of the estate and not against the specific legatees, those of the executor as between solicitor and client; the disposition of costs of the appeal to the Appeal Division to stand as unanimously directed by that court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J.

The appellant's husband, holder of an insurance policy issued by the respondent company, died, and, by the terms of his will, the appellant was made universal legatee and as such became entitled to the benefit of the insurance policy. On an action by the appellant claiming the payment thereof, the respondent pleaded that the policy was issued upon the written application of the insured, including a \"questionnaire\" and a medical examination attached to and forming part of the policy in question; that the statements and answers of the insured in the application and the medical \"questionnaire\" constituted warranties on the truth and accuracy of which the validity of the contract depended; that the insured failed to disclose to the medical examiner his true medical history, notwithstanding the fact that the questions put to him called for such disclosure; that his answers were untrue, inaccurate and misleading and as such were a cause of nullity of the contract of insurance; that, in any event, the insured, in giving his answers, was guilty of misrepresentation and concealment of a nature to affect the appreciation of the risk by the respondent, and consequently, whether made by him in error or by design, they were a cause of nullity of the contract, and there never was any contract of insurance binding on the respondent. The respondent prayed for a declaration that the policy was null and void and that it had no binding effect.\nThe General Clauses which were at the back of the policy contained the following clause (translated): \"This policy, with the application of which copy is attached, contains and constitutes the integral contract intervened between the parties to the said contract, and all the declarations made by the assured shall, in the absence of fraud, be considered as \"d\u00e9clarations\" and not as \"affirmations\" and no declaration shall annul the policy nor shall serve as a basis of contestation of a claim based on this contract, unless this declaration be contained in the application of the policy and unless a copy of this application be endorsed on the policy or be attached to it at the time of its issue.\" The trial judge maintained the appellant's action, but that judgment was reversed by the appellate court.\nHeld, Davis and Hudson JJ. dissenting, that the appeal to this Court should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored. The answers, or statements, made by the assured in his proposal, must, in the absence of fraud (and the trial judge found no fraud), be considered only as representations, and not as warranties. As a copy of the proposal has been attached to the policy and the proposal formed part thereof, these answers and statements may be used by the respondent for the purpose of contesting the claim of the appellant, and they may result in avoiding the policy; but they always remain representations, and they do not become warranties, notwithstanding the fact that a copy thereof has been attached to the policy and that they formed part of the contract. [In other words, by force of the clause above quoted, the parties have agreed to submit their contract purely and simply to the provisions of the Civil Code with regard respectively to warranties and representations.] Upon the evidence, and applying these provisions of the law of Quebec, the alleged misrepresentations by the assured, invoked by the respondent company, and specially the alleged failure by the assured to disclose the facts that he had consulted doctors and had gone to a sanatorium, are not shown to have had any influence upon the respondent company in its appreciation of the risk; and it is also impossible on a fair consideration of the evidence to come to the conclusion that disclosure of the matters concealed or misrepresented would have influenced a reasonable insurer to decline the risk or to have stipulated for a higher premium. Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Ontario Products Company ([1925] A.C. 344) foll. As to the clause of the policy quoted in the head-note, the word \"d\u00e9clarations,\" used therein four times, must of necessity, except on the first occasion, be understood to mean \"repr\u00e9sentations\"; while the word \"affirmations,\" in that same clause, must be given the meaning of warranties.\nPer Davis and Hudson JJ. (dissenting)\u2014Even assuming, without deciding the point, that the answers to the questions were, by virtue of certain language in the policy, representations and not warranties, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that, if these facts as they existed had been disclosed by the insured, special mention of the facts would have been made to the respondent company by any medical examiner and a more careful and serious examination would have been ordered by the company. Such concealment of the facts was \"of a nature to diminish the appreciation of the risk,\" and therefore \"is a cause of nullity,\" according to the provisions of article 2487 C.C.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Langlois J., and dismissing the appellant's action based on a policy of insurance issued by the respondent company upon the life of the appellant's deceased husband, for an amount of $5,000.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nAntoine Rivard K.C. and Jules Savard for the appellant.\nJ. P. A. Gravelle K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Crocket JJ. was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The appellant's husband, the late Clifford Huot, holder of an insurance policy issued by the respondent, died in Quebec on January 20th, 1938.\nBy the terms of his will, the appellant was made universal legatee of her late husband, and as such became entitled to the benefit of the insurance policy. She claimed the payment thereof from the respondent, which pleaded that the policy was issued upon the written application of the insured, including a \"questionnaire\" and a medical examination attached to and forming part of the policy in question; that the statements and answers of the insured in the application and the medical \"questionnaire\" constituted warranties on the truth and accuracy of which the validity of the contract depended; that the insured failed to disclose to the medical examiner his true medical history, notwithstanding the fact that the questions put to him called for such disclosure; that his answers were untrue, inaccurate and misleading and as such were a cause of nullity of the contract of insurance; that, in any event, the insured, in giving his answers, was guilty of misrepresentation and concealment of a nature to affect the appreciation of the risk by the respondent, and consequently, whether made by him in error or by design, they were a cause of nullity of the contract, and there never was any contract of insurance binding on the respondent. The respondent tendered with its plea the amount of $73.55, representing the premium paid in respect of the policy and, by its conclusions, prayed for a declaration that the policy was null and void, that it had no binding effect and that the appellant's action be dismissed.\nThe trial judge maintained the action and condemned the respondent to pay to the appellant the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000), being the amount of the policy; but the Court of King's Bench reversed that judgment by a majority of four judges to one and dismissed the action with costs.\nThe decision in this Court, as it did in the other courts, turns upon the effect to be given to certain answers contained in the \"questionnaire\" put to Mr. Huot, when he made his application to the insurance company.\nThe questions and the answers thereto were as follows:\n6. A. Avez-vous jamais eu line maladie s\u00e9rieuse? Non.\nB. Recu une blessure grave? Non.\nC. Eu une op\u00e9ration chirurgicale? Non.\nD. Avez-vous jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 dans un h\u00f4pital, sanatorium ou autre institution pour observation, diagnose, repos ou traitement? Non.\n* * *\n9.

Non.\nR\u00e9tr\u00e9cissement? Non.\nSyphilis? Non.\n10. B. Les r\u00e9ponses int\u00e9grales aux questions 6, 7, 9 et 10A avec d\u00e9tails donn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'espace ci-dessous constituent-elles un relev\u00e9 complet de toutes vos maladies, op\u00e9rations chirurgicales et de tous vos s\u00e9jours dans les h\u00f4pitaux, sanatoriums ou autre institutions? Oui.\nThose are the answers which the respondent contends were untrue, inaccurate and misleading. In this it was sustained by the majority of the Court of King's Bench.\nThe evidence at the trial showed that Mr. Huot died \"\u00e0 la suite d'une h\u00e9patite aigu\u00eb.\"\nThe policy was issued on August 2nd, 1937. The death took place on January 20th, 1938.\nThe application was made on July 23rd, 1937.\nThe trial judge made a very careful analysis of the medical evidence adduced before him. He began by stating that the insured consulted Dr. Courchesne in 1932 and 1933 and, subsequently, in 1936 and 1937. In 1932, the assured consulted him \"sur une question de vertige\". The doctor advised and caused to be made an X-ray examination. He found \"aucune l\u00e9sion fonctionnelle\". He simply ordered \"quelques digestifs\". In 1936, upon the recurrence of the stomach trouble he advised the assured to consult a specialist; and Mr. Huot then saw Dr. Langlois of Montreal.\nDr. Langlois is a neurologist in charge of the neurology department of Notre-Dame Hospital and of a private sanatorium. He says that Mr. Huot complained of dizzy spells, with a special character of the spells, with propulsion forward, with \"bourdonnements d'oreilles\". The doctor made a thorough examination in his office on January 16th, 1937. As he was of the opinion that it was a case of \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re\", he asked the patient to come to his sanatorium for a more complete examination, for a day or so. Mr. Huot went to the sanatorium on the 18th and stayed there for twenty-four hours. As a result, the doctor convinced himself that Mr. Huot was suffering of \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re\"; but he did not treat him at the sanatorium. He gave him a special diet to follow and certain pills (\"pastilles\") to take. He states that\nfrom the beginning of the treatment, Mr. Huot never suffered again from any attack of \"vertige\";\nand this is confirmed by Dr. Courchesne:\nAussit\u00f4t qu'il a suivi le r\u00e9gime, les indications du docteur Langlois, il s'est aussit\u00f4t am\u00e9lior\u00e9 et gu\u00e9ri; en 1937, il n'a jamais souffert de vertige de Meni\u00e8re.\nMr. Huot again saw Dr. Langlois on March 6th, May 14th and October 19th, 1937. He did not come to Montreal for the special purpose of seeing Dr. Langlois. His business brought him to Montreal and, on those occasions, he took the opportunity of seeing the doctor.\nAt the outset, Dr. Langlois had advised Huot not to drive his car, because, as he explained, if Huot had a sudden attack of dizziness or \"vertige,\" it might lead to accidents. But afterwards the doctor gave Huot permission to drive his car, \"because he had no more spells of dizziness.\" That was on the occasion when he saw him on March 6th, 1937. Further, on that occasion, the doctor advised Huot to continue the diet but to cease taking the \"pastilles,\" because the \"vertige\" or \"\u00e9tourdissements\" had ceased. When Dr. Langlois saw Huot on May 14th, he considered him as cured of his \"vertige.\"\nAs to the nature of this \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re,\" the specialist himself, Dr. Langlois, says that it is\nune maladie banale du syst\u00e8me nerveux localis\u00e9e * * * pas dangereuse au point de vue organique * * * due \u00e0 une petite l\u00e9sion de son oreille.\nHe considered it as a \"chose banale,\" and he was not of the opinion that any recurrence of it was possible.\nDr. Alphonse Gigu\u00e8re, also heard on behalf of the appellant, medical examiner for several insurance companies (Northern Life, Excelsior, Confederation Life, L'Union St-Joseph), describes the \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re\" as\nun groupe de syndr\u00f4mes, surtout du c\u00f4t\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me nerveux, qui se manifestent par des vertiges, \u00e9tourdissements, quelquefois aussi par des vomissements. C'est une maladie qui si\u00e8ge ordinairement dans l'oreille interne, au niveau des canaux qu'on appelle semi-circulaires, qui voient \u00e0 l'\u00e9quilibre de l'individu * * * Plusieurs causes peuvent produire le vertige de Meni\u00e8re, notamment les troubles digestifs, infection de l'oreille, corps \u00e9trangers dans l'oreille, intoxication; comme, par exemple, certains m\u00e9dicaments peuvent produire cela.\nCe n'est pas une maladie \u00e0 proprement parler, c'est un groupement de syndr\u00f4mes, lorsque des causes d'intoxication se produisent; lorsque les causes disparaissent, ordinairement le malade gu\u00e9rit; except\u00e9 s'il y a eu lesion de l'oreille interne, infection des tissus osseux, le vertige de Meni\u00e8re est suppos\u00e9 r\u00e9appara\u00eetre par p\u00e9riodes \u00e0 mesure que l'infection se manifeste, enfin par recrudescence.\n* * *\nAvec un r\u00e9gime d\u00e9constipant, tout entre dans l'ordre.\nDr. James Stevenson, heard on behalf of the respondent, describes the \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re\" as\na disease of the nervous system * * * having to do with the mechanism of the internal ear and the balancing centres of the brain. True Meni\u00e8re's disease symptoms are dizziness or vertige and disturbance of the balancing centres in the nervous system, and usually noises in the ear and in the brain as well * * * It is a symptom rather than a disease.\nAs for Dr. Armand Rioux, the physician who proceeded to the medical examination attached to the application for the insurance policy, he says:\nce vertige de Meni\u00e8re, c'est un vertige qui donne des troubles, \u00e9videmment d'instabilit\u00e9, et qui est souvent en rapport avec des troubles d'oreille * * * Il est d'origine digestive surtout.\nA little later, in his deposition, he adds:\nC'est une maladie nerveuse en rapport avec des troubles d'estomac, mauvaise digestion, trouble digestif * * * Si la digestion s'am\u00e9liore, \u00e9videmment la cons\u00e9quence qui est le vertige, peut s'am\u00e9liorer \u00e9galement. * * * Il peut gu\u00e9rir s\u00fbrement.\nDr. Rioux says that if he had known that Mr. Huot had already suffered of \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re,\"\nJ'aurais simplement conseill\u00e9 \u00e0 la Compagnie de lui fatire faire certains examens sp\u00e9ciaux pour pr\u00e9ciser la question.\nIf he had discovered it, he would have made a mention of it in his medical report, and this would have led to \"un examen plus pr\u00e9cis du tube digestif.\"\nThe above is substantially the evidence of the medical practitioners on the nature of the \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re,\" and the extent to which Mr. Huot was affected by it in the years preceding his application for the policy.\nTurning now to that application, it contains a certain number of questions addressed to the applicant in connection with his name, his occupation, the nature of his work rand other matters which it is not necessary to state in detail, since they are not made a subject of complaint by the respondent. Then comes the following declaration made by Mr. Huot:\nJe d\u00e9clare par la pr\u00e9sente que toutes les d\u00e9clarations et r\u00e9ponses faites aux questions ci-dessus sont compl\u00e8tes et vraies, que je consens que ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de ainsi que cette d\u00e9claration et les d\u00e9clarations faites ou \u00e0 faire au m\u00e9decin examinateur de la compagnie * * * ou dans mes d\u00e9clarations au lieu d'examen m\u00e9dical, forment l'ensemble de la proposition et fassent partie du contrat d'assurance propos\u00e9 par la pr\u00e9sente.\nThat is followed by a report from the agent of the company, and then by the answers made to the medical examiner, of which it is stated that they form part of the proposal for the insurance made to the respondent on the life of Mr. Huot.\nI have already stated the answers which, in that part of the application, are alleged by the respondent to have been erroneous, untrue and misleading. There follows afterwards a confidential report from the medical examiner; and this completes the several documents comprised in the proposal.\nThe policy proper begins by stating:\nEn consid\u00e9ration de la proposition qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite de cette Police, Proposition qui, par la pr\u00e9sente, est constitu\u00e9e partie int\u00e9grante de ce contrat et dont copie est ci-jointe, * * * etc.\nThen comes the respective obligations of the insured and of the insurer, followed by \"Dispositions generates,\" among which is the following clause, on which the respondent laid special stress:\nContrat Int\u00e9gralement Contenu Dans Cette Police\u2014Cette Police, avec la Proposition dont copie est ci-jointe, contient et constitue le contrat integral pass\u00e9 entre les parties dudit contrat, et toutes les d\u00e9clarations faites par l'Assur\u00e9 seront, en l'absence d\u00e9 fraude, consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des d\u00e9clarations et non comme des affirmations, et aucune d\u00e9claration n'annulera la Police, ni ne sera employ\u00e9e pour contester une r\u00e9clamation bas\u00e9e sur ce contrat, \u00e0 moins que cette d\u00e9claration ne soit contenue dans la Proposition de la Police, et qu'une copie de cette Proposition ne soit endoss\u00e9e sur la Police ou n'y soit jointe lors de son \u00e9mission.\nThe remainder of the policy, which is rather a bulky document, need not be referred to, as the parties do not rely on any of its provisions.\nWith regard to the clause just quoted, however, some observations might be made as to its wording. It must be noticed that the word \"declarations\" is there used four times; and it seems to be clear from the context that when it is first used, it has not the same meaning as on the three other occasions. The first word \"d\u00e9clarations\" is evidently used to refer generally to the answers or statements made by the insured in the \"questionnaire\" put to him, either by the agent or by the medical examiner, while on the three other occasions, it is intended to have the meaning of \"repr\u00e9sentations\"; and, in fact, such is the word used and the meaning given to it in articles 2485 and 2489 of the Civil Code.\nOn the other hand, the word \"affirmations,\" in that same clause, must of necessity be given the meaning of warranties. That follows necessarily from the distinction therein made between the \"d\u00e9clarations\" and the \"affirmations.\" In the clause, the \"declarations\" are opposed to the \"affirmations\" in the same way as in the Code the representations are opposed to the warranties and the former are distinguished from the latter. Unless these words are understood as we have just stated, the clause does not make sense.\nThe analysis of the policy, including the several documents forming part of the proposal, therefore, shows that the proposal forms an integral part of the contract; and, moreover, it should be stated that it was attached to the policy in accordance with the requirements of sec. 214 of ch. 243 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec (1925), being the Insurance Act of Quebec.\nFurther, the answers, or statements, made by the assured in his proposal, must, in the absence of fraud, be considered only as representations, and not as warranties. As a copy of the proposal has been attached to the policy and the proposal forms part thereof, these answers and statements may be used by the respondent for the purpose of contesting the claim of the appellant, and they may result in avoiding the policy; but they always remain representations, and they do not become warranties notwithstanding the fact that a copy thereof has been attached to the policy and that they form part of the contract. In other words, by force of the clause above quoted, the parties have agreed to submit their contract purely and simply to the provisions of the Civil Code with regard respectively to warranties and representations. The material provisions of the Code which are pertinent in the premises are the following:\n2485. The insured is obliged to represent to the insurer fully and fairly every fact Which shows the nature and extent of the risk, and which may prevent the undertaking of it, or affect the rate of premium.\n2487. Misrepresentations or concealment, either by error or design, of a fact of a nature to diminish the appreciation of the risk or change the object of it, is a cause of nullity. The contract may in such case be annulled although the loss has not in any degree arisen from the fact misrepresented or concealed.\n2488. Fraudulent misrepresentation or concealment on the part either of the insurer or of the insured is in all cases a cause of nullity of the contract in favour of the innocent party.\n2489. The obligation of the insured with respect to representation is satisfied when the fact is substantially as represented and there is no material concealment.\n2490. Warranties and conditions are a part of the contract and must be true if affirmative and if promissory must be complied with; otherwise the contract may be annulled notwithstanding the good faith of the insured.\nThey are either express or implied.\n2491. An express warranty is a stipulation or condition expressed in the policy, or so referred to in it as to make part of the policy.\nImplied warranties will be designated in the following chapters relating to different kinds of insurance.\n2588. The declaration in the policy of the age and condition of health of the person, upon whose life the insurance is made, constitutes a warranty upon the correctness of which the contract depends.\nNevertheless in the absence of fraud the warranty that the person is in good health is to be construed liberally and not as meaning that he is free from all infirmity or disorder.\nAs a result of the special agreement between the parties as contained in the clause of the policy already mentioned, the answers and statements of the assured are to be taken as representations, and not as warranties; and, incidentally, it would appear, with due respect, that the majority of the Court of King's Bench misdirected itself by regarding these answers and statements as warranties, for the sole reason that they were attached to the policy and formed part of the contract. On the contrary, the express stipulation was that these answers and statements, in the absence of fraud, were to be considered merely as representations, and not as warranties. As we have already stated, the reference in the clause to the condition that these answers or statements be contained in the application and that copy thereof be attached to the policy does not transform the representations into warranties. Its only effect is that, in such a case, they may be made use of by the respondent to contest the claim, as a result of which they may avoid the contract. But they remain representations and they do not become warranties.\nThe only declarations made by the insured in this case which may possibly be styled warranties are those with regard to age and with regard to \"condition of health of the person.\" This would follow not from the policy itself, but from art. 2588 of the Civil Code. However, that article expressly enacts that, in the absence of fraud, the warranty that the person is in good health is to be construed liberally and not as meaning that he is free from all infirmity or disorder. No help can come to the respondent from the application of this provision of the law. The declarations made by the insured in respect of his age and of his health, on the date of the application, were proven to have been true. The evidence is clear that, on that date, his health was good and that he had no reason to suspect any impairment thereof. The medical examination, according to Dr. Rioux himself,\nindiquait qu'il \u00e9tait en excellente sant\u00e9. Pression art\u00e9rielle bonne. Bon sujet d'apr\u00e8s l'examen du c\u0153ur * * * Poumons bons * * *\nThis, of course, bears out the statement of Dr. Courchesne that, as soon as Huot followed the regime prescribed by Dr. Langlois, \"il a gu\u00e9ri\"; and that he had no troubles in 1937. This is in accordance with what Dr. Langlois himself said that he found Huot in very good health, when he saw him on May 14th. He was then cured; he had no longer any \"vertiges.\" And the medical evidence concurs with the testimony of the plaintiff, Huot's wife, that her husband was in good health, that he suffered no longer of his dizzy spells after the diet prescribed by Dr. Langlois, and that during the summer of 1937, \"il n'avait plus rien du tout.\"\nHuot was the manager of the Roofers' Supply Company; and it was stated that during the year 1937 \"il n'a jamais perdu une heure; il ne connaissait pas beaucoup les in\u00e9decins.\"\nSo that the respondent does not get any help from the application of art. 2588 of the Civil Code in respect of any warranty with regard to the correctness of Huot's declarations in the policy about his age and about the condition of his health when he made his application. The other answers or statements which he made, in the questionnaire forming part of the application; by the very terms of the policy itself, as we have seen, are not, in the absence of fraud, to be considered as warranties, but merely as representations.\nThat there was no fraud on the part of Mr. Huot, when he gave his answers to the questions put to him by the medical examiner, can hardly be disputed. The burden of proving fraud was, of course, upon the respondent. Far from having succeeded in that respect, the evidence is clearly to the contrary. The trial judge so held; and while that finding, not being based on credibility, is open to review, I have no hesitation in concurring in it.\nThe death did not result from the \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re.\" That is abundantly established by the medical evidence; death had no connection with that \"vertige.\" But, even \"although the loss has not in any degree arisen from the fact misrepresented or concealed,\" the contract may nevertheless be annulled if the misrepresentation or concealment was \"of a fact of a nature to diminish the appreciation of the risk or change the object of it\" (C.C. 2487).\nThe misrepresentations invoked by the respondent are to be found in the answers 6 (d), 9 (a), 10 (a) and 10 (b) of the medical questionnaire.\nQuestion 10 (b) may be discarded for the purpose of the present discussion. It only emphasizes, if that was necessary, the answers to questions 6 (d), 9 (a) and 10 (a). It states that the answers given to those questions constitute\nun relev\u00e9 complet de toutes vos maladies, operations chirurgicales et de tous vos s\u00e9jours dans les h\u00f4pitaux, sanatoriums ou autres institutions.\nIt does not add any new facts to the questions and answers already made.\nThe untruthfulness in the answer to question 6 (d) is found in the fact that Mr. Huot was there asked whether he had ever been in a sanatorium, and he answered No, while, as we have seen, he spent twenty-four hours in the private sanatorium of Dr. Langlois in January, 1937.\nQuestion 6 (d) is the fourth of a series of questions inquiring from the applicant if he has suffered (a) of a \"maladie s\u00e9rieuse,\" (b) of a \"blessure grave,\" and (c) if he has undergone an \"operation chirurgicale.\" The question, as put, being only a subdivision of question 6, may well be understood to mean that the applicant was asked whether he has ever been in a hospital, a sanatorium, or another institution, for observation, diagnosis, rest or treatment, in connection with a \"maladie s\u00e9rieuse,\" a \"blessure grave\" or an \"operation chirurgicale.\" That is, as we understand it, the interpretation put upon question 6 (d) both by the trial judge and by Mr. Justice L\u00e9tourneau, the dissenting judge in the Court of King's Bench. To my mind, that interpretation is the more plausible. The least that can be said is that the question was susceptible of being understood in that way; and, as a result, that is sufficient to establish that the answer to it may not be pronounced untruthful by a court of justice.\nBut if it should be interpreted as being disconnected from the first three sub-questions, as forming a question by itself, then it must be admitted that, when Mr. Huot answered \"No\" to question 6(d), he was not correct, since he had been for twenty-four hours in Dr. Langlois' sanatorium for the purpose of observation.\nThen also, although to a lesser degree, the same thing may be said of question 9 (a) and of the answer to it. It may well be understood by an applicant to whom the question is put as part of the \"questionnaire\" that, when he is asked whether he has consulted a doctor or been treated by a doctor during the last three years, and to indicate the date, the sickness, the name and the address of his doctors, the inquiry is in respect of a \"maladie s\u00e9rieuse,\" a \"blessure grave,\" or an \"operation chirurgicale\" about which the previous questions were concerned. Under such circumstances, the answer made by Huot to question 9 (a): \"Pour aucune,\" should be found to have been true.\nIf, however, in the same way as for question 6 (d), the answer should be more meticulously scrutinized, one would have to say that it was not strictly true that Huot had neither consulted a doctor, nor been treated by a doctor during the three years preceding his application. The application was made on July 23rd, 1937, and since July, 1934, he had consulted, or, at least, he had seen Dr. Courchesne in 1936, and he had consulted Dr. Langlois on January 16th and March 6th and on May 14th, 1937. Then, if we turn to question 10 (a), it inquires whether the applicant has ever suffered of a number of ailments or sicknesses, which are there enumerated, and in each case the answer is \"No.\" But there is the fact that, as admitted by himself, the medical examiner never put that question to Huot. The examiner says that he read all the questions to the latter,\nexcept\u00e9 celles qui regardent le num\u00e9ro 10 (a), o\u00f9 je simplifie en demandant simplement: Avez-vous consult\u00e9 un m\u00e9decin depuis trois ans et avez-vous souffert de quelque maladie quelconque? Il n'y a aucune maladie en cours?\n* * *\nJe lui demande s'il a souffert de quelque maladie quelconque et consult\u00e9 un m\u00e9decin depuis trois ans?\nThat is not the question as put in the \"questionnaire\"; and that is not the question which forms part of the application. As a result, it was never, in that form, attached to the policy and it does not, as such, form part of the contract between the parties. It is not necessary to decide whether, in such a case, although the real question which was put must be disregarded, yet the question as it appears in 10 (a) should still be considered as forming part of the application, because Huot signed the \"questionnaire\" after it had been filled. Of course, the respondent contends that, on the strength of such cases as Biggar v. Rock Life Assurance Company[1]; New York Life Insurance Company v. Fletcher2; Newsholme v. Road Transport & General Insurance Company3; and Dawsons v. Bonnin4, Mr. Huot must be held to the answer written down after question 10 (a) as it appears in the \"questionnaire,\" because he signed the \"questionnaire,\" and notwithstanding that the medical examiner himself states positively that he never put that question and that he put an altogether different question.\nIn the Biggar case 1, in the New York Life Insurance case2 and in the Newsholme case3, the question had been put, but the answer was falsely written down by the agent who was filling the \"questionnaire\" form. It was there held that notwithstanding that the falsity of the answer was due to the agent and not to the applicant, because the latter had signed the \"questionnaire,\" and that he should have read it as filled in by the agent before he signed it, he could not be relieved of the effect of his signature; and that, therefore, he was bound by the answer as it had been written down.\nIn the Dawsons case5, decided by the House of Lords, the inaccurate answer had been made by inadvertance; but it was found that, apart from materiality, the answer was a condition of the liability of the insurers, and the policy was void.\nI see a great difference between those cases and the present case, where admittedly question 10 (a) was never put to the applicant; another question was put instead; and the applicant thus being put under a wrong impression by the medical examiner, and while being under that impression, although he was imprudent perhaps in signing the \"questionnaire\" without reading it, yet, having faith in the medical examiner, he signed the \"questionnaire\" as it had been filled in by the latter. In my view, the present case may well be distinguished from the four cases relied on by the respondent.\nAs I have said, however, I do not find it necessary to discuss that point here, because, even assuming that the question as it appears in 10 (a) had been put to the applicant, his answer to it, to my mind, ought not to be allowed to affect the validity of the contract, in the circumstances.\nThat question has already been reproduced at the beginning of the present judgment. It will be noticed that, although it contains a very long enumeration of several distinct ailments or sicknesses, it does not include \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re.\" The nearest approach to it is the word \"vertigo.\" The respondent cannot ask the courts to take judicial notice of the fact that \"vertigo\" may be the same as \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re.\" It may be that it is, although no evidence at the trial was specially directed to establish that fact. But what is sure is that the medical examiner never explained to Mr. Huot that, in medical phraseology, \"vertigo\" may be regarded as the equivalent of \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re.\" It is impossible on the record to hold that they are one and the same trouble; and Mr. Huot, when he answered \"No,\" even if the question had been put to him as appeared in 10 (a), would have been perfectly justified to believe that \"vertigo\" was not the same as \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re\"; and that he was well warranted in answering that he never suffered of \"vertigo.\"\nIt follows that question 10 (a) cannot enter into any consideration as to whether the representations made by Mr. Huot in giving, to the questions invoked by the respondent, the answers he gave, was guilty of concealment of a nature to diminish the appreciation of the risk or change the object of it.\nWe are left, therefore, with the misrepresentation in the answers given to questions 6 (d) and 9 (a), such misrepresentation consisting in the fact that Mr. Huot did not disclose that he had consulted or seen Dr. Courchesne in the year 1936, and that he had consulted Dr. Langlois in January, 1937, having gone to the latter's private sanatorium for observation for a period of twenty-four hours.\nAssuming, merely for the purpose of meeting the argument of the respondent and not forgetting what has already been said that these two questions may well be interpreted, as they have been by the trial judge and Mr. Justice L\u00e9tourneau, as having to do only with a \"maladie s\u00e9rieuse,\" a \"blessure grave,\" or an \"operation chirurgicale,\" it is impossible, on the evidence, to come to the conclusion that the mere disclosure of that fact by Mr. Huot would have made the slightest difference in the appreciation of the risk by the respondent and that, if the respondent had known such a fact, it would either have prevented from undertaking the risk or it would have affected the rate of premium.\nDr. Rioux, who made the medical examination for the application, states in his evidence that if he had known that Mr. Huot had already suffered of \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re,\"\nj'aurais simplement conseill\u00e9 \u00e0 la compagnie de lui faire faire certains examens sp\u00e9ciaux pour pr\u00e9ciser la question.\nHe adds that if he had discovered it, he would have mentioned it in his medical report. He does not, however, go the length of saying that it would have affected the risk:\nTout aurait d\u00e9pendu du rapport sur l'examen sp\u00e9cial\u2014un examen plus precis du tube digestif.\nBut he says that, although a note of it must be made in the medical report:\nIl n'y a pas de raison sp\u00e9ciale de refuser celui qui en aurait d\u00e9j\u00e0 souffert; and that, upon finding that he was cured, he would have accepted the risk. The evidence, both from Dr. Courchesne and from Dr. Langlois, is that when Mr. Huot made his application he was cured.\nDr. Courchesne, who was heard on behalf of the respondent, states that the mere fact that Mr. Huot had, at one time, suffered of \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re\" was no reason to refuse his application and that, for himself, as soon as Huot was cured, he would have accepted the risk. He says it was the usual practice to mention the \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re\" in medical examinations, so that the examination may be complete, but that, so far as he was concerned, as he knew that Mr. Huot was cured, he would have accepted him.\nDr. Stevenson says that he would not consider as a \"first class risk\" a man who had suffered from \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re,\" although he adds that \"a good deal depends upon what the applicant was applying for.\" He states that \"vertige of any nature is a symptom rather than a disease,\" but that it is a symptom of sufficient importance to be mentioned, because vertige would affect the risk in other ways. As an instance of what he had in mind when making that statement, he refers to his practical experience of\na man who suffered from vertige and during an attack of vertige fell off a train or ran his automobile into an obstruction.\nWhat he means, therefore, is that it may be a cause of accident and\nit adds to the natural hazard of death to which healthy persons are exposed.\nThose are the very words of Dr. Stevenson; and it would follow that his views have no particular reference to Mr. Huot and that he would hold to them even with regard to a healthy person who might occasionally be subject to vertige.\nDr. Stevenson's statement, however, is merely that of a physician who came to give expert evidence on a medical question. Dr. Courchesne had had the advantage of seeing Mr. Huot in person; and, of course, the evidence most to be relied on, in view of the closer relation which he had with Mr. Huot, is that of Dr. Langlois. The latter says that Mr. Huot \"souffrait de troubles nerveux d'aucune gravit\u00e9\" and that, when he saw him again in May, 1937, he was cured. After having had him under observation at his sanatorium for twenty-four hours, he did not treat him in any special way, but merely prescribed a diet and gave him some pills. He had, however, for the same reason as mentioned by Dr. Stevenson, advised him not to drive his car. In that connection, he says that, if called upon to make a medical examination for an insurance application, he would mention \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re,\" not because he considers it a serious disease, but because of the possibility of an accident on the street. He calls it, \"Une maladie banale * * * pas dangereuse au point de vue organique.\" In May, 1937, all vertige had disappeared. He found Mr. Huot \"tr\u00e8s bien et gu\u00e9ri.\" He permitted him again to drive his car, and he adds that, upon the condition and the state of health found in May, he would have recommended the risk to an insurance company. He then said to Mr. Huot: \"Je crois que vous n'en aurez plus jamais\"; and adds that Huot was certainly put by him under the impression that the ailment was not serious, and left him \"rassur\u00e9.\"\nCan it be said that, under the circumstances, even if it had been mentioned in the medical report that Mr. Huot had at one time suffered from \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re,\" this would have influenced a reasonable insurer to have refused the risk or to have stipulated for a higher premium?\nIt ought to be pointed out that none of the officers, agents or representatives of the respondent has ventured to offer evidence to that effect in the present case. The Court is left to decide for itself and to surmise what might have taken place if the exact and precise fact had been disclosed, even if we assume that the question for that purpose had properly been put to the applicant.\nThe answer must be that upon the information given by the doctors who were heard at the trial and which is the only one upon which the Court is asked to pronounce, the conclusion reached by the trial judge and by Mr. Justice L\u00e9tourneau in the Court of King's Bench is the right one and that the so-called misrepresentations could not possibly have had any effect on the assumption of the risk by the respondent.\nThat conclusion, as a matter of fact, follows almost forcibly from the evidence of Dr. Gigu\u00e8re, the medical examiner for the four insurance companies already mentioned at the beginning of this judgment. He says that, in his experience, \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re,\" which is not a maladie but a \"groupement de syndromes,\" gradually disappears, after which a man who has had it is nevertheless considered as a first class risk. He does say that it is customary to mention it in the medical report; but he shows the unimportance of a mention of that kind by stating that, even if a man has suffered from toothache (\"affection de dents\"), the medical examiner is supposed to make a note of it in his report. In a case of \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re\" having already existed, he says that a new special examination might be asked by the insurance company; but he has no doubt that, in the present case, this new examination would have shown that Mr. Huot was cured and that he would have been accepted.\nComme dans le cas qui nous int\u00e9resse, voici un malade qui a eu tous ses examens, sa pression art\u00e9rielle est normale, son sang est normal aussi; il n'y a pas de raison de ne pas le passer.\nThis case is in the same category as Fidelity & Casualty Ins. Co. v. Mitchell6; and more particularly Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Ontario Products Company7, where the Privy Council, confirming this Court, dismissed the appeal of the insurance company and found that the so-called misrepresentations would not have influenced a reasonable insurer to refuse the risk or demand a higher premium, and accordingly held the policy valid and compelled the insurance company to abide by its contract.\nMy conclusion, therefore, is that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment at the trial should be restored with costs throughout.\nDavis J. (dissenting)\u2014This appeal arises out of an action by the appellant to recover upon a policy of insurance issued by the respondent company upon the life of her deceased husband (hereinafter for convenience called \"the insured\").\nThe policy was dated August 2nd, 1937, and the insured died within six months, on January 28th, 1938. The policy was not only what is called a life policy, for the sum of $5,000, but contained special benefits in the event of disability. The defence to the action is based upon certain answers made to questions put to the insured by the medical examiner; the questions and answers are not only attached to the policy but are stated in the policy to form a part of the contract.\nThere is little if any conflict of evidence on the facts. In 1932 the insured, who resided in Quebec City, had consulted his own local physician, Dr. Courchesne, and again in 1933, as to spells of dizziness from which he had been suffering\u2014a feeling of falling forward and buzzing in the ears. Upon the recurrence of the trouble in 1936 the insured again consulted Dr. Courchesne, who advised him to consult a named specialist in Montreal, Dr. Langlois. Dr. Langlois is a neurologist in charge of the neurological department of the Notre Dame Hospital and has a private sanatorium. The insured consulted Dr. Langlois in his office on January 16th, 1937. Dr. Langlois was of the opinion that it was a case of \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re,\" and advised the insured to go into his sanatorium for a more complete examination. The insured did so on January 18th, 1937, and remained in the sanatorium for observation for twenty-four hours. Dr. Langlois was then convinced that the insured was suffering from \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re\"; he gave the patient a special diet to follow and certain medicine to take. The insured again consulted Dr. Langlois in Montreal on March 6th, May 14th and October 19th, 1937.\nOn July 23rd, 1937, the insured made application to the respondent company for the policy in question; $5,000 life insurance and certain benefits in the event of disability. The policy in question was issued August 2nd, 1937. At the time of his medical examination on the said July 23rd, 1937, certain written questions were submitted to the insured to which he gave written answers and these questions and answers were, as I have said, made a part of the policy.\nThe insured as applicant for the policy was amongst other questions asked if he ever had a serious illness (une maladie s\u00e9rieuse), to which he answered, No, and specifically if he had had \"vertigo,\" to which his answer was No. He was asked further if he had consulted a doctor during the past three years, and he answered, No. He was asked if he had ever been in a sanatorium for observation and he answered, No. The insurance contract was made in the province of Quebec. I shall assume, without deciding the point, that the answers to the questions were, by virtue of certain language in the policy, representations and not warranties. Article 2487 of the Civil Code provides:\n2487. Misrepresentation or concealment either by error or design, of a fact of a nature to diminish the appreciation of the risk or change the object of it, is a cause of nullity. The contract may in such case be annulled although the loss has not in any degree arisen from the fact misrepresented or concealed.\nThe evidence satisfies me that if the facts as they existed had been disclosed by the insured, special mention of the facts would have been made to the company by any medical examiner and a more careful and serious examination would have been ordered by the company. The concealment of the facts was in my opinion \"of a nature\" to diminish the appreciation of the risk. Dr. Langlois forbade the insured to drive his motor car though later on, in his visit in May or possibly in October, 1937 (the exact date is not clearly fixed), he was allowed again to use his car. In this connection it is important to observe that the policy applied for carried disability benefits. Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Ontario Products Company8, relied upon by the appellant, was decided upon its own facts. I cannot hold that the appellant is entitled to recover on the policy. That was the conclusion of the majority of the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) of the province of Quebec\u2014Sir Mathias Tellier, C.J., Bernier, Hall and Galipeault JJ. (L\u00e9tourneau J. dissenting) and I should therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKerwin J.\u2014The facts in the present case are set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Rinfret and need not be repeated. I am clearly of opinion that the answers to questions 6D, 9A, 10A and 10B in the medical questionnaire are representations and not warranties or conditions under article 2490 of the Quebec Civil Code. The policy is not in the same form as that which was in question in Dawsons v. Bonnin9. In the present case, the following clause appears under the heading \"Dispositions G\u00e9n\u00e9rales\":\u2014\nContrat int\u00e9gralement contenu dans cette police.\u2014Cette Police, avec la Proposition, dont copie est ci-jointe, contient et constitue le contrat int\u00e9gral pass\u00e9 entre les parties dudit contrat, et toutes les d\u00e9clarations faites par l'Assur\u00e9 seront, en 1'absence de fraude, consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des d\u00e9clarations et non comme des affirmations, et aucune d\u00e9claration n'annulera la Police ni ne sera employ\u00e9e pour contester une r\u00e9clamation bas\u00e9e sur ce contrat \u00e0 moins que cette d\u00e9claration ne soit contenue dans la Proposition de la Police et qu'une copie de cette Proposition ne soit endoss\u00e9e sur la Police ou n'y soit jointe lors de son \u00e9mission.\nI agree with what my brother Rinfret has said with reference to this clause.\nAs to the answers to the various questions mentioned above, that given to 10B may be disregarded as it is merely a general clause adding nothing to the effect of the answers to the others. The answer to 6D was clearly inaccurate and I can read the answer to 9A in no way that would render it correct. According to the evidence detailed in the judgment of my brother Rinfret, the answer to 10A, wherein Vertigo is mentioned but not Vertige de Meni\u00e8re, is correct as Huot never suffered from vertigo and we are not entitled to assume that the two mean the same thing. I desire to make it clear, however, that I am assuming and not' deciding that the appellant is bound by Huot's answer to question 10A even though it was not read or explained to him by the medical examiner.\nThe answers to 6D and 9A being inaccurate, the question is whether article 2487 of the Civil Code applies. That article reads as follows:\nMisrepresentation or concealment either by error or design, of a fact of a nature to diminish the appreciation of the risk or change the object of it, is a cause of nullity. The contract may in such case be annulled although the loss has not in any degree arisen from the fact misrepresented or concealed.\nIt is beside the point that Huot did not die either from vertigo or vertige de Meni\u00e8re; but were the inaccuracies of a nature to diminish the appreciation of the risk or change the object of it? The criterion, I apprehend, that is to be followed is the same as that set forth by the Privy Council in Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Ontario Metal Products Company[2], i.e., whether if the matters concealed or misrepresented had been truly disclosed they would, on a fair consideration of the evidence, have influenced a reasonable insurer to decline the risk or to have stipulated for a higher premium. There is no evidence in the present case that the Company would have done either of these things nor is there anything in the record from which either may be presumed.\nFraud, of course, would prevent the appellant succeeding. The trial judge found no fraud. This conclusion not being based upon the credibility of witnesses is open to review by an appellate court but in my view the evidence is overwhelmingly against making any finding of fraud.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial, with costs throughout.\nHudson J. (dissenting)\u2014This action was brought on an insurance policy which provided for benefits in case of (a) death, (b) permanent disability which included the loss of one or both eyes, one or both hands, one or both legs, \"caus\u00e9e par maladie ou par lesion, contusion ou blessure corporelle\". It also provided:\nLes dispositions d'invalidit\u00e9 dans cette Police, sont accord\u00e9es sans qu'une surprime sp\u00e9cifique soit exig\u00e9e pour elles, mais le co\u00fbt en est inclus dans la prime pour cette Police.\nWhen making his application for this policy, the deceased, in answer to the questions put to him by the medical examiner of the company, gave the following replies:\n6. (d) Avez-vous jamais eu une maladie s\u00e9rieuse? Non.\n9 (a) Avez-vous consult\u00e9 ou \u00e9t\u00e9 soign\u00e9 par un m\u00e9decin au cours des trois derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es? Indiquez date, maladies, nom et adresse des m\u00e9decins? Pour aucune.\n10. (a) Avez-vous jamais souffert de: vertigo, \u00e9pilepsie, folie, \u00e9vanouissement, paralysie, n\u00e9vralgie, maux de t\u00eate fr\u00e9quents ou s\u00e9v\u00e8res? Non.\nThese answers were untrue.\nIf the answers thus given amount to a warranty or if they were made in bad faith, they would vitiate the policy, and further article 2487 of the Civil Code provides:\nMisrepresentation or concealment either by error or design, of a fact of a nature to diminish the appreciation of the risk or change the object of it, is a cause of nullity. The contract may in such case be annulled although the loss has not in any degree arisen from the fact misrepresented or concealed.\nThe learned trial judge took the view that the above statements were not in the nature of warranties, that there was no bad faith on the part of the deceased and that the misrepresentation did not diminish the appreciation of the risk.\nA majority of the Court of King's Bench in Appeal, consisting of Chief Justice Tellier, Mr. Justice Bernier, Mr. Justice Hall and Mr. Justice Galipeault, took a contrary view on each of these points.\nThe question of whether the answers amounted to a warranty is debatable and on the question of a good faith, in view of the finding of the trial judge, I do not express an opinion although there is much to be said on the position taken in the Court of Appeal.\nThere is no question as to the misrepresentations. What has to be decided is whether or not these misrepresentations were, in the language of article 2487, \"of a nature to diminish the appreciation of the risk.\"\nBriefly, the facts are that the deceased had suffered from occasional spells of dizziness onwards from the year 1932 and had consulted and had been treated by the family physician for this illness. In the month of January, 1936, at the suggestion of the family doctor, he went to consult a neurologist, Doctor Langlois of Montreal. He was put in that doctor's sanatorium twenty-four hours for examination and then Doctor Langlois diagnosed his trouble as being \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re\" and prescribed some medicines and a diet, and forbade him to drive his automobile.\nThe deceased afterwards consulted Doctor Langlois in the months of March and May and October. Apparently, outside of the vertige de Meni\u00e8re he was in good general health and he did not suffer any relapses of the \"vertige\" after having taken the doctor's treatment for some months. Doctor Langlois states:\nQ. Au mois de mars, il a constat\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame, comme vous qu'il \u00e9tait consid\u00e9rablement am\u00e9lior\u00e9?\nR. Non seulement am\u00e9lior\u00e9, mais au mois de mars il m'a dit qu'il n'avait aucun vertige.\nQ. Est-ce qu'il pouvait penser qu'il \u00e9tait absolument gu\u00e9ri?\nR. Je peux r\u00e9pondre ce que j'ai pens\u00e9.\nQ. Qu'est-ce que vous lui avez dit?\nR. Je lui ai dit que j'\u00e9tais encourag\u00e9 mais que c'\u00e9tait un peu trop t\u00f4t pour lui dire que j'\u00e9tais gu\u00e9ri (sic) mais au mois de mai, avec la continuation de la di\u00e8te, je l'ai consid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s s\u00fbrement gu\u00e9ri.\nHowever, Doctor Langlois was evidently not absolutely sure that he was cured, because he told him to come in again when he was in Montreal and, as a result of this request, he returned in October. It was in July in the (interim that he applied for the life insurance and gave the answers above mentioned. At the same time, it is not quite clear when he was given permission to again drive his automobile. Doctor Langlois:\nQ. Vous lui avez dit au mois de mars ou au mois de mai qu'il pouvait conduire son automobile?\nR. Je peux pas dire exactement si c'est en mai ou octobre, je ne peux pas dire qu-and je lui ai permis, mais je me rappelle bien lui avoir dit: \"Ca fait plusieurs mois que vous n'avez pas de vertige, je suis certain que vous pouvez conduire votre automobile.\" Je ne peux pas dire si c'est en mai ou octobre.\nIt appears from the medical evidence that the \"vertige de Meni\u00e8re\" is not a disease which is likely to result in death, other than through accident. I think also from the evidence that it is a disease which may recur. The fact that, although the deceased had been consulting Doctor Langlois from January until May, the latter still thought it wise to have him come back, is some evidence of a fear on the part of the doctor of recurrence of the trouble.\nThe medical evidence is to the effect that the condition of the deceased was such that if true answers had been given, a further thorough medical examination would have been required before an insurance company would have decided to issue the policy. In view of the fact that there was the possibility of the recurrence of this dizziness and that the policy covered disability from accidents as well as death, I find it very difficult to hold that the failure to answer these questions truly did not \"diminish the appreciation of the risk\" insured against, particularly in view of the fact that the additional provisions for benefits in case of invalidity were provided without any special addition to the premium. On this ground, I agree with the majority in the Court of Appeal and would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Jules Savard.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Gravel, Thomson & Gravel.\n[1] [1902] 1 K.B.D. 516.\n2 (1886) 117 U.S. Rep. 519.\n3 [1929] 2 K.B.D. 356.\n4 [1922] 2 A.C. 413.\n1 [1902] 1 K.B.D. 516.\n2 (1886) 117 U.S. Rep. 519.\n3 [1929] 2 K.B.D. 356.\n5 [1922] 2 A.C. 413.\n6 [1917] A.C. 592.\n7 [1925] A.C. 344.\n8 [1925] A.C. 344.\n9 [1922] 2 A.C. 413.\n[2] [1925] A.C. 344.\n"

Sharp and Others (Defendants) Respondents.\n1940: November 4, 5, 6; 1940: December 20.\nPresent: Rinfret, Crocket, Davis, Hudson and Taschereau JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nInsurance\u2014Fidelity\u2014Companies\u2014Auditors' duties\u2014Statutory audit\u2014Special and complete audit\u2014Cashier's dishonesty\u2014Failure to check customer's accounts\u2014Cash book\u2014Bank deposit slips\u2014Dominion Companies Act, 1934, 24-25 Geo. V, c. 33, s. 120.\nWhen a firm of accountants has merely been appointed to act as auditors of an advertising company, without any special terms or conditions as may have been contained in a by-law or a special contract and, thus, where the definition of their duties must be found entirely within the language of section 120 of the Dominion Companies Act, their duties are those, and only those, imposed upon them by the statute.\nA contract imposing upon them the duty of making the statutory audit therein referred to and of issuing a certificate to the effect that the balance sheet was \"properly drawn up so as to exhibit a true \"and correct view of the state of the company's affairs * * * as \"shown by the books of the company\" does not call for a more complete and detailed audit, unless some circumstances would give rise to suspicion of dishonesty or irregularities.\nIn the absence of any suspicion as to the honesty of a cashier, who as a fact had been guilty of defalcations for a period of nearly six years before they were discovered, the auditors were not obliged, as in this case, to compare the details of the bank daily deposit slips with the entries in the cash book: they were bound only to exercise a reasonable amount of care and skill in order to ascertain that the books were showing the company's true position; or, adopting the words used by Lopes LJ. in In re Kingston Cotton Mill Co. (1896 2 Ch. 279), \"it is the duty of an auditor to bring to bear on the work he has to perform, that skill, care and caution which a reasonably competent, careful and cautious auditor would use\"; and, using a term of the Quebec law system, auditors must act \"en bons p\u00e8res de famille \".\nUpon an action brought by an insurance company, which had issued a fidelity bond on the employees of the advertising company and which had been subrogated in that company's rights, if any, against the auditors, held, applying the principles enunciated in the decisions below-mentioned to the particular facts of this case, that there was no such neglect or default on the part of the auditors as would entitle the advertising company, were it the plaintiff, to succeed in the action. In re London and General Bank (No. 2) ([1895] 2 Oh. 673); In re Kingston Cotton Mill Company (No. 2) ([1896] 2 Ch. 279); London Oil Storage Company Limited v. Seear, Hasluck and Co. (Dicksee on Auditing, 11th ed., p. 783) and In re City Equitable Fire Insurance Company Limited ([1925] Oh. 407) referred to.\nComments as to whether, assuming that there was some: breach of duty on the part of the auditors, a claim based on such a breach of duty would have been covered by the subrogation document in favour of the appellant; and also, assuming it were covered by the subrogation, what would be the measure of damages for such a breach of duty.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, L. Cousineau J. and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe appellant company, having by its policy of insurance guaranteed to the Claude N\u00e9on General Advertising, Limited the honesty of its cashier, A. O. Cl\u00e9ment, was, since the cashier turned out to be a defaulter, obliged to pay the N\u00e9on Company $5,000, and, having received subrogation of that company's rights, instituted an action against the respondents, alleging that the theft, misappropriation or fraudulent conversion by Cl\u00e9ment, were rendered possible and caused through the neglect and want of professional skill of the respondents, in particular because they failed to check the bad accounts of the company and to compare, check and verify the moneys received, as shown by the general cash book and the certified bank deposit slips, in which were entered the names of the makers of cheques which did not appear in the cash book itself. The respondents alleged that they exercised reasonable care and skill in the performance of their duty; that Cl\u00e9ment was never subject to their discipline or control, and that he succeeded in deluding his employers, the officers of the N\u00e9on Company, into extraordinary practices, by which were created possibilities for dishonesty which were beyond the scope of investigation and inquiry of an ordinary audit; that any loss sustained by the N\u00e9on Company is attributable to the dishonesty of Cl\u00e9ment and the gross negligence and incompetence of the assistant-secretary of the N\u00e9on Company, whose duty it was to supervise Cl\u00e9ment.\nThe questions at issue and more detailed statement of the facts are contained in the judgments now reported. Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and N. Charbonneau for the appellant.\nJohn T. Hackett K.C. and Lindsay H. Place for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014La Guardian Insurance Company, l'appelante, avait \u00e9mis une police d'assurance destin\u00e9e \u00e0 indemniser la Claude N\u00e9on General Advertising Limited jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de $5,000 contre les d\u00e9falcations de ses employ\u00e9s. Comme r\u00e9sultat de la manipulation de certains comptes, le caissier de cette derni\u00e8re compagnie a d\u00e9tourn\u00e9 durant une p\u00e9riode de pr\u00e8s de cinq ans une somme de $6,756.41, et l'appelante a d\u00fb payer \u00e0 son assur\u00e9e, en vertu de sa police, la somme de $5,000.\nElle poursuit maintenant pour ce montant les intim\u00e9sauditeurs de la Claude N\u00e9on, et ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 subrog\u00e9e dans les droits de cette derni\u00e8re, elle all\u00e8gue qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gligents dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions et qu'ils n'ont pas, comme ils auraient d\u00fb le faire, d\u00e9couvert le syst\u00e8me employ\u00e9 par Cl\u00e9ment pour frauder son employeur. En Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, l'action a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue, mais la Cour du Banc du Roi, l'honorable juge-en-chef et l'honorable juge Gibsone dissidents, en est venue \u00e0 la conclusion que la responsabilit\u00e9 des intim\u00e9s n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, et a rejet\u00e9 l'action.\nLe syst\u00e8me employ\u00e9 par Cl\u00e9ment pour convertir \u00e0 son usage personnel les fonds dont il avait la garde \u00e9tait assez ing\u00e9nieux. Lorsqu'un client de Claude N\u00e9on se pr\u00e9valait de la Loi des Faillites, ou lorsqu'on faisait avec lui un compromis pour la paiement de son compte, ou bien encore lorsque l'on confiait la r\u00e9clamation contre lui aux avocats de la Compagnie, on inscrivait son nom dans un r\u00e9gistre sp\u00e9cial avec tous les autres mauvais comptes. L'assistantsecr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier, M. Tulloch, apposait ses initiales vis-\u00e0-vis le nom de celui qui ainsi \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme incapable de remplir son obligation. Depuis ce moment, aucune facture n'\u00e9tait adress\u00e9e \u00e0 ce d\u00e9biteur et il fallait attendre la remise de l'avocat de la Compagnie ou les dividendes du syndic \u00e0 la faillite. Le syst\u00e8me imagin\u00e9 par Cl\u00e9ment consistait \u00e0 s'emparer de ces remises, \u00e0 ne les entrer nulle part dans les livres, et \u00e0 garder ces ch\u00e8ques en sa possession jusqu'au moment o\u00f9 des clients dont les comptes \u00e9taient actifs venaient au comptoir payer en argent ce qu'ils devaient.\nCl\u00e9ment s'appropriait alors cet argent, jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence du montant des ch\u00e8ques des mauvais comptes, entrait dans le livre de caisse les noms de ceux qui payaient en argent, et, pour balancer, d\u00e9posait en banque les ch\u00e8ques qu'il avait en sa possession. Ce syst\u00e8me dont les auditeurs ne s'aper\u00e7urent pas dura au-del\u00e0 de quatre ans et permit au caissier de d\u00e9tourner la somme de $6,756.41. A cause d'un changement dans le syst\u00e8me de perception des comptes, on d\u00e9couvrit qu'un montant de $13.50 qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 n'\u00e9tail cr\u00e9dit\u00e9 nulle part. La Compagnie en avertit aussit\u00f4t les auditeurs qui firent une enqu\u00eate sp\u00e9ciale avec les r\u00e9sultats que cette fraude fut mise \u00e0 jour et le montant de la defalcation d\u00e9finitivement \u00e9tabli.\nLa faute des auditeurs r\u00e9side, pr\u00e9tend l'appelante, dans le fait qu'ils n'ont pas compar\u00e9 les entr\u00e9es quotidiennes du livre de caisse avec les copies des bordereaux de d\u00e9p\u00f4ts. On aurait pu s'apercevoir ainsi, parce que les noms des signataires des cheques apparaissaient sur les bordereaux, qu'il y avait sur ceux-ci des noms ne figurant pas au livre de caisse et ces dissemblances auraient imm\u00e9diatement fait na\u00eetre des soup\u00e7ons.\nIl est n\u00e9cessaire, pour bien determiner les responsabilit\u00e9s, s'il en existe, d'examiner la nature et l'\u00e9tendue des services que les intim\u00e9s \u00e9taient appel\u00e9s \u00e0 rendre \u00e0 Claude N\u00e9on. Aucun contrat \u00e9crit n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit, mais on trouve cependant un r\u00e8glement des actionnaires pass\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la Loi F\u00e9d\u00e9rale des Compagnies, nommant les intim\u00e9s auditeurs, et rien dans le dossier ne d\u00e9termine les devoirs qu'ils doivent remplir. Il n'y a aucune restriction qui limite, et aucun engagement qui augmente leurs obligations. Il s'ensuit donc qu'ils ont \u00e0 remplir les devoirs impos\u00e9s par la loi telle qu'interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e par les auteurs et la jurisprudence.\nL' article 120 de la Loi F\u00e9d\u00e9rale des Compagnies se lit de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\u2014\n120. (1) Les v\u00e9rificateurs doivent faire aux actionnaires un rapport sur les comptes qu'ils ont examin\u00e9s et sur tout bilan pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la Compagnie lors d'une assembl\u00e9e annuelle pendant la dur\u00e9e de leur charge. Ce rapport doit mentionner: (a) s'ils out obtenu ou non tons les renseignements et explications qu'ils ont demand\u00e9s; et,\n(b) si, \u00e0 leur avis, le bilan qui fait l'objet de leur rapport est bien dress\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 donner un \u00e9tat v\u00e9ritable et exact des affaires de la Compagnie, du mieux qu'ils ont pu s'en rendre compte par leurs renseignements et les explications qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es et d'apr\u00e8s ce qu'indiquent les livres de la Compagnie.\nComme il est facile de s'en rendre compte, cet article ne determine pas tous les devoirs des auditeurs. Il dit bien que ceux-ci doivent faire un rapport aux actionnaires, qu'il est de leur devoir de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler si le bilan, dans leur opinion, repr\u00e9sente l'\u00e9tat veritable des affaires de la Compagnie d'apr\u00e8s les informations obtenues et les livres de la Compagnie. Mais, jusqu'o\u00f9 va leur r\u00f4le d'investigateurs, et o\u00f9 s'arr\u00eate leur obligation de chercher dans les livres pour trouver des irr\u00e9gulariti\u00e9s, voire m\u00eame des fraudes?\nCette cause qui a pris naissance dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, doit n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre jug\u00e9e suivant les lois de cette province. Il ne s'agit nullement d'une r\u00e9clamation d\u00e9lictuelle ou quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle fond\u00e9e sur 1'article 1053 C.C., mais bien d'une r\u00e9clamation bas\u00e9e sur le d\u00e9faut d'accomplir certaines obligations r\u00e9sultant d'un contrat d'engagement.\nIl n'y a pas dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec d'arr\u00eats qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus et qui puissent nous aider \u00e0 solutionner le probl\u00e8me de la responsabilit\u00e9 des auditeurs. Ayant en vue toujours qu'il s'agit de l'inex\u00e9cution d'une obligation contractuelle, je crois qu'il est difficile de mieux d\u00e9finir les devoirs r\u00e9sultant d'un semblable contrat, que ne l'a fait l'honorable juge L\u00e9tourneau qui s'exprime de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\u2014\nOr, il n'y a de responsabilit\u00e9 en dommages pour inex\u00e9cution d'obligation que si le d\u00e9biteur de cette obligation a fait ou omis ce que n'eut pas fait ou omis en semblable occasion un bon p\u00e8re de famille. Et ceci d\u00e9pend enti\u00e8rement, dans l'esp\u00e8ce qui nous est soumise, du crit\u00e8re que voici: qu'aurait donc fait dans les m\u00eames circonstances, tout autre v\u00e9rificateur comp\u00e9tent, diligent?\nCe principe qui doit nous guider est bien semblable \u00e0 la doctrine maintes fois appliqu\u00e9e en Angleterre, et o\u00f9 les juges des plus hautes cours ont maintenu que les auditeurs doivent dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions, faire preuve d'un degr\u00e9 raisonnable d'habilet\u00e9 et d'attention. Et nous devons d'autant plus nous inspirer de cette jurisprudence, si l'on consid\u00e8re que l'article 120 de la Loi F\u00e9d\u00e9rale des Compagnies que je viens de citer est semblable au texte de la loi anglaise.\nQuelques extraits des causes les plus importantes nous font voir l'uniformit\u00e9 de la jurisprudence anglaise, et ceux-ci, dans les limites d\u00e9termin\u00e9es par cette Cour dans The King v. Desrosiers[2], et Latreille v. Curley[3], peuvent sans doute nous servir de guides. Dans In re London and General Bank (No. 2) [4], Lindley L.J. s'exprime de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\u2014\nHe must take reasonable care to ascertain that the books show the Company's true position.\nDans In re Kingston Cotton Mill Company (No. 2) [5]:\nHe is bound only to exercise a reasonable amount of care and skill.\nEt plus loin, Lopes L.J. dit:\u2014\nHe is only bound to be reasonably cautious and careful.\nEt plus loin, \u00e0 la page 288 de la m\u00eame cause:\u2014\nIt is the duty of an auditor to bring to bear on the work he has to perform, that skill, care and caution which a reasonably competent, careful and cautious auditor would use.\nLes auditeurs, comme dans le cas actuel, \u00e0 qui on n'a pas confi\u00e9 la t\u00e2che d'ex\u00e9cuter un travail sp\u00e9cial, doivent donc remplir leurs devoirs avec la prudence, 1'attention et l'habilet\u00e9 qu'un autre auditeur comp\u00e9tent montrerait dans des conditions identiques. C'est en \"bons p\u00e8res de famille\" qu'ils doivent agir. Leur t\u00e2che consiste \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier si le bilan repr\u00e9sente bien la position financi\u00e8re de la Compagnie, d'apr\u00e8s les livres et les informations obtenues. Ils ne sont pas des d\u00e9tectives et ils ne sont donc pas tenus de pr\u00e9venir et de retracer toutes les fraudes que des employ\u00e9s malhonn\u00eates et ing\u00e9nieux peuvent commettre au pr\u00e9judice de leur employeur.\nIls sont justifiables de croire \u00e0 l'honn\u00eatet\u00e9 de certains employ\u00e9s qui jouissent de la confiance des directeurs de la Compagnie depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es de service, et il leur est \u00e9galement permis, lorsque les livres ne donnent naissance \u00e0 aucun soup\u00e7on, de s'abstenir de faire certaines recherches et investigations, qui pourraient \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaires dans des cas d'auditions particuli\u00e8res o\u00f9 des instructions sp\u00e9ciales leur sont donn\u00e9es. C'est d'ailleurs la jurisprudence constante telle qu'\u00e9tablie et par les arr\u00eats cit\u00e9s ant\u00e9rieurement et aussi par les suivants:\u2014\nDans la cause de In re London and General Bank (2) d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9e[6], Lindley L.J. dit:\u2014\nAn auditor has nothing to do with the prudence or imprudence of making loans with or without security. It is nothing to him whether the business of a Company is being conducted prudently or imprudently, profitably or unprofitably. * * * his business is to ascertain and state the true financial position of the Company at the time of the audit, and his duty is confined to that.\nDans la m\u00eame cause, \u00e0 la page 683:\u2014\nWhere there is nothing to excite suspicion, very little inquiry will be reasonably sufficient * * * where suspicion is aroused, more care is obviously necessary; but still an auditor is not bound to exercise more than reasonable care and skill even in a case of suspicion, and is perfectly justified in acting upon the opinion of an expert where special knowledge is required.\nDans In re Kingston Cotton Mill Company (2) [7]\u201e il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9:\u2014\nthat, it being no part of the duty of the auditors to take stock, they were justified in relying on the certificates of the manager, a person of acknowledged competence and high reputation, and were not bound to check his certificates in the absence of anything to raise suspicion and that they were not liable for the dividends wrongfully paid.\nAn auditor is not bound to be suspicious where there are no circumstances to arouse suspicion; he is only bound to exercise a reasonable amount of care and skill.\nLopes L.J., dans la m\u00eame cause, nous dit:\u2014\nAn auditor is not bound to be a detective, or as was said, to approach his work with suspicion or with a foregone conclusion that there is something wrong. He is a watch-dog, but not a bloodhound. He is justified in believing tried servants of the Company in whom confidence is placed by the Company. He is entitled to assume that they are honest, and to rely upon their representations, provided he takes reasonable care. If there is anything calculated to excite suspicion he should prove it to the bottom; but in the absence of anything of that kind he is only bound to be reasonably cautious and careful.\nEt plus loin,\nAuditors must not be made liable for not tracking out ingenious and carefully laid schemes of fraud when there is nothing to arouse their suspicion, and when those frauds are perpetrated by tried servants of the company, and are undetected for years by the directors. So to hold would make the position of an auditor intolerable.\nAller au-del\u00e0 de cela serait cr\u00e9er pour les auditeurs, comme il est dit dans les arr\u00eats ci-dessus, une situation intol\u00e9rable, et signifierait qu'ils assurent contre la fraude, et qu'ils sont responsables des habiles manipulations d'employ\u00e9s peu scrupuleux qui r\u00e9ussissent \u00e0 tromper la surveillance de leurs employeurs.\nDans le cas actuellement soumis \u00e0 la Cour, on reproche aux intim\u00e9s, et c'est le seul grief s\u00e9rieux invoqu\u00e9 contre eux, de ne pas avoir compar\u00e9 les bordereaux de d\u00e9p\u00f4t avec les entr\u00e9es au livre de caisse. Il est utile de se rappeler ici que tous les mauvais comptes de la Compagnie \u00e9taient initial\u00e9s par l'assistant-secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier, M. Tulloch, et, en cons\u00e9quence, soustraits du compte des profits et pertes. M. Turner, le vice-pr\u00e9sident, le tr\u00e9sorier et le g\u00e9rant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Compagnie nous dit:\u2014\nWhen the bankrupt estate of a customer was wound up, Mr. Tulloch's job was to see to it that we had received whatever dividends were due to the Company as disclosed by the report of the Trustee, and to authorize the balance of the account being written off as a bad debt. Mr. Tulloch was instructed to signify his scrutiny of the whole transaction by placing his initials on the entry writing off the bad debt.\nLorsque Cl\u00e9ment r\u00e9ussissait a percevoir le montant de certains de ces comptes, il d\u00e9posait, comme nous l'avons vu, ces ch\u00e8ques au compte de banque de la Compagnie sans faire d'entr\u00e9e au livre de caisse, et s'appropriait d'autres montants \u00e9gaux pay\u00e9s en argent. Il est possible que la v\u00e9rification des bordereaux e\u00fbt r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 certaines de ces malversations, mais les experts entendus, sauf M. Parent et M. Grant, nous disent qu'on ne peut se fier \u00e0 une pareille comparaison. M. Gordon Scott nous affirme que l'examen d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des bordereaux de d\u00e9p\u00f4t n'est d'aucune utilit\u00e9. M. Young, un des associ\u00e9s de Price, Waterhouse & Co., nous dit que l'examen des copies de bordereaux de d\u00e9p\u00f4t a peu de valeur comme moyen de v\u00e9rifier l'exactitude des recettes en argent. Il affirme que ces bordereaux ne sont pas une preuve de r\u00e9ception d'argent, mais bien une preuve que de l'argent a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la banque. M. L. E. Potvin jure que le bordereau de d\u00e9p\u00f4t peut faire mention d'entr\u00e9es qui n'ont aucune relation avec le commerce du client, qu'il peut y avoir eu \u00e9change de ch\u00e8ques avec ce client et autres accommodations, et il nous dit qu'il ne pourrait pas se fier \u00e0 ces copies de bordereaux de d\u00e9p\u00f4t. C'est aussi l'opinion de M. Maurice Chartr\u00e9 et de M. K. W. Dalglish qui tous deux croient que cette fa\u00e7on de v\u00e9rifier n'est pas certaine et qu'elle n'est pas g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement employ\u00e9e. La raison se devine facilement. Il peut se pr\u00e9senter des cas nombreux o\u00f9 un caissier honn\u00eate ne pourra jamais faire concorder les entr\u00e9es d'un jour inscrites au livre de caisse avec le bordereau de d\u00e9p\u00f4t. Si, ainsi, il re\u00e7oit au comptoir d'un client d\u00e9biteur de $25, un ch\u00e8que de $50, et lui remet $25 en change, le livre de caisse comportera une recette de $25 et le bordereau un d\u00e9p\u00f4t de $50. Si un autre client paye le m\u00eame montant au moyen de trois ch\u00e8ques diff\u00e9rents sign\u00e9s par des tiers, et endoss\u00e9s par lui il y aura encore une entr\u00e9e de $25 au livre de caisse, et sur le bordereau, le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de trois ch\u00e8ques qui n'ont aucune relation avec les affaires de la Compagnie. Le caissier peut changer le ch\u00e8que d'un officier de la Compagnie, qui appara\u00eetra au bordereau mais nullement au livre de caisse. Il peut aussi recevoir des ch\u00e8ques postdates qui ne seront pas sur le bordereau \u00e0 la date qui correspond \u00e0 celle inscrite au livre de caisse.\nL'on voit donc par ces t\u00e9moignages des experts et les exemples cit\u00e9s que cette faute reproch\u00e9e aux intim\u00e9s n'en est pas une en r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Ils se sont content\u00e9s de v\u00e9rifier le total des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts, comme le font tous les auditeurs prudents et ayant un degr\u00e9 raisonnable d'habilet\u00e9 professionnelle. Les intim\u00e9s ont agi comme les autres auditeurs agissent dans des conditions identiques, et parce qu'ils ont omis de faire cette v\u00e9rification qui ne se fait pas habituellement, on ne peut pas dire qu'ils n'ont pas agi en \"bons p\u00e8res de famille\".\nDevaient-ils surveiller davantage des comptes consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme mauvais comptes? Il ne faut pas oublier que l'appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 subrog\u00e9e aux droits de Claude N\u00e9on Limited. Elle a tous les droits de celle-ci, mais elle n'en a pas davantage. Les auditeurs ont sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Turner, vice-pr\u00e9sident et g\u00e9rant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, d'adresser une circulaire \u00e0 tous les d\u00e9biteurs de la Compagnie pour v\u00e9rifier l'exactitude des montants dus, mais celui-ci a refus\u00e9 cette suggestion en disant que le contr\u00f4le interne de la Compagnie \u00e9tait suffisant. Il y avait donc lieu d'assumer que ces comptes disparus des livres l'\u00e9taient r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. On sait que des auditeurs, qui louent leurs services \u00e0 une corporation employant de nombreux commis, sont tenus de donner moins d'attention \u00e0 certains d\u00e9tails pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 cause du contr\u00f4le interne exerc\u00e9 par les employ\u00e9s. Les tribunaux ne doivent pas \u00eatre plus s\u00e9v\u00e8res vis-\u00e0-vis les auditeurs qu'ils ne le sont vis-\u00e0-vis les autres professionnels. Du moment qu'ils agissent suivant les principes que j'ai mentionn\u00e9s d\u00e9j\u00e0, ils sont \u00e0 l'abri de responsabilit\u00e9 civile, et ne peuvent pas \u00eatre recherch\u00e9s en dommages si l'on d\u00e9couvre des vols dont l'examen raisonnable des livres ne faisait pas soup\u00e7onner l'existence. Il est vrai, comme on l'a dit, qu'ils ne sont pas employ\u00e9s seulement pour additionner, soustraire ou diviser, et qu'on a droit d'attendre d'eux un degr\u00e9 d'habilet\u00e9 qui permette \u00e0 la Compagnie de se rendre compte de sa situation financi\u00e8re. Mais il est \u00e9galement vrai qu'on ne peut pas exiger d'eux que le bilan qu'ils contresignent comporte une garantie d'honn\u00eatet\u00e9 de tous les employ\u00e9s, et qu'il est une assurance que leur vigilance n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tromp\u00e9e.\nLe certificat qu'ils donnent aux actionnaires indique la situation de la Compagnie, telle que r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e par les livres qui n'ont pas \u00e9veill\u00e9 de soup\u00e7ons, et d'apr\u00e8s les informations fournies par des employ\u00e9s responsables qui ont la confiance des directeurs. Ils sont des auditeurs, et non des enqu\u00eateurs sp\u00e9ciaux qui, eux, souvent doivent pr\u00e9sumer, \u00e0 cause de soup\u00e7ons pr\u00e9existants, la malversation et le d\u00e9tournement.\nPour ces raisons, je crois que le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi, qui a rejet\u00e9 l'action, est bien fond\u00e9, et je suis d'opinion de le confirmer avec d\u00e9pens.\nThe judgment of Crocket, Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nDavis J.\u2014Claude N\u00e9on General Advertising Limited (hereinafter for convenience called \"the company\"), with head office in the city of Montreal in the province of Quebec, carries on the business of manufacturing and leasing advertising signs. The company was incorporated in 1929 for the purpose of consolidating the activities of several advertising businesses theretofore carried on separately and became one of a group of nine companies whose consolidated balance sheet shows total assets to the amount of approximately four million dollars. That indicates in a general way the nature and extent of the business of the company.,\nIn November, 1935, shortly after a collector of accounts in the employ of the company had introduced for his own protection the use of a counterfoil receipt book, the auditors discovered that the company's cashier, Cl\u00e9ment, had stolen some money from the company. He had been a trusted employee against whom there had never been any suspicion of wrongdoing but when the defalcation was discovered an investigation was at once commenced to ascertain if there had been any other defalcations by this man. A thorough investigation of all customers' accounts, deposit slips, bankruptcy dividends and agreements with customers was made, with the result that this special investigation disclosed that comparatively small sums of cash had been taken by Cl\u00e9ment from time to time from as early as January 29th, 1931 (when $13.50 was taken) over a period of nearly six years, the total amounting to $6,756.41. Each of the items going to make up this total was a comparatively small sum, such, for instance, as $11.50, $7, $21.25, $18.65, $2, $14.44, $6.20, $1.74, $83.25, $10.31, $27.50, $19. I have picked out these items at random throughout the long list. In only a few instances was more than $100 taken at one time; the defalcations were usually of small amounts at a time.\nOne at once asks how this sort of thing was done in that it was not discovered for nearly six years. The obvious answer on the evidence is that Cl\u00e9ment was fully trusted by his superior officers in the large business, that there was no suspicion that anything like this was going on. And one naturally asks then: How did Cl\u00e9ment do this so as to evade discovery? Like most consistent practices of fraud, the system when explained seems very simple, though perhaps ingenious at its inception in the mind of the guilty person. What happened was this: Cl\u00e9ment from time to time induced Tulloch, the assistant treasurer of the company whose duty it was to supervise Cl\u00e9ment and who was specifically entrusted with credits and bad debts, to write off some comparatively small accounts as bad debts, though apparently Cl\u00e9ment himself regarded them as accounts from which the company might well receive some further payments. These accounts, I should think negligently by Tulloch, were closed and written off on the books of the company and became dead accounts. No further monthly or other statements of account went out to these customers and therefore if any of them subsequently paid in anything on their accounts they did not thereafter receive statements of account which would have indicated at once that their payments had not been properly credited to their accounts on the books of the company. Further, there were accounts of persons or firms which went into bankruptcy; when notice of bankruptcy was received the company filed its claim with the trustee in bankruptcy and these accounts were then closed out on the books of the company. Other accounts from time to time were given over to the solicitors of the company for collection and when that was done these accounts were closed on the books of the company and no further statement of account was sent by the company to the customer; the matter was left in the hands of the solicitor. Those three named classes of accounts, I take it from the evidence, represent the basis of the system upon which Cl\u00e9ment, the cashier, worked in taking moneys from the company. He did it this way: the company had an ordinary cash ledger in which he daily recorded or was supposed to have recorded all the incoming moneys which in most cases were by cheques but in some cases by small cash payments. Every day the cashier sent, or was supposed to send, all the moneys taken in that day, whether represented by cash or by cheque, to the company's bank for deposit. On the whole this was done faithfully day after day during the six years in question. But from time to time in order to take some money to himself Cl\u00e9ment did this: having received a cheque from a bankrupt estate or from the company's solicitor on a collection or in respect of one of the accounts that had been written off as a \"bad debt,\" he would hold the particular cheque and not enter it in the cash ledger. And then, when sufficient cash was in to amount to or exceed the amount of the cheque, he deposited the cheque at the bank to the company's credit but would take to himself the equivalent amount out of the cash in hand. It is plain that each day Cl\u00e9ment deposited or caused to be deposited in the company's bank the exact amount of money, represented by cheques or cash, which was shown in the cash ledger of the company as having been received that day by the company. The amount of the daily deposits as shown on the original bank statements to the company agreed exactly with the amount of the daily receipts as shown in the company's cash ledger. The company carried a fidelity bond on its employees which had been issued to it by the appellant, Guardian Insurance Company of Canada, and the appellant paid the company in respect of Cl\u00e9ment's defalcations $5,000, being the full amount of the bond. Upon payment the appellant took from the company a document headed \"Subrogation Receipt,\" in which the company acknowledged receipt of the $5,000 from the appellant in full settlement of all claims and demands under the bond in respect of defalcations on the part of Cl\u00e9ment and, in consideration of such payment, the company\nhereby assign and transfer to (the Guardian Insurance Company of Canada) each and all claims and demands against any other party, person, persons, property or corporation, arising from or connected with such loss and the said (the Guardian Insurance Company) is (hereby subrogated in the place of and to the claims and demands of the undersigned (Claude N\u00e9on General Advertising Limited) against said party, person, persons, property or corporation in the premises to the extent of the amount above named, and the said (Guardian Insurance Company) is hereby authorized and empowered to sue, compromise or settle in its name or otherwise to the extent of the money paid as aforesaid.\nThe document is dated July 10th, 1936.\nNeither the appellant nor the company itself took any proceedings against Cl\u00e9ment to recover the amount of his defalcations, or any part of them, but the appellant commenced this action on November 10th, 1936, in its own name, against the auditors of the company (who are the respondents in this appeal) to recover $5,000, the amount it had paid on its bond, alleging that the \"theft or misappropriation or fraudulent conversion\" by Cl\u00e9ment\nwas rendered possible by and was caused through the neglect, want of professional skill of the defendants; that such conversion would have been impossible if the defendants had done what they were bound to do, and what they had agreed to do towards the said company, Claude N\u00e9on General Advertising Limited, and its directors, and that the said loss was caused immediately by the said negligence, want of profesional skill of the defendants.\nThe appellant put its case on the alleged neglect of the auditors in failing to check what are called the \"deposit slips\u201d. Cl\u00e9ment had made out day by day the usual form of bank deposit slip in connection with the daily deposit of company's moneys at the bank. The original deposit slip was retained by the bank. The amount of the daily deposit would vary considerably but on some days would be several thousand dollars. But on any day that Cl\u00e9ment intended to misappropriate some of the cash on hand, he would deposit the particular cheque which he had been holding back with the other cheques received that day but the amount of cash he would deposit would be the amount actually received less the amount of the cheque which he had been holding back until that day. Cl\u00e9ment kept a carbon copy of each of these daily bank deposit slips. They appear to have been kept by him openly on a file on his desk; he must have known that it was not customary for auditors to check these carbon deposit slips or else he would not have adopted the system he did. While the bank stamped each of these carbon copies, it merely acknowledged that it had received \"the total amount\" as shown on the slip. The original deposit slips, which were left with the bank, do not appear to have been produced but I understand it is admitted that they were the same as the carbon copies. Strange as it may appear, on the days when misappropriations took place Cl\u00e9ment made marginal notes on the copy of the deposit slip for the day which he retained which would give him the information, if he ever wanted the information, as to what cheque was added in the deposit of that day that had not been shown in the cash ledger, and in some cases a notation of the difference in the cash. There was no explanation for the making or for the keeping of these annotated copies but I suspect that Cl\u00e9ment, at least at the inception of the defalcations, hoped to make good later on and wanted a record of exactly what he had taken. However that may be, the appellant says that if the auditors had checked not only the books of the company but these copies of bank deposit slips in Cl\u00e9ment's possession, his system would have failed and the company would not have lost the money. What the auditors say is that it is not customary in the practice of auditors to check copies of bank deposit slips because they are not original documents and that the bank's stamp on them is expressly limited to an acknowledgment that \"the total amount\" shown on the slip has been received and deposited to the credit of the company's account. The auditors say that they entirely shared the confidence of the superior officers of the company in Cl\u00e9ment's honesty and had no ground for suspicion and that as a matter of auditing practice a stamp by the bank on a carbon copy of a deposit slip that the total amount shown thereon had been received by the bank was not something which in the ordinary course they would examine because they had before them the company's original cash ledger with its details of the daily receipts and they checked and examined the original statements received by the company from the bank, showing the total daily deposits, against the daily receipts as shown by the company's cash ledger. The appellant's factum contains the admission:\nThere is no doubt that if these duplicate deposit slips had been in the form usually employed, they could have been of no assistance, in order to check the cash book.\nThe auditors had been appointed at the time of the incorporation and organization of the company in 1929. They then made out a programme or chart of their work which was known and accepted by the company and to which they adhered. They are admitted to be an old Montreal firm with an excellent reputation.\nIt is indeed a striking fact that Turner (himself a chartered accountant), who was the senior officer in charge of the company's office (being vice-president and secretary-treasurer for some years), testified that the company had foreseen \"something like this\" and had sought to cover it by internal checks and controls which he described. He said he did not criticize the auditors after the investigations had revealed the losses. Further, the Hon. Gordon W. Scott, who is acknowledged to have been one of the outstanding chartered accountants in this country and who was himself a director of the company, testified that had the audit of the company been under his supervision he would not have thought it an essential part of his duty to check the deposit slips. \"In a large public corporation,\" he said,\nI think the greatest safeguard you have is the internal organization, that one man is checking another all through the process, and if that is functioning properly, as is done in the larger corporations, we rely on the organization for the honesty of the employees, and in no sense do I believe it is the duty of an auditor to be a detective.\nMr. Scott said there was\nsomething like three or four hundred thousand dollars coming in within a year\nand\nsomething like a million and a half dollars on the books of the company and three thousand accounts and a lot of little accounts in instalments, and he thought the checking of the daily deposit slips by the auditors would be \"superfluous\" and \"useless\" work in the circumstances. Dempster, one of the partners in the auditing firm, testified that he had at one time suggested to the company that a communication be sent to each customer to ascertain if the customer admitted that his indebtedness to the company was exactly as shown on his card or ledger sheet but that his suggestion had not been carried out; Mr. Turner felt that the system of internal control was a sufficient safeguard against defalcations.\nBut Mr. Geoffrion for the appellant, with his usual vigour and lucidity of argument, pressed upon us his contention that the appellant was entitled to succeed in the action upon the ground that it was negligence on the part of the auditors not to have examined these copies of the bank deposit slips and that if they had, Cl\u00e9ment would have been frustrated in his scheme of taking the moneys from the company and consequently the auditors were responsible in law for the company's loss caused by Cl\u00e9ment's misappropriations. The liability of the auditors was put as coterminous with the liability of Cl\u00e9ment himself to the company.\nIn the view I take of the case it is unnecessary to determine the question whether or not under Quebec law the so-called subrogation receipt is sufficient to entitle the appellant in its own name to maintain this action against the auditors.\nI turn now to the consideration of the nature and extent of the duty of the auditors to the company. It was admitted that they had merely been appointed by resolution of the company \"to be the auditors of the company,\" without any special terms or conditions by by-law or agreement, and that the definition of their duty was to be found entirely within the language of sec. 120 of the Dominion Companies Act, 1934, ch. 33, which reads as follows:\n120. (1) The auditors shall make a report to the shareholders on the accounts examined by them and on every balance sheet laid before the company at any annual meeting during their tenure of office, and the report shall state\n(a) whether or not they have obtained all the information and explanations they have required; and,\n(b) whether, in their opinion, the balance sheet referred to in the report is properly drawn up so as to exhibit a true and correct view of the state of the company's affairs according to the best of their information and the explanations given to them, and as shown by the books of the company.\n(2) Every auditor of a company shall have a right of access at all times to all records, documents, books, accounts and vouchers of the company, and shall be entitled to require from the directors and officers of the company such information and explanation as may be necessary for the performance of the duties of auditor.\n(3) The auditors of a company shall be entitled to attend any meeting of shareholders of the company at which any accounts which have been examined or reported on by them are to be laid before the shareholders for the purpose of making any statement or explanation they desire with respect to the accounts.\nThe respondents were engaged then to make what is called a statutory audit for the company and their duties were those and only those imposed by the statute. A distinction was very properly made in the argument between a statutory audit and a special investigation that may be undertaken by auditors under terms of a special contract.\nThe language of the statutory duty here is substantially the same as the language in the Companies Act, 1879, which was under consideration in In re London and General Bank [8]. In that case Lindley L.J. said at p. 683:\nAn auditor, however, is not bound to do more than exercise reasonable care and skill in making inquiries and investigations. He is not an insurer; he does not guarantee that the books do correctly shew the true position of the company's affairs; he does not even guarantee that his balance-sheet is accurate according to the books of the company. If he did he would be responsible for error on his part, even if he were himself deceived without any want of reasonable care on his part, say, for the fraudulent concealment of a book from him. His obligation is not so onerous as this. Such I take to be the duty of the auditor: he must be honest\u2014i.e., he must not certify what he does not believe to be true, and he must take reasonable care and skill before he believes that what he certifies is true. What is reasonable care in any particular case must depend upon the circumstances of that case. Where there is nothing to excite suspicion very little inquiry will be reasonably sufficient, and in practice I believe business men select a few cases at haphazard, see that they are right, and assume that others like them are correct also. Where suspicion is aroused more care is obviously necessary; but, still, an auditor is not bound to exercise more than reasonable care and skill, even in a case of suspicion, and he is perfectly justified in acting on the opinion of an expert where special knowledge is required.\nLopes L.J., who concurred in the judgment of Lindley L.J., said in another case that came up the following year, In re Kingston Cotton Mill Company [9]: But in determining whether any misfeasance or breach of duty has been committed, it is essential to consider what the duties of an auditor are. They are very fully described in In re London and General Bank[10], to which judgment I was a party. Shortly they may be stated thus: It is the duty of an auditor to bring to bear on the work he has to perform that skill, care, and caution which a reasonably competent, careful, and cautious auditor would use. What is reasonable skill, care, and caution must depend on the particular circumstances of each case. An auditor is not bound to be a detective, or, as was said, to approach his work with suspicion or with a foregone conclusion that there is something wrong. He is a watch-dog, but not a bloodhound. He is justified in believing tried servants of the company in whom confidence is placed by the company. He is entitled to assume that they are honest, and to rely upon their representations, provided he takes reasonable care. If there is anything calculated to excite suspicion he should probe it to the bottom; but in the absence of anything of that kind he is only bound to be reasonably cautious and careful.\nLord Alverstone C.J., in summing up to a special jury in a case in the King's Bench Division on June 1st, 1904, said (London Oil Storage Company Limited v. Seear, Hasluck and Co. reported in Dicksee on Auditing, 11th ed., p. 783, at pp. 785 and 786):\nI will not adopt any fanciful expression which may be quoted from any particular judgment, but he (the auditor) has got to bring to bear upon those duties reasonable and watchful care, he has got to discharge those duties remembering that the company look to him to protect their interests. He is not, however, supposed to be a man constantly going about suspecting other people of doing wrong, and that is the only respect in which, I think, Mr. Bankes in his most able speech pressed the matter a little too high. While Mr. Hasluck has by the exercise of due and reasonable care to see that all the officials of the company are doing their duty properly in so far as the accounts are concerned, he is not bound to assume when he comes to do his duty that he is dealing with fraudulent and dishonest people; and there comes in the most important consideration from one point of view\u2014perhaps more important than the other, though I do not think of such substantial weight in this matter\u2014if circumstances of suspicion arise, it is the duty of the auditor, in so far as those circumstances relate to the financial position of the company, to probe them to the bottom.\nAnd further on at p. 787:\nMr. Isaacs is quite right in saying to you, as I have already indicated, that the auditor is not bound to assume that people are dishonest. On the contrary, he is entitled to think that they are honest.\nLord Alverstone later on said, p. 787:\n* * * I think the best concluding direction I can give to you for which I am responsible is, that he must exercise such reasonable care as would satisfy a man that the accounts are genuine, assuming that there is nothing to arouse his suspicion of honesty, and if he does that he fulfills his duty; if his suspicion is aroused, his duty is to \"probe the thing to the bottom,\" and tell the directors of it, and get what information he can. In re City Equitable Fire Insurance Company Limited[11] affords an exhaustive discussion, by Romer J. (as he then was) and on appeal by Pollock M.R., Warrington L.J., and Sargant L.J., of the duties of auditors. The report of the case extends to 125 pages. I shall quote only one passage from the judgment of Pollock M.R., at p. 509:\nWhat is the standard of duty which is to be applied to the auditors? That is to be found, and is sufficiently stated, I think, in In re Kingston Cotton Mill Co. (No. 2) [12]. As I have already said it is quite easy to have discovered something which, if you had discovered it, would have saved us and many others from many sorrows.\" But it has been well said that an auditor is not bound to be a detective or to approach his work with suspicion or with a foregone conclusion that there is something wrong. \"He is a watchdog, but not a bloodhound.\" That metaphor was used by Lopes L.J., in In re Kingston Cotton Mill Co. (No. 2) 12. Perhaps, casting metaphor aside, the position is more happily expressed in the phrase used by my brother Sargant L.J., who said that the duty of an auditor is verification and not detection. The Kingston Cotton Mill case (2) is important, because expansion is given to those rather epigrammatic phrases. Lindley L.J. says: \"It is not sufficient to say that the frauds must have been detected if the entries in the books had been put together in a way which never occurred to anyone before suspicion was aroused. The question is whether, no suspicion of anything wrong being entertained\", there was a want of reasonable care on the part of the auditors in relying on the returns made by a competent and trusted expert relating to matters on which information from such a person was essential.\" The judgment of Lopes L.J., as well as that of Kay L.J., may be looked at in support of the words of Lindley L.J., and also in support of what I have called the epigrammatic way of putting the auditors' duty.\nThe legal standard of duty of auditors (to adopt a phrase of Lindley L.J.), in the absence as here of any special by-law or stipulation of the terms of employment, is plainly defined in the decisions to which I have referred, and applying the principles of those decisions to the particular facts of this case I am unable to hold that there was any such neglect or default on the part of the auditors as would entitle the company, were it the plaintiff, to succeed in the action. The question is whether before the discovery of the thefts, in the then existing state of experience, failure of knowledge or foresight is to be imputed to the auditors for a breach of duty. Conduct pursued in the light of experience derived from the present knowledge of the system of defalcations can hardly be taken as a sufficient basis for a charge of want of care. There was nothing to indicate that the accounting methods and control of the company were so lax and inadequate that reliance could not properly be placed upon the books.\nBut assuming that there was some breach of duty on the part of the auditors to the company, there would be two answers, I should think: firstly, a claim based on such a breach of duty may not be covered by the subrogation document in favour of the appellant; and, secondly, assuming it were covered by the subrogation, what is the measure of damages for such a breach of duty? The auditors did not steal the money; they were not the direct cause of the loss. As Lord Alverstone told the jury in the London Oil Storage Company case above mentioned (Dicksee on Auditing, 11th ed., at p. 797):\nI do not know that I ever remember a question the solution of which was more difficult in the concrete. It is easy to put it in general terms: Was he guilty of breach of duty, and, if so, what loss was occasioned to this company by that breach of duty? You must not put upon him the loss by reason of theft occurring afterwards or before, but you must put upon him such damages as you consider in your opinion were really caused by his not having fulfilled his duty as auditor of the company.\nThe loss of the plaintiff amounted to \u00a3760; the jury awarded five guineas against the auditors.\nCanadian Woodmen of the World v. Hooper et al.[13], was a somewhat recent Ontario case. The auditors were held liable for breach of their duties to the plaintiff corporation. The trial judge, Raney J., awarded the corporation the full amount of its loss, $8,840.32, against the auditors as well as against an official of the corporation, but after the case had been twice before the Ontario Court of Appeal 13 the protracted litigation ended, so far as the auditors were concerned, with a judgment against them of only $1 as nominal damages. I do not pursue the difficult question of the measure of damages because, in my view of the case, it is unnecessary to do so. Nor do I find it necessary to consider the question of prescription raised by the respondents.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Charbonneau, Charbonneau & Charlebois.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Hackett, Mulvena, Foster, Hackett & Hannen.\n[1] (1940) Q.R. 68 K.B. 391.\n[2] (1919) 60 Can.

The King (61 Can. S.C.R. 608) approved.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the conviction of the appellant on an indictment for murder.\nThe appellant, being put on trial, pleaded that he was insane when the crime was committed. Subject to this defence, the crime was proved.\nThe trial judge, in charging the jury, instructed them in the following terms: \"The whole burden of proving insanity rests upon the defence, just as the whole burden of proving guilt rests upon the Crown. Every man is presumed to be sane and responsible for his acts until he, in defence of himself, proves the contrary.\"\nD. Gillmor K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. W. Long K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014It was settled by the decision of this Court in Clark v. The King[1], that where a plea of insanity is advanced on a trial for murder the law does not require the accused, in order to succeed upon that issue, to satisfy the jury that insanity has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt; it is sufficient in point of law if insanity is proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the jury.\nThe law, for reasons of policy which are well understood, draws a distinction as to the sufficiency of the evidence required to establish the affirmative of the issue of guilt or innocence in criminal proceedings, and that which is generally required as the basis of decision in civil cases. Mr. Best in his instructive work (as it is described by Willes J., in Cooper v. Slade[2], 12th ed.) says at p. 82:\u2014\nThere is a strong and marked difference as to the effect of evidence in civil and criminal proceedings. In the former, a mere preponderance of probability, due regard being had to the burden of proof, is a sufficient basis of decision; but in the Latter, especially when the offence charged amounts to treason or felony, a much higher degree of assurance is required. The serious consequences of an erroneous condemnation, both to the accused and society, the immeasurably greater evils which flow from it than from an erroneous acquittal, have induced the laws of every wise and civilized nation to lay down the principle, though often lost sight of in practice, that the persuasion of guilt ought to amount to a moral certainty; or as an eminent judge (Parke, B.) expressed it, \"Such a moral certainty as convinces the minds of the tribunal, as reasonable men, beyond all reasonable doubt.\"\nIt is the rule that prevails generally in civil cases, as this Court decided in the case above mentioned, which governs the jury in determining the issue raised by a plea of insanity.\nThe learned trial judge in charging the jury used language which, with the greatest possible respect, I think was calculated to confuse them as to this important point of the sufficiency of evidence in relation to the issue of insanity. They may very well have got the impression that the existence of insanity must be demonstrated in the sense in which the guilt of an accused must be established beyond reasonable doubt.\nSuch being the case, the verdict ought not to be permitted to stand and there should be a new trial.\nAppeal allowed and a new trial ordered.\n[1] (1921) 61 Can. S.C.R. 608.\n[2] (1857), 6 H.L.C. 746, at 772.\n"

The plaintiff having raised on appeal the point that the provincial courts had no jurisdiction to entertain such a defence on the ground that the Exchequer Court of Canada alone has the authority and the power to declare a patent or any claim therein invalid or void,\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, that the provincial courts have jurisdiction, concurrently with the Exchequer Court of Canada, to entertain a defence of invalidity of a patent. In doing so, the provincial courts will not assume to give any judgment setting aside the patent, but will merely deny the plaintiff the relief sought on the ground that the plaintiff's patent was invalid.\nDurable Electric Appliance Co. Ltd. v. Renfrew Electric Products Ltd. (59 O.L.R. 527; [1928] S.C.R. 8) ref.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Morrison C.J., and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nH. R. Bray for the appellant.\nE. G. Gowling for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014This appeal is from the courts of British Columbia and it concerns a patent bearing number 283712, issued on the second day of October, 1928, for \"Hot Air Heating Systems,\" upon an application filed March 23rd, 1927. The appellant brought his action in the British Columbia courts under section 54 (1) of the Patent Act, 1935. He complained that his patent had been infringed by the respondents; and he asked for a declaration to that effect, accompanied by an injunction restraining the respondents from constructing, using and vending the Hot Air Heating System, as well as for an order directing them to deliver up all articles found to have infringed, that all necessary accounts be taken and enquiries made and for the payment of damages, or profits, and costs.\nIn the trial court, the appellant succeeded; but in the Court of Appeal the judgment was reversed, on the ground that, as to a certain feature concerning top and rear radiators in the furnace, there was no claim in the patent to protect the monopoly invoked by the appellant, and, in respect of another feature called the \"Breather\", the device was not patentable at the time of the application therefor because it had been in public use or sale in Canada for more than two years prior to the application for the patent, and because the knowledge and use of that, device was of a public and open character several years at least previous to the application.\nAlthough the appellant brought the action before the British Columbia courts and prayed for a declaration that his patent was valid and in full force and effect, he raised before us, as he had done before the Court of Appeal, the point that the provincial courts had no jurisdiction to entertain the defence of the respondents based on the ground of invalidity, and that the Exchequer Court of Canada alone could do so.\nThe argument was that the respondents before the provincial courts could meet the appellant's action only by showing that they had not infringed the patent. If, on the other hand, they intended to urge the invalidity of the whole patent, or of some of the claims thereof, according to the appellant, they could do so exclusively by bringing themselves a substantial action for impeachment of the patent before the Exchequer Court of Canada, which alone had the authority and the power to declare the patent or any claim therein invalid or void.\nWe agree with the Court of Appeal that, in the premises, this objection to the jurisdiction of the provincial courts cannot be sustained. For the purpose of the present argument, it is immaterial whether we refer to the Patent Act, ch. 23 of the Statutes of Canada (13-14 Geo. V), assented to on the 13th of June, 1923, or to the Patent Act, 1935. The right of the respondents to plead as matter of defence any fact or default which, by statute or by law, rendered the patent void, is expressed in identical terms either in sec. 37 of the Act of 1923, or in sec. 59 of the Act of 1935. These sections read as follows:\u2014\nThe defendant, in any action for infringement of a patent, may plead as matter of defence any fact or default which by this Act or by law renders the patent void, and the Court shall take cognizance of such pleading and of the relevant facts and decide accordingly.\nThe court referred to in these sections is\nthat court of record having jurisdiction to the amount of damages claimed in the province where the infringement is said to have occurred\n(sec. 33 of the Act of 1923, or sec. 54 of the Act of 1935). It is not disputed that the court where the present action was brought in British Columbia is a court of record within the meaning of these sections; and we have no doubt that the respondents, in an action for infringement such as the present one, had the right to plead the invalidity of the patent in whole or in part. That right flows evidently from the terms of the relevant sections of the Patent Act.\nWe may say that jurisdiction in a case like this was entertained, without there being any point raised in regard to it, by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario in Durable Electric Appliance Company Ltd. v. Renfrew Electric Products Ltd.[1], from which a further appeal to this Court was dismissed[2]. In that case, the Appellate Division held that the patent in question was invalid and that the plaintiffs' action for infringement should be dismissed. In delivering the unanimous judgment of this Court, Anglin C.J.C., said:\nThe ground on which the Court of Appeal has rested its judgment is, we think, sound.\nEven if we were not bound by the judgment in the Durable case2, we would certainly decide in a similar way in the present case.\nTurning now to the merits of the judgment in the Court of Appeal of British Columbia: The appellant, heard at the trial, declared in positive terms that his invention consisted in the combination of a top radiator and a back radiator in a furnace:\nQ. You are claiming that your invention is a combination of these two? A. Yes, sir.\nAnd, at bar, counsel for the appellant did not put it on any different ground; but, when asked by this Court wherein the specifications and the claims of the patent covered such an invention, he referred to claims 8 and 9.\nFor the present purposes, it will be sufficient to set out claim 9, as the wording of claim 8 is wholly reproduced in claim 9, which consists merely of the same wording, plus the addition of the two last lines in the latter. Claim 9 reads as follows:\n9. In a hot air furnace having a casing enclosing a fire pot, and a dome in communication with a smoke header and a jacket depending from the smoke header and within the casing through which the smoke is adapted to pass to increase the heat radiating areas of the furnace, said jacket comprising a vertical pipe having a dividing wall defining a down flow and an upflow passage.\nNow, it is not possible to read into this claim a combination of what was described throughout the evidence as a top radiator and a back radiator.\nWhen called upon to show to the Court wherein no. 9 claimed such a combination as new and requested therefor the grant of \"an exclusive property or privilege\" (sec. 14-1 of the Act of 1923, or sec. 35-2 of the Act of 1935), counsel for the appellant contended that the words \"smoke header\" in the said claim were there to indicate the top radiator, and the word \"jacket\" to indicate the rear radiator.\nUnfortunately for the appellant, it is impossible so to read claim 9, in view of the wording of the whole specification and also of the reference therein to the drawings accompanying his application and which form an essential part of the patent issued to him. Wherever, in the descriptive part of the specification, the appellant wished to refer to the top radiator, he invariably described it as \"a radiator\"; whilst the expressions \"smoke-header\" and \"jacket\" are invariably used for the purpose of designating the rear radiator.\nIn claims 6 and 7, which admittedly have reference only to the top radiator, the latter is called \"radiator\"; but\u2014 which is still more significant\u2014the reference by number indicating the corresponding part in each figure of the drawing is no. 5 for the device designated as radiator and nos. 16 and 32 for the devices designated respectively as \"smoke-header\" and \"Jacket.\" And a mere glance at the drawings will show that no. 5 is there used to indicate the top radiator, while nos. 16 and 32 represent the Smoke-Header and Jacket. The latter aggregation, as described throughout the evidence, is declared to form what is called the rear radiator.\nIt follows that the same words (Smoke-Header and Jacket), in claim 9, cannot be taken, as contended, to indicate, the former (Smoke-Header) the top radiator, and the latter (\"Jacket\") the rear radiator. By the very terms of the specifications and by the references therein made to the drawings, it is shown inescapably that \"smoke-header\" and \"Jacket\" form together only the rear radiator, and the consequence is that the top radiator is not mentioned at all in claim 9, that nowhere in any of the claims referred to or invoked is there a claim made for an invention consisting in the combination of the top radiator and the rear radiator; and that, therefore, the appellant never got a patent protecting such a combination, nor granting an exclusive property and privilege therein.\nWe agree with the Court of Appeal that, as a result, the appellant fails in his contention that his alleged invention of the so-called combination was ever protected by the patent issued to him and that, therefore, he cannot make his patent the basis of an action for infringement against the respondents on that score.\nAs for the \"breather,\" which, we are told, is designated in the patent and more particularly in claims 10 and 11 as \"a tubular ring having a plurality of air jets,\" we find it impossible to follow the appellant in his contention that such \"breather\" was not fully anticipated within the meaning of the Patent Act. The Court of Appeal was unanimous in its finding to that effect and we think the finding is unquestionably warranted by the evidence, as we read it. In fact, the anticipation dated back to a great number of years previous to the application made by the appellant for his patent.\nIt is not disputable that the \"breather\" was used by others before the appellant contends that he invented it; that it was in public use and on sale in Canada for more than two years prior to the application, and in such a manner that it had become available to the public (sec. 7-1 of the Act of 1923; sec. 26-1-a and b and sec. 61-1-a of the Act of 1935).\nMoreover, it is even doubtful whether the appellant has adduced satisfactory evidence that the respondents, when they were using a breather in their furnace as far back as many years preceding the date of the application for the appellant's patent, were using a similar breather or, in the terms of claims 10 and 11 a similar \"tubular ring having a plurality of air jets.\"\nBut, be that as it may, the appellant finds himself on the horns of a dilemma for, either the breather used by the respondents was the same as that claimed by the appellant, and, therefore, the said \"breather\" was anticipated; or it was different and, in that case, there was no infringement of the appellant's claims 10 and 11 for the breather therein described.\nIn either case, the appellant fails and his action in that respect was rightly dismissed by the Court of Appeal.\nUnder the circumstances, it is not necessary to declare the appellant's patent invalid or void. It is sufficient to say that the patent, so far as concerns the alleged combination of the top and rear radiators, did not claim such a combination, or certainly did not claim it by \"stating it distinctly and in explicit terms,\" as required by the Patent Act; and, as a consequence, there could be no legal infringement of the combination alleged by the appellant to have been the substance of his invention.\nIn so far as regards the \"breather,\" on the evidence, it must be held to have been anticipated, as found by the Court of Appeal; and so far as claims 10 and 11 of the patent are concerned, they are invalid and void and they cannot form the basis of an action for infringement against the respondents.\nThe appeal is, therefore, dismissed with costs.\nDavis J.\u2014This appeal arises out of one of two actions commenced in the Supreme Court of British Columbia for damages for alleged infringement of two patents. The actions were consolidated and tried together. Morrison C.J., the trial judge, found in favour of the plaintiff on both patents. The Court of Appeal for British Columbia allowed an appeal in respect of patent no. 283712 issued October 2nd, 1928, for certain improvements in hot air heating systems or furnaces but dismissed an appeal in respect of the other patent relating to sawdust burners or feed units. The appeal to this Court, by special leave of the Court of Appeal, was limited to that part of the judgment of the Court of Appeal which relates to the firstly mentioned patent.\nThe defendant not only denied infringement but pleaded that the patent was invalid. The first point taken by Mr. Bray on behalf of the patentee, appellant before us, was that the defence of invalidity was an impeachment of the patent and was not open to the respondents in a provincial court. Mr. Bray contended that jurisdiction rests solely in the Exchequer Court of Canada, relying on sec. 60 (1) of the Patent Act, 1935, which reads:\n60. (1) A patent or any claim in a patent may be declared invalid or void by the Exchequer Court of Canada at the instance of the Attorney-General of Canada or at the instance of any interested person.\nBut by sec. 54 jurisdiction is expressly given to the provincial courts in an action for the infringement of a patent. It is provided, however, that nothing in this section shall impair the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court of Canada under section 22 of the Exchequer Court Act or otherwise.\nSection 59 of the Patent Act, 1935, reads as follows:\n59. The defendant, in any action for infringement of a patent may plead as matter of defence any fact or default which by this Act or by law renders the patent void, and the Court shall take cognizance of such pleading and of the relevant facts and decide accordingly.\nThe provincial court did not assume to give any judgment setting aside the patent; it merely denied the plaintiff the relief sought on the ground that the plaintiff's patent was invalid. That was the same course which was taken by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Durable Electric Appliance Co. Ltd. v. Renfrew Electric Products Ltd,[3], which judgment was affirmed on appeal to this Court[4].\nOn the merits of the appeal I agree entirely with the judgment of the Court of Appeal and do not find it necessary to add anything to the reasons given by the learned judges of that Court.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs. Taschereau J.\u2014The plaintiff Louis Skelding took action before the Supreme Court of British Columbia against the defendants, and claimed damages for infringement of his patent no. 283712, and an injunction restraining the defendants from constructing, using and selling the hot air heating system described in the letters patent. In his statement of claim, the plaintiff also prays for a declaration that the letters patent are valid and in full force and effect.\nThe action was maintained by the Honourable the Chief Justice of British Columbia, but the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, and set aside that part of the judgment relating to patent no. 283712 for any alleged infringement thereof.\nThe appellant submitted before this Court that under the dispositions of the Patent Act, the Exchequer Court of Canada alone had jurisdiction to hear the plea of invalidity of the patents raised by the defence.\nI cannot agree with that contention. Under the heading of \"Infringement\" the Patent Act says (sec. 54, par. (1)):\n(1) An action for the infringement of a patent may be brought in that court of record which, in the province wherein the infringement is said to have occurred, has jurisdiction, pecuniarily, to the amount of the damages claimed and which, with relation to the other courts of the province holds its sittings nearest to the place of residence or of business of the defendant. Such court shall decide the case and determine as to costs, and assumption of jurisdiction by the court shall be of itself sufficient proof of jurisdiction.\nThis section clearly gives jurisdiction to the Supreme Court of British Columbia to hear the present case which is an action for the infringement of a patent, but this jurisdiction conferred to the provincial court does not, as provided by subsection (2) of section 54, impair the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court of Canada under section 22 of the Exchequer Court Act.\nFurthermore, section 59 which reads as follows:\u2014\nThe defendant, in any action for infringement of a patent, may plead as matter of defence any fact or default which by this Act or by law renders the patent void, and the court shall take cognizance of such pleading and of the relevant facts and decide accordingly.\ngives the right to the defendants to do precisely what they have done in the present case. Having been sued by the plaintiff for infringement, they raise in their plea that the letters patent are invalid because the invention is not novel, is not useful, does not involve any inventive step having regard to what was known prior to the date of the letters patent, and because what is claimed to be an invention is not a proper subject-matter of letters patent.\nUnder the heading of \"Impeachment,\" section 60, subsection (1) says:\u2014\n(1) A patent or any claim in a patent may be declared invalid or void by the Exchequer Court of Canada at the instance of the Attorney-General of Canada or at the instance of any interested person.\nIt is, therefore, obvious that the Exchequer Court has jurisdiction to declare a patent void or invalid in an action for its \"impeachment,\" and that the provincial courts, and the Exchequer Court have jurisdiction in an action for \"infringement\" to entertain the issue of invalidity raised by the defence.\nMoreover, section 63 which reads as follows:\u2014\nEvery judgment voiding in whole or in part or refusing to void in whole or in part any patent shall be subject to appeal to any court having appellate jurisdiction in other cases decided by the court by which such judgment was rendered.\nindicates clearly that the provincial courts of appeal have jurisdiction to hear appeals from provincial courts voiding or refusing to void any patent.\nHaving come to the conclusion that the provincial courts have jurisdiction, I will now deal with the merits of the case itself.\nI see no good reasons to interfere with the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nIn his specifications the applicant must fully describe the invention and its use as contemplated by the inventor in such clear and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art or science to which it appertains, to make, construct, compound or use it. The specification must end with a claim or claims stating distinctly and in explicit terms the things or combinations which the applicant regards as new and in which he claims an exclusive property or privilege. In his evidence, the appellant claims that his invention is a combination of a top and rear radiator. Nothing in the claims indicates that the invention for which letters patent were issued is such a combination. As to the \"breather,\" I believe that it lacked novelty, and that many years before Skelding obtained his letters patent, this device was of a public and open character.\nThis appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.

Its right to do so was attacked in an action in which there were claimed against it a declaration that it was wrongfully maintaining its mains in the streets, etc., in said city and wrongfully supplying gas to the inhabitants, an injunction against its continuing to do so, a mandatory order for removal of its mains, and damages. Respondent defended the action and was successful, at trial and on appeals. Its legal expenses of the litigation were $48,560.94 (after crediting all sums recovered against the other party as taxed costs). The question now in dispute was whether that sum, which respondent paid in 1934, should be allowed as a deduction in computing respondent's taxable income for that year under the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 97.\nHeld: The sum was not deductible in computing respondent's taxable income. (Judgment of Maclean J., [1940] Ex. C.R. 9, reversed).\nPer the Chief Justice and Davis J.: In order to fall within the category \"disbursements or expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income\" (s. 6 (a) of said Act), expenses must be working expenses; that is to say, expenses incurred in the process of earning \"the income\"; and the expenditure in question did not meet that requirement. Lothian Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Rogers, 11 Tax Cases 508, at 521; Robert Addie & Sons' Collieries Ltd. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, 1924 S.C. 231, at 235; Tata Hydro-Electric Agencies v. Income Tax Commissioner, [1937] A.C. 685, at 695-6; Ward & Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Taxes, [1923] A.C. 145, at 149). Further, the expenditure in question was a capital expenditure. It was incurred \"once and for all\" and was incurred for the purpose and with the effect of procuring for respondent \"the advantage of an enduring benefit\" within the sense of Lord Cave's language in the criterion laid down in British Insulated v. Atherton, [1926] A.C. 205, at 213. (Van den Berghs Ld. v. Clark, [1935] A.C. 431, at 440; Moore v. Hare, 1914-1915 S.C. 91, also cited). Though in the ordinary course legal expenses are simply current expenditure and deductible as such, yet that is not necessarily so (as example, reference to Thomson v. Batty, 1919, S.C. 289).\nPer Crocket J.: The expenditure in question cannot be said to have been wholly and exclusively made by respondent \"as part of the process of profit earning\" according to the test formulated (on statutory provisions not distinguishable in effect, as regards the present case, from those now in question) in the Addie case (supra), 1924 S.C. 231, at 235, which test was expressly adopted and applied by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Tata case (supra), [1937] A.C. 685, at 696, and therefore is binding on this Court.\nPer Kerwin and Hudson JJ.: The test stated in the Addie case (supra), 1924 S.C. 231, at 235, and approved in the Tata case (supra), is applicable to the case at bar, and the expenditure in question was not one \"laid out as part of the process of profit earning\" within the requirement of that test. It was a \"payment on account of capital,\" as it was made \"with a view of preserving an asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade\" (British Insulated v Atherton, [1926] A.C. 205, at 213).\nAPPEAL by the Minister of National Revenue from the judgment of Maclean J. President of the Exchequer Court of Canada,[1] allowing the present respondent's appeal from the decision of the Minister of National Revenue affirming the disallowance of the sum of $48,560.94, paid by the respondent in the year 1934 for certain legal expenses, as a deduction in computing the respondent's taxable income for that year under the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 97. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported. The appeal to this Court was allowed, and the assessment of respondent (with said deduction disallowed) restored, with costs throughout.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. and A. A. McGrory for the appellant.\nR. C. H. Cassels K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Davis J. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice\u2014The point in issue in this appeal is whether certain legal costs incurred in the litigation about to be mentioned and paid in the year 1934 are deductible from the profits, or gains, of the respondent company for the purpose of assessing such profits, or gains, as income under the Income War Tax Act for that year.\nThe respondent company since 1904 had continuously supplied the Township of Barton and its inhabitants with natural gas under a by-law of that township granting perpetual rights for that purpose, and before and after that date has been developing gas fields and supplying gas to the inhabitants of other municipalities. Since 1904 parts of the township have been at different times annexed to the City of Hamilton. The respondent company has continued to supply the annexed territory with natural gas as before annexation. The United Company had since the year 1904 been supplying the City of Hamilton, as it was before the annexations and its inhabitants with manufactured gas under authority granted to it by by-laws of the City. About the year 1930 the United Company advanced a claim under these by-laws that it had the exclusive right to sell gas in the City of Hamilton including the annexed districts, and that the respondent company had no competing rights.\nPursuant to authority conferred by an agreement made between the City of Hamilton and the United Company dated March 24th, 1931, which agreement was confirmed by Statute of the Province of Ontario (21 Geo. V, Chap. 100), the United Company in the year 1931 took action in its own name as well as in the name of the City of Hamilton, in the Supreme Court of Ontario, against the respondent claiming:\u2014\n(a) a declaration that the respondent was wrongfully maintaining its mains in the streets, public squares, lanes and public places in the City of Hamilton, and wrongfully supplying gas to the inhabitants of the said City;\n(b) an injunction restraining the respondent from continuing to so use the said streets, public squares, lanes and public places, and from continuing to supply gas to the inhabitants of the City of Hamton;\n(c) a mandatory order requiring the respondent to remove its mains and other property from the streets, public squares, lanes and other places of the City of Hamilton;\n(d) damages;\n(e) further and other relief.\nThe respondent company defended this action and in due course it came on for trial and was dismissed[2]. An appeal was then taken by the United Company from the judgment of the trial Judge to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which appeal was dismissed[3]. The United Company then appealed to His Majesty in Council, which appeal was also dismissed[4]. The costs of this litigation paid by the respondent company in the year 1934 amounted to $48,560.94 after crediting all sums recovered against the United Company as taxed costs.\nIn its Income Tax return for 1934 the respondent company deducted from its taxable income this sum of $48,560.94, returning a taxable income of $202,326.86. This deduction was disallowed and the respondent company's assessment was increased accordingly. The respondent appealed to the Minister of National Revenue who dismissed the appeal, and thereupon appealed to the Exchequer Court of Canada and this appeal was allowed[5]. The Minister now appeals from that judgment.\nThe relevant statutory provisions are:\u2014\nDeductions not allowed.\n6. In computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed, a deduction shall not be allowed in respect of:\u2014\nExpenses not laid out to earn income.\n(a) disbursements or expenses not wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income;\nCapital outlays or losses, etc.\n(b) any outlay, loss or replacement of capital or any payment on account of capital or any depreciation, depletion or obsolescence, except as otherwise provided in this Act.\n[There are two broad grounds upon which I think the Minister is entitled to succeed. First, in order to fall within the category \"disbursements or expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income,\" expenses must, I think, be working expenses; that is to say, expenses incurred in the process of earning \"the income.''] The judgment of Lord Clyde in Lothian Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Rogers[6] seems to point to the material distinction. The passage is pertinent, because the words Lord Clyde is applying are more comprehensive than those of sec. 6 (a). He says:\nThe question, and the only question it seems to me that arises in the present case, is this. Was the expenditure of the original \u00a34,000 an expenditure which was part of the working expenses of the business carried on by this Company, that is to say, expenditure laid out in the process of manufacture and of sale by which the Company expected to make profit from year to year? Or, on the other hand, was this expenditure which was necessary to acquire the disposal of property, buildings or plant, the use of which was necessary for conducting the processes of the manufacture and sale of the Company, so long as those processes were carried on? My Lords, if those two alternative questions fairly state the question here, there can be no doubt whatever upon which side the expenditure in question falls. It was not part of the working expenses of the Company, and it cannot be so represented. It was expenditure which was made for the purpose of acquiring the disposal of property or plant which was to be used in the business of the Company, namely, the manufacture of some chemical products and, in this case, of one chemical product in particular, and which was to be so used, not for the purpose of making profit in any particular year, but for the purpose of such manufacture so long as that manufacture might be carried on.\nSimilar language is used by Lord Clyde in Addie's case[7] and was approved and applied by Lord Macmillan in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Tata v. Income Tax Commissioner[8]. Under s. 10, sub-s. 2, of the Indian Income-tax Act the profits or gains of any business carried on by the assessee are to be computed after making allowance for \"(ix) any expenditure (not being in the nature of capital expenditure) incurred solely for the purpose of earning such profits or gains.\" Lord Macmillan said at pp. 695-696:\u2014\nTheir Lordships recognize, and the decided cases show, how difficult it is to discriminate between expenditure which is, and expenditure which is not, incurred solely for the purpose of earning profits or gains. * * * In short, the obligation to make these payments was undertaken by the appellants in consideration of their acquisition of the right and opportunity to earn profits, that is, of the right to conduct the business, and not for the purpose of producing profits in the conduct of the business. * * * * * In the case of Robert Addie & Sons' Collieries, Ld. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1), the Lord President (Clyde), dealing with corresponding words in the British Income-tax Act, says: \"What is 'money wholly and exclusively laid out for the purposes of the trade' is a question which must be determined upon the principles of ordinary commercial trading. It is necessary, accordingly, to attend to the true nature of the expenditure, and to ask oneself the question, Is it a part of the Company's working expenses; is it expenditure laid out as part of the process of profit earning?\" Adopting this test, their Lordships are of opinion that the deduction claimed by the appellants is inadmissible as not being expenditure incurred solely for the purpose of earning the profits or gains of the business carried on by the appellants.\nThe distinction is also explained in the judgment of the Court of Appeal for New Zealand in a passage approved by the Judicial Committee in Ward & Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Taxes[9]. \"We find it quite impossible to hold that the expenditure was incurred exclusively, or at all, in the production of the assessable income. It was incurred not for the production of income, but for the purpose of preventing the extinction of the business from which the income was derived, which is quite a different thing. It was contended by the Company that it was illogical that while legitimate expenses incurred in the production of the income are deductible, similar expenses incurred for the much more important purpose of keeping the profit-making business alive are not deductible, and, further, that it was inequitable that the Legislature should, on the one hand, force a certain class of traders into a struggle for their very existence, and, on the other hand, treat the reasonable expenses incurred in connection with such struggle as part of the profits assessable to income tax. These aspects of the matter are clearly and forcibly set out in the contentions of the Company as embodied in the correspondence with the Commissioner contained in the case, but they raise questions which can only be dealt with appropriately by the Legislature. This Court, however, cannot be influenced by such considerations, being concerned only with the interpretation and application of the law as it stands.\"\nTheir Lordships agree with this reasoning. * * * The expense may have been wisely undertaken, and may properly find a place, either in the balance sheet or in the profit-and-loss account of the appellants; but this is not enough to take it out of the prohibition in s. 86, subs. 1 (a), of the Act.\nAgain, in my view, the expenditure is a capital expenditure. It satisfies, I think, the criterion laid down by Lord Cave in British Insulated v. Atherton[10]. The expenditure was incurred \"once and for all\" and it was incurred for the purpose and with the effect of procuring for the company \"the advantage of an enduring benefit.\" The settlement of the issue raised by the proceedings attacking the rights of the respondents with the object of excluding them from carrying on their undertaking within the limits of the City of Hamilton was, I think, an enduring benefit within the sense of Lord Cave's language. As Lord Macmillan points out in Van den Berghs Ld. v. Clark[11]:\nLord Atkinson indicated that the word \"asset\" ought not to be confined to \"something material\" and, in further elucidation of the principle, Romer L.J. has added that the advantage paid for need not be \"of a positive character\" and may consist in the getting rid of an item of fixed capital that is of an onerous character: Anglo-Persian Oil Co. v. Dale[12].\nThe character of the expenditure is for our present purposes, I think, analogous to that of the expenditure in question in Moore v. Hare[13], where promotion expenses incurred by coalmasters in connection with two parliamentary bills giving authority to construct a line to serve the coalfield were held to be capital expenditures. Lord Skerrington at p. 99 says:\u2014\nOne can figure a case where a firm of coalmasters in the position of the appellants might incur Parliamentary or other preliminary expenses with a view to constructing a railway which was to be the private property of the firm, and which when constructed would be useful and would in fact be used wholly and exclusively for the purposes of their trade as coalmasters. Such expenditure would be of the same legal character as the actual cost of building the railway. It would be capital employed in the firm's trade as coalmasters, and therefore would not be a legitimate deduction from profits.\nI do not perceive any distinction between expenditures incurred in procuring the company's by-laws authorizing the undertaking and the expenses incurred in their litigation with the City of Hamilton.\nIn the ordinary course, it is true, legal expenses are simply current expenditure and deductible as such; but that is not necessarily so. The legal expenses incurred, for example, in procuring authority for reduction of capital were held by the Court of Sessions not to be deductible in Thomson v. Batty[14].\nThe appeal should be allowed and the assessment restored with costs throughout.\nCrocket J.\u2014In 1931 the United Gas and Fuel Company of Hamilton, Limited, and the City of Hamilton brought an action in the Supreme Court of Ontario to restrain the respondent from continuing to supply natural gas to the inhabitants of those portions of the City of Hamilton, which prior to the year 1904 formed part of the Township of Barton and subsequently became part of that city. The United Company claimed that by its franchise it had the exclusive right to supply gas in the City of Hamilton, including the annexed districts, and that the by-law of Barton Township granting the respondent a perpetual franchise to supply its inhabitants with natural gas, as it had been doing since 1904, gave it no right to supply gas to the annexed districts or their inhabitants subsequent to their incorporation in the city. The respondent defended the action, which was dismissed by the trial judge. The United Company appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which confirmed the trial judgment. A further appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was dismissed in 1934, and in that year the respondent expended the sum of $48,560.94 as costs and expenses in connection with this litigation.\nIn its income tax return for 1934 the respondent computed its taxable income at $202,326.80 after deducting the said legal expenses. The taxing authorities disallowed this deduction. The respondent appealed to the Minister of National Revenue, who affirmed the disallowance, and then to the Exchequer Court from the Minister's decision, with the result that the appeal was allowed[15].\nThe respondent contended before the learned President, who heard the appeal in the Exchequer Court, that the amount in question was wholly, exclusively and necessarily expended for the purpose of earning its income, and was not an outlay, loss or replacement of capital or any payment on account of capital, and therefore did not fall within either the prohibition (a) or (b) of s. 6. The learned President sustained this contention, and the Minister now appeals from that decision.\nIf we were free to decide this appeal on considerations of practical business sense and equity, or to deduce from decided cases the governing rule, which should be applied in determining whether the respondent was or was not entitled, under the formula prescribed by s. 6 of the Canadian Income War Tax Act, to the deduction claimed in computing its assessable profits or gains for the year 1934, I should have no hesitation in adopting the conclusion at which the learned President of the Exchequer Court arrived and the reasons he has given therefor. We are confronted, however, with a recent judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of the appeal of Tata Hydro-Electric Agencies, Ltd., Bombay, v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay Presidency and Aden[16], in which a test, formulated in 1924 by Lord President Clyde of the Scottish Court of Session in the case of Robert Addie & Sons' Collieries, Ltd. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue[17], for determining whether a deduction is allowable under practically identical provisions of the English Income Tax Act, 1918, is expressly adopted and applied. The English Act of 1918, ch. 40, 8 & 9 Geo. V, by rule 3 of Schedule \"D,\" prohibits deductions in respect of \"any disbursements or expenses, not being money wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for the purposes of the trade, profession, employment or vocation,\" or in respect of \"any capital withdrawn from, or any sum employed or intended to be employed as capital in such trade,\" etc., as well as other specified capital expenditures for improvements and the like, the effect of which, as regards this case, it seems to be impossible to distinguish from the prohibitions (a) and (b) of s. 6 of the Canadian Act. I apprehend, therefore, that the test so distinctly adopted by the Judicial Committee in the Tata case[18] is binding upon us. In delivering judgment in the Addie case[19], the Lord President of the Court of Sessions said:\u2014\nWhat is \"money wholly and exclusively laid out for the purposes of the trade\" is a question which must be determined upon the principles of ordinary commercial trading. It is necessary, accordingly, to attend to the true nature of the expenditure, and to ask oneself the question, Is it a part of the Company's working expenses; is it expenditure laid out as part of the process of profit earning?\nLord Macmillan in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the Tata case[20] quoted this passage and immediately added:\nAdopting this test, their Lordships are of opinion that the deduction claimed by the appellants is inadmissible as not being expenditure incurred solely for the purpose of earning the profits or gains of the business carried on by the appellants.\nIt should perhaps here be pointed out that in the Tata case[21] the deduction claimed was for an amount equal to 25% of the commission earned and received by the appellants as managing agents of the Tata Power Co. Ltd. and of three other electric power companies in India, which proportion of the commission they were required to pay to certain parties under the terms of the agreement by which they had acquired the agency from their predecessors.\nThe attention of the learned President of the Exchequer Court does not seem to have been called to this case. He did not refer to it in his printed reasons. No mention of it is made either in the appellant's nor in the respondent's factum, though Mr. Varcoe cited it in his argument before us. The learned President discussed the New Zealand case of Ward v. Commissioner of Taxes[22], and other cases, on which the appellant had relied in the hearing before him. He quoted extensively from the judgment of Romer, L.J., in Anglo-Persian Oil Co. v. Dale[23], and seems to have based his judgment that the expenditure in question was deductible under s. 6 of the Canadian Act as a proper charge against revenue rather than against capital upon the law as laid down by Romer, L.J., in the Appeal Court in that case and by Lord Loreburn, L.C., and Lords Macnaghten and Atkinson in Strong & Co. Ltd. v. Woodifield in the House of Lords[24]. In the last named case the House of Lords held that a payment by a brewery company to satisfy a judgment recovered against it for damages and costs for personal injury sustained by a customer sleeping in an inn, owned by the brewery company, owing to the negligence of the company's servants, could not be deducted in computing the company's profits for the purpose of income tax, the loss not being connected with or arising out of the trade and the moneys not having been wholly and exclusively laid out and expended for the purposes of the trade. Lord Loreburn in his speech in support of this judgment used the following language at p. 452 of the report:\u2014\nIn my opinion, however, it does not follow that if a loss is in any sense connected with the trade, it must always be allowed as a deduction; for it may be only remotely connected with the trade, or it may be connected with something else quite as much as or even more than with the (trade. I think only such losses can be deducted as are connected with in the sense that they are really incidental to the trade itself. They cannot be deducted if they are mainly incidental to some other vocation or fall on the trader in some character other than that of trader. The nature of the trade is to be considered. * * * In the present case I think that the loss sustained by the appellants was not really incidental to their trade as inn-keepers, and fell upon them in their character, not of traders, but of householders.\nLord Macnaghten and Lord Atkinson concurred in the Lord Chancellor's opinion as thus expressed, which, as I read it, lays down the rule that the test as to whether an expenditure is allowable under the English Income Tax Act (which was then of the same import as now) is, not whether it was made \"as part of the process of profit earning,\" but whether it was \"really incidental to the trade.\" Lord Davey in his speech in the same case, however, laid down the principle that:\u2014\nIt is not enough that the disbursement is made in the course of, or arises out of, or is connected with, the trade, or is made out of the profits of the trade. It must foe made for the purpose of earning the profits.\nSingularly enough, it was apparently upon this dictum of Lord Davey, and not that of the Lord Chancellor, concurred in by Lords Macnaghten and Atkinson, that Lord President Clyde of the Court of Session in the Addie case[25] formulated the test, which the Judicial Committee adopted 13 years later in the Tata case[26]. See Lord Clyde's judgment in the Court of Session, Session Cases (1924), at the bottom of p. 235.\nIn any event, we must now recognize the rule as expressly affirmed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and determine whether the expenditure in question in this appeal was wholly and exclusively made by the respondent as part of the process of profit earning. Being unable to convince myself that the expenditure falls within this strict formula, I have reluctantly concluded that the appeal must be allowed.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court[27] allowing an appeal by the Dominion Natural Gas Company Limited from a decision of the Minister of National Revenue whereby the latter disallowed the sum of $48,560.94 claimed by the company as a proper deduction from its income. This sum represents the company's solicitor and client costs in connection with an unsuccessful action brought against it by the United Gas and Fuel Company of Hamilton, Limited. As to that action, it is sufficient to state that the Dominion Company had been supplying gas to the inhabitants of the City of Hamilton for some years and the United Company attacked its right to continue so to do. If the claim had succeeded, the Dominion Company would have lost the franchise it had enjoyed and would have been prevented from earning any income from that part of its assets. The determination of the present dispute depends upon whether certain well-known provisions of the Income War Tax Act apply to the payment of the solicitor and client costs. Section 9 of the Act is the charging section and by it a tax is to be assessed, levied and paid upon \"income\" which by section 3 is defined as meaning \"the annual net profit or gain * * * being profits from, a trade or commercial or financial or other business or calling.\" By section 6:\u2014\nIn computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed, a deduction shall not foe allowed in respect of\n(a) disbursements or expenses not wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income;\n(b) any outlay, loss or replacement of capital or any payment on account of capital or any depreciation, depletion or obsolescence, except as otherwise provided in this Act.\nThe appellant does not deny that the costs were properly and reasonably incurred but contends that the payment falls within the prohibitions of both clauses (a) and (b) and that it must not be considered in fixing the annual net profit or gain.\nThe cases referred to on the argument deal with expressions used in other statutes and certainly, so far as clause (a) is concerned, I have been unable to derive any assistance from them. Ward and Company, Limited v. Commissioner of Taxes[28] was determined on the wording of the New Zealand Act there in question \"in the production of the assessable income.\" In view of the fact that that wording is less liberal and comprehensive than the wording in our statute \"laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income,\" the decision is, I think, inapplicable.\nHowever, as to the other two contentions, there are three decisions that may usefully be referred to. The first of these is Robert Addie & Sons' Collieries Ld. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue[29], where the Lord President stated[30]:\u2014\nWhat is \"money wholly and exclusively laid out for the purposes of the trade\" is a question which must be determined upon the principles of ordinary commercial trading. It is necessary, accordingly, to attend to the true nature of the expenditure, and to ask oneself the question, Is it a part of the Company's working expenses; is it expenditure laid out as part of the process of profit earning? The second is the decision in the House of Lords in British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd. v. Atherton[31]. In that case a sum had been irrevocably set aside out of profits as a nucleus of a pension fund, but it was held that the expenditure could not be deducted from the profits. Viscount Cave pointed out that an expenditure though made once and for all may nevertheless be treated as a revenue expenditure but he then added[32]:\u2014\nBut when an expenditure is made, not only once and for all, but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade, I think that there is very good reason (in the absence of special circumstances leading to an opposite conclusion) for treating such an expenditure as properly attributable not to revenue but to capital.\nThis speech of Viscount Cave has been referred to a number of times and particularly in two decisions in the English Court of Appeal, Mitchell v. Noble[33], and Anglo-Persian Oil Company v. Dale[34], but it is unnecessary to consider the applicability of either of these.\nThe third case is Tata Hydro-Electric Agencies v. Commissioner of Income Tax[35],\u2014valuable, in the present instance, not so much for the actual decision as for the fact that their Lordships quoted with approval the extract from the judgment of the Lord President in Addie's case[36] set out above. The test established by him is applicable to the case at bar, and I have concluded that the payment of the costs was not an expenditure laid out as part of the process of profit earning. It was a \"payment on account of capital,\" as it was made (to use Viscount Cave's words) \"with a view of preserving an asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade.\"\nThe appeal should be allowed and the decision of the Minister re-instated, with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

Railway Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 170, sections 267 and 309.\nIn an action tried without a jury, resulting from a level-crossing accident, the main issue was as to whether there was sufficient evidence to connect such accident with an alleged default of the appellant railway company in respect of its obligation to properly maintain a crossing sign as required by the Railway Act and the regulations thereunder. At the trial, the appellant company produced as evidence a finding by the (then) Board of Railway Commissioners, made under section 309 after the accident, affirming a report of its inspector made when the crossing was in the same condition as it was at the time of the accident,\u2014that the crossing in that condition was sufficiently protected. The trial judge, although rejecting such evidence, nevertheless dismissed the respondent's action. On appeal, the judgment was reversed and the action maintained; but the appellate court also held that the finding of the Board of Railway Commissioners was not binding upon the parties to the action or upon the courts, and that it was not admissible evidence upon the issue whether the regulation requiring the placing of the sign at the crossing had been observed.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, ([1940] 1 W.W.R. 643) that the evidence did not justify the finding of the appellate court that the default in the condition of the crossing sign materially contributed to the accident, and, such being the case, the respondent's action ought to be dismissed.\nHeld, also, affirming the judgment appealed from as to that ground, that the finding of the Board of Railway Commissioners was not admissable evidence. Such finding was not evidence which did go to the crucial issue on the appeal, i.e., whether the default of the appellant company materially contributed to the accident.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Manson J., and maintaining the respondent's action. The action was for damages resulting from a collision at a level crossing between a train of the appellant company and an automobile driven by one Valentine, the respondent and his wife being passengers. The accident took place on a dark rainy night and the visibility was very poor. The driver stopped his car on the track, and six seconds later it was struck by the engine of a train. The respondent's wife died from injuries received.\nA. Alexander for the appellant.\nR. O. D. Harvey for the respondent.\nAfter the conclusion of the arguments by counsel for the appellant and for the respondent, and without calling on the former to reply, the Chief Justice, speaking for the Court, delivered the following oral judgment.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014It will not be necessary to call upon you, Mr. Alexander.\nWe have very fully considered the able argument that has been presented on behalf of the respondent and the evidence, as well as the judgments in the courts below, and we have come to the conclusion this appeal ought to be allowed.\nThe crucial issue\u2014the one issue\u2014is whether, or not, there is evidence which connects the alleged default of the railway company in respect of its obligation to maintain a sign in accordance with the regulation which has been produced and has been relied upon, and the most unfortunate accident in which the wife of the respondent lost her life. We have the greatest sympathy with the respondent, but in our judicial capacity we cannot allow considerations of that kind to weigh with us.\nNow, on that issue the learned trial judge found against the respondent; the Court of Appeal reversed his judgment and held either that this default connected itself with the accident, or that there was evidence connecting it with the accident. In other words, that the respondent had acquitted himself of the onus resting upon him.\nThe first thing to be noticed is that there is no finding of a jury. There is a finding in the judgment at the trial and that judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal and this Court in these circumstances is in this position: it must examine the evidence and form its conclusion as to the issue upon which it has to base its judgment, but the Court will not reverse the judgment of the Court appealed from unless it comes to a conclusion which is different from that at which that Court arrived. In that sense it must be satisfied that the judgment below is wrong, that the evidence leads to a conclusion which is not the conclusion at which the Court below arrived.\nNow, we are all satisfied that the evidence does not justify the finding that this default materially contributed to the accident, and such being the case the respondent must fail.\nIt is necessary to advert to the evidence that was before the trial judge which was rejected by the Court of Appeal. There was a finding by the Board of Railway Commissioners after this accident, when the crossing was in the same condition as it was at the time of the accident, that the crossing in that condition was sufficiently protected. The Court of Appeal held that that finding was not binding upon the parties to this action, or upon the Court, and that it was not admissible evidence upon the issue whether the regulation requiring the placing of the sign at the crossing had been observed. We are satisfied that the Court of Appeal was right in its conclusion that the evidence was not admissible. Counsel for the respondent dwelt upon the fact that the trial judge rejected that evidence, but it must be noticed, and it is very important to notice, that that evidence did not go to the issue which we regard as the crucial issue on this appeal; it did not go to the issue whether the default of the Railway Company materially contributed to the accident; it went only to the issue whether there was default in a failure to comply with the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nIn any case, the real substantial question for this Court is the question whether, on its own view of the evidence, the judgment of the Court of Appeal ought to be sustained, and our view as to the effect of the evidence leads to a conclusion contrary to that of the Court of Appeal, whose judgment is therefore reversed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, if asked for.\nSolicitor for the appellant.

An appeal was brought to this Court, and respondent moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nHeld: It is the settled practice, the settled course of this Court, not to interfere with a judgment of that type by the Court of last resort in a province. It is in essence and in substance a matter of procedure only. And it is also the settled course of this Court that when on a motion to quash it plainly appears to the Court that the appeal is one which, if it came on in the regular and ordinary way, must be dismissed, the Court will on that ground quash the appeal. The appeal was accordingly quashed. (No opinion was expressed as to respondent\u2019s contention that the judgment appealed from was not a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 35).\nMOTION to quash an appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nThe appellant had applied by way of originating notice of motion in the Supreme Court of Ontario for an order terminating the trust declared in a certain trust deed and for other relief. McFarland J. dismissed the motion with costs. His reasons were:\nThis application does not come within the provisions of Rule 600. The proper procedure is by action.\nThe appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. That Court, by its order, dismissed her appeal,\nwith leave to the appellant to bring an action if so advised, without any expression of opinion by this Court as to the merits.\nAs to costs, the order of the Court of Appeal provided:\nthat upon the trial of the action, if one is had, the costs of this appeal and of the appellant\u2019s motion in the High Court Division be in the discretion of the Trial Judge but so nevertheless that the respondent shall be entitled to its costs of this appeal and of the said motion as between solicitor and client to be paid out of the trust fund, after the taxation thereof.\nThe reasons of the Court of Appeal (Riddell, Masten and McTague, JJ.A.) were given by Riddell J.A. at the conclusion of the argument as follows:\nWe consider this case of some importance; and we think the facts should not be disposed of simply on affidavit\u2014the deponents not being cross-examined and not being seen by the Court.\nWe think that the facts should be determined by a Judge who sees the witnesses and hears their evidence on examination and cross-examination.\nWe accordingly dismiss the appeal, with leave to the applicant to bring an action, if so advised, without any expression of opinion on our part. [Costs dealt with in terms as above].\nNothing we have said is to be taken as an adjudication on any point in question, except that we do not deal with it.\nThe appellant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The present motion was made on behalf of the respondent to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction. It was contended in support of the motion that the judgment appealed from was not a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d (within s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 35); that the question was purely one of practice and procedure; and that no injustice would be done to either of the parties by the quashing of the appeal. These contentions were opposed by appellant\u2019s counsel, who also complained of delay in making the motion, much work having been done in the meantime in preparing the Appeal Case.\nJ.J. Connolly for the motion.\nJ.M. Laing, contra.\nThe motion was heard on October 7, 1940, and at the conclusion of the argument, the judgment of the Court was delivered orally, to the effect that the appeal be quashed without costs. (A further direction with respect to costs was made on October 29, 1940, as appears at the end of the reasons infra).\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (orally, for the Court)\u2014We have considered the very able argument of Mr. Laing and we have come to the conclusion that this is one of those cases in which it is plain that if the appeal came on for hearing in the ordinary way it could not be entertained by the Court, conformably to the course of the Court with regard to such matters.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario has held that the relief asked for, and the matters raised by the originating motion, are not matters which could be conveniently and properly considered by the Supreme Court of Ontario in a proceeding of this kind, and that to enable these matters to be properly considered and dealt with the proceedings ought to be commenced by writ; that is to say, they should be dealt with in a proceeding which is an action for all purposes.\nNow, it is the settled practice, the settled course of this Court not to interfere with a judgment of that type by the Court of last resort in a province. It is in essence and in substance a matter of procedure and only a matter of procedure. And it is also the settled course of this Court that when on a motion to quash it plainly appears to the Court that the appeal is one which, if it came on in the regular and ordinary way, must be dismissed, the Court will on that ground quash the appeal.\nIn the result then, this motion must succeed, but in the circumstances of this case we think there should be no costs either of the motion or in the appeal.\nWe do not decide any question as to whether in the strict sense the Court would have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal; that is to say, whether there is a final judgment. We express no opinion on that point.\n(29th October, 1940)\nThe order as to costs will be without prejudice to the right, if any, of the Trusts Corporation to apply to the proper tribunal for its costs (taxed as between solicitor and client) to be paid out of the trust fund.\nAppeal quashed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.M. Laing.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Malone, Malone & Montgomery.\n"

Plaintiff claimed: specific performance; payment of arrears and interest due, and, under an acceleration clause, payment of the balance of purchase price; in default of payment, cancellation of the agreement and forfeiture of moneys paid thereunder; immediate possession of the land. Defendant did not defend and plaintiff obtained an order nisi which fixed the amount due at $8,804.64, of which $4,104.64 was in arrear; ordered that defendant pay into court by a certain date $4,104.64 and interest and costs to be taxed; that in default of payment the agreement be cancelled and determined and all moneys paid thereunder be forfeited and retained by plaintiff; provided that upon payment of $4,104.64 (the sum in arrear) and interest, defendant be relieved from immediate payment of what had not become payable by lapse of time; and ordered that plaintiff have immediate possession of the land. Subsequently to said order nisi and before expiry of the time for payment thereunder, the Board of Review, under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934 (Dom., c. 53), formulated a proposal reducing the amount owing to plaintiff and extending the time for payment, which proposal was rejected by plaintiff but confirmed by the Board. Thereafter plaintiff issued a writ of possession, which was executed by the sheriff who placed plaintiff in possession. Defendant moved to set aside the writ of possession. The Local Master dismissed the motion. His order was reversed by Bigelow J. ([1940] 1 W.W.R. 204) but was restored by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan ([1940] 1 W.W.R. 657)., Defendant appealed.\nHeld: Defendant's appeal should be dismissed. At the time when the Board formulated and confirmed its proposal, there was no \"debt\" owing by defendant to plaintiff within the meaning of the Act, and therefore defendant was not entitled to the benefits of the Act. When plaintiff elected to take out a judgment in the form in which he did in the order nisi, he ceased to have any personal right against defendant. Sec. 11 (1) of the Act did not aid defendant. After the order nisi the plaintiff's position was negative that of defendant, if he wished to retain the land, was positive. Plaintiff had the title to the land and an order for possession. Defendant had no title and no rights unless he actively did what the order nisi called for. APPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan [1] which (reversing an order of Bigelow J. in chambers [2]) held that, after the issue of a certain order nisi obtained by the plaintiff in a certain action upon an agreement for sale of land (in which agreement the plaintiff was the vendor and the defendant the purchaser), there was no \"debt \"owing by the defendant to the plaintiff within the meaning of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934 (Dom., c. 53), and therefore a certain proposal formulated and confirmed by the Board of Review under said Act subsequent to the said order nisi was a nullity, as the agreement in question was then outside the Board's jurisdiction. The order of the Court of Appeal restored an order of the Local Master dismissing defendant's motion for an order vacating and rescinding a writ of possession of the land issued by the plaintiff. The material facts of the case are more particularly set out in the reasons for judgment of this Court now reported, and are indicated in the above head-note. Special leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. By the judgment of this Court now reported the appeal was dismissed with costs.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. for the appellant.\nR. M. Balfour for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHudson J.\u2014The question in this appeal is whether or not the appellant is entitled to the benefits provided by the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, and amendments. On the 4th of, December, 1933, the respondent agreed in writing to sell farm lands in Saskatchewan to the appellant for the sum of $7,500, payable $300 cash, $500 a year for a number of years and a final payment in 1947, with interest in the meantime at the rate of 7%. The appellant covenanted to pay these sums and also taxes. The agreement contained an acceleration clause by which, in case of default, the total amount should become payable at once. Default was made in payment of various sums and on the 18th of October, 1938, the respondent commenced an action, alleging that there was due under the agreement as of 1st October, 1938, the sum of $8,804.64, and claiming specific performance of the agreement, payment of the said sum with interest and, in default of payment, cancellation of the agreement and forfeiture of all moneys paid thereunder and, lastly, immediate possession of the lands.\nThe appellant did not defend and on the 10th of November, 1938, the respondent recovered a judgment in the form of what is called an order nisi, whereby the amount due in respect of principal and interest under the agreement was fixed at $8,804.64, of which sum $4,104.64 was in arrears. It further ordered the defendant to pay into court to the credit of the cause on or before the 19th day of February, 1939, the said sum together with interest thereon, and costs to be taxed. It was further ordered that in default of payment into court as aforesaid the agreement should be cancelled and determined and that all moneys paid thereunder by defendant to the plaintiff be forfeited and retained by the plaintiff. There was a proviso, however, that on payment of $4,104.64, the sum in arrears, together with interest, the defendant should be released from immediate payment of so much of the purchase money as may not have become payable by lapse of time. It was further ordered that the plaintiff should have immediate possession of the lands. There was also a provision for rectification of the name of one of the parties, which is not material to the question here involved.\nIt is important at this point to determine the rights of the parties upon the signing of this judgment. It is clear that the defendant ceased to have right to the possession of the land. It is also clear that he had a right to the restoration of his position as purchaser under the agreement of sale upon payment of the sum of $4,104.64, with interest and costs, and the right to acquire title to the land on payment of the total sum due, providing one or other of these payments was made within the time prescribed by the order of the court, or such extension as might thereafter be given.\nThe plaintiff became entitled to immediate possession of the land and he had and retained title to the land, subject only to the right of the defendant to the restoration of his possession as purchaser under the agreement, on payment of the sum or sums above mentioned.\nThere remains the question of whether or not the vendor still retained any right to collect the moneys theretofore due under the agreement of sale from the defendant personally. It was held by the learned judges in the court below that he had no longer any such right because he had elected to take the judgment for cancellation. In arriving at this conclusion, it is stated by Mr. Justice Gordon, speaking for the court, that in his opinion this was the effect of the judgment of this court in the case of Davidson v. Sharpe [3], and a decision of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal delivered by the late Mr. Justice Lamont in a later case of Primeau and Imperial Lumber Yards Ltd. v. Meagher [4]. Mr. Justice Gordon further states that\nthe practice in this Province has been settled for many years and in my view the plaintiff elected to take an order for the determination of his agreement with the defendant when he took out the order nisi in its present form.\nIt was contended on behalf of the appellant that the decisions referred to could not be held to deprive the vendor of a right to collect until after the expiration of the time provided by the order or judgment for final payment. On consideration, it seems to me that the conclusion reached by the learned judges in the Court of Appeal is well founded, and that when the respondent elected to take out a judgment in the form in which he did, he ceased to have any personal right against the appellant.\nSubsequently to this order nisi and before the time for payment prescribed by the judgment had expired, the Board of Review under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act formulated a proposal for submission to the defendant and the plaintiff, who was said by the court below to have been the only creditor of the defendant. This proposal reduced the amount owing to the plaintiff under his agreement for sale to $3,000 as of January 1st, 1939, and extended the payments for ten years. The plaintiff having rejected this proposal, it was confirmed by the Board on February 21st, 1939. Thereafter, the plaintiff issued a writ of possession and this was executed by the sheriff, who placed the plaintiff in possession. Following this, there was a motion to set aside the writ before the Local Master, who dismissed same. The defendant appealed to the Judge in Chambers and this application was heard before Mr. Justice Bigelow who allowed the appeal and set aside the writ. From that decision, the plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal, where his appeal was allowed as above stated.\nThe defendant contends that section 7 of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act gives the Board of Review authority to formulate the rights of plaintiffs and argued that there was a debt owing by the defendant to the plaintiff. The preamble of the Act states in part as follows:\nWhereas * * * it is necessary to provide means whereby compromises or rearrangements may be effected of debts of farmers who are unable to pay.\nThe word \"debt\" is not defined by the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act or the Bankruptcy Act, but subsection 2 of section 2 of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act provides that expressions in the Act shall be given the same meaning as in the Bankruptcy Act, unless it is otherwise provided or the context otherwise requires, The word \"debt\" is defined in Stroud's Judicial Dictionary as \"a sum payable in respect of a liquidated money demand, recoverable by action,\" and I think that this definition can be accepted as applicable here.\nBy section 9 of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act it is provided that subsection 5 of section 16 of the Bankruptcy Act shall not apply in the case of a proposal for a composition, extension or scheme of arrangement made by any farmer. Now, section 16, subsections 1 and 5, provide:\nThe court shall, before approving the proposal, hear a report of the trustee as to the terms (thereof, and as to the conduct of the debtor, and any objections; which may be made by or on behalf of any creditor.\n* * *\n5. No composition, extension or scheme shall be approved by the court which does not provide for the payment in priority to other debts of all debts directed to be so paid in the distribution of the property of a bankrupt or authorized assignor.\nIt was argued that the fact that subsection 5 was expressly excluded had some bearing on the interpretation of the Act before us, but this I cannot see. In the argument before us, special reliance was placed on section 11 (1) of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act as follows:\nOn the filing with the Official Receiver of a proposal, no creditor whether secured or unsecured, shall have any remedy against the property or person of the debtor, or shall commence or continue any proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act, or any action, execution or other proceedings for the recovery of a debt provable in bankruptcy, or the realization of any security unless with leave of the court and on such terms as the court may impose; Provided, however, that the stay of proceedings herein provided shall only be effective until the date of the final disposition of the proposal.\nSpecial emphasis was placed on the words \"or any action, execution or other proceedings for the recovery of a debt provable in bankruptcy, or the realization of any security unless with leave of the court.\" Now it seems to me that this section does not aid the appellant in the present case.\nAfter the judgment of the court, the position of the respondent was negative, that of the appellant, if he wished to retain his land, was positive. The respondent had the title to the land and he also had an order for possession. The appellant had no title and no rights unless he actively did what the judgment called for.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: P. G. Hodges.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Balfour, Hoffman & Balfour.\n[1] [1940] 1 W.W.R. 657; [1940] 2 D.L.R. 499.\n[2] [1940] 1 W.W.H. 204; [1940] 1 D.L.R. 712.\n[3] (1920) 60 Can.

Some mineral claims were, in 1937, staked and recorded and subsequently transferred into the name of Mun Syndicate, one of the appellants. By reason of the failure of the latter to comply with the conditions prescribed by the regulations under The Mineral Resources Act of Saskatchewan., these claims had become forfeited in the summer of 1938 and were thus open for restaking. Later, in the month of September, 1938, the prosecutor Studer, associated with two others, all of whom held miners' licences, restaked the claims; and applications by them to have the claims recorded in their names, together with assignments thereof by his associates to him, were filed on October 12th, 1938, at the sub-recording office at Prince Albert and the necessary fee was paid. These applications reached the mining recorder at Regina on October 13th, 1938. The pertinent regulation provides that the date upon which the documents are \"received in the office of the mining recorder shall govern, and shall be considered the date of the application.\" Meanwhile, the Mun Syndicate had become active and had secured from the Minister on October 11th, 1938, an order under section 22 of the Act and section 66 of the regulations, reviving their claims to the property. The order of reinstatement expressly stated that it was subject to section 22, which provides that the revesting of rights which have been forfeited or lost shall be subject to the rights intervening between the default and the order of the Minister. This order was then recorded, so that, when Studer's application arrived at the Mining Recorder's Office, the situation was that the Mun Syndicate again stood in the record as the holders of the claim in good standing, subject only to the conditions specified. The Mining Recorder, now the appellant Swain, rejected the applications of the prosecutor Studer on the ground already stated that the prior holders had been reinstated on October 11th, 1938. The prosecutor Studer then applied for a prerogative writ of mandamus to compel the appellant Swain, Mining Recorder, to record and enter the name of Studer as holder of the mineral claims in question, his expressed object being to obtain a record of his claims so that he would have the necessary status to maintain an action, against the reinstated claimants, to establish his rights. The trial judge granted the order applied for, which judgment was affirmed by a majority of the Court of Appeal.\nHeld, Davis and Kerwin JJ. dissenting, that the appeal should be allowed, the judgments of the courts below be set aside, and the writ of mandamus discharged, but, under the circumstances of the case, without costs to any party.\nPer Rinfret, Crocket and Hudson JJ.\u2014The remedy sought on behalf of Studer was to compel the Recorder in his official quality to record his name as holder of the mineral claims, that is, to do a ministerial act, not to decide a dispute, much less to rule on the legality or propriety of an act of his Minister. The motion for mandamus was based on the assumption that Studer would not have an adequate remedy in an action commenced by writ, until he had been first duly recorded as a holder, which assumption has found acceptance in the courts below. But there is no reason in principle why a lack of entry of Studer's name should be a bar to an ordinary action to enforce any such rights as he is entitled to in the matter. Such rights were the very kind of rights which were intended to be preserved by section 22 of the Mineral Resources Act, and were preserved by the order of the Minister. Per Davis J. (dissenting).\u2014The only remedy sought by the respondent Studer in this case was to have recorded in his name in the books of the Mining Recorder the restaking by him, or by those under whom he claimed, of the mining lands in question in this case, and Studer was entitled to such a remedy. These claims had become forfeited due to the absence of any record of the necessary assessment work required to keep the claims alive, subject to the provisions of section 22 of the statute. But the restaking or relocation was done by Studer after the default and before the order had been made under that section by the Minister. At least fifteen days were made available by the regulations for recording that staking and the fifteen days had not elapsed before the date of the Minister's order. Therefore, notwithstanding the Minister's order relieving against the forfeiture, the restaking of the claims in the interval entitle the licensee Studer to have a record of the staking made in the Recorder's Office. The order of the Minister was not only on its face but by the force of section 22 of the statute subject to that intervening right, while the refusal to record the staking was definitely put by the Mining Recorder upon the ground that \"the former claims covering the same area had been reinstated.\"\nPer Kerwin J. (dissenting)\u2014The respondent Studer, having staked claims that were at the time open, could not, under the circumstances, litigate his rights as against the members of the Mun Syndicate without first acquiring a record. Studer could not do this unless it is held that the Mining Recorder had no discretion to decline to receive the application and record it. In view of the fact that the claims were open and the staking done by the respondent Studer before the order was made by the Minister, section 22 of the statute applies, and the interest or rights forfeited or lost are to be revested in the person so relieved, \"but subject, however, to any intervening right of any person arising subsequent to the default sought to be remedied and prior to the order of the Minister.\" The order of the Court of Appeal, granting respondent Studer's application for mandamus and thus affording him the opportunity to litigate the rights he claimed, should be upheld.\nOsborne v. Morgan (13 App. Cas. 227), Hartley v. Maston (32 Can. S.C.R. 644); Mutchmore v. Davis (14 Grant 346); Farmer v. Livingstone (8 Can. S.C.R. 140); McPhee v. Box ([1937] S.C.R. 385) ; Re Massey Mfg. Co.

The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nJ. E. Doerr K.C. for the appellants.\nJ. G. Diefenbaker K.C. for the respondent Studer.\nE. G. Gowling for the respondent The Mun Syndicate.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Crocket and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nHudson J.\u2014In this case a motion was made on behalf of the prosecutor Studer before Mr. Justice Embury, for a mandamus requiring the appellant Swain, a Supervisor of Mines and Mining Recorder for Saskatchewan, to record and enter in the name of Studer the eight mineral claims in question. Mr. Justice Embury granted the order applied for, with one qualification, which in the view I take of this matter need not be discussed.\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeal, by a majority of two to one, decided that the mandamus should issue without any such qualification. It is from that decision that the present appeal is brought.\nIt is desirable here to make clear exactly what aid was sought on behalf of Studer. It was to compel the Recorder in his official capacity to record the name of Studer as holder of these claims, that is, to do a ministerial act, not to decide a dispute, much less to rule on the legality or propriety of an act of his Minister. It was simply to enter Studer's name in the record as holder. This is the position taken on behalf of the prosecutor in the court below, as pointed out by Chief Justice Turgeon:\nNo relief is claimed against any person other than the Mining Recorder and the only claim of the respondent is that the Mining Recorder be compelled to discharge the legal obligation resting upon him; and that the respondent have executed in his favour, those public duties to which he has a legal right.\nIt again becomes necessary to point out that the nature of relief prayed for in the present instance is relief against the Mining Recorder, and against the Mining Recorder only. The other parties, are joined merely for the purpose of giving them notice of the proceedings.\nThe position taken before this Court is substantially the same.\nThe material facts relevant to this issue may be stated briefly. In 1937, the claims in question had been staked and recorded and subsequently transferred into the name of Mun Syndicate, parties to these proceedings. By reason of the failure of Mun Syndicate to comply with the conditions prescribed by the regulations, the claims had become forfeited in the summer of 1938. During the time when these claims were still in good standing, Studer had something to do with them and was quite familiar with the property. Later, in the month of September, he, Studer, satisfied himself that the forfeiture had taken place and that the claims were open for staking. He then proceeded, associated with two others, all of whom held Miners' Licences, to restake these claims, and the rights of the others were subsequently transferred to him. On October 3rd, 1938, the Mining Recorder advised him by letter as follows:\u2014\nConcerning the mineral claims named \"Contact\" and \"Golden Bean Nos. 1 to 16, inclusive,\" these have now all lapsed and are, therefore, available to the first eligible applicant, so that if you want them and providing they have not already been staked you should go ahead to secure such of this property as you deem necessary to round out your holdings.\nOn October 12th, 1938, Studer presented at the office of the District Superintendent of Mines at Prince Albert an application to have the claims recorded in his name and paid the necessary fee. This was accepted by the District Superintendent but Mining Regulation 45 provides:\nThe record of a mineral claim shall be made at the office of the Mining Recorder, but the application may be made to a district superintendent or a sub-recorder, to be forwarded to the mining recorder. The date upon which the application and the fee may be received in the office of the mining recorder, however, shall govern, and shall be considered the date of the application.\nThe duty of the District Superintendent was to forward Studer's application to the office of the Recorder at Regina, and this was done.\nMeanwhile, the Mun Syndicate had become active and had secured from the Minister on October 11th, an order reviving their claims to the property in the following language:\nPursuant to the power vested in me by authority of Section 66 of the Quartz Mining Regulations, under The Mineral Resources Act, I do hereby order that the Mineral Claims known as \"Contact Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4\" be reinstated and the rights forfeited be revested in the former owner subject to Section 22 of The Mineral Resources Act. A similar order was made in respect of the other claims now in question in this matter. Section 22 of the Act provided that any such reinstatement was to be subject to\nany intervening right of any person arising subsequent to the default sought to be remedied and prior to the order of the Minister.\nThis order of the Minister was then recorded; so the position when Studer's application arrived at the Mining Recorder's office was that the Mun Syndicate again stood in the record as the holders of the claims in good standing, subject only to the conditions specified. Studer was advised of this position and, after some correspondence, the present proceedings were commenced.\nNeither the statute nor the regulations, as I read them, make any provision for placing in the register at the same time the names of two persons with competitive claims, and I agree with the views of Chief Justice Turgeon, that a reading of all of the rules make it quite clear that such was never the intention.\nThe motion for mandamus is based on the assumption that Studer would not have an adequate remedy in an action commenced by writ, until he had been first duly recorded as a holder. This assumption has found acceptance in the court below. It is based on a number of decisions following that of the Judicial Committee in Osborne v. Morgan[3]. The head-note in the report of that decision is as follows:\u2014\nIn an action by the holders of \"miners' rights\" issued to them under the Gold Fields Act 1874 and regulations made thereunder, to set aside the defendants' mining leases also thereunder granted on the grounds (1) that they had been granted contrary to sect. 11 within two years from the proclamation of the goldfield within which the leased areas were contained; (2) that the formalities prescribed by the regulations had not been observed by the defendants when applying therefor:\u2014\nHeld, that neither under the Act nor otherwise had the plaintiffs any right to interfere with the lessees' possession. Sect. 9 gave them no rights whatever as against lands let by the Crown, and no title to try the validity of Crown leases relating thereto; and the whole tenor of the regulations is opposed to such contention.\nThe miners' rights, which were all that the plaintiffs held, corresponded with the mining licence held by Studer in the present case. It gave a right to the holder to stake, occupy and work mining properties owned by the Crown, subject to regulations. It did not refer to any specific land. The defendants had a lease from the Crown and were in possession and working the property. The plaintiffs alleged that this lease was invalid and improperly held and that, therefore, the property should be open to them to stake and brought their action on this basis. The Judicial Committee said that under these circumstances the plaintiffs had no status to attack the defendants' title.\nThe circumstances in that case were of course very different from the position here. According to Studer's claim, the Mun Syndicate were neither in actual nor in constructive possession at the time. Their right to be there had been forfeited, and while this continued he, Studer, was rightfully entitled to enter on the land and stake it according to the regulations, and he so did and duly presented an application within the time prescribed by such regulations. The only reason why his application was not accepted was that the Mun Syndicate had meanwhile been restored to the record as holder, subject to intervening rights.\nThe case of Hartley v. Maston[4] was decided on the authority of Osborne v. Morgan[5]. The facts were very similar. The defendants there had a hydraulic lease of mineral lands in existence and they were in occupation of the land. The plaintiffs entered upon the lands and staked claims and, in their action, alleged that the hydraulic mining lease was invalid. Mr. Justice Davies, who gave the principal judgment in the case, said at page 647:\nI agree substantially with the judgment of the Gold Commissioner, Mr. Senkler. I do not think that the mere fact of the appellants, as free miners, entering upon lands already leased by the Crown and professing to locate claims there gave them any right or interest in the lands, or any status to come into court and ask for any declaration with respect to the validity of a prior lease from the Crown of those very lands.\nTo attain such a status mere \"staking\" is not sufficient. They must go further and obtain from the mining recorder their placer grants.\nIn the judgment of Mr. Senkler, approved of by Mr. Justice Davies, Mr. Senkler says:\u2014\nIt appears in this case that the appellants entered upon the lands occupied by the respondents under a lease from the Minister of the Interior. They had no right to do this, and their right to bring this protest is based upon the fact that they are free miners only and the fact of their being free miners does not carry with it any legal or equitable interest in the ground in dispute. He followed the decision in Osborne v. Morgan[6], and further referred to the cases of Mutchmore v. Davis[7], and Farmer v. Livingstone[8]. The present case is distinguishable from that of Hartley v. Maston[9] for the same reason as from that of Osborne v. Morgan6. The determining facts in both of those cases were possession by, and priority of title in, the defendants.\nIn McPhee v. Box[10], the facts were somewhat similar, although not identical with those in the present case, and there this Court refused to grant a mandamus. The question under immediate discussion here was left open.\nI can see no reason in principle why a lack of entry of Studer's name should be a bar to an ordinary action to enforce any such rights as he is entitled to in the matter. Such rights were the very kind of rights which were intended to be preserved by section 22 of the Mineral Resources Act, and were preserved by the order of the Minister.\nI concur in the views expressed in the court below that the proper authorities should consider the advisability of clarifying the regulations.\nI would allow the appeal and set aside the judgments below and discharge the writ of mandamus but, under the circumstances, without costs to any party.\nDavis J. (dissenting)\u2014The relator Adolph Studer became entitled to have recorded in his name on the books of the Mining Recorder the staking of the mining lands in question. The contention of the appellants that mandamus cannot lie against the Mining Recorder because he is a servant of the Crown is untenable. The Mining Recorder is in a sense a servant of the Crown but his duties are purely ministerial; they involve nothing in the nature of an executive act. He is, in the relevant sense, an agent of the statute to do the things that he is by the statute directed to do, and mandamus may properly be directed to him. See Re Massey Mfg. Co.[11]; Minister of Finance of B.C. v. Andler et al.[12]. The mining claims in question had theretofore become forfeited due to the absence of any record of the necessary assessment work required to keep the claims alive. It may not be a strict forfeiture but rather a qualified forfeiture because the statute provides that the holder of a mining claim which has thus become forfeited may within a certain delay obtain relief from the forfeiture and the reinstatement of his claims upon proof that the necessary assessment work has been done. Sec. 22 of The Mineral Resources Act, 1931 (ch. 16 of the 1931 Saskatchewan Statutes) is the governing provision and that section is as follows:\n22. Where forfeiture or loss of rights has occurred, the minister may, within three months after the default or within such further time as the Lieutenant-Governor in Council upon the recommendation of the minister may direct, upon such terms as he deems just, make an order relieving the person in default from such forfeiture or loss of rights, and upon compliance with the terms, if any, so imposed, the interests or rights forfeited or lost shall be revested in the person so relieved, but subject however, to any intervening right of any person arising subsequent to the default sought to be remedied and prior to the order of the Minister.\nNow the regulations provide (No. 39) that\nWithin fifteen days after a mineral claim has been staked out by a licensee, either on his own behalf or on behalf of another licensee, application for a record of such claim shall be made to the mining recorder, * * *\nsubject to certain extensions of time having regard to distance; and then by Regulation 54(1) any licensee\nhaving duly located and recorded a mineral claim, shall be entitled to hold it for a period of one year, and whence from year to year without the necessity for re-recording * * *\nsubject to the performance of certain work on the claim. If the amount of the required assessment work is not done and duly recorded within the period of one year, plus a month of grace thereafter, then by Regulation No. 55\nthe claim shall lapse, and shall forthwith be open to relocation under these regulations, without any declaration of cancellation or forfeiture on the part of the Crown, subject, however, to the provisions of section 66 of these regulations.\nBy Regulation No. 66 the Minister may, within three months after such default has occurred, upon such terms as he may deem just, make an order relieving the person in default from such forfeiture or loss of rights. It may be noted here that the power of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council from time to time to make regulations and orders is limited (by sec. 10 of the statute) to\nsuch regulations and orders not inconsistent with this Act as are necessary to carry out its provisions according to their obvious intent or (to meet cases which may arise and for which no provision is made therein * * *\nWe must therefore go back to sec. 22 of the statute itself, which stipulates that if forfeiture or loss of rights is relieved against by the Minister, the interests or rights forfeited or lost shall be \"revested\" in the person so relieved,\nbut subject, however, to any intervening right of any person arising subsequent to the default sought to be remedied and prior to the order of the minister.\nIn this case the restaking or relocation was done after the default and before the order had been made by the Minister. At least fifteen days were made available by the regulations for recording that staking and the fifteen days had not elapsed before the date of the Minister's order. Therefore, notwithstanding the Minister's order relieving against the forfeiture, the restaking of the claims in the interval entitled the licensee to have a record of the staking made in the Recorder's Office. The order of the Minister was not only on its face but by the force of sec. 22 of the statute subject to that intervening right. The refusal to record the staking was definitely put by the Mining Recorder upon the ground that \"the former claims covering the same area had been reinstated.\" The orders of the Minister covering the reinstatement of the several claims, signed by the Deputy Minister, read as follows:\nPursuant to the power vested in me by authority of Section 66 of the Quartz Mining Regulations, under The Mineral Resources Act, I do hereby order that the Mineral Claims known as * * * be reinstated and the rights forfeited be revested in the former owner, subject to Section 22 of The Mineral Resources Act,\nAll that the respondent has sought in these proceedings is to have the restaking by him, or by those under whom he claims, recorded. He is faced with the difficulty that a mere staker of mineral claims may not have a status to assert his claims to the properties until he gets himself on the Record. That difficulty is envisaged as the result of some words by Davies J. in Hartley v. Matson[13]: To attain such a status (i.e., to question the validity of a prior lease from the Crown) mere staking is not sufficient. They must go further and obtain from the Mining Recorder their placer grants. If for any reason he refuses to issue such grants then their remedy is by way of mandamus to compel him to do his duty. Until they have obtained such grants they are not in a position to attack the defendants' lease.\nI see nothing in the objection raised that the respondent had in respect of some of the claims only a transfer of the rights of the licensee or licensees who actually staked some of the properties. They were all licensees entitled to stake but had assigned their rights to the respondent in respect of their particular stakings.\nThe further objection is taken that the remedy by mandamus is not available because of an alternative remedy. Regulation 132 provides that\nany decision of the Mining Engineer, or other officer of the Department, made under any of the provisions of these regulations, shall be subject to an appeal to the Minister.\nThat regulation however is dealing only with matters of routine departmental decision and was never contemplated to apply to a case such as this.\nThe order of the Court directing that the record must be made by the Recorder must necessarily be interpreted as made nunc pro tunc because the respondent was in time when he made the application which was improperly refused.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.\nKerwin J. (dissenting)\u2014This is an appeal by Mr. E. Swain, Supervisor of Mines for the province of Saskatchewan, the Minister of Natural Resources for the province, and five individuals carrying on a mining syndicate under the name of Mun Syndicate, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for the province of Saskatchewan. The respondent is His Majesty the King on the relation of Adolph Studer. The proceedings were commenced by Studer applying in the Court of King's Bench of Saskatchewan for a writ of mandamus requiring the Supervisor of Mines, who is also the Mining Recorder, to record and enter in Studer's name eight certain mining claims. Mr. Justice Emery, before whom the application came in the first instance, made the order asked, as to certain claims but not as to others. An appeal and cross-appeal being taken from his order, the Court of Appeal directed the issue of a writ of mandamus with reference to the eight claims. The Chief Justice of Saskatchewan, dissenting, would have allowed the appeal and dismissed the application.\nStuder desires the issue of the writ in order that he may be recorded as the holder of the claims and thus acquire a status to question the validity of what was done under the following circumstances. The individuals comprising the Mun Syndicate appeared on the record as the owners of the claims (although under different names) but, because of failure to comply with number 54 of the Saskatchewan Regulations for the Disposal of Quartz Mining Claims, the claims lapsed under regulation 55, and in accordance with the provisions of such last-mentioned regulation were \"open to relocation\" subject to the provisions of regulation 66. Under the latter, the Minister of Natural Resources has power to make an order relieving the person in default.\nThe respondent, Studer, having ascertained that a lapse had occurred, located the claims and applied, in due form, for registration. His application was filed in the Prince Albert office but under the regulations the effectual filing date was that on which it was received in Mr. Swain's office in Regina, viz., October 13th, 1938. In the meantime, on October 11th, the Minister, purporting to exercise the powers conferred upon him by regulation 66, had made an order relieving the members of the Syndicate from the lapse. The respondent conceives that he has a claim to be recorded and to have the registration of the Syndicate expunged but he has concluded that, in view of the decisions, he has no status to advance such a claim until he appears upon the record.\nIn MacPhee v. Box[14], the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan determined that the plaintiff in that case could not succeed in view of certain decisions. An appeal to this court[15] was dismissed but as appears from the reasons for judgment, upon a rather limited ground. This Court did not endorse the view taken by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal but no decision upon the point was given. In the present case, I think the point must be decided and my view is that, having staked claims that were at the time open, the respondent could not, under the circumstances, litigate his rights as against the members of the Syndicate without first acquiring a record. It is obvious that he cannot do this unless we conclude that the Mining Recorder had no discretion to decline to receive the application and record it. In view of the fact that the claims were open and the staking done by the respondent before the order was made by the Minister, section 22 of The Mineral Resources Act, chapter 16 of the statutes of 1931, applies, and the interest or rights forfeited or lost are to be revested in the person so relieved\nbut subject, however, to any intervening right of any person arising subsequent to the default sought to be remedied and prior to the order of the Minister.\nIn fact the order is distinctly made subject to section 22.\nIt is merely to give the respondent an opportunity to litigate the rights he claims that the present application is made and I think the order of the Court of Appeal affording him that opportunity was right. If, of course, the applicant has another remedy at law, the prerogative writ may not issue. It is contended that he had such a right under regulation 132 whereby\nany decision of the mining engineer or other officer of the department, made under any of the provisions of these regulations, shall be subject to an appeal to the minister.\nThis regulation, however, in my opinion has no bearing upon an appplication to the Mining Recorder to record a person as the holder of a mining claim.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs and the writ issued nunc pro tunc as Studer's application was made within the time limited by regulation 39.\nAppeal allowed, without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants Swain and The Minister of Natural Resources: J.

Code, ss. 951(3), 285(6), 1023(2)\u2014Accused charged with manslaughter\u2014Charge arising out of operation of motor vehicle\u2014At trial accused found not guilty of manslaughter but guilty of driving in a manner dangerous to the public\u2014Appeal by Attorney-General of the province dismissed by appellate court (with a dissent on questions of law)\u2014Appeal by Attorney-General to Supreme Court of Canada\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Whether there was a \"judgment or verdict, of acquittal\" within s. 1028(2)\u2014Merits\u2014Evidence and findings at trial. Accused was charged with manslaughter. The charge arose out of the operation of a motor vehicle. The trial judge (sitting without a jury, as permitted by statute applicable to the province) found accused not guilty of manslaughter but, as provided for by s. 951(3) of the Cr. Code (as amended in 1938, c. 44, s.. 45), found him guilty of driving in a manner dangerous to the public, under s. 285(6) of the Cr. Code (as amended ibid, s. 16). The Attorney-General for Alberta appealed, asking that the \"judgment or verdict of acquittal\" at trial on the charge of manslaughter \"be set aside and a conviction made in lieu thereof\" or that, in the alternative, there be a new trial of accused upon said charge. The appeal was dismissed by the Appellate Division, Alta., (Harvey, C.J., dissenting on questions of law), [1940] 2 W.W.R. 401. The Attorney-General appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Rinfret, Crocket, Kerwin and Taschereau JJ.: The appeal should be quashed for want of jurisdiction.\nRinfret J.: Neither of the conditions of a right of appeal to this Court under s. 1023(2) of the Cr. Code (as amended in 1935, c. 56, s. 16) exists; the Appellate Division did not \"set aside a conviction\" nor \"dismiss an appeal against a judgment or verdict of acquittal.\" The judgment at trial was not an acquittal; it was a conviction upon the charge as laid, in accordance with s. 951(3) which indicates that a conviction under s. 285(6) may be the result of a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle. Further, (the right of appeal of an Attorney General of a province under s. 1023(2), as it was only recently given and as criminal statutes should always be construed favourably to the accused, should not be extended beyond the strict terms of the Code.\nPer Crocket J.: The judgment of the Appellate Division did not fall within the terms of s. 1023(2). The clear intendment of s. 951(3) is that a charge of manslaughter which arises out of the operation of a motor vehicle must be taken to include the offence described in s. 285(6) and that the trial tribunal shall have the right, instead of convicting of manslaughter, to find accused guilty, on the manslaughter charge, of the lesser offence. This having been done, it cannot be said that there was \"a judgment or verdict of acquittal\" in respect of the charge on which accused was tried.\nPer Kerwin J.: Though accused was acquitted of the charge of manslaughter, yet it cannot be said that the judgment at trial was \"a judgment or verdict of acquittal in respect of an indictable offence\" within the meaning of s. 1023(2) so as to give this Court jurisdiction, particularly in view of the results which otherwise might follow (as set out infra, per Taschereau J.).\nPer Taschereau J.: A charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle includes, by operation of s. 951(3), a charge under s. 285(6), though the offence under 285(6) is not mentioned in the count. When there is an acquittal on said major offence followed with a conviction on said minor offence, it cannot be said that accused has been acquitted on the charge as laid; the degree of his guilt is smaller, but he has nevertheless been found guilty. For the purpose of the right of appeal given by s. 1023(2), the word \"acquittal\" therein means a complete acquittal in respect of all the offences charged directly or otherwise in the same count. To hold otherwise would have the very extraordinary result that this Court, entertaining the appeal, would undoubtedly have the power to direct a new trial, as a result of which the accused, without having appealed, might be acquitted even of the charge on which he has already been found guilty at the first trial.\nThe Chief Justice, but for the above weighty concurrence of opinion by four Judges of this Court against this Court's jurisdiction, would have thought that the Appellate Division, Alta., was right in considering the appeal on the merits. He expressed emphatically his opinion that, on a charge such as that in the present case, a jury, having satisfied themselves that the accused, in the language of s. 951(3), \"is not guilty of manslaughter\" (which is a condition of their jurisdiction to find the accused guilty of an offence under s. 285(6)), must pronounce a verdict to that effect and that the accused is entitled to demand such pronouncement; and that such a pronouncement is an acquittal of the accused upon the charge of manslaughter under the indictment. Whether an appeal lies or not may, of course, be another question.\nPer Davis J.: The appeal should be dismissed on the merits. On the evidence and the finding's at trial, it cannot be said that accused killed the man with whose death he was charged by the indictment.\nPer Hudson J.: The appeal should be dismissed on the ground that the trial judge, on proper interpretation of his statements, found that there was not sufficient evidence to satisfy him beyond reasonable doubt that accused caused the death of the deceased and, as a consequence, found accused not guilty of manslaughter.\nAPPEAL by the Attorney-General for Alberta from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] dismissing (Harvey, C.J., dissenting on questions of law) his appeal from the judgment of Howson J. (sitting without a jury, as permitted by statute applicable to the province) upon the trial of the accused, respondent, on the charge that he \"did unlawfully cause the death of one, Charles W. Stout, and did thereby commit manslaughter.\" It appeared from the evidence and the record that the charge arose out of the operation of a motor vehicle. The trial judge found the accused not guilty of manslaughter but, as provided for by s. 951(3) of the Criminal Code (as amended in 1938, c. 44, s. 45), found him guilty of driving in a manner dangerous to the public under s. 285(6) of the Criminal Code (as amended in 1938, c. 44, s. 16).\nIn his appeal to the Appellate Division, the Attorney-General asked that the \"judgment or verdict of acquittal\" at trial on the charge of manslaughter \"be set aside and a conviction made in lieu thereof\"; or that, in the alternative, there be a new trial of accused upon the said charge. In his appeal to this Court the Attorney-General asked for an order setting aside the judgment of the Appellate Division \"and directing that a verdict or judgment of guilty of manslaughter be entered against\" accused\"in lieu of said verdict of acquittal and the appropriate punishment imposed or in the alternative an order directing a new trial or such other order as may be proper.\"\nOn the hearing before this Court the question was raised whether there had been a \"judgment or verdict of acquittal\" within the meaning of s. 1023(2) of the Criminal Code (as amended in 1935, c. 56, s. 16) so as to give jurisdiction to hear the present appeal; and argument was heard on this point as well as argument on the merits of the appeal.\nH. J. Wilson K.C. and W. S. Gray K.C. for the appellant.\nE. F. Newcombe K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014The majority of the Court have come to the conclusion that no appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada in this case under section 1023(2). But for the weighty concurrence of opinion on this point by four judges of this Court, I should have thought that the Court of Appeal for Alberta was right in considering the appeal on the merits. I do not further pursue the discussion of the question whether an appeal to this Court arises under section 1023(2).\nI am concerned to emphasize one point. Before proceeding to that point it may be as well to note in passing that Mr. Wilson, on behalf of the Attorney-General for Alberta, contended that the proceedings in the trial did not disclose a charge of \"manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle\" and, consequently, that the case did not fall within section 951.\nI say nothing about this point. The point I desire to insist upon is this: The enactment under consideration, section 951, subsection 3, provides in the most explicit way that it is a condition of the jurisdiction of the jury to find the accused guilty of an offence under subsection 6 of section 285 that they shall be \"satisfied that the accused is not guilty of manslaughter.\" In the present case the accused was charged with manslaughter simpliciter. I can have no doubt that the jury, having satisfied themselves that the accused, in the language of the section, \"is not guilty of manslaughter,\" must pronounce a verdict to that effect and that the accused is entitled to demand such pronouncement. Nor have I any doubt that such a pronouncement is an acquittal of the accused upon the charge of manslaughter under the indictment. Whether an appeal lies or not may, of course, be another question.\nRINFRET J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be quashed for want of jurisdiction in this Court.\nThe appeal is asserted by the Attorney-General of the province of Alberta against the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of that province, which affirmed the judgment of Howson, J., finding the respondent guilty \"of driving to the public danger,\" under sec. 285, subs. 6, of the Criminal Code.\nThe charge laid against the respondent was that he \"did unlawfully cause the death of one, Charles W. Stout, and did thereby commit manslaughter\"; and it appears from the evidence and the record that such charge of manslaughter arose out of the operation of a motor vehicle.\nUpon that charge, the trial judge, being satisfied that the accused was not guilty of manslaughter, but was guilty of an offence under subs. 6 of sec. 285 above mentioned, found him (as he could do under subs. 3 of s. 951 of the Criminal Code) guilty of the lesser offence.\nThe case was then carried to the Appellate Division of Alberta by the Attorney-General, apparently taking advantage of subs. 4 of sec. 1013 of the Code, by force of which\nthe Attorney-General shall have the right to appeal to the court of appeal against any judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial court in respect of an indictable offence on any ground of appeal which involves a question of law alone.\nThe Court of Appeal merely confirmed the judgment condemning the respondent. It is not necessary to consider whether the right of appeal in this particular case was competently asserted before that Court.\nThe Attorney-General then appealed from the two concurrent judgments to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nNow, the right of the Attorney-General of the province to appeal to this Court, in a case such as this, is regulated by subs. 2 of sec. 1023 of the Code. Under that subsection, the Attorney-General may appeal to this Court only\nfrom the judgment of any court of appeal setting aside a conviction or dismissing an appeal against a judgment or verdict of acquittal in respect of an indictable offence on an appeal taken under section ten hundred and thirteen on any question of law on which there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal.\nIt is, therefore, apparent that the right of appeal by the Attorney-General under the above subsection is strictly dependent upon the existence of one of two conditions: Either a judgment of the Court of Appeal setting aside a conviction; or a judgment of a Court of Appeal dismissing an appeal against a judgment or verdict of acquittal.\nNeither of these conditions exists here.\nThe conviction against the respondent has not been set aside but, on the contrary, it was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nNor was there a dismissal of an appeal against a judgment or verdict of acquittal.\nThe respondent was not acquitted either by the trial judge or by the Court of Appeal.\nWhen the informer laid his charge against the respondent, and upon the charge as laid, he was praying, no doubt, for a conviction of manslaughter; but he was also praying, in the alternative, by force of subs. 3 of sec. 951, for a conviction of an offence under subs. 6 of sec. 285. And, as a matter of fact, he got the alternative condemnation, or, in other words, he got one of the two things that he had been asking for. Upon the charge as laid, and upon that alone, the respondent was not acquitted, but he was found guilty of having driven his motor vehicle on a highway in a manner which was dangerous to the public, in accordance with the provisions of subsection 6 of sec. 285. There has been no judgment of acquittal, either by the trial judge or by the Court of Appeal, from which it was open to the Attorney-General to bring an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada,\nSubs. 3 of sec. 951 of the Criminal Code was introduced in 1930 by ch. 11, sec. 25, of the Statutes of Canada of that year, though in a different form.\nThe amendment thus introduced stated in terms that\nUpon a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle the jury may find the accused not guilty of manslaughter but guilty of criminal negligence under section two hundred and eighty-four, and such conviction shall be a bar to further prosecution for any offence arising out of the same facts.\nLater, in the amendment so made, sec 285(6) was substituted for sec. 284.\nAs a result, the situation in the present case, it seems to me, was as follows:\nThe accident happened. It was a single occurrence. There was only one set of facts. The informer laid his charge and therein described the occurrence as a manslaughter, without more. But I cannot close my eyes to the fact that, upon the evidence and the record, it was, if at all, a \"manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle.\" This, to my mind, brought the charge within the terms of subs. 3 of s. 951 of the Criminal Code.\nAfter having heard the witnesses, the trial judge was \"satisfied that the accused was not guilty of manslaughter but was guilty of an offence under subsection six of section two hundred and eighty-five.\" By force of section 951(3) of the Code, the trial judge could then find the accused guilty of the lesser offence. And that is what he did. Parliament itself indicates in that subsection that a conviction under subs. 6 of s. 285 may be the result of a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle. The trial judge could find the accused guilty of the lesser offence upon the charge as laid, as a consequence of that single occurrence and upon the evidence of the single set of facts leading to it. By the will of Parliament as expressed in sec. 951(3), the conviction for the lesser offence was one of the two convictions which the trial judge had the power to make. The judgment of the trial judge, therefore, cannot be styled an acquittal within the meaning of s. 1023(2) of the Criminal Code. It was, and it is, a conviction upon the charge as laid, in accordance with the provisions of sec. 951(3). By the very terms of that subsection, \"such conviction shall be a bar to further prosecution for any offence arising out of the same facts.\" As a consequence of that provision of the Code, should the accused be later confronted with a charge of manslaughter based upon the same occurrence, he could plead autrefois convict; and that plea would have to be maintained upon the plain terms of that section of the Code.\nThe respondent has, therefore, been convicted upon the charge as laid; and I cannot look upon the judgment now submitted to our Court as being an acquittal in the sense that it may give the Attorney-General a right of appeal to this Court under the provisions of subs. 2 of s. 1023.\nIn connection with the above, one must recall that it is only recently that the Attorney-General of a province was given the right of appeal under sec 1023; and, both on that account and because criminal statutes should always be construed favourably to the accused, I do not think the right of appeal of the Attorney-General should be extended beyond the strict terms of the Code.\nIt follows that the present appeal was not competently asserted and that this Court is lacking of the jurisdiction required to entertain the appeal.\nUnder these circumstances, the appeal must be quashed.\nCROCKET J.\u2014The accused was tried on an indictment for the single offence of manslaughter before Mr. Justice Howson. Such an indictment may be tried in Alberta without a jury, if the accused so elects, under certain unrepealed provisions of the old North West Territories Act still in force in that province.\nS. 951, subs. 3, of the Criminal Code provides that:\nUpon a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle the jury, if they are satisfied that the accused is not guilty of manslaughter but is guilty of an offence under subsection 6 of section. 285, may find him guilty of that offence, and such conviction shall be a bar to further prosecution for any offence arising out of the same facts.\nIt is not questioned that this enactment applies to a trial before a Supreme Court Judge in Alberta sitting without a jury, or that the manslaughter charge in the present case arose out of the operation of a motor vehicle. The trial judge specifically found the accused guilty of driving an automobile in a manner dangerous to the public contrary to the provisions of s. 285(6), and not guilty of manslaughter.\nThe Attorney-General appealed to the Court of Appeal, which merely confirmed the conviction, the Chief\" Justice dissenting, and this is the judgment which it is now sought to challenge in this Court under the provisions of s. 1023(2) of the Criminal Code on the point or points of law raised in the dissenting opinion of the learned Chief Justice.\nIt was contended by counsel for the accused that the judgment of the Court of Appeal does not fall within the terms of subs. 2 of s. 1023 of the Code and that no appeal therefore lies to this Court.\nI think this objection is well taken. This Court is authorized by the subsection to hear an appeal at the instance of the Attorney-General of a Province from the judgment of a provincial Court of Appeal only if the judgment is one which sets aside a conviction or dismisses \"an appeal against a judgment or verdict of acquittal in: respect of an indictable offence.\" That such conviction, or judgment or verdict of acquittal, as the case may be, must necessarily be upon the charge or indictment upon which the accused has been tried by the trial court, is obvious, for assuredly no accused person could either be convicted or acquitted \"in respect of\" any indictable offence which was not included in the charge or indictment to which he was required to plead. The clear intendment of s. 951(3), to my mind, is that a charge of manslaughter which arises out of the operation of a motor vehicle must be taken to include the offence of driving a motor vehicle on a street, road, highway or other public place recklessly or in a manner which is dangerous to the public, as described in s. 285(6) of the Criminal Code, and that the trial tribunal shall have the right, instead of convicting the accused of the principal offence of manslaughter, to find him guilty upon that charge of the lesser offence against s. 285(6). This is what the trial judge did in the present case, he being satisfied that the accused was not guilty of manslaughter, but was guilty under the manslaughter indictment of the latter offence. The learned judge certainly could not have convicted the accused, under the indictment he was trying, of both manslaughter and an offence against s. 285(6). He could only find him guilty of one or the other, and having found him guilty of the lesser offence, it cannot, in my judgment, rightly be said that there was \"a judgment or verdict of acquittal\" in respect of the charge upon which the accused was tried; otherwise his conviction for the subordinate offence would not be a bar to his further prosecution for manslaughter or any other offence arising out of the same facts, as the last clause of s. 951(3) explicitly provides it shall be.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Appeal does not fall within the ambit of s. 1023(2) and that this appeal therefrom should be quashed for want of jurisdiction.\nDAVIS J.\u2014The question of the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the appeal of the Attorney-General of Alberta, turning on the point of some nicety as to whether or not there was an \"acquittal\" within the meaning of sec. 1023(2) of the Criminal Code in that while the accused was found not guilty of the charge of manslaughter laid in the indictment he was found guilty under sec. 285(6) of the lesser offence of driving his motor car to the public danger, was raised by a member of the Court during the argument of the merits of the appeal. I am not prepared, without a full and considered argument of a point of such importance and widespread effect, to dispose of the difficult question involved. Suffice it to say that at present I have much doubt as to the objection to jurisdiction but, in my view of the appeal, it becomes unnecessary to determine the point.\nI would dismiss the appeal on the merits. Too much emphasis has been put in this case, I think, upon the difficulties of definition of the crime of manslaughter in running-down cases. Andrews v. Director of Public Prosecutions[2]. The first and fundamental question, not touched by such difficulties, is whether or not the accused killed the unfortunate man with whose death he is charged by the indictment. That is a question of fact. Upon the evidence it is plain that the accused was driving his motor car in an easterly direction up a hill on a public highway in the suburb of Alberta Park, near the city of Calgary. It was about eight o'clock on a clear evening, May 30th, 1939. The trial judge found as a fact that the accused was travelling at a moderate rate of speed. On going up the hill the accused had run over the centre line but the trial judge found that the car was only \"a little north\" of the centre line\u2014\"a small amount\u2014\" somewhat but not greatly\" on the north side of the centre line. The deceased, a man within a few days of his 67th birthday, was at the same time riding a bicycle along the highway in the opposite direction. He was carrying empty beer bottles, which it had been his custom to collect and sell for a living, in a pasteboard box placed in a metal basket which was fastened to his bicycle in front of the handlebars. The accused said that when he saw the man on the bicycle come over the hill the bicycle was swerving along the road and that he, the accused, applied his brakes. Hodges, an eye witness called by the Crown, testified that the motor car \"was either actually stopped or practically stopped at the moment of the impact.\" The trial judge found that the man on the bicycle swerved or wavered on his bicycle into the left-hand front corner of the motor car. The left front headlight of the motor car was broken and the windshield of the car was caved in. The unfortunate man died shortly thereafter from hemorrhage of the brain due to a fractured skull, and the driver of the motor car was charged with manslaughter.\nThe accused was tried by a judge of the Supreme Court of Alberta, without a jury, as permitted by the North West Territories Act of 1886 made applicable by the Alberta Criminal Procedure Act, 1930, Dom., ch. 12. The trial judge found the accused was not guilty of manslaughter and the Court of Appeal of Alberta affirmed that judgment, Harvey, C.J., dissenting.\nThere was evidence that the accused was under the influence of liquor at the time and on that evidence the learned trial judge found him guilty under sec. 285(6) of the lesser offence of driving his car to \"the public danger. No appeal was taken from that conviction. In my opinion, it cannot be said on the evidence and the findings that the accused killed the man on the bicycle, and on that ground I should dismiss the appeal.\nKERWIN J.\u2014I thought, and still think, that the accused was acquitted of the charge of manslaughter. I was at first inclined to the view that we had jurisdiction. Further consideration, however, and particularly the results (set out in the judgment of my brother Taschereau) that would follow from a decision that this Court had jurisdiction have now convinced me that this was not \"a judgment or verdict of acquittal in respect of an indictable offence\" within the meaning of subsection 2 of section 1023 of the Criminal Code. I would therefore dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nHUDSON J.\u2014As I interpret the remarks of the learned trial judge, he found that there was not sufficient evidence to satisfy him beyond reasonable doubt that the accused caused the death of the deceased and, as a consequence, found the accused not guilty of manslaughter.\nOn this ground, I would dismiss the appeal.\nI am inclined to agree that this Court has no jurisdiction, but as the question was raised only by a member of the Court during the argument, I would prefer to leave it open for further discussion.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014On the 27th of November, 1939, the respondent, Harry Wilmot, was charged before Mr. Justice Howson of the Supreme Court of Alberta of having unlawfully caused by the operation of a motor vehicle the death of Charles W. Stout, thereby committing the crime of manslaughter. In a very elaborate judgment, the trial judge found the accused not guilty of manslaughter, but found him guilty of driving in a manner dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.\nThe section of the Criminal Code which authorizes the jury to find the accused guilty of the lesser offence reads as follows:\u2014\n951.(3) Upon a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle the jury, if they are satisfied that the accused is not guilty of manslaughter but is guilty of an offence under subsection six of section two hundred and eighty-five may find him guilty of that offence, and such conviction shall be a bar to further prosecution for any offence arising out of the same facts. Section 285(6) says:\u2014\nEvery one who drives a motor vehicle on a street, road, highway or other public place recklessly, or in a manner which is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition, and use of the street, road, highway or place, and the amount of traffic which is actually at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, on such street, road, highway or place, shall be guilty of an offence and liable * * *\nThe Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal for Alberta and the judgment was affirmed, Chief Justice Harvey dissenting on a question of law. The Attorney-General of Alberta now appeals to this Court and submits that in law, the respondent should not have been convicted of the lesser offence mentioned in section 285(6) but of manslaughter.\nDuring the argument the question of jurisdiction of the Court was raised. The right given to the Attorney-General of a province to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada is found in section 1023(2) of the Criminal Code which is in the following terms:\u2014\n(2) The Attorney-General of the province may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of any court of appeal setting aside a conviction or dismissing an appeal against a judgment or verdict of acquittal in respect of an indictable offence on an appeal taken under section ten hundred and thirteen on any question of law on which there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal.\nThe law strictly limits the rights of the Attorney-General to appeal and they can be summarized as follows:\nThe Attorney-General may appeal:\n1. From the judgment of a court of appeal setting aside a conviction;\n2. From the judgment of a court of appeal dismissing an appeal against a verdict of acquittal.\nIt is, therefore, only when the accused has been acquitted that the Crown may appeal to this Court. In the present case, the accused has been acquitted of the charge of manslaughter, but he has been found guilty under section 285(6) of the offence of driving an automobile in a manner dangerous to the public, and this conviction has been affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nUpon a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle, three verdicts may be rendered: 10. guilty of manslaughter, 20. guilty under section 285(6), and 30. not guilty. The power of the Court to convict of a lesser offence upon a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle, was originally given in 1930, when it was said that the accused could be found guilty of, criminal negligence under section 284, Cr. C. In 1938 (Chap. 44, section 45) the law was amended, and we now have section 951(3), Cr. C., which clearly says that the lesser offence on a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle is the offence found in section 285(6).\nBy the operation of the law, the lesser offence is included in the count, and a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle, therefore, includes a charge under section 285(6), although this last offence is not mentioned in the count. When there is an acquittal on the major offence followed with a conviction on the minor offence, it cannot be said that the accused has been acquitted on the charge as laid. The degree of his guilt is smaller, but he has nevertheless been found guilty.\nTo my mind, the law requires a complete acquittal in respect of all the offences charged directly or otherwise in the same count, in order to allow the Attorney-General to appeal to this Court.\nTo hold different views would, in my opinion, lead us to a very extraordinary result. This Court, if it did come to the conclusion that it has jurisdiction to entertain this appeal, would undoubtedly have the power to direct a new trial, and as a result of which the accused, without having appealed, might be acquitted, even of the charge on which he has already been found guilty at the first trial.\nI, therefore, have to come to the conclusion that the respondent has not been acquitted within the meaning of section 1023(2), that this Court has no jurisdiction to hear this appeal, and that it should be quashed.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] [1940] 2 W.W.R. 401; [1940] 3 D.L.R. 358.\n[2] [1937] A.C. 576.\n"

Benmaple, which sank as a result of a collision between her and the ship Lafayette, owned by the respondent, La Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Transatlantique. The collision occurred at about five o'clock in the morning of August 31st, 1936, in the St. Lawrence river, about 25 miles above Father Point, where the Lafayette had taken a pilot. There was a dense fog and neither ship saw the other until almost the moment of the collision, apparently too late to avoid it. The Lafayette, about ten minutes before the collision, heard an ordinary fog whistle ahead, slightly on her port bow. Up to that time, she had been running through the fog for some 35 minutes at a \"standby full speed\" which, for her, was about 16 knots \"over the ground.\" The tide was ebb about 2 to 3 knots against her. When the Lafayette heard the fog signal, the only one she alleged she did hear, she stopped her engines for three minutes, but the ship still continued running along at about 5 or 6 knots over the ground. Then she went ahead at slow speed for two minutes and then increased to half speed for about five minutes when the collision occurred. The trial judge found that the logs on the Lafayette plainly appeared to have been erased and falsified at critical points. Subsequent to the action in damages by the owners of the Benmaple against the ship Lafayette, the master and other officers and members of the crew of the Benmaple and four passengers on board the steamer were added as plaintiffs for loss of clothing and personal effects. La Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Transatlantique also filed a counterclaim against the owners of the Benmaple for $75,000 for damage caused to the ship Lafayette by the collision. Another action was taken against the Lafayette by Maple Leaf Milling Company, Limited and other owners of cargo or goods laden on the Benmaple. The trial judge, Demers J., Judge in Admiralty, hearing the case with two assessors, held that there was no doubt as to the fault on the part of the Benmaple; that the Lafayette also contributed to the accident, she having been wrong in going half speed before ascertaining that there was no danger from the other ship; and the trial judge apportioned fault three-quarters against the Benmaple and one-quarter against the Lafayette. On appeal to the Exchequer Court of Canada, Angers J., assisted by one assessor, held that the fault was wholly that of the Benmaple and that, even assuming that the Lafayette's speed was too great, that was not the proximate cause of the accident, and the actions were dismissed.\nHeld, Crocket J. dissenting, that there was no doubt as to the fault on the part of the Lafayette as well as on the part of the Benmaple, as found by the trial judge and that such finding should not have been disturbed on appeal to the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nPer the Chief Justice and Davis J.\u2014Under the circumstances of this case, it is plain that the Lafayette should have stopped when she heard the first fog signal until she had ascertained \"with certainty\" what was the position of the ship from which the signal had come.\u2014Comments as to what constitutes a moderate speed in fog; as to the duty of a ship to stop and then navigate with caution until the danger of a collision is over; and as to the question of altering the apportionment of blame on each vessel as fixed by the trial judge.\nPer Crocket J. (dissenting):\u2014The vital issue in the case is a question of fact as to whether the fog signals of the Benmaple were sounded at regular intervals after the first signal heard by the Lafayette; and the trial judge misdirected himself in holding that he was obliged to accept the affirmative testimony of the Benmaple's witnesses that they were sounded rather than the negative testimony of the Lafayette's witnesses that they were not, following the rule of evidence that the positive or affirmative testimony as to whether a thing did or did not happen should be accepted rather than the negative testimony. Therefore, the judge in appeal was justified in disregarding the trial finding upon that vital issue and himself concluding upon the evidence that the Lafayette was not at fault: her act of increasing her speed from slow to half was attributable, not to any negligence on her own part, but solely to the negligent failure of the Benmaple to regularly sound her fog signals for a period of at least five minutes.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1939] Ex. C.R. 355) reversed, Crocket J. dissenting.\nAPPEALS (heard together before this Court) from the judgments of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Angers J.[1], reversing the judgments of the District Judge in Admiralty for the Quebec Admiralty District, Demers D.J.A.[2] and holding that all the actions by the several plaintiffs should be dismissed and that the respondents' counter-claim should be maintained.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nR. C. Holden K.C. for the appellants.\nLucien Beauregard K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Davis J. was delivered by\nDavis J.\u2014The appeals in these cases were heard together and arise out of a collision between two ships in the St. Lawrence river at about five o'clock in the morning of August 31st, 1936. The appellants Port Colborne & St. Lawrence Navigation Company, Limited, were owners of the Benmaple, which sank as a result of the collision. She was a steel single screw steamer of the Canadian canal type of construction, about 250 feet in length with a beam of about 43 feet and a gross tonnage of about 1,729. She was carrying a heavy cargo of flour and feed and was on her way down the river from Montreal to Halifax. The respondents, La Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Transatlantique, are the owners of the Lafayette\u2014a large French passenger motor vessel of a gross tonnage of 25,000 with a net registered tonnage of 14,430. She is a ship over 600 feet in length. The Lafayette was coming up the river on an excursion trip from Boston to Quebec. The collision occurred about 25 miles above Father Point where the Lafayette had taken on a pilot. There was a dense fog and it is plain that neither ship saw the other until almost the moment of the collision. The Lafayette cut into the Benmaple's stern about 33 feet, going from starboard to port and from stem to stern, and swinging the Benmaple right around. Within about an hour the Benmaple with her full cargo sank.\nThe vital fact in the case, and it is not in dispute, is that the Lafayette heard a fog whistle ahead, slightly on her port bow, about ten minutes before the collision. It was an ordinary fog signal. Up to that time she had been running through the fog for some 35 minutes at what the witnesses termed \"standby full speed\" which, for the Lafayette, is about 16 knots \"over the ground.\" The tide was ebb about 2 to 3 knots against the Lafayette. When the Lafayette heard the fog signal (the only one she did hear if any other was given until she was right upon the Benmaple) she stopped her engines for three minutes. But the stopping of her engines for such a short time did not mean that the ship stopped going ahead; it appears to have left the ship running along at about 5 or 6 knots over the ground. The Lafayette, after stopping her engines for three minutes, then went ahead at slow speed for two minutes and then increased to half speed for about five minutes when the collision occurred. She had heard no further fog signals but when there suddenly appeared on her port bow a white masthead light on an approaching ship (it turned out to be on the Benmaple) the Lafayette turned 15 degrees up to the moment of impact. What the appellants say is that on all the authorities the speed of the Lafayette was a very serious matter. It is rather apparent that the Lafayette's witnesses at the trial endeavoured to keep down the speed of the ship and to extend the range of visibility. The logs on the Lafayette plainly appear to have been erased and falsified at critical points as found by the trial judge.\nDemers J., the learned district Judge in Admiralty for Quebec, who heard the case with two assessors, said he had no doubt as to fault on the part of the Benmaple. She did not have a pilot and while not bound by law to have one she did not follow the usual course of ships going down the Gulf of St. Lawrence. She was not sufficiently manned and the captain failed to meet his responsibilities. Further, the trial judge found that those on board the Benmaple were not keeping a proper lookout. The Lafayette was equipped with an exceptionally strong diaphone whistle which was placed forward of the funnel and the fog signals of the Lafayette were given at regular intervals and were always heard by the officer of the Daghild, another ship which was going up the river at the time and which the Lafayette had overtaken two or three miles before the collision. The trial judge said that he had more difficulty in determining the question whether the Lafayette was also in fault. The only serious reproach, he said, was that she violated article 16 of the International Rules of the Road. But he pointed out that she did not entirely disregard the rule; if she had and continued at full speed, very likely nothing would have happened. She started to obey the rule. Hearing a signal, she stopped for three minutes and nothing more being heard, she started to slow for two minutes and then she started at half speed. She was so going for one or two minutes when she saw the Benmaple at a distance of between 500 and 1,000 feet. Her engines were stopped and reversed. The learned trial judge then put to himself the question: \"Was half speed a reasonable speed ?\" On the evidence he reached the conclusion that a vessel in such a fog should have been stopped until it could be ascertained with certainty what the position of the Benmaple was and what she was doing, and in failing to do so, the Lafayette was wrong in going half speed before ascertaining that there was no danger from the other ship. The trial judge was satisfied that the Lafayette's neglect contributed to the accident and he apportioned fault three-quarters against the Benmaple and one-quarter against the Lafayette, and therefore only gave the Benmaple's owners and co-plaintiffs one-quarter of their damages without costs. From that judgment the Lafayette appealed to the Exchequer Court of Canada and the present appellants, the Benmaple and the owners of her cargo, gave notice of a cross appeal asking for an equal division of fault. Angers J. heard the appeal and he came to the conclusion that the fault was wholly that of the Benmaple, allowed the appeal and dismissed the actions. From his judgment the Benmaple and the owners of her cargo appealed to this Court, asking for the restoration of the trial judgment with a variation to the extent of holding the Lafayette equally to blame with the Benmaple and condemning her to pay to the appellants one-half of their damages and full costs. Certain members of the crew and the parents of a deceased member of the crew intervened in the actions but when the actions were dismissed by Angers J. they did not carry their interventions to this Court. Angers J., on appeal, while not inclined to think that the Lafayette proceeded at an immoderate speed after stopping her engines for three minutes and then proceeding at slow speed for two minutes, and then at half speed, held even if her speed was too great, that was not the proximate cause of the accident.\nIf the Lafayette had continued to proceed at slow speed, the damages would very likely have been less serious. I do not think, however, that this is a sufficient reason to hold the Lafayette partly responsible for the damages incurred, as, in my opinion, the collision could and would have been avoided had the Benmaple given regular fog signals and kept a proper lookout.\nFor this reason the learned judge on appeal exonerated the Lafayette from any fault causing or contributing to the collision.\nMr. Holden for the appellants admitted at once that there was fault on the part of the Benmaple in that its speed was not \"moderate\" as required by article 16 of the International Rules of the Road, but contended, as the trial judge found, that there was clearly fault also on the part of the Lafayette; that Angers J. had no just ground for disturbing that finding of the trial judge; and that on the evidence taken as a whole the apportionment of fault should have been an equal division. Mr. Holden's submission was that the Lafayette cannot be exonerated: (1) because up to 4.52 a.m. the Lafayette by going ahead at full speed in dense fog was guilty of travelling at an immoderate speed; (2) that any ship in a dense fog after hearing even one fog signal ought not to go ahead even at half speed\u2014that was not cautious; (3) that Demers J. in making the apportionment did not take into account the speed of the Lafayette before the first whistle but only the speed after it was heard; and if the trial judge had given that aspect of the case its proper weight he could not and would not have put 75 per cent of the blame on the Benmaple as against 25 per cent on the Lafayette.\nThe evidence satisfies us that the two ships did not come head to head but that the Benmaple's direction was rather that of crossing the other's course. One can only roughly estimate the angle of the collision. While the witnesses no doubt give their best recollection as to the distances in feet between the two ships when each observed the other, it is plain that the ships were practically on top of one another at that time. Taking the speed of the two vessels travelling in opposite directions it is estimated by Mr. Holden that their combined speed was about 1,750 feet in a minute and from the various distances of separation given by the several witnesses it would probably be only a matter of seconds when each ship suddenly endeavoured to avoid the other.\nThere was undoubtedly a thick fog and when the Lafayette finally saw the Benmaple her orders were: \"Stop. Hard to starboard. Full astern.\" These orders were given almost all at once. Mr. Holden referred to the automatic course recorder as conclusive against the Lafayette having stopped. It is contended that she could have stopped in 2.44 minutes but Mr. Holden argued that the chart shows that she could not have been dead in two and a half minutes. I now quote article 16 of the International Rules of the Road:\nArticle 16. Every vessel shall, in a fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy rain storms, go at a moderate speed, having careful regard to the existing circumstances and conditions.\nA steam vessel hearing, apparently forward of her beam, the fog-signal of a vessel, the position of which is not ascertained, shall, so far as the circumstances of the case admit, stop her engines, and then navigate with caution until danger of collision is over.\nNow what constitutes a moderate speed in fog? In the House of Lords in The Oceanic[3], Lord Halsbury at p. 380 said this:\nApart from any rule, one would think that where it was known that two bodies were approaching, and that there was no absolute means of knowing the direction in which they were coming and the danger which was to be avoided, the common sense thing would be to stop until the direction was ascertained, and also whether it was possible to avoid the serious danger which might arise.\nLord Shand added, at p. 380:\nIt is not denied that the Kincora was to blame, and the question now is whether she was solely to blame. The Oceanic seems to possess a remarkable stopping power, and it was said that that power of stopping justified the speed at which she was going. I have come to the opinion after the full arguments which we heard that taking that power of stopping into account, the Oceanic, nevertheless, was not going at a moderate speed having regard to the circumstances of the case. The power of stopping within a short distance is no doubt a material circumstance to be taken into account in such a question as this, but here the fog was so thick that the power of stopping was not timeously exercised. As it was not timeously exercised the way on the vessel was such that she by her speed conduced to the collision, and so the Oceanic was also, in my opinion, to blame. As to the duty to stop and then navigate with caution until the danger of a collision is over, a leading case is The Chinkiang in the Privy Council[4]. The judgment was delivered by Sir Gorell Barnes. Their Lordships were clearly of opinion that, having regard to the weather and the circumstances of the case, the ship\nwas not proceeding at a moderate speed, and that her excessive speed was a contributing cause to the collision in question.\nDealing with article 16 of the International Regulations,\nTheir Lordships cannot consider that the speed which was upon the vessel in this case was such as to comply with the terms of art. 16.\nThe judgment continues (at p. 259):\nafter hearing the first whistle * * * it is notorious that it is a matter of the very greatest difficulty to make out the direction and distance of a whistle heard in a fog, and that it is almost impossible to rely with certainty on being able to determine the precise bearing and distance of a fog signal when it is heard.\nand goes on to say that the ship should know \"unequivocally and distinctly what was the position\" and that the engines\nought to have been stopped until it could be, with certainty, ascertained what the position of the Chinkiang was, and what she was doing.\nIn 1934 in the Privy Council in Nippon Yusen Kaisha v. The China Navigation Co. Ltd.[5], Lord Macmillan said, at pp. 534 and 535:\nThe result is that their Lordships are of opinion that the Kiangsu was in breach of Regulation 16 by reason of her failure to stop her engines * * * She cannot be absolved from a share in the blame for the collision. Their Lordships cannot too emphatically express their sense of the importance of implicit obedience to the regulations on whose observance navigators are entitled at all times to rely.\nAt the close of the argument of counsel for the respondent the case came down for discussion very much to what was the distance between the two ships when the Lafayette first sighted the Benmaple. In fact I asked specifically for an answer to that question because it seemed to me that the closer the one ship was put to the other, the stronger became the inference that the five men on the bridge of the Lafayette plus two additional lookouts must either have been inattentive if they did not see the Benmaple until they were right on top of her, or, that the fog must have been so dense that they could not see her until they were right on top of her, in which case great caution should have been taken in navigating. Mr. Beauregard answered the question by saying in terms of time it was between a minute and two minutes and then translated that into distance, making, as Mr. Holden did, the combined speed of the two ships travelling in opposite directions at about 1,750 feet per minute, although Mr. Beauregard preferred to state that as the maximum. Mr. Justice Demers had said:\n* * * when she (i.e. the Lafayette) saw the Benmaple at a distance of between five hundred and one thousand feet * * *\nMr. Justice Angers put it at 1,000 feet. No matter what the exact distance may have been, it is plain that it was a very short distance but Mr. Beauregard, in a clear and forcible argument, contended that if there was any immoderate speed on the part of the Lafayette which might be said to be a breach of article 16, such speed on the facts of this case did not cause or contribute to the collision. It was merely collateral and immaterial, he said.\nOn the whole case we think it is plain that the Lafayette should have stopped when she heard the first fog signal until she had ascertained \"with certainty\" what was the position of the ship from which the signal had come. There can be no question, we think, of fault on the part of the Lafayette as well as on the part of the Benmaple and that was the finding of the trial judge, assisted by two assessors. With the greatest respect I can find no ground upon which the learned Judge in the Exchequer Court of Canada on appeal, assisted by one assessor, should have disturbed the finding of liability.\nWe were pressed by counsel for the appellant, if we came to the above conclusion on the question of liability, to apportion the blame on an equal division rather than on the division of 25 and 75 per cent fixed by the trial judge. But upon the question of altering the share of responsibility Lord Buckmaster in the House of Lords in SS. Kitano Maru v. SS. Otranto[6] (and his judgment was concurred in by all the other Law Lords who sat upon the appeal) said:\n* * * this is primarily a matter for the judge at the trial, and unless there is some error in law or fact in his judgment it ought not to be disturbed. The Luso[7] was an appeal in the Court of Appeal before Lord Justice Scrutton, Lord Justice Greer and Lord Justice Maugham (as he then was). That was a collision case and the only thing in dispute was the measure of apportionment of the damage. Lord Justice Scrutton, after referring to The Glorious[8], The Karamea[9], and The Peter Benoit[10], said (at p. 165):\nThe learned Judge below having two admissions from the two sides, has apportioned the damage between them, making certain findings as to the reliability of the evidence given by the two sides, and has apportioned the damage 75 per cent on the Latvian ship and 25 per cent on the Portuguese ship, and before the Court of Appeal ought to interfere with that finding they must be able to put their finger on something and say that, the learned Judge has been wrong on some particular point and that that particular point is so substantial that if he had taken what we say is the right view of it he must have altered the proportion of damage.\nLord Justice Greer at p. 166 said:\nIt is not an easy problem to set a tribunal of fact to measure the amount of fault there is in the navigation of two ships, but the statute (Maritime Conventions Act, 1911, sect. 1 (1)) puts it upon the tribunal to decide that question, and where it is more or less in every case a question of degree, it is right to say that on only very rare occasions is it that the Court of Appeal ought to reverse the decision of the learned Judge, if there is any ground on which there can be established a difference of fault of the two vessels in collision.\nWe have come to the conclusion that the learned trial judge was justified in his view that there were different degrees of fault of the two vessels in collision and we are not satisfied that in making the apportionment he did he was in any degree acting either on any wrong ground of law or conclusion of fact.\nThe appeals should be allowed, the judgments of Angers J. set aside and the judgments of Demers J. at the trial restored. The appellants should have their costs of the appeal in the Exchequer Court and in this Court.\nCrocket J. (dissenting)\u2014These actions arose out of a collision, which occurred in the River St. Lawrence at a point 6 or 7 miles west of Bicquette Island about five o'clock a.m. (daylight time), on August 31st, 1936, between the Benmaple and the Lafayette. The Benmaple was a steel single screw steamer of the Canadian canal type with triple expansion steam engines. She was 250\u00b71 feet in length and 43 feet in beam and of a net registered tonnage of 1,074, and was on a trip from Montreal to Halifax with a cargo of flour, feed and other general cargo. The Lafayette was a motor steel passenger vessel with a length of 184 meters, a width of 26 meters and a net registered tonnage of 14,430 tons. She was equipped with four Diesel engines, her maximum speed being about 17 knots. She was on an excursion trip from Boston to Quebec. For some hours before the collision foggy weather of varying thickness had prevailed in the river between Quebec and Eather Point, and the trial judge found that, while the crew of the Lafayette saw the Benmaple at a distance of between 500 and 1,000 feet, the crew of the Benmaple did not see the Lafayette until she was within a distance of 50 feet of the motor ship, bearing slightly on the Benmaple's starboard bow. It was apparently then too late to avoid the collision. Both vessels at the moment the Benmaple's white masthead light was first seen by the Lafayette were going at half speed, which, making due allowance for the one moving against the current and tide and the other with it, meant a speed of 9 knots (over the ground) for the Lafayette and at least 8\u00bd knots for the Benmaple. Notwithstanding that the powerful engines of the Lafayette were immediately stopped and reversed to full speed astern, and the helm put hard astarboard, she struck the Benmaple, cut through the forecastle and main decks for a distance of 33 feet, and turned her completely around. The Benmaple sank with her cargo in a little more than an hour, all 19 members of her crew except one sailor having been rescued by one of the Lafayette's life boats.\nThe actions were tried before Mr. Justice Demers, Local Judge in Admiralty for the district of Quebec, sitting with two assessors. The learned judge held the Lafayette one-quarter and the Benmaple three-quarters to blame for the collision and rendered judgment accordingly, condemning the Lafayette and her bail to pay one-quarter of the plaintiffs' damages and awarding the defendants three-quarters of their damages on their counter-claim, without costs to any of the parties, and with a reference to the Registrar to assess the damages on that basis. The defendants appealed from the trial judgment to the Exchequer Court of Canada and the plaintiffs cross-appealed, claiming that the trial judgment should be varied so as to hold the Lafayette at least equally to blame with the Benmaple for the collision. The result was that the defendants' appeal was allowed, the plaintiffs' action dismissed with costs and the defendants' counter-claim maintained, and a reference to the District Registrar ordered for the assessment of the defendants' damages only.\nThe one ground, on which the learned trial judge found the Lafayette in part to blame for the collision, was that after she had stopped for three minutes upon hearing a fog signal from a ship ahead, which proved to be the Benmaple, and then proceeding slow for two minutes, she went to half speed again before ascertaining that there was no danger from the other ship. Other than this he found no negligence of any kind on the part of the Lafayette. \"Nobody denies,\" he said,\nthat the ship was well manned. Her officers were all on the alert. Her fog whistle was in operation with regularity. There were seven persons on the bridge exercising a vigil and there were two additional lookouts. The master and the staff were all at their posts.\nOn the other hand, with respect to the Benmaple, which admittedly had no pilot, he found in effect that this lack was not made up by the presence of officers, who were conversant with all the difficulties of navigation in that stretch of the river, and that as a result she did not follow the usual course of outgoing ships. The undisputed and admitted fact was that the master of the Benmaple had retired to his cabin below the pilot house about midnight, undressed and went to sleep, and continued to sleep until he was awakened by the collision, and that during all this time the vessel was in charge of a master mariner, 64 years of age, who had been on duty for approximately 17 hours except for a few moments' rest, and who the trial judge, in his reasons, described as being deaf. The learned trial judge explicitly found that the master failed to meet his responsibilities, and, moreover, that those on board the Benmaple were not keeping a proper look-out.\nThe appellant, while of course impugning the validity of the Exchequer Court of Canada judgment in exonerating the Lafayette from all blame, makes no pretension on this appeal that the trial judge was not fully warranted in finding that the Benmaple was guilty of negligence, which materially contributed to the collision, but it does contend, as it did in the Exchequer Court of Canada, that it should not be saddled with more than fifty per cent of the responsibility, and that the trial judgment should be varied accordingly. The respondent on the other hand directly challenges, as it did in the Exchequer Court of Canada, the trial finding that the Lafayette was at fault in starting her engines at half speed in the circumstances described by the presiding judge before ascertaining that there was no danger ahead. Herein, it seems to me, lies the crux of the problem presented by this appeal\u2014the main issue upon which the trial judge and Angers J. differed.\nThat the question whether or not the Benmaple, in addition to the other grounds of negligence found against her by the trial judge, failed also to properly sound her fog whistle at regular intervals was a matter of first importance in determining whether the Lafayette violated its duty in ordering her engines from slow to half speed, when she did, goes, I think, without saying. It could hardly be doubted, as pointed out by Angers J., that if the Lafayette had heard another signal before the expiry of the three minutes during which her engines were stopped, she would have kept them stopped, and not gone on. No one, I think, can read the learned trial judge's reasons without seeing that he was keenly alive to this fact. Indeed these considered reasons seem to me directly to point to the probability that, had he not felt obliged to accept the affirmative testimony of the Benmaple's witnesses that her fog signals were being regularly sounded rather than the negative testimony of the Lafayette's witnesses that they were not, he would have exonerated the Lafayette from all blame. His finding on this question of the Benmaple's signals was the only finding of fact, which the learned judge on appeal does not seem to have followed; and as to this the trial judge says:\u2014\nI must now come to the question of signals. There is positive evidence by the Benmaple that they were regularly given. My assessors are of the opinion that they were not. They base their opinion on the fact that the Lafayette was stopped three minutes to listen and that all on board were very attentive and heard nothing; that the Daghild was coming astern but heard them (the Lafayette), though the diaphone was on the funnel; and also very likely by the poor manner in which the Benmaple was conducted. This, however, being a question of evidence, I consider I am not bound by their opinion and that I must follow the ordinary rules of evidence and that I cannot reject positive evidence on presumption. The doubt in my mind is not sufficient. Plaintiff, therefore, is entitled to the benefit of the doubt.\nNo doubt what His Lordship had in mind was the principle that upon an issue as to whether a thing did or did not happen, the positive or affirmative testimony ordinarily should be accepted rather than the negative testimony. The clear implication of his statement is that he felt he was precluded by this so-called rule of evidence from rejecting the positive testimony of the Benmaple's witnesses, and that that rule cast upon the defendant ship the burden of proving the negative of the issue beyond all reasonable doubt. With the greatest respect, I am of opinion that the learned trial judge misdirected himself in that regard. No more than a preponderance of evidence upon the particular question involved was required, to my mind, to rebut the affirmative assertions of the Benmaple's witnesses, the question always being: on which side does the balance of the probabilities lie? The rule referred to, which some judges have described as being merely a rule of common sense rather than a rule of evidence, is, I think, applicable only to a case where a trial tribunal is obliged to choose between a positive assertion made by one or more apparently credible witnesses on one side that some particular thing happened and its denial by one or more apparently equally credible witnesses on the other. The reason of the rule, as I have always understood it, is that the negative testimony may be explained on grounds, which are perfectly consistent with the good faith and veracity of the negative witnesses, as, for instance, that they were in such a position or the conditions were such that the thing may have happened, notwithstanding that they neither heard nor saw it.\nThat such was not the case in the present instance is, to my mind, plainly shown by the facts which the learned trial judge has himself found. For instance, he quotes the statement of his assessors regarding the vagaries of sound in a fog and \"silent areas\" and finds that there was nothing in the conditions prevailing at the time to prevent fog signals being heard. He also explicitly finds in the extracts I have already quoted that the Lafayette's officers were all at their posts and on the alert and that they heard at least one signal before making the three-minute stop. The obvious purpose of that stop was to watch and listen and assure themselves that the fog signal they did hear did not come from a vessel bearing towards her, and that there was consequently no danger ahead. Then, as the presiding trial judge himself puts it, \"nothing being heard, she started to slow for two minutes, and then she started half speed.\" Had the atmospheric conditions in that area been such as were likely to render sound signals inaudible in certain directions, one could perhaps understand the possibility of the Benmaple repeating her fog signals at regular intervals as she came nearer and nearer the Lafayette without their being heard by the latter; but how can such a hypothesis be reconciled with the trial judge's finding, after consultation with his expert assessors, that no such conditions were present, and at the same time with the completely irreproachable character of the vigil exercised, not only from the bridge but the forward lookout posts of the Lafayette, by the master and eight other efficient navigating officers and seamen, all on the alert, as so explicitly certified by the presiding trial judge himself? Or how can it be reconciled with the other equally vital fact that the Lafayette had previously heard one fog signal from the Benmaple, which must necessarily have been given from a greater distance, and immediately stopped her engines for three minutes for the special purpose of making sure that the vessel, from which the signal had come, was not bearing towards her own course? I should have thought that these facts themselves were quite sufficient, not only to override any assumption that the Benmaple's fog signals may have been regularly repeated and yet not heard on board the Lafayette, but to leave no other conclusion reasonably open in the situation described than that, if further fog signals were not heard by the Lafayette's witnesses after the stop-engines order was given and immediately executed, further signals were not sounded, as alleged by the Benmaple's witnesses.\nThis, however, is not all. The learned trial judge found also that the fog signals of the Lafayette were given at regular intervals and were always heard by the officers of the Daghild, which was coming astern. It should be explained in this connection that the Lafayette shortly after passing Bicquette Island overtook the Daghild proceeding up river, which she passed on the latter's starboard side at a distance of between a quarter and a half mile, when the Baghild's lights were plainly visible, as were those of the Lafayette, and that from that time the Lafayette never got beyond hearing of the Daghild's fog signals. When the Lafayette stopped her engines for three minutes and then started them at slow for two minutes more, the Daghild naturally gained on her. Three witnesses from the Daghild\u2014the master, chief officer and pilot\u2014gave evidence before the trial judge, all of whom, though swearing that they distinctly heard the Lafayette's signals as they were regularly given, testified that they did not hear any signals from the Benmaple. Here is another material fact, proven by three perfectly independent disinterested witnesses, and tending unerringly, as it seems to me, to further confirm the Lafayette's case that no further fog signals were sounded by the Benmaple while the Lafayette's engines remained stopped or were run at slow, i.e., for a period of five minutes, before the motor vessel started them at half speed again.\nAdding to these considerations the laxity and carelessness, which marked the navigation of the Benmaple during the relevant period, as found by the learned trial judge himself, we have such a formidable series of facts, conditions and circumstances as, considered in relation to each other, cannot reasonably, it seems to me, be squared with the affirmative testimony that the Benmaple's fog signals were actually blown at regular intervals.\nIn my most respectful opinion the learned trial judge misdirected himself when he held that he was precluded by the rule of evidence he had in mind from accepting, not only the advice of his expert assessors upon this question, but the negative testimony upon which the Lafayette relied, supplemented, as that testimony was, by all the facts and circumstances I have above indicated. If this be so, it follows that the learned judge in appeal was fully justified in disregarding the trial finding upon that vital issue and himself concluding upon the evidence in relation thereto that the Benmaple's signals were not regularly given, and determining the appeal upon that basis and all the other trial findings, in which he concurred. Considering this appeal upon that footing, as I think we ought to do, the really decisive question for our determination is as to whether the learned judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada was warranted in setting aside the conclusion of the learned trial judge that the Lafayette, after stopping her engines for three minutes upon hearing one fog signal from the Benmaple, and then proceeding slow for two minutes, was at fault in proceeding at half speed again before ascertaining that there was no danger from the other ship. As to this conclusion the learned trial judge seems again to be in disagreement with his assessors, who, he says, considering the Lafayette's special and powerful equipment, \"are inclined to think that under the circumstances (her) speed was moderate.\" In this instance, however, His Lordship bases himself upon the judgment of Barnes, J., rendered in 1900 in the case of The Campania[11], and the judgment of the Privy Council in The Chinkiang[12], which was delivered by the same eminent judge (then Sir Gorell Barnes). Both these cases involved the consideration of Article 16 of the International Rules of the Road. This Article reads as follows:\u2014\nEvery vessel shall, in a fog, mist, falling snow or heavy rainstorms, go at a moderate speed, having careful regard to the existing circumstances and conditions.\nA steam vessel hearing, apparently forward of her beam, the fog signal of a vessel, the position of which is not ascertained, shall, so far as the circumstances of the case admit, stop her engines, and then navigate with caution until danger of collision is over.\nThe Campania case (1) concerned a collision, which took place in St. George's Channel between the well known Cunard transatlantic liner and the barque Embelton in a fog so dense that the Campania could not be seen until she came within a distance of about half the length of the barque. The liner was running at slow, making between 9 and 10 knots an hour and her whistle was continuously sounding a long blast every minute. The trial judge found that the Embelton's fog horn was efficient and that it was being duly and properly sounded, notwithstanding that it did not appear to have reached the ears of those on board the Campania. This latter fact, he said, was not sufficient to override the positive evidence of the witnesses from the barque that it was properly sounded. The Elder Brethren advised me that, as a matter of experience, sound signals in a fog are not always to be heard as they might be expected to be, and especially by persons on steamers approaching at considerable speed, and sounding their own fog whistles, and that this makes it all the more necessary that the speed of vessels in a fog should be moderate, as provided by the 16th Article.\nHe held that the Campania was guilty of a breach of Article 16, and was solely to blame for the collision. It was contended that the Campania could not be safely navigated at sea at less speed; that if she were she would not steer properly and there would be uncertainty about her course and the distance run; and further, that being a twin-screw steamer, she could be brought to a standstill in a very short distance by reversing her engines full speed astern. Barnes, J., held, notwithstanding that it was proved that her engines were so constructed that she could not go slower, that she was not going at a moderate speed within the meaning of the regulation, and that she was solely responsible for the collision. In his reasons he quoted Lord Hannen's dictum in The Irrawaddy in the Admiralty Div. in 1887, cited in Marsden on Collisions, 9th ed., at 344, viz.:\nIf it be necessary to reduce the speed of a vessel below that which is its lowest speed, though it may cause inconvenience yet it must be done in what appears to be the only practical way of doing it\u2014viz.: by stopping from time to time.\nIn The Chinkiang[13] the collision took place in a dense fog off the Shantung Promontory, North China, between that steamer and His Majesty's despatch vessel, Alacrity. The trial judge held that the Chinkiang was solely to blame for not stopping and going at a speed of 9\u00bd knots an hour in the fog which prevailed, but the Judicial Committee held that the Alacrity was guilty of negligence, which also contributed to the collision, in that she was going at a speed of about 6\u00b78 knots an hour, which, having regard to the weather and the circumstances of the case, was not a moderate speed within the meaning of the Article, and that by not stopping her engines after hearing the first signals from the Chinkiang until he could ascertain her position with certainty and what she was doing, her commander failed to comply with the Article's directions. Both these cases are clearly distinguishable from the case at bar in that neither the Campania nor the Alacrity stopped her engines at all, and that in both cases the weather and fog conditions were apparently such as to render the sound of fog signals uncertain and undependable, which the trial judge distinctly found was not the fact in this case.\nWhile these cases illustrate the marked disinclination of the English courts to recognize any considerations of convenience or even government urgency as an adequate excuse for non-compliance with a code of rules devised to ensure as far as possible the safety of navigation throughout the world, they clearly recognize, as the terms of Article 16 themselves do, that the duty of observing them depends at all times on existing circumstances and conditions. In neither of these cases is any new doctrine propounded, which can well be taken as in any way affecting the application of the general governing principles of the law of negligence to collisions at sea. When a ship is charged with negligence causing or materially contributing to a collision and the relevant facts, conditions and circumstances are proved, there is but one recognized criterion for determining her responsibility. That is, as I apprehend it from the various cases: Did the ship, by her master and those navigating her under his command, exercise that degree of nautical care and skill, which is generally looked for in competent seamen, to avoid such risks as might in the existing circumstances be reasonably anticipated?\nIn considering whether the Lafayette discharged this duty in relation to the Benmaple we must bear in mind that both courts below distinctly negatived all negligence on her part up to the moment when she ordered her engines from slow to half speed, and that she was going at that speed only \"for one or two minutes when she saw the Benmaple at a distance of between five hundred and one thousand feet,\" as the trial judgment says. I concede at once that, had she heard any further signals forward of her beam or had the atmospheric conditions been such as to render fog signals inaudible or uncertain as to distance or direction, she ought to be held to have violated Article 16, as well as her duty to the Benmaple. As I have already pointed out, however, the learned trial judge himself has expressly found that no such atmospheric conditions prevailed; that her master and his staff were exercising a faultless vigil from the bridge with two special lookouts at their forward posts and that, when she heard a single signal (which turned out to be from the Benmaple), \"she stopped for three minutes, and nothing being heard, she started to slow for two minutes\" before going into half speed again. In all these explicit findings the learned judge in appeal has concurred, so that we must, I think, take it as conclusively established that the Lafayette heard no further signals during at least the three minutes her engines were stopped. I think, moreover, that, though the trial judge did not distinctly say so, he must be taken to have meant that she heard no further signals during the following two minutes her engines were running at slow, for it is hardly conceivable that a ship, which admittedly stopped for three minutes for the special purpose of listening for further signals, and then, hearing none, proceeded slow for two minutes more, would then double her speed, had she heard any further signals during the latter interval. It follows as a necessary inference, I think, that, when the half speed order was given, the Lafayette had not heard a fog signal from the Benmaple for at least five minutes before she started half speed again. What else could the master and his navigating staff reasonably assume from the facts, conditions and circumstances, to which they were all during that critical interval admittedly so keenly alive, than that there was no further danger from the Benmaple? As Lord Blackburn pointed out in Cayzer v. Carron Co.[14], they had a right to suppose that the other vessel would observe the requirements of the well known international rules of the road, as she herself was doing, and to regulate their own movements on that supposition. This, it seems to me, makes an end of the charge of negligence against the Lafayette concerning the changing of her speed from slow to half after her three-minute stop. The trial judge having, as I have said, negatived all negligence up to that moment, and only found the Lafayette at fault in respect of that act, and of going at that speed for not more than one or two minutes before she saw the Benmaple, it is self-evident that, if the Lafayette would not have thus increased her speed from slow to half but for the negligent failure of the Benmaple to regularly sound her fog signals for a period of at least five minutes, her act in doing so was attributable, not to any negligence on her own part, but solely to the negligence of the Benmaple, as are all the natural and direct consequences thereof.\nAs to the apparent alteration of the Lafayette's deck and engine room logs, this concerned only her speed during the one or two minutes which elapsed between the half speed order and the collision of the two ships and the contention put forward on the trial that the Lafayette had come to a full stop before hitting the Benmaple. Both the trial judge and the judge in appeal, as well as all three assessors, concurred in the opinion that she had some advance when the two vessels came together.\nAfter the fullest and most careful consideration I have been able to give this case, I have concluded for the reasons, which I hope I have made sufficiently clear, that these appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nKerwin J.\u2014The Local Judge in Admiralty found that the Benmaple and Lafayette were to blame in the proportions of seventy-five and twenty-five per cent. In view of his findings and the alteration of the logs of the Lafayette, I am not prepared to disagree with his conclusion. I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial. The appellants are entitled to their costs of the appeals in the Exchequer Court of Canada and to their costs of the appeals to this Court.\nHudson J.\u2014The only questions open for decision by this Court are whether or not the Lafayette was in part at fault causing the collision of the two ships and, if so, in what degree. Both of these are questions of fact. The trial was lengthy, many witnesses were heard and the evidence was conflicting. The case was tried by a very able and experienced judge who found that the Lafayette was responsible to the extent of 25%. While one may differ from the learned trial judge in some respects, a perusal of the evidence has not convinced me that he was wrong in his conclusions. Therefore, with all respect to the learned judge in appeal, I would restore the judgment at the trial with costs of the appeal to this Court and of the appeal heard before Mr. Justice Angers in the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nAppeals allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Meredith, Holden, Reward & Holden.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Beauregard, Phillimore & St. Germmn.\n[1] [1939] Ex.

Act, 1867, ss. 91(18), 92(18) (14)\u2014 Conflict between Dominion and Provincial legislation\u2014Dominion legislation paramount. The Debt Adjustment Act, Alberta, 1937, c. 9, by s. 8 enacted that \"no action or suit for the recovery of any money which is recoverable as a liquidated demand or debt in respect of any claim enforcible by virtue of any rule of law or equity or by virtue of any statute * * * shall be taken * * * by any person whomsoever against a resident debtor in any case\" unless the Board constituted by the Act and appointed by the Provincial Government issues a permit consenting thereto.\nIn an action brought without a permit in the Supreme Court of Alberta against a resident debtor upon a promissory note, it was held that a defence pleading said Act could not prevail; that said s. 8 of the Act, in so far as it affects a right of action on a promissory note, is ultra vires the Provincial Legislature. (Judgment of the Appellate Division, Alta., [1940] 2 W.W.R. 437, affirming judgment of Ewing J., [1940] 1 W.W.R. 35, affirmed in the result). Per the Chief Justice and Kerwin J.: In so far as said legislation extends to actions upon bills of exchange and promissory notes, it is plainly repugnant to the enactments in ss. 74, 134, 135 and 136 of the Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 16 (which, or substantially the same, enactments have been in the Act since 1890), which, read together, affirm the unqualified right of the holder of a note to sue upon it in his own name and to recover judgment from any party liable on it; and which enactments are necessarily incidental to the exercise of the powers conferred upon the Dominion Parliament by s. 91 (18) of the B.N.A. Act. On the passing of the Bills of Exchange Act the jurisdiction of a province, if it ever possessed any, to enact such legislation as s. 8 of said Debt Adjustment Act (in so far as it extended to actions upon bills and notes) was superseded because it could not be enforced without coming into conflict with the paramount law of Canada. It would not make any difference if said s. 8 were expressed in the form of limiting the jurisdiction of the courts of Alberta. In pith and substance such an enactment, if operative, imposes a condition upon suitors to whom it applies governing them in the exercise of their rights to enforce causes of action vested in them; and, if it contemplates such an action as the present one, it purports to qualify rights in respect of which the Parliament of Canada has legislative jurisdiction in virtue of s. 91 (18) of the B.N.A. Act, and has exercised that jurisdiction by affirming them unconditionally. (Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion, [1896] A.C. 348, at 359, 365, 366, and Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion, [1894] A.C. 189, at 200-201, cited).\nPer Rinfret J.: The prohibition in said s. 8 of the Provincial Act goes to the right to sue\u2014a substantive right; it is not a matter of mere procedure. Under said Bills of Exchange Act (ss. 74, 134, 135), the holder of a note has the right to sue thereon in his own name and to enforce payment against all parties liable. That right is enforcible by action in the provincial courts (Board v. Board, [1919] A.C. 956, at 962; also said provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act shew that Parliament intended the right to be enforcible by an action in court\u2014the only method open to enforce payment and recover). With respect to matters coming within the enumerated heads of s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act, the Parliament of Canada may give jurisdiction to provincial courts and regulate proceedings in such courts to the fullest extent (Valin v. Langlois, 3 Can. S.C.R. 1, at 15, 22, 26, 53, 67, 76, 77, 89, and 5 App. Cas. 115, at 117-118; Cushing v. Dupuy, 5 App. Cas. 409, at 415). Said provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act relate directly to the matter of head 18 in s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act; and therefore defendants' contention, that the provincial legislation was not necessarily incidental to legislation with respect to bills and notes and therefore the Dominion legislation could not encroach on provincial powers to make laws in regard to matters under heads 13 and 14 of s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act, could not prevail (Tennant v. Union Bank of Canada, [1894] A.C. 31; Cushing v. Dupuy, 5 App. Cas. 409; Proprietary Articles Trade Assn. v. Attorney-General for Canada, [1931] A.C. 310, at 326-327). The right to sue or to enforce payment or to recover on a bill or note is of the very essence of bills of exchange; it is one of the essential characteristics of a bill or note; the matter falls within the strict limits of s. 91 (18) of the B.N.A. Act; it flows from the provisions establishing negotiability, which has become the primary quality of a bill or note and in which consist the true character and nature of these instruments; the provisions relating to the right to sue, to enforce payment and to recover before the courts are not incidental; they are the very pith and substance of the statute. The Dominion legislation is valid; the Alberta legislation, in so far as it applies against the institution of an action on a promisorry note, is in direct conflict with it, is overridden by it, and is ultra vires on the ground that it attempts 'to take away from the Alberta courts a jurisdiction conferred on them by the Parliament of Canada with respect to a matter within the exclusive legislative authority of that Parliament; and to that extent it must be held inoperative (John Deere Plow Company v. Wharton, [1915] A.C. 330; Board of Trustees of the Lethbridge Northern Irrigation District v. Independent Order of Foresters, [1940] A.C. 513). Whatever jurisdiction there may have been in the province on the subject has been superseded by the Dominion legislation (Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion et al., [1896] A.C. 348, at 369, 370).\nCrocket J., while not acceding to the contention that the rights conferred by ss. 74, 134 and 135 of the Bills of Exchange Act upon holders of bills and notes to sue, enforce payment and recover thereon in provincial courts, are not subject to provincial legislation relating to the jurisdiction of provincial courts and to procedure in civil matters therein, was not prepared to hold that the prohibitory enactment of said s. 8(1) of the Alberta statute does not conflict with said Dominion legislation; and he held that if there is conflict, then the Dominion legislation, strictly relating, as it does, to bills of exchange and promissory notes as one of the classes of subjects specially enumerated in s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act, in the sense of being necessarily incidental thereto, prevails over the provincial legislation.\nPer Davis J.: The Alberta enactment is one of general application, not aimed at, nor legislation in relation to, bills of exchange or promissory notes. Sec. 74 of the Bills of Exchange Act deals only with the rights acquired by negotiation, and the words \"the holder of a bill\" \"may sue on the bill in his own name\" mean only that he is not liable to be defeated in an action on the bill on the ground that the action has been brought by the wrong party (reference to Sutters v. Briggs, [1922] A.C. 1, at 15). The Dominion statute is not in any way dealing with access to any court. But the Alberta enactment is ultra vires the province. Where legislative power is divided, as in Canada, between a central Parliament and local legislative bodies and the administration of justice in the provinces, including the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts, is given over to the provinces (with the appointment of the judges in the Dominion), a province cannot validly pass legislation, at least in relation to subject-matter within the exclusive competency of the Dominion, which puts into the hands of a local administrative agency the right to say whether or not any person can have access to the ordinary courts of the province. The Debt Adjustment Board of Alberta is an administrative body and is not validly constituted to receive what is in fact judicial authority (Toronto v. York, [1938] A.C. 415, at 427).\nPer Hudson and Taschereau JJ.: The Alberta enactment does not purport to amend or limit the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Alberta, but to place in the hands of a provincial body the right to say whether or not certain classes of rights, some of which may arise under the laws of Canada, may be established or enforced through the courts. In s. 92 (14) of the B.N.A. Act, which gives to the province the exclusive right to make laws in relation to \"the administration of justice in the Province,\" etc., the expression \"administration of justice,\" read in connection with the whole Act, must be taken to mean the administration of justice according to the laws of Canada or the laws of the province, as the case may be. Normally the administration of justice should be carried on through the established courts, and the Province, though it has been allotted power to legislate in relation to the administration of justice and the right to constitute courts, cannot substitute for the established courts any other tribunal to exercise judicial functions (Toronto v. York, [1938] A.C. 415). There may be administration of law outside of the courts short of empowering provincial officers to perform judicial functions, but in respect of matters falling within the Dominion field a province could not do anything which would destroy or impair rights arising under the laws of Canada. The Dominion has power to impose duties upon courts established by the provinces, in furtherance of the laws of Canada, and a province could not interfere with nor take away the jurisdiction thus conferred (Valin v. Langlois, 5 App. Cas. 115; Cushing v. Dupuy, 5 App. Cas. 409). Sec. 74 of the Bills of Exchange Act expressly recognizes a right of action on a promissory note. That right of action is one governed by the laws of Canada and therefore excluded from the provincial legislative field. The Alberta enactment is not properly a law as to procedure in courts; it provides for extra-judicial procedure. A province cannot impose extrajudicial control over rights of action under the laws of Canada.\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] affirming the judgment of Ewing J.[2].\nThe plaintiff sued to recover upon a promissory note made by the defendant Winstanley. The defendant pleaded the Debt Adjustment Act, c. 9 of the Statutes of Alberta of 1937 and amendments, and said that the plaintiff had not been granted a permit under the said Act to commence the action. Ewing J. held that there was direct conflict between the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 16, and the provisions of the said Debt Adjustment Act as applied to promissory notes; and that the Dominion legislation must prevail; and that the plaintiff should be permitted to proceed with its action without a permit. The formal judgment adjudged and declared that the said Debt Adjustment Act, \"in so far as the same affects Promissory Notes, is ultra vires the powers of the Provincial Legislature\" and \"that the plain- tiff has the right to proceed with this action without a permit of the Debt Adjustment Board\". The judgment of Ewing J. was affirmed by the Appellate Division.\nThe facts, pleadings and legislation involved are more particularly set out in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported.\nThe plaintiff, upon its reply to the statement of defence, gave notice to the Attorney-General for Alberta, who was represented on the trial of the action and on the appeal to the Appellate Division (which court had, previously to the hearing of the appeal, made an order adding him as a party defendant).\nSpecial leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted to the defendants by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta.\nW. S. Gray K.C. and H. J. Wilson K.C. for the appellants.\nW. H. McLaws K.C. for the respondent.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. for the Attorney-General of Canada.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014On the 9th of May, 1939, the respondent company sued the defendant, Winstanley, upon a promissory note dated the 9th of October, 1935, payable on demand for One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) and interest at the rate of eight per cent., the payee's name on the note being the Revelstoke Sawmill Company which, it was alleged, had endorsed the promissory note to the plaintiff. The defendant, the maker of the note, set up this defence:\u2014\nIn answer to the Plaintiff's Statement of Claim herein, the Defendant pleads the Debt Adjustment Act, being Chapter 9 of the Statutes of Alberta for 1937 and amendments, and says that the Plaintiff has not been granted a permit under the said Act to commence this action.\nIn reply the respondent company alleged, inter alia, as follows:\u2014\n(1) The promissory note referred to in the Statement of Claim was made and taken pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of \"The Bills of Exchange Act\", being Chapter 16 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, and amendments thereto, and the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada has the exclusive power of legislating with respect to promissory notes and bills of exchange, and the rights of the Plaintiff are determined by the provisions of the said \"The Bills of Exchange Act\" and not otherwise.\n(2) The said \"The Bills of Exchange Act\" gives to the Plaintiff an immediate cause of action on the said promissory note against the Defendant, upon default being made in paying the said promissory note when it became due and payable, and the immediate right to sue thereon.\n* * *\n(5) The said Debt Adjustment Act and amendments thereto are ultra vires the Legislature of the Province of Alberta in so far as the provisions of the said Act are applicable to the promissory note referred to in the Statement of Claim and a permit under the said Act is not necessary before commencing this action.\nThe pertinent enactment of the Debt Adjustment Act set up in the statement of defence is section 8, which is in these words:\u2014\n8.(1) Unless the Board or any person designated by the Board under the provisions of this Act, issues a permit in writing giving consent thereto,\u2014\n(a) no action or suit for the recovery of any money which is recoverable as a liquidated demand or debt in respect of any claim enforcible by virtue of any rule of law or equity or by virtue of any statute, except money payable in respect of rates and taxes payable pursuant to any statute, and debts owing to a hospital for hospital services;\n* * *\nshall be taken, made or continued by any person whomsoever against a resident debtor in any case.\n* * *\nThe trial Judge and the Court of Appeal for Alberta unanimously held that the defence set up in the pleadings by the appellant, Winstanley, is without legal validity.\nBy The Alberta Act, under which the Province of Alberta came into existence (4 and 5 Edward VII, Chap. 3, sec. 3) it was provided:\u2014\nThe provisions of The British North America Acts, 1867 to 1886, shall apply to the province of Alberta in the same way and to the like extent as they apply to the provinces heretofore comprised in the Dominion, as of the said province of Alberta had been one of the provinces originally united, except in so far as varied by this Act and except such provisions as are in terms made, or by reasonable intendment may be held to be, specially applicable to or only to affect one or more and not the whole of the said provinces.\nBy section 91 of the British North America Act,\u2014\n* * * * it is * * * declared that (notwithstanding anything in this Act) the exclusive Legislative Authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all Matters coming within the Classes of Subjects next hereinafter enumerated; that is to say,\u2014 * * * 18. Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes. * * * * And any Matter coming within any of the Classes of Subjects enumerated in this Section shall not be deemed to come within the Class of Matters of a local or private Nature comprised in the Enumeration of the Classes of Subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nBy Chap. 33, 53 Victoria, the Parliament of Canada, enacted the Bills of Exchange Act, 1890. Sections 38 and 57 were reproduced in the Bills of Exchange Act, Chap. 119, R.S.C., 1906, as section 74, which corresponds textually to section 38 of the parent Act, and as sections 134, 135 and 136 which correspond to section 57, slightly altered in form without change in substance or effect. These enactments of R.S.C. 1906, appear in the revision of 1927 (Chap. 16) without change as to the numbers of the sections or otherwise, and still retain that form.\nThe substantive question in controversy, as I view it, does not lend itself to extended discussion. Sections 74, 134, 135 and 136 of the Bills of Exchange Act, read together, affirm the unqualified right of the holder of a promissory note to sue upon the note in his own name and to recover judgment from any party liable on it damages according to the measure defined by sections 134 and 136. These enactments were in force when the Debt Adjustment Act was passed in 1937. The appellants contend that by section 8 of that Statute a condition is imposed upon this unqualified right of the holder of a promissory note to sue upon it, a condition that he shall first obtain the consent of a Board appointed by the Government of the Province.\nI think it is convenient at this place to reproduce textually the well-known passage in the judgment of Lord Watson in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion[3]; Lord Watson is here, of course, speaking for the Judicial Committee:\u2014\nIt was apparently contemplated by the framers of the Imperial Act of 1867 that the due exercise of the enumerated powers conferred upon the Parliament of Canada by s. 91, might, occasionally and incidentally, involve legislation upon matters which are prima facie committed exclusively to the provincial legislatures by s. 92. In order to provide against that contingency, the concluding part of s. 91 enacts that \"any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\" It was observed by this Board in Citizens' Insurance Co. of Canada v. Parsons[4] that the paragraph just quoted \"applies in its grammatical construction only to No. 16 of s. 92.\" The observation was not material to the question arising in that case, and it does not appear to their Lordships to be strictly accurate. It appears to them that the language of the exception in s. 91 was meant to include and correctly describes all the matters enumerated in the sixteen heads of s. 92, as being, from a provincial point of view, of a local or private nature. It also appears to their Lordships that the exception was not meant to derogate from the legislative authority given to provincial legislatures by these sixteen subsections, save to the extent of enabling the Parliament of Canada to deal with matters local or private in those cases where such legislation is necessarily incidental to the exercise of the powers conferred upon it by the enumerative heads of clause 91. That view was stated and illustrated by Sir Montague Smith in Citizens' Insurance Co. of Canada v. Parsons[5] and in Cushing v. Dupuy[6]; and it has been recognized by this Board in Tennant v. Union Bank of Canada[7] and in Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion[8].\nTheir Lordships observed further at page 365:\u2014\nIn the able and elaborate argument addressed to their Lordships on behalf of the respondents it was practically conceded that a provincial legislature must have power to deal with the restriction of the liquor traffic from a local and provincial point of view, unless it be held that the whole subject of restriction or abolition is exclusively committed to the Parliament of Canada as being within the regulation of trade and commerce. In that case the subject, in so far at least as it had been regulated by Canadian legislation, would, by virtue of the concluding enactment of s. 91, be excepted from the matters committed to provincial legislatures by s. 92.\nAnd again at page 366:\u2014\nIt has been frequently recognized by this Board, and it may now be regarded as settled law, that according to the scheme of the British North America Act the enactments of the Parliament of Canada, in so far as these are within its competency, must override provincial legislation.\nSection 8 of the Debt Adjustment Act, if (as the appellants contend and I agree) it extends to actions upon bills of exchange and promissory notes, is plainly repugnant to the enactments of the Bills of Exchange Act in the sections mentioned above. Nor can I think it susceptible of dispute that the enactments are \"necessarily incidental to the exercise of the powers conferred upon the Dominion Parliament\" by section 91 of the British North America Act in relation to bills of exchange and promissory notes. On the passing of the Bills of Exchange Act of 1890, therefore, the jurisdiction of any province of Canada, if it ever possessed any, to enact such legislation was, to borrow the language of the same judgment (at p. 369), \"superseded\" because it could not be enforced \"without coming into conflict with the paramount law of Canada.\"\nI do not think it would make any difference if section 8 were expressed in the form of limiting the jurisdiction of the courts of Alberta. In pith and substance such an enactment, if operative, imposes, I repeat, a condition upon suitors to whom it applies governing them in the exercise of their rights to enforce causes of actions vested in them; and, if it contemplates such an action as this, it purports to qualify rights in respect of which the Parliament of Canada has legislative jurisdiction in virtue of section 91 (18), and has exercised that jurisdiction by affirming; them unconditionally.\nOnce again, the Dominion Parliament has seen fit \"to deal with\" those rights (to adapt the language of Lord Herschell, L.C., speaking for the Judicial Committee in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion[9] \"as part of a * * * law\" concerning bills of exchange and promissory notes; and the provincial legislatures are consequently \"precluded from interfering with this legislation inasmuch as such interference would affect the * * * law of the Dominion Parliament\" touching that subject.\nThis is the ground upon which, as it appears to me, the defence to the action and (consequently) this appeal, demonstrably fail.\nRINFRET J.\u2014In this case, action was brought by the respondent, Atlas Lumber Company Limited, to recover from the appellant Winstanley the amount due on a promissory note for $1,000 payable on demand, with interest at 8% per annum, said note being dated the 9th of October, 1935.\nIn answer to the respondent's statement of claim, the appellant Winstanley pleaded the Debt Adjustment Act, being chapter 9 of the Statutes of Alberta for 1937 and amendments, and said that the respondent had not been granted a permit under the said Act to commence its action and that, therefore, it could not proceed to judgment thereon. In reply, the respondent invoked the Bills of Exchange Act, being chapter 16 of the Revised Statutes of Canada (1927) and amendments thereto. It alleged that the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada had the exclusive power to legislate with respect to promissory notes and that the rights of the respondent were determined by the provisions of the said Bills of Exchange Act, and not otherwise. That Act gave the plaintiff an immediate cause of action on the promissory note held against the appellant Winstanley, upon default being made in paying the said promissory note when it became due and payable, and the immediate right to sue thereon. The respondent contended that it was not subject to the provisions of the Debt Adjustment Act with respect to the said promissory note and that the right of recourse against Winstanley was not subject to, or conditional upon, the granting of a permit under the said statute.\nThe reply further stated that the respondent had made application under the provisions of the Debt Adjustment Act for a permit to commence proceedings in the trial division of the Supreme Court of Alberta against the appellant Winstanley on the promissory note in question, that he had complied with the provisions of the said Act, but that the officers authorized under the Act in that behalf refused a permit.\nThe respondent further replied that, if it should be contended that the Debt Adjustment Act and amendments was meant to cover a case such as this one, then it was ultra vires the Legislature of Alberta, in so far as the provisions of the said Act were intended to be applicable to the promissory note referred to in the respondent's statement of claim, and a permit under the Debt Adjustment Act was not necessary before commencing the action.\nSimultaneously with the filing of the respondent's reply, notice was served upon the Attorney-General for Alberta that the respondent had, by its reply, pleaded that the Adjustment Act and amendments thereto were ultra vires the Legislature of the Province of Alberta, in so far as it may be contended that the Act applied to an action under a promissory note made and taken in accordance with the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act. Counsel for the Attorney-General appeared and took part in the trial. In the Appellate Division, the Court ordered that he be added as a party in the case and that the style of cause be amended accordingly.\nIn this Court, the Attorney-General of Alberta appeared as appellant, together with Winstanley, the debtor on the promissory note.\nBoth the trial court and the Appellate Division came to the conclusion that, to the extent that the Debt Adjustment Act purported to include within its operation the debt sued upon here, it was ultra vires of the provincial legislature.\nIn the result, the respondent was permitted to proceed with his action without a permit from the Adjustment Board, and the question is whether the concurrent judgments below ought to be confirmed.\nThe material provisions of the Debt Adjustment Act (c. 9 of the Statutes of Alberta, 1937) read in part as follows:\n8.(1) Unless the Board or any person designated by the Board under the provisions of this Act, issues a permit in writing giving consent thereto,\u2014\n(a) no action or suit for the recovery of any money which is recoverable as a liquidated demand or debt in respect of any claim enforcible by virtue of any rule of law or equity or by virtue of any statute, except money payable in respect of rates and taxes payable pursuant to any statute, and debts owing to a hospital for hospital services;\n* * *\nshall be taken, made or continued by any person whomsoever against a resident debtor in any case.\nThe note sued on in this action is not among the exceptions stated in subsec. 1 (a) or any of the other subsections of section 8. In terms, section 8 prohibits an action of the nature of the one brought here by the respondent, except where a permit is issued by a Board appointed and controlled by the Provincial Government under the provisions of the Act. The prohibition goes to the right to sue. It has nothing to do with mere procedure. The right to bring an action is not procedure; it is a substantive right.\nThe Debt Adjustment Board has the power to grant or to refuse permits. It can do so wholly within its discretion. It may refuse a permit indefinitely and is not called upon to give reasons for its decision. In effect, in view of the unlimited powers of the Board, the holder of a promissory note, and more particularly the respondent, may be entirely denied access to His Majesty's courts.\nIt does not diminish the impropriety of the situation that, in the present case, the respondent is a federally incorporated company.\nIt could not be seriously disputed by the appellants herein that the Debt Adjustment Act applied in the premises and was meant to prevent the institution of actions, even in the case of promissory notes. The appellant Winstanley took that ground from the very start and pleaded the Act in his statement of defence. As for the Attorney-General, he intervened in the case at the trial and later was made a party for the very purpose, of which he took full opportunity, of arguing both that the Act applied and that it was well within the powers of the Alberta Legislature.\nThe only point remaining for decision, therefore, is the constitutionality of the legislation now before us.\nOf course, it need only be stated that the Bills of Exchange Act, which gives to the holder of the note its rights and powers, is within the legislative competence of the Parliament of Canada. The subject of \"bills of exchange\" and \"promissory notes\" is specifically mentioned in sub-head 18 of sec. 91 of the B.N.A. Act.\nAmong the rights and powers given to the holder of a promissory note under the Bills of Exchange Act, is the right to \"enforce payment\" of the note and to \"recover\" from persons liable thereon by an action, inter alia, in the Supreme Court of Alberta:\nRights and Powers of Holder\n74. The rights and powers of the holder of a bill are as follows:\n(a) He may sue on the bill in his own name;\n(b) Where he is a holder in due course he * * * may enforce payment against all parties liable on the bill;\n* * *\n134. Where a bill is dishonoured, the measure of damages which shall be deemed to be liquidated damages shall be,\n(a) the amount of the bill;\n(b) interest thereon * * *;\n(c) the expenses of noting and protest.\n135. In the case of the dishonour of a bill the holder may recover from any party liable on the bill * * * the damages aforesaid. The effect of the above sections is that the holder of a bill or note has the right to sue on the bill or note in his own name, to enforce payment against all parties liable; and, in case of a dishonour of the bill or note, he may recover from any party liable under the bill both the amount of the bill with interest and the expense of noting the protest, of which it is stated that they \"shall be deemed to be liquidated damages.\"\nThese rights and powers are enforceable by action in the provincial courts (Board v. Board[10]):\nIf the right exists, the presumption is that there is a court which can enforce it, for if no other mode of enforcing it is prescribed, that alone is sufficient to give jurisdiction to the King's Courts of Justice. In order to oust jurisdiction, it is necessary, in the absence of a special law excluding it altogether, to plead that jurisdiction exists in some other Court.\nIn this case, the right is conferred, the Act does not exclude the jurisdiction of the provincial court and there is no other court in which that right could be enforced.\nFurther, the provisions of the Act show that Parliament intended the rights and powers conferred by it to be enforceable by an action in court. The statute expressly provides that the holder of a bill or note may enforce payment, may sue on the bill or note, and may recover from any party liable thereon. Action in the courts is the only method open to enforce payment and recover.\nThe appellants contend that such provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act exceed the powers of the Dominion Parliament, in so far as they provide for procedure in such an action, on the ground that the provincial legislature had the exclusive right to legislate with respect to the administration of civil justice in the province, the constitution of courts and the proceedings in civil matters in those courts.\nThey further contend that the legislation in question is not necessarily incidental to legislation with respect to bills and notes and that, therefore, in legislating on the subject, Parliament could not encroach on the powers of the provincial legislature to make laws in regard to property and civil rights in the province (sub-head 13 of sec. 92 B.N.A. Act) and the administration of justice in the province, including the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts, both of civil and criminal jurisdiction and including procedure in civil matters in those courts (sub-head 14 of sec. 92).\nBut it has long since been decided that, with respect to matters coming within the enumerated heads of sec. 91, the Parliament of Canada may give jurisdiction to provincial courts and regulate proceedings in such courts to the fullest extent.\nThat question was decided by this Court in Valin v. Langlois[11]. An application was made to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for leave to appeal, and Lord Selborne[12] said:\nOn the other hand, the same considerations make it unfit and inexpedient to throw doubt upon a great question of constitutional law in Canada, and upon a decision in the Court of Appeal there, unless their Lordships are satisfied that there is, prima facie, a serious and a substantial question requiring to be determined. Their Lordships are not satisfied in this case that there is any such question, inasmuch as they entertain no doubt that the decisions of the lower Courts were correct.\nSee also Cushing v. Dupuy[13].\nAs for the further contention of the appellants, it ought to be said that, so long as Dominion legislation directly relates to matters enumerated in the heads of sec. 91, no question of the legislation being incidental can be raised (Tennant v. Union Bank of Canada[14]; Cushing v. Dupuy[15]).\nI would like to quote the following passage from Lord Atkin, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. Attorney-General for Canada[16]:\nIf then the legislation in question is authorized under one or other of the heads specifically enumerated in s. 91, it is not to the purpose to say that it affects property and civil rights in the Provinces. Most of the specific subjects in s. 91 do affect property and civil rights, but so far as the legislation of Parliament in pith and substance is operating within the enumerated powers, there is constitutional authority to interfere with property and civil rights. The same principle would apply to s. 92, head 14, \"the administration of justice in the Province,\" even if the legislation did, as in the present case it does not, in any way interfere with the administration of justice. Nor is there any ground for suggesting that the Dominion may not employ its own executive officers for the purpose of carrying out legislation which is within its constitutional authority, as it does regularly in the case of revenue officials and other matters which need not be enumerated.\nAnd in this case it should be pointed out that the right to sue, or to enforce payment, or to recover on a bill or note is of the very essence of bills of exchange; it is one of the essential characteristics of a bill or of a promissory note. The matter falls within the strict limits of subhead 18 of sec. 91. It flows from the provisions establishing negotiability, which has become the primary quality of a bill or note and in which consist the true character and nature of these instruments.\nThe provisions relating to the right to sue, to enforce payment and to recover before the courts are not incidental provisions; they are, in truth, the very pith and substance of the statute.\nIf that be so, there is no question but that the Alberta Debt Adjustment Act providing, as it does, that no action or suit \"shall be taken, made or continued\" to enforce payment of a debt\u2014including debts evidenced by bills of exchange or promissory notes\u2014is in direct conflict with valid Dominion legislation.\nThe Boara created under the Provincial Act, as we have seen, has an absolute discretion to say whether or not the particular holder of a bill of exchange or of a promissory note will have the right and power to enforce payment by action or suit. The effect is to destroy the value of the negotiability of the bill or note and to deprive the holder of a bill or note of the right and power to sue and enforce payment and recover, which are conferred upon him by the Bills of Exchange Act.\nThe consequence is that the Alberta Act, being in direct conflict with the above two provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act, are overridden by the latter; and that, in so far as the Alberta Act may be interpreted as applying to this action, it is ultra vires of the Alberta Legislature, on the ground that it attempts to take away from the Alberta courts a jurisdiction conferred upon such courts by the Parliament of Canada with respect to a matter within the exclusive legislative authority of that Parliament. To that extent, the provisions of the Alberta Adjustment Act must be held inoperative (John Deere Plow Company v. Wharton[17]; Board of Trustees of the Lethbridge Northern Irrigation District v. Independent Order of Foresters[18]). Whatever jurisdiction there may have been in the province on the subject has been superseded by the Dominion legislation (Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion and The Distillers and Brewers' Association of Ontario[19]).\nFor these reasons, it must be held that the judgment a quo is right and the appeal ought to be dismissed with costs.\nCROCKET J.\u2014While I cannot at all accede to the respondent's contention that the rights conferred by ss. 74, 134 and 135 of the Bills of Exchange Act upon holders of bills of exchange and promissory notes to sue, enforce payment and recover thereon in provincial courts, are not subject to provincial legislation relating to the jurisdiction of provincial courts and to procedure in civil matters therein, I am not prepared to hold that s. 8(1) of the Alberta Debt Adjustment Act does not conflict with the Dominion enactment in prohibiting all actions \"for the recovery of any money which is recoverable as a liquidated demand or debt,\" etc., without the consent of a Board constituted by the Provincial Government.\nIf the two enactments do conflict, as both courts below have adjudged, then the Dominion legislation, strictly relating, as it does, to Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes as one of the classes of subjects specially enumerated in s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act, in the sense of being necessarily incidental thereto, unquestionably prevails over the provincial.\nI agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIS J.\u2014The provincial legislation in question, The Debt Adjustment Act, 1987, of Alberta, is not aimed at bills of exchange or promissory notes; nor is it legislation in relation to bills of exchange or promissory notes. It is a statute of general application whereby no action or suit for the recovery of any money which is recoverable as a liquidated demand or debt in respect of any claim enforceable by virtue of any rule of law or equity or by virtue of any statute (except money payable in respect of rates and taxes payable pursuant to any statute, and debts owing to a hospital for hospital services); and no proceedings by way of execution, attachment or garnishment; and no action or proceeding for the sale under or foreclosure of a mortgage on land, or for cancellation, rescission or specific performance of an agreement for sale of land or for recovery of possession of land, whether in court or otherwise; and other specified proceedings for seizure or distress; and \"no action respecting such other class of legal or other proceedings as may be brought within the provisions\" of the statute \"by order of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council\" shall be taken, made or continued in the courts of the province by any person whomsoever against a resident debtor (a person who is a debtor and who is an actual resident of and personally living in Alberta) without a permit in writing giving consent thereto issued by the Debt Adjustment Board constituted by the province pursuant to the statute. The statute further provides that such consent whenever given shall relate back to anything done in the action or other proceedings in respect of which the permit is given. The statute does not apply to any contract made or entered into by a debtor where the whole of the original consideration for the contract arose on or after the 1st day of July, 1936, but does apply to any agreement, contract, stipulation, covenant or arrangement made since that date which purports to substitute a new indebtedness in the place of any indebtedness created or arising before the 1st day of July, 1936, or to any guarantee whensoever made for the payment of any debt payable in respect of any contract, the whole of the original consideration for which arose before the 1st of July, 1936.\nThe principal submission of the Attorney-General of Canada and of the respondent (plaintiff) was that the statute is in conflict with the Dominion legislation under the Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C.; 1927, ch. 16. Particular emphasis was put upon sec. 74 of that statute, which provides that the holder of a bill may sue on the bill in his own name. It is contended that the provincial legislation is in conflict and therefore invalid or inoperative in so far as it affects bills of exchange or promissory notes. A holder means a payee or endorsee of a bill or note who is in possession of it, or the bearer thereof. But the words \"the holder of a bill may sue on the bill in his own name\" mean only \"not liable to be defeated in an action on the bill on the ground that the action has been brought by the wrong party\" (see the judgment of Lord Birkenhead in Sutters v. Briggs[20]). Section 74 deals only with the rights acquired by negotiation (sec. 60), that is, by transfer according to the form required by the law merchant. Falconbridge on Banking, 5th ed., 1935, pp. 698-99.\nI do not think that the Dominion statute is in any way dealing with access to any court, general or particular, provincial or Dominion. The original statute, the Bills of Exchange Act, 1890, was a re-enactment (with only some slight modifications with which we are not concerned) of the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882, as enacted by the Imperial Parliament. Our present section 74 is the original sec. 38 of the Imperial statute. The argument before us was directed to the contention that the Dominion statute expressly gave access to the courts and that the provincial legislation closed the door of the particular court in which this action was instituted, that is, the Supreme Court of Alberta, and that was a conflict, and the Dominion legislation prevailed. But, as I have said, I do not think the Dominion statute was in any way dealing with courts as such, either general or particular.\nSection 92 (14) of the British North America Act gave the legislatures of the provinces exclusive jurisdiction in relation to \"the administration of justice in the province, including the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts, both of civil and of criminal jurisdiction, and including procedure in civil matters in those courts.\" It is of vital importance to the integrity of our system of constitutional government that full recognition be given to the rights of the provinces in the exercise of their powers by their elected legislative bodies. If they have legislative competency in relation to the matters dealt with, then that any particular enactment may appear to us to be inadvisable or unjust has nothing whatever to do with its validity.\nIf the constitution of the civil courts by a province and the provincial legislation governing the administration of justice in a province is not adequate at any time in the view of the Parliament of Canada for the purposes of those specific matters which are within the exclusive legislative competency of the Dominion, the Parliament of Canada may itself establish additional courts, as it did in the Exchequer Court of Canada which has original as well as appellate jurisdiction, or designate any existing provincial courts, as was done in sec. 63 of the Dominion Bankruptcy Act, 1919, ch. 36, now sec. 152 of R.S.C., 1927, ch. 11 (pursuant to the power vested in the Dominion by sec. 101 of the British North America Act) \"for the better administration of the laws of Canada,\" i.e., laws passed by the Dominion Parliament (Consolidated Distilleries Ld. v. The King[21]).\nBut I am prepared to hold for the purposes of this action (both the Attorney-General of Canada and the Attorney-General of the province having been represented before us) that the provincial legislation relied upon as a defence to the action is ultra vires the province. Where legislative power is divided, as in Canada, between a central Parliament and local legislative bodies and the administration of justice in the provinces, including the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts, is given over to the provinces (with the appointment of the Judges in the Dominion), a province cannot, in my opinion, validly pass legislation, at least in relation to subject-matter within the exclusive competency of the Dominion, which puts into the hands of a local administrative agency the right to say whether or not any person can have access to the ordinary courts of the province. The Debt Adjustment Board of Alberta is an administrative body and is not validly constituted to receive what is in fact judicial authority. Toronto v. York[22].\nFor the reasons above stated, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Hudson and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nHUDSON J.\u2014In this action the plaintiff, as holder, claims from the defendant, a resident of Alberta, as maker, the amount of an overdue promissory note made and payable in Alberta. The only defence set up by the defendant is the Debt Adjustment Act, being chapter 9 of the Statutes of Alberta of 1937 and amendments, and that the plaintiff has not been granted a permit under the said Act to commence the action. In reply it was claimed that this Act was ultra vires of the Province.\nThe Attorney-General of Alberta intervened to support the defence.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Ewing, who gave judgment:(1) declaring that the Debt Adjustment Act of Alberta, 1937, in so far as the same affects promissory notes, is ultra vires the powers of the Provincial Legislature;(2) that the plaintiff has the right to proceed with this action without a permit of the Debt Adjustment Board.\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeal in a unanimous judgment confirmed the decision of Mr. Justice Ewing.\nThe Debt Adjustment Act of 1937, as amended, constituted a Board to be known as the Debt Adjustment Board, the member or members to be named by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\nSection 4 empowers the Board to nominate agents who, with the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, shall have power to grant or refuse permits under the Act.\nSection 6 empowers the Board to make inquiries with regard to the property of a resident debtor and the disposition made by him of the property, and may examine under oath certain persons and others.\nSection 7 constitutes the Board a body politic and corporate and provides that any member of the Board is empowered to act for and on behalf of the Board.\nSection 8, which is the important section, in part is as follows:\n8.(1) Unless the Board or any person designated by the Board under the provisions of this Act, issues a permit in writing giving consent thereto,\u2014\n(a) no action or suit for the recovery, of any money which is recoverable as a liquidated demand or debt in respect of any claim enforcible by virtue of any rule of law or equity or by virtue of any statute, except money payable in respect of rates and taxes payable pursuant to any statute, and debts owing to a hospital for hospital services;\n* * *\n(g) no action respecting such other class of legal or other proceedings as may be brought within the provisions of this section by order of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council,\u2014 shall be taken, made or continued by any person whomsoever against a resident debtor in any case.\nSubsection 3 limits the application of the section to debts where the original consideration arose prior to the 1st of July, 1936.\nSubsection 5 provides that the Board may at any time in its discretion cancel or suspend any permit which has been previously issued under this section by the Board.\nSection 10 provides that where a creditor asks for a permit, the Board shall proceed to make such inquiries as it may deem proper, and thereupon may issue a permit or refuse or adjourn the application, and may give directions to the resident debtor as to the conduct of his affairs.\nSection 23 provides that in case any person makes wilful default in complying with any order, direction or condition of the Board, or wilfully takes or continues any action or proceeding, or makes or continues any seizure, etc., in contravention of the provisions of this Act, or makes default in complying with any direction of the Board under the provisions of this Act, then he shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine, and, in default, to imprisonment.\nSection 26 indemnifies the Board and its members from liability for any act done under the Act.\nSection 27 provides that every action, order or decision of the Board as to any matter or thing in respect of which any power, authority or discretion is conferred on the Board shall be final and shall not be questioned, reviewed or restrained by injunction, prohibition or mandamus or other process or proceeding in any court, or be removed by certiorari or otherwise in any court.\nIt is further provided that the provisions of this Act shall not be so construed as to authorize the doing of any act or thing which is not within the legislative competence of the Legislative Assembly.\nThis Act, if valid, effectually bars access to the established courts of justice in respect of a large class of rights arising under the laws of Canada as well as the laws of Alberta, unless a nominee of the Provincial Executive of his or its own free will, ungoverned by any law, chooses to give consent.\nThe right of the Province to pass such a law, in so far as it affects a promissory note made and payable in Alberta, is directly challenged in this action. The British North America Act, sec. 91, subsection 18, particularly enumerates as a class of subjects falling exclusively within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada: \"18. Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes,\" and under the authority of this heading the Parliament of Canada passed the Bills of Exchange Act. In the court below, reference was made to section 74, which provides:\nThe rights and powers of the holder of a bill are as follows:\n(a) He may sue on the bill in his own name;\n(b) Where he is a holder in due course, he holds the bill free from any defect of title of prior parties, as well as from mere personal defences available to prior parties among themselves, and may enforce payment against all parties liable on the bill.\nThis section expressly recognizes a right of action on a note such as is here in question.\nThe action was entered in the Supreme Court of Alberta. This court was constituted by statute of the Province of Alberta and given civil and criminal jurisdiction similar to that exercised by superior courts in England and, in addition, was expressly given the jurisdiction up until then exercised by the former Supreme Court of the North West Territories. This latter court was a Dominion court created by the statutes of the Parliament of Canada and maintained and organized under Dominion authority. The express grant of this jurisdiction merely emphasizes in the case of Alberta what has always been recognized since Confederation, that a provincial court has jurisdiction to entertain actions founded on the laws of Canada as well as on the laws of the Province.\nUpon the constitution of this court by the Province, qualified judges were appointed by the Dominion, as provided for in section 96 of the British North America Act, and thus the court was enabled to function as contemplated by the statute.\nThere can be no doubt that it had jurisdiction and that it was its duty to entertain this action, unless that right ; had been taken away by competent authority.\nThe Debt Adjustment Act, which is set up as a defence, does not purport to amend or limit the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. What it does is to place in the hands of a provincial body the right to say whether or not certain classes of rights may be established or enforced through the courts. The contention of the Attorney-General and of the defendant in support of this statute is based primarily on sub-head 14 of section 92 of the British North America Act, which reads as follows:\n92. In each Province the Legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to * * *\n(14) The administration of justice in the Province, including the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts, both of civil and of criminal jurisdiction, and including procedure in civil matters in those courts;.\nThe expression \"administration of justice\" taken by itself is most comprehensive, but it must be read as part of the British North America Act; otherwise, it would enable the Legislature to make and enforce laws within the field allotted exclusively to the Dominion Parliament. The expression must mean, the administration of justice according to the laws of Canada or the laws of the Province, as the case may be.\nNormally, the administration of justice should be carried on through the established courts, and the Province, although it has been allotted power to legislate in relation to the administration of justice and the right to constitute courts, cannot substitute for the established courts any other tribunal to exercise judicial functions: see Toronto v. York[23].\nThere may be administration of law outside of the courts short of empowering provincial officers to perform judicial functions, but in respect of matters falling within the Dominion field a province would certainly not be justified in doing anything which would destroy or impair rights arising under the laws of Canada.\nThe province is given the power to constitute courts, and this would imply a power to define, limit, or enlarge the jurisdiction of those courts, at least in so far as the laws of the province may be involved.\nThe Dominion Parliament has power to impose duties upon courts established by the provinces in furtherance of the laws of Canada, and a province could not interfere with, nor take away, the jurisdiction thus conferred: see Valin v. Langlois[24]; Cushing v. Dupuy[25]. In the present case, as already pointed out, the Province has not directly altered the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Alberta. It has set up a commission without whose approval all courts are forbidden to act within a prescribed field.\nUnder section 92 (14) a Provincial Legislature has power to legislate in respect of procedure in the courts in respect of matters exclusively allocated to the provinces under other headings of section 92, and no doubt to regulate procedure in those courts in respect of enforcement of the laws of Canada where Parliament has not otherwise provided and where the result is not in conflict with the laws of Canada.\nIt is said that a right of action on a promissory note is a \"civil right\" within the meaning of section 92 (13), but it is a civil right governed by the laws of Canada and, for that reason, excluded from the provincial legislative field.\nHowever, the Debt Adjustment Act is not properly a law as to procedure in courts. It provides for extrajudicial procedure.\nWe are not concerned here with the law of executions, exemptions from seizure or property rights and it is neither necessary nor advisable to discuss the validity of the Debt Adjustment Act, in so far as it affects matters not now directly in issue in this action.\nThe real question here appears to be this: Can a province impose extra-judicial control over rights of action arising under the laws of Canada? To answer this in the affirmative would, in my opinion, conflict with the distribution of legislative power contemplated by the Constitution.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1940] 2 W.W.R. 437; [1940] 3 D.L.R. 648.\n[2] [1940] 1 W.W.R. 35; [1940] 3 D.L.R. 648 (at 649-656).\n[3] [1896] A.C. 348, at 359.\n[4] (1881) 7 App. Cas. 96, at 108.\n[5] (1881) 7 App. Cas. 96, at 108, 109.\n[6] (1880) 5 App. Cas. 409, at 415.\n[7] [1894] A.C. 31, at 46.\n[8] [1894] A.C. 189, at 200.\n[9] [1894] A.C. 189, at 200 and 201.\n[10] [1919] A.C. 956, at 962.\n[11] (1879) 3 Can.
