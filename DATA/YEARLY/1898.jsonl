B. 65) affirmed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) reversing the decision of the Court of Review ([2]) and restoring the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, ([3]) by which the plaintiff's action had been dismissed with costs.\nThe plaintiff brought his action for damages against the officers of a workingmens union, known as \"l'Union Ouvri\u00e8re des Tailleurs de Pierre,\u201d alleging that these persons and the members of the Union had illegally combined and conspired together to injure the plaintiff and had maintained in existence a permanent plot against him in the form of an association amongst tradesmen in the City of Montreal following the same trade as himself, and thereby had completely deprived him of the free exercise of his trade and pre-vented him from obtaining employment as a stone cutter, and thus reduced him to misery and rendered it difficult and almost impossible for him to provide for the wants of his family. The declaration set up three incidents in support of the plaintiff's claim as follows:\u2014First, that the defendants caused strikes at a stone-yard on account, of plaintiff\u2019s employment, which however had been successfully resisted and plaintiff's employment there continued for some time: Secondly, that afterwards when he had established a stone-yard of his own where the work was done by non-union workmen the defendants approached his workmen with a request that they should raise their rate of wages, and being refused, they and their union illegally combined to make the sale of stone by him unprofitable, and brought about such a reduction, or \"cut\" in the prices of building stone that he was obliged to close his stone-yard and abandon the business; and Thirdly, that on a later occasion, when he had obtained employment in Perrault & Riopel's stone-yard, the union men employed there on being told that he belonged to an opposition union left work \" without saying a word \" or giving any reason; that this \"strike\" was maliciously instigated by the defendants and their union who had posted him as a \"scab\" on account of his having left their union and he was in consequence compelled to quit work there in order to avoid causing loss to his employers, (one of whom was his brother) and that as a result of such combination and conspiracies he was deprived of the means of earning a living at his trade in any stone-yard in Canada or in the United States.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court dismissed the action but on appeal to the Court of Review this decision was reversed and a verdict entered in favour of the plaintiff. The Court of Queen's Bench, however, allowed an appeal from the judgment in Review and restored the first judgment, dismissing the action. From this latter judgment the plaintiff has taken the present appeal.\nLafleur and Lanctot for the appellant cited arts. 1053, 1106 C. C.; 20 Laurent nos. 405 408, 410-412; Joost v.

Il m'est impossible de voir la moindre ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 dans la conduite des intim\u00e9s le 9 novembre, 1892, au chantier Perrault-Riopel. Le maxime \"sic utere tuo ut alienum non l\u00e6das\" que l'appelant invoque est sans doute un principe incontestable, mais il n'est pas moins incontestable que \"qui jure suo utitur newinem l\u00e6dit.\" Or, les intim\u00e9s dans l'occasion en question n'ont fait qu'user d'un droit qu'ils partagent avec leurs concitoyens de toutes classes. Et ce droit, ils pouvaient s'entendre pour l'exercer tous ensemble, tout comme chacun d'eux pouvait le faire seul Je ne vois pas que l'on puisse douter qu'un ouvrier ait le droit de stipuler avec son patron qu'il aura droit de se retirer si un autre tel ou tel, est employ\u00e9; ou qu'un procureur ait le droit de dire \u00e0 son client que si tel on tel lui est adjoint ou continue comme conseil, ii se retirera de la cause; on que les serviteurs d'un h\u00f4tel aient le droit de notifier leur ma\u00eetre qu'ils quitteront \u00e0 la fin de leur terme d'engagement, si une telle on telle classe, des n\u00e8gres, des Chinois ou des Juifs, par exemple, est employ\u00e9e. L'appelant invoque la libert\u00e9 du travail mais il oublie que les intim\u00e9s ne lui doivent rien, ne lui sont obliges \u00e0 rien, et qu\u2019ils ont eux droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 de ne pas travailler sans \u00eatre tenus d'en donner leurs motifs \u00e0. qui que ce soit si leurs patrons ne s'y opposent pas, qu'ils en ait le droit ou non.\nDepuis que j'ai \u00e9crit ces quelques mots le lendemain de l'audition de la cause, mon savant coll\u00e8gue le juge Girouard, a bien voulu me communiquer ses notes. Je suis heureux de voir qu'il en soit aussi venu \u00e0 la conclusion de renvoyer l'appel. Tant qu'\u00e0 la cause d'Allen v. Flood ([12]), il me semble que m\u00eame si la d\u00e9cision de la Chambre des Lords e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 en sens contraire, nous 'avons, dans l'esp\u00e8ce un \u00e9tat de choses si diff\u00e9rent que le r\u00e9sultat n'en aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plus favorable \u00e0 l'appelant. Et pour ma part, mon opinion \u00e9tait bien et d\u00fbment form\u00e9e avant la d\u00e9cision de la Chambre des Lords, comme, je n'ai pas h\u00e9sit\u00e9 de le faire voir \u00e0 l'audition.\nGWYNNE, SEDGEWCKK and KING JJ. agreed that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014Cases involving civil responsibility, especially those affecting personal liberty, whether of trade, labour, speech or the press, are always perplexing; and the present one, which is the result of an alleged illegal and malicious interference of a trade union with the employment of a fellow workman, not a, member, proves no exception to the general rule. Plaintiff's action was dismissed by the Superior Court in Montreal (Davidson J.), but was maintained in Review by Jett\u00e9 and Tellier, JJ., Mathieu, J. dissenting; and in appeal the judgment of the Superior Court was restored by Sir A. Lacoste C.J. W\u00fcrtele and Ouimet, JJ.; contra, Boss\u00e9 and Blanchet, JJ. Thus far, the pretensions of the appellant were upheld by four judges out of a total of nine. A recent decision by the House of Lords in a similar case Allen v. Flood (1) still more strikingly illustrates the glorious uncertainty of the law. The trial before Mr. Justice Kennedy resulted in a verdict for the plaintiffs which was maintained unanimously by the three judges sitting in appeal. The case was taken to the House of Lords, but as there was a diversity of opinion among the noble and learned Lords, seven in number, a re-hearing was ordered, and this time judges of other courses were summoned to be present and tender their advice as assessors, according to an ancient practice. The rehearing' took place before nine Lords and eight assessor judges. The latter gave their opinion in June last, six being' in favour of the plaintiffs, and two against. The decision of the Lords was, however, the other way, and the appeal of the trade union was allowed on the 14th December, 1897, by a majority of six to three. The reporter of the Times Law Reports ([13]). states that probably no precedent exists in which their Lordships have overruled such a preponderance of judicial opinion. Four judges below had unanimously been in favour of the plaintiffs, and thus, on this side, with the six assessor judges and the dissentient minority of the Lords, there were thirteen; and on the other side eight, six Law Lords and two judges. This decision is however, the final expression of the highest tribunal in the British Empire, and must govern the present appeal if the circumstances of the case warrant its application.\nThe facts in the two cases are very similar in many respects, although in some Allen v. Flood ([14]) is much stronger for the non-union men. We dismiss two of the three incidents which at the argument before us and before every court were urged as causes of the action although not set set forth in the declaration; they were rejected unanimously by the three courts, and we entirely concur in their finding. Therefore, the following remarks apply only to the third incident alleged in the declaration which happened on the 9th November 1892 at Perrault and Riopel's stone-yard, in the City of Montreal, and was alone the occasion of a conflict of opinion among the learned judges.\nIn the two cases the contest was between \"union men and fellow workmen (in Allen v. Flood ([15]) two in number, Flood and Taylor, plaintiffs, respondents, and in this case one, the plaintiff, appellant), not members of the union, called s scabs \" on this continent; the members were bound by regulations not to work with outsiders; there was no violence, nor threat of violence; the non union men, in both cases, were working by the day.\nIt has been alleged that Perrault had been engaged for two months but the evidence discloses only a mere hope of employment for that length of time, and not an engagement or contract for any specific term. Clovis Perrault, one of the employers and a brother of the plaintiff, after stating that the latter was engaged by his foreman, Napol\u00e9on Goulet, says;-\nQ. Votre fr\u00e8re avait-il de l\u2019ouvrage pour longtemps chez vous? R. Pour une couple de mois, je pense bien. Q. Combien lui' donniez-vous par jour? R. Il n'y avait pas de prix fix\u00e9s.\nThe foreman, Napol\u00e9on Goulet, who engaged plain tiff, does not mention any contract; he merely states that plaintiff applied for work and got it.\nThe facts in the two cases vary in these important particulars: In Allen v. Flood (1) the non-union men, although employed by the same concern, were not doing the same kind of work; they were shipwrights doing wood-work on a vessel, whereas the union men much larger in number, were doing iron-work on the same vessel. In the present case all the men belonged to the same trade and were employed in the same kind of work that of cutting stone. In Allen v. Flood (1) the union men entertained a strong feeling against the non-union men, on the ground that on a previous occasion they, being shipwrights, had done iron-work for another firm; and hence the element of malice so strongly urged by the plaintiffs. In this case there was no ill feeling whatever, beyond the reasonable regret that plaintiff had left the union to join a rival one, the Progressive. One of the union men, Joseph Homier, who was also the \u201csurveillant\u201d of the union approached him en ami, to use his own words, and asked him whether he intended to return to the union and upon his answer\nque non, qu\u2019il appartenait a une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pour appartenir \u00e0 deux,\nHomier merely replied:\n\u00c7a c'est ton affaire, \u00e7a ne nous regarde page.\nIn Allen v. Flood ([16]), a representative of the union called upon the employers and informed them that, if the shipwrights were continued on the job, the iron-men would leave work or be called out. In this case the union men, numbering twenty or twenty-five, made no communication to the patrons; they merely withdrew in silence without, however, leaving the yard. Plaintiff says that one of them, Charles Latour, used intimidation to Clovis Perrault, and he quotes the following passage of his evidence:\nLatour m'a dit que mon fr\u00e8re faisait bien mal de ne pas rejoindre la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, qu\u2019il s'en repentirait plus tard.\nBut plaintiff has omitted the balance of the sentence: \u201cquand bien m\u00eame il gagnerait son proc\u00e8s; qu'il s'en repentirait.'' These vague words can hardly amount to intimidation; but even if they did, they evidently were not used on the day of the strike for according to plaintiffs own evidence, he had then no proc\u00e8s with the union, or the union men. In Allen v. Flood (1), the non-union men were dismissed at once in consequence of the request of the unionists. In this case the plaintiff was not dismissed; he was even pressed to remain, and told by foreman Goulet, although a member of the union, that other stonecutters would be obtained; but he insisted upon leaving and left at once, of his own free will, remarking to Goulet that he could not alone do the work of his brother.\nThe reasons why we should be guided by the English jurisprudence are plain. In 1872, the Parliament of Canada which has jurisdiction over a matter of this nature, introduced into Canada the Imperial legislation of 1871 legalizing trade unions. The Canada Trade Unions Act ([17]) provides as follows:\nSec. 2. The purposes of any trade union shall not, by reason merely that they are in restraint of trade, be deemed to be unlawful, so as to render any member of such trade union liable to criminal prosecution for conspiracy or otherwise.\nSec. 3. The purposes of any trade union shall not, by reason merely that they are in restraint of trade be unlawful so as to render void or voidable any agreement or trust.\nSec. 22. In this Act, the term T Trade Union \" means such combination, whether temporary or permanent, for regulating the relations between workman and masters or for imposing restrictive conditions on the conduct of any trade or business, as would, if this Act had not been passed, have been deemed to be an unlawful combination by reason of some one or more of its purposes being in restraint of trade\nThe Criminal Code of 1892 has re-affirmed the legality of trade unions. See sections 517, 518, 519 524.\nThese enactments are far from the royal privileges granted in old France to the \u201cCorps et Communaut\u00e9s des Avis et M\u00e9tiers\" which denied all outsiders the right to exercise any trade or occupation, although perhaps the practical results may be the same, if not worse, under the r\u00e9gime of trade unions. The privileged classes existed more or less in New France in so far as they were suitable to the condition of a new settlement ([18]); but they disappeared with the cession of the country to Great Britain in 1763, as being inconsistent with the public rights of British subjects, which, at that time and since, until modified by Parliament, secured to them liberty of trade and commerce, and avoided all contracts, and prohibited combinations in restraint of trade.\nIn France, the revolution put an end to all privileged classes and proclaimed the British principle of freedom of trade and commerce; and in 1810 the Penal Code, arts 414, 415 and 416, were adopted to punish coalitions in restraint of trade and labour. These articles were modified in 1834, 1849, and' again in 1864 but it was not till the year 1884 that trade unions were allowed to exist. This law by its first article repeals article 416 of the Penal Code and enacts:__\nArt. 2. Les syndicats ou associations professionnelles, m\u00eame de plus de vingt personnes, exercant la m\u00eame profession, des m\u00e9tiers similaires ou des professions connexes concourant, \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement de produits d\u00e9termin\u00e9s, pourront se constituer librement sans l'autorisation du gouvernement.\nArt. 7. Tout membre d'un syndicat professionnel peut se retirer a tout instant de l'association nonobstant toute clause contraire, mais sans pr\u00e9judice du droit pour le syndicat de r\u00e9clamer la cotisation pour l'ann\u00e9e courante.\nIt must also be borne in mind that the great principles of the Declaration of Rights of 26th August, 1789, have been emphasized in all the subsequent con situational charters of France and are still in force namely: \"L'\u00e9galit\u00e9 civile des citoyens; la libert\u00e9 de l\u2019industrie\" ([19]). Articles 414 and 415 of the Penal Code are still in force and like sections 523 and 524 of our Criminal Code punish intimidation violence and threats which may be used to prevent any one from working at any trade. If no violence or threat be resorted to, the offenders, whether members of a trade union or not will not be liable to a criminal prosecution; but in France their civil responsibility continues to attach, under the constitutional charters, as recently held by the Cour de Paris ([20]).\nSp\u00e9cialement, le syndicat professionnel qui, par des agissements abusifs, porte atteinte \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 du travail garantie par les lois et \u00e0 l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance des citoyens, commet une faute lourde engageant sa responsabilit\u00e9.\nThe appellant relies upon a recent decision of the Cour de Cassation Joost v. Syndicat de Jallieu ([21]) de cided the 22nd June, 1892, and quoted by the minority judge as an authority in his favour:\u2014\nVu les art. 7 de la loi du 21 mars, 1884, et 1382 C. civ; Attendu que l\u2019art. 7, susvis\u00e9, donne \u00e0 tout membre d'un syndicat professionnel ' le droit absolu de se retirer de l'association, quand bon lui semble; que si, depuis l'abrogation de l'art. 416 C. p\u00e9n., les menaces de gr\u00e9ve adress\u00e9es, sans violence ni man\u0153uvres frauduleuses, par un syndicat \u00e0 un patron, \u00e0 la suite d'un concert entre ses membres sont licites quand elles ont pour objet la d\u00e9fense des int\u00e9r\u00eats professionnels elles ne le sont pas, lorsqu'elles ont pour but d'imposer au patron le renvoi d'un ouvrier, parce qu'il s'est retire de l'association et qu'il refuse d'y rentrer.; que, dans ce cas ii y a une atteinte au droit d'autrui qui si ces menaces sont suivies d'effet, rend le syndicat passible de dom mages-int\u00e9r\u00eats envers l'ouvrier cong\u00e9di\u00e9 * * * ([22])\nThis arr\u00eat has already been severely critised by eminent jurists and the remarks of Mr. Raoul Jay in a foot note (2) to the report of the same case in Sirey shew that the French jurisprudence is yet unsettled. He says:\u2014\nAdmettons que l'ouvrier demandeur ait subi un dommage. L'existence de ce dommage ne peut suffire \u00e0 faire na\u00eetre une action en dommage-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Il faut, pour que l'action soit possible une faute commise par les auteurs du dommage.\nCette faute, on ne la trouve pas dans notre esp\u00e8ce. Les membres du syndicat ne nous paraissent avoir fait qu'un usage licite d'un droit aujourd'hui formellement reconnu aux ouvriers, apr\u00e8s leur avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 longtemps d\u00e9ni\u00e9. Et c'est peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame parce que la v\u00e9ritable reconnaissance du droit de coalition est si r\u00e9cente qu'une partie de la jurisprudence a tant de peine \u00e0 accepter franchement les corollaires logiques du droit nouveau.\nMr. Huc in his Commentaire du Code Civil ([23]) although approving the arr\u00eat under the special circum stances of the case adds that it must be accepted with reserve:--\nMais il ne faudrait pas g\u00e9n\u00e9raliser la solution de la Cour de Cassation car on peut concevoir une semblable menace d'interdit adress\u00e9e \u00e0 un patron dans un int\u00e9r\u00eat professionnel.\nThere is a great deal of force in the argument of Mr. Jay which covers several pages of Sirey, and although I am not prepared to go the whole length of it, I agree with him that the Cour de Cassation has greatly exaggerated the meaning of article 7 of the law of 1884. Whatever may be said for or against this decision it is certain that the British and Canadian statutes vary in many respects from the French laws, and more particularly that article 7 of the law of 1884, upon which it is based, is not to be found in the Imperial or the Canadian statutes, and finally, as observed by Chief Justice Lacoste, there was no threat, coercion or intimidation in this case either to the patrons or the plaintiff; and for these reasons, that decision and others which followed in 1894 1895 and 1896 all reported in Dalloz ([24]) cannot be accepted as safe guides in the interpretation of those statutes.\nThe Imperial Trade Unions Act ([25]) has been in force since 1871 and even before, in 1855, 1858, 1859 and especially 1869, laws had been enacted to remove partly the restrictions and disabilities of the common law against trade coalitions and promote trade unions. The present legislation of Great Britain, rightly or wrongly, for we have nothing to do with the policy of the law, was conquered by degrees by and through the increasing political influence of the workingmen. The English courses have had, therefore, several occasions to consider these statutes, which have been re produced in our Canadian statute book; and finally the House of Lords has pronounced on them not only once but twice in 1897, in Alien v. Flood ([26]), and in 1892 in The Mogul Steamship Go. v. McGregor ([27]), and we have no hesitation in saying that its jurisprudence is binding upon us in a case like the present one.\nIt is contended that these statutes have merely legalized trade unions, and that, as such legal associations, they enjoy no greater rights than individuals, and that in violation of article 1053 of the Civil Code they cannot, with impunity, commit legal wrongs, d\u00e9lits or quasi-d\u00e9lits. Undoubtedly, such is the law; but all the commentators and the French jurisprudence unanimously hold that one who acts within the limits of his rights commits no fault, that is legal fault, and is not liable in damages. A recent writer, Baudry-Lacantinerie, and a high authority not only in France but also in Quebec has summed up the French jurisprudence in these few words:\nTout d\u00e9lit civil et tout quasi-d\u00e9lit engendre \u00e0 la charge de son auteur Pollination d'eu r\u00e9parer les cons\u00e9quences. La r\u00e9paration con siestera dans une somme d'argent, suffisante pour compenser le pr\u00e9 judice cause et dont les tribunaux sont appel\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le montant en cas de contestation. Cette responsabilit\u00e9 est \u00e9dict\u00e9e par l\u2019art. 1382, ainsi concu: \"Tout fait quelconque de l'homme, qui cause \u00e0 autrui un dommage, oblige celui par la faute duquel il est arrive \u00e0 le r\u00e9parer.\" On travestit souvent cet article au palais en disant qu'il oblige chacun \u00e0 r\u00e9parer le pr\u00e9judice dont ii est l'auteur. Ainsi formul\u00e9e, la r\u00e8gle est beaucoup trop g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Ii peut se faire que je cause pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 autrui en usant d'un droit qui m'appartient; devrai-je alors la r\u00e9paration de ce pr\u00e9judice? Certainement non. Ainsi en construisant un mur sur mon terrain qui est libre de toute servitude je bouche la vue que la maison voisine avait sur la compagne; ou bien, en creusant un puits dans ma propri\u00e9t\u00e9, je tombe sur la verne d'eau qui alimente le puits Voisin, et je le taris; je ne devrai aucune indemnit\u00e9 de l'un ou de l'autre chef, parce que je n'ai fait qu'user de mon droit. Neminem l\u00e6dit qui suo jure utitur. Pour qua l'obligation de r\u00e9parer le pr\u00e9judice cause \u00e0 autrui prenne naissance, il faut que l'auteur de ce pr\u00e9judice soit en faute. En un mot, le pr\u00e9judice dont l'art. 1382 oblige \u00e0 fournir la r\u00e9paration, c'est le damnum injuria datum, qui faisait en droit romain l'objet des pr\u00e9visions de la loi Aquilia. Cass., 28 juillet 1887, S\u201e 93, 1. 198, D. 93. 1. 585, et 15 avril 1889, S. 91, 1. 292, D. 90, 1. 136 ([28]).\nWe therefore entirely concur in the following re marks of Chief Justice Lacoste ([29]), speaking for the majority of the Court of Appeal:\nPuisque l'union ouvri\u00e8re des tailleurs de pierre de Montr\u00e9al est une association autoris\u00e9e par la loi, et puisqu'aucun acte ill\u00e9gal n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis par las ouvriers, ii s'en suit qu'il n'y a pas lieu d'appliquer l'art. 1053 C. C. Ii manque un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'action en responsabilit\u00e9, c'est la faute.\nAnd elsewhere, ([30])\nEn outre l'intim\u00e9 confond l'intention malicieuse avec la cons\u00e9quence de l'acte, Les ouvriers pouvaient croire que leur acte aurait pour r\u00e9sultat le d\u00e9part de l\u2019intim\u00e9, mais il ne suit pas de l\u00e0 qua leur intention \u00e9tait de lui nuire. La motif de leur conduite pouvait \u00eatre uniquement d'ob\u00e9ir aux r\u00e8glements et de sauvegarder las int\u00e9r\u00eats de l'union ouvri\u00e8re. Auraient-ils eu, d'ailleurs, l'intention de lui nuire, ce n'est pas tout acte fait avec cette intention qui peut \u00eatre attaqu\u00e9 il faut de plus qu'il soit malicieux, et l'exercise d'un droit implique absence de malice.\nThat is the very argument of the Law Lords in Allen v. Flood ([31]); and it would be a grave mistake to sup pose that art. 1053 of the Civil Code is peculiar to the countries governed by the French or the Roman law; it simply enunciates an elementary maxim of universal or natural law adopted by all civilized nations:\nEvery person capable of discerning right from wrong is responsible for the damage caused by his fault to another, whether by positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of skill Lord Watson said:\nAlthough the rule may be otherwise with regard to crimes, the law of England does not, according to my apprehension, take into account motive as constituting an element of civil wrong. Any invasion of the civil rights of another person is in itself a legal wrong, carrying ' with it liability to repair its necessary or natural consequences, in so far as there are injurious to the person whose right is infringed, whether the motive which prompted it be good bad or indifferent. But the existence of a bad motive in the case of an act which is not in itself illegal, will not convert that act into a civil wrong for which reparation is due. A wrongful act, done knowingly, and with a view to its injurious consequences, may, in the sense of law, be malicious but such malice derives its essential character from the circumstance that the act done constitutes a violation of the law ([32]).\nLord Herschell, at page 118 said:\nIt is to be observed, in the first place, that the company in declining to employ the plaintiffs were violating no contract; they were doing nothing wrongful in the eye of the law. The course which they took was dictated by self interest; they were anxious to avoid the inconvenience to their business which would ensue from a cessation of work on behalf of the ironworkers. It was not contended at the Bar that merely to induce them to take this course would constitute a legal wrong, but it was said to do so because the person inducing them acted maliciously. ([33]) I understood it to be admitted at the Bar, and it was indeed stated by one of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal, that it would have been perfectly lawful for all the iron workers to leave their employment and not to accept a subsequent en gagement to work in the company of the plaintiffs. At all events I cannot doubt that this would have been so. I cannot doubt either that the appellant or the authorities of the union would equally have acted within his or their rights if he or they had \" called the men out.\" They were members of the union. It was for them to deter mine whether they would become so or not, and whether they would follow or not follow the instructions of its authorities, though no doubt if they had refused to obey any instructions which under the rules of the union it was competent for the authorities to give they might have lost the benefits they derived from membership. It is not for your Lordships to express any opinion on the policy of trade unions, membership of which may undoubtedly influence the action of those who have joined them. They are now recognised by law; there are combinations of employers as well as of employed. The members of these unions, of whichever class they are composed, act in the interest of their class. If they resort to unlawful acts they may be indicted or sued. If they do not resort to unlawful acts, they are entitled to further their interests of the manner which seems to them best and most likely to be effectual.\nI now proceed ([34]) to consider on principle the proposition advanced by the respondents, the alleged authorities for which I have been discussing. I do not doubt that every one has a right to pursue his trade or employment without \" molestation \" or o obstruction \" if those terms are used to imply some act in itself wrongful. This is only a branch of a much wider proposition, namely, that every one has a right to do any lawful act he pleases without molestation or obstruction. If it be intended to assert that an act not otherwise wrongful always becomes so if it interfere with another's trade or employment and needs to be excused or \"justified. I say that such a proposition in my opinion has no solid foundation in reason to rest upon. A man's right not to work or not to pursue a particular trade or calling, or to determine when or where or with whom he will work, is in law a right of precisely the same nature and entitled to just the same protection as a man's right to trade or work. 'They are but examples of that wider right of which I have already spoken. That wider right embraces also the right of free speech. A man has a right to say what he pleases, to induce, to advise to exhort, to command, provided he does not slander ordeceive, or commit any other of the wrongs known to the law of which speech maybe the medium Unless he is thus shewn to have abused his right why is he to be called upon to excuse or justify himself because his words may interfere with some one else in his calling? In the course of argument one of your Lordships asked the learned counsel for the respondents whether, if a butler on account of a quarrel with the cook told his master that be would quit his service if the cook remained in it and the master preferring to keep the butler terminated his contract with the cook the latter could maintain an action against the butler. One of the learned judges answers this question without hesitation in the affirmative. As in his opinion the present action would lie, I think he was logical in giving this answer. But why I ask was not the butler in the supposed case entitled to make his continuing in the employment conditional on the cook ceasing to be employed? And if so, why was he not entitled to state the terms on which alone he would remain, and thus give the employer his choice? Suppose after the quarrel each of the servants made the terminating of the contract with the other a condition of remaining in the master's service, and he choose to retain one of them would this choice of his give the one parted with a good cause of action against the other? In my opinion a man cannot be called upon to justify either act or word merely because it interferes with another's trade or calling, any more than he is bound to justify or excuse his act or word under any other circumstances, unless it be shewn to be in its nature wrongful, and thus to require justification.\nWe have been invited to examine the American jurisprudence but, under the circumstances we consider that such an inquiry would be a mere waste of time. The simple perusal of a very recent book published by Mr. Albert Stickney on \" State Control of Trade and Commerce,\" will suffice to convince any one that the American jurisprudence is far from being settled, or that it is satisfactory even to the American Bar and public.\nFor these reasons we are unanimously of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed with costs\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: P.

S. C. c. 135, s. 29 (b)\u201456 V. c. 29 (D)\u2014Established jurisprudence in court appealed from.\nIn an action en declaration de paternit\u00e9 the plaintiff claimed an allowance of $15 per month until the child then a minor aged four years and nine months),should attain the age of ten years and for an allowance of $20 per month thereafter \" until such time as the child should be able to support and provide for himself.\" The court below, following the decision in Lizotte v. Descheneau (6 Legal News, 107), held that under ordinary circumstances, such an allowance would cease at the age of fourteen years.\nHeld that the demande must be understood to be for allowances only up to the time the child should attain the age of fourteen years and no further, so that, apart from the contingent character of the claim the demande was for less than the sum or value of two thousand dollars and consequently the case was not appealable under the provisions of the twenty-ninth section of \" The Supreme and Exchequer Court Acts, \" even if an amount or value of more than two thousand dollars might become involved under certain contingencies as a consequence of the judgment of the court below, Rodier v. Lapierre (21 Can. S. C.

R. 319) followed.\nMOTION to quash an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), which affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, in favour of the plaintiff with costs.\nThe respondent brought the action in her capacity of tutrix to her minor child, born about four years and nine months previously, and prayed that the defendant might be declared to be the father of the child and condemned to pay to her in her said capacity the sum of fifteen dollars per month until the child should attain the age of ten years and thereafter the sum of twenty dollars per month until such time as the child should be able to support and provide for himself.\nThe trial court rendered judgment in favour of the plaintiff and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench which held also that under ordinary circumstances, an allowance such as that demanded would cease upon the child attaining the age of fourteen years.\nA. R. Hall and Smith for the respondent moved to quash the appeal on the grounds that the matter in controversy was not of the amount or value of $2,000 and did not otherwise come within any of the exceptions stated in section twenty-nine of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act as amended. The following cases were cited in support of the motion: Lizotte v. Desch\u00e9neau ([1]); O'Dell v. Gregory ([2]); Rodier v. Lapierre ([3]).\nSt. Pierre Q.C. for the appellant contra. The claim and condemnation are both indefinite and might in volve the maintenance of the child for any number of years in case he proved an invalid or became crippled or otherwise unable \"to support or provide for himself.\" In any reasonable view of the case the demande must be considered as liable to exceed $2,000. The effect of the judgment is to bind future rights of the parties and brings the case within the general terms \"other matters and things \" used in the last clause of section 29 of \"The Supreme and Exchequer Court Act.\"\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This case is before us upon a motion to quash the appeal. The action is one \"en d\u00e9clara\u00b0 tion de paternit\u00e9,\" with conclusions\u2014\nthat the said defendant (now appellant) be declared to be the father of the said minor, and be condemned to pay to the plaintiff es qualit\u00e9 the sum of fifteen dollars a month until the child shall have attained the age of ten years, and the sum of twenty dollars a month thereafter until such time as the said minor may be able to support and provide for himself.\nThe said child was four years and nine months old, less seven days, when the action was served, on the fifth of January, 1897. So that, leaving aside its contingent character, the claim does not amount to $2,000, if, as held by the judgment appealed from, fourteen year is the limit where an allowance of this kind ceases under ordinary circumstances. The claim must be read as if for an allowance up to that age and no further. But even if more than $2,000 might have become involved under certain contingencies, as a consequence of the judgment, it would seem that under Rodier v. Lapierre ([4]), the appeal would not lie. The amount claimed rules, but there is no direct claim for a definite sum of $2,000 or over. The appellant has attempted to rest his right to this appeal upon the amended section 29 of the Supreme Court Act, as to future rights, but under O'Dell v. Gregory ([5]), his contention cannot prevail. See also Raphael v. Maclaren ([6]). Parliament may have intended, by the amending act, to give an appeal in cases like the present one, but has not done so.\nThe motion must be allowed with costs, and the appeal quashed with costs.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St. Pierre, Pelissier & Wilson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Johnson,Hall & Donahue.\n[1] 6 Legal News, 170.\n[2] 24 Can.

S. G. c. 18\u2014Abolition of office\u2014Discretionary power\u2014Jurisdiction.\nEmployees in the Civil Service of Canada who may be retired or removed from office under the provisions of the eleventh section of \"The Civil Service Superannuation Act\" (R. S. C. c. 18), have no absolute right to any superannuation allowance under that section, such allowance being by the terms of the Act entirely in the discretion of the executive authority.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] declaring that the suppliant was not entitled to the relief sought by his petition of right.\nThe appellant was appointed to the Civil Service of Canada on 1st January, 1883, by order of the Governor-General-in-Council, and since that date up to the 26th April, 1897, had been continuously in the employ of the Government of Canada, being a period of over fifteen years. During the last five years of his service, the appellant held office as secretary of the Department of Railways and Canals in Canada, and his average yearly salary, based upon his salary for the last three years of his service was $2,275. All deductions for superannuation, as required by section six of the Civil Service Superannuation Act[2], had been made from time to time from the appellant's salary throughout the whole of his service.\nOn the 26th April, 1897, to promote economy in the public service, the appellant was, by order of the Governor-General-in-Council, retired from the service and placed upon the retired list with an annual allowance of six hundred and eighty-two dollars and fifty cents, the amount to which he would be entitled for fifteen years service at the average salary paid him for the three years preceding his retirement. He claimed the annual sum of $455 in addition to the allowance granted, alleging that the combined amount of these two sums was the compensation he was entitled to under the statute. This claim was based on the contention that ten years should have been added to his term of service, as provided by section eleven of the Act. The appeal was from the judgment of the Exchequer Court declaring that he was not entitled to the relief sought by his petition of right.\nHogg Q.C. for the appellant. The meaning and intention of the whole Superannuation Act is to give to retired civil servants who have performed good and faithful service a fair consideration and compensation for the service given, and by the deductions made from their salaries, to create a fund towards making good the superannuation allowances provided under the statute.\nUnder section nine the retired civil servant has a legal right to full superannuation allowance in case his retirement is based upon the causes therein mentioned, provided the head of the department has not reported against him. The causes for retirement referred to in section; nine are also mentioned in section eleven and the allowance, to which under section nine he would \"be otherwise entitled,\" refers to the full or maximum allowance mentioned in section eleven. The correct interpretation is, that upon retirement of a civil servant for the causes mentioned in these sections, prim\u00e2 facie, the amount of the superannuation grant should be the maximum allowance mentioned in section eleven subject to be reduced or dimished only upon a special adverse report, by the application of the provisions of the ninth section.\nThe appellant was retired to promote economy and comes under section eleven. The maximum compensation in the appellant's case, would be twenty-five-fiftieths of his average salary during his last three years of service, the twenty-five years on which the calculation is based, being made up under section eleven by adding ten years to the fifteen years of his actual service. There can be no reduction upon this estimate unless an adverse report has been made under section nine. The provision in the ninth section as to granting a superannuation allowance less than \"that to which he would have otherwise been entitled,\" shews clearly an intention that when retired under the eleventh section the employee should be entitled to the full or maximum allowance except only upon an adverse report. The statute itself determines the amount of the retiring allowance.\nThe words \"may grant\" should be construed as mandatory, following the custom of Parliament when it is sought to lay an obligation upon the Crown or an officer of the Crown. The ninth section clearly gives discretion, for it differs from the eleventh section, which does not, by the insertion of the words \"as to him seems fit,\" after the word \"may.\" Julius v. Bishop of Oxford[3] at page 225; Hardcastle, Statute Law, 2nd ed. 316; Maxwell, Interpretation of Statutes, 3 ed. [1896,] pp. 334, 350. Reg. v. Bishop of Oxford[4] at page 258; M'Dougall v. Patterson[5]; Crake v. Powel[6]; The Board of Supervisors of Rock Island v. United States[7] at page 446; Attorney General v. Lock[8]; In Re Eyre v. Corporation of Leicester[9]. The Governor-General-in-Council is bound to grant such an allowance as shall actually be a fair compensation. Such compensation will be estimated, if necessary, by the court and, if there is no adverse report, the court will be bound by the statute to grant the maximum amount. Pollock on Contracts (5 ed.), at pages 45 and 46; Roberts v. Smith[10]; Bryant v. Flight[11].\nThe crown can dismiss its servants without compensation only where there is cause for dismissal; or under the Superannuation Act, where an adverse report has been made under section nine, in which case the compensation may be reduced to nothing. Sub-section 2 of section 8 does not confer a right, but only reserves a right already in the Governor-General-in-Council.\nThe Exchequer Court has jurisdiction under sub-section \"d\" of section 16 of the Exchequer Court Act, and should be directed to declare that the Governor-General-in-Council is bound, under the Act cited, to grant and pay such allowance as the court may find to be fair compensation for loss of office, and that a petition of right lies against the Crown under the above-cited sections of the Exchequer Court Act.\nNewcombe Q.C, Deputy Minister of Justice, for the respondent. The appellant was a civil servant appointed under the provisions of \"The Civil Service Act\"[12], on 1st January, 1883, and retired by Order in Council; of 26th April, 1897, in order to promote economy in the public service. By the same Order-in-Council, the appellant was granted an annual allowance of $682.50, under the authority of the Superannuation Act[13].\nThe appointment was during pleasure, and the executive had the undoubted right to dismiss him at any time. Civil Service Act, sec. 10; Shenton v. Smith[14]; Gould v. Stuart[15]; Dunn v. The Queen[16].\nThe appellant had not attained the age of sixty, nor was he incapacitated by bodily infirmity, and he was therefore not qualified for superanuation under section three. Section 11 applies and its provisions are merely enabling and intended to vest a discretion in the Governor-General-in-Council which may be exercised favourably or unfavourably to the officer being retired, in any case.\nNo right accrues until the allowance has been granted by His Excellency in Council. R. S. C. c. 18 s. 8. The courts have no jurisdiction to review the exercise of the discretion vested in His Excellency in Council. Cooper v. The Queen[17]; Kinloch v. The Secretary of State for India[18]; Gidley v. Lord Palmerston[19]; Matton v. The Queen[20]. The jurisdiction of the court in this case, if any, arises under section sixteen of the Exchequer Court Act[21], which is quite inadequate to confer a jurisdiction to review the exercise of discretionary authority.\nIt has not been shown that Her Majesty contracted with the appellant to the effect that he should receive upon retirement a superannuation allowance. TASCHEREAU J.\u2014This appeal must be dismissed There is no room whatever for the appellant's contention that it was a condition of his contract of employment that, in the event of his being superannuated in order to promote economy in the civil service, he was to have a legal right to any allowance whatever. The superannuation allowance that the Governor-General-in-Council may grant in such a case to any person is a gratuity. It is so called in sec. 11 of the \"Civil Service Superannuation Act\"[22], and when the statute enacts that this gratuity which, in the discretion of the executive authority, may be granted, will be such as to fairly compensate the superannuated officer for his loss of office, it leaves it at the sole discretion of the executive to determine what is the amount he is to receive, if any. The members of the civil service of Canada hold their office during pleasure and have no absolute right to any superannuation allowance under that section. They accept office under that condition. The appellant here has been granted a yearly allowance of $682.50, calculated upon fifteen years of service. He contends that he is entitled to have ten years added to his term of service, amounting to $455\u00bb making in all the sum of $1,137.50. His contention cannot be sustained. The courts of the country have no jurisdiction to review the exercise of the discretion vested by the statute in the Governor-General-in-Council.\nThe appeal is dismissed, but the case must be viewed as a test case, and we give no costs.\nGWYNNE J. concurred.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The appellant can succeed only upon showing that the Crown contracted with him, upon his entering the civil service, that he would receive the increased superannuation allowance claimed upon any compulsory retirement therefrom. He relies upon section 11 of the Act, and argues that that section, though in terms enabling only, is in fact imperative and obligatory.\nWe are unable to place this construction upon it, or upon the Act as a whole. Its whole scope and object is to confer authority upon the Government to appropriate public funds in a certain way, but as it expressly states (sec. 8), it does not confer \"any absolute right to superannuation allowance, or impose any statutory obligation on the Crown to grant it.\"\nKING and GIROUARD JJ. also concurred in the dismissal of the appeal for the reasons stated.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: O'Connor, Hogg & Magee.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

By the judgment of the Exchequer Court, the letters patent in question were declared valid and subsisting and to have been infringed by the defendants, and the court by injunction restrained the defendants as prayed during the continuance of the letters patent, and further ordered them forthwith to deliver up to the plaintiffs all lights or incandescent devices and material in their possession, and that accounts should be taken of the gains and profits made by the defendants under the infringement complained of and to pay the same to the plaintiffs when ascertained upon a reference directed to the registrar of that court.\nThe defendants gave notice of appeal against the judgment to the Supreme Court of Canada and the respondents moved to quash on the grounds that there was no actual amount of money in controversy and that no order had been obtained from a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada allowing the appeal to be taken as required by 50 & 51 Vict. ch. 16, sec. 52. On the hearing of the motion affidavits were filed on behalf of both parties in which estimates were made of the amount of gains and profits likely to be ascertained upon the reference as resulting from the infringement adjudged by the Exchequer Court and the value of the lights, devices and material ordered to be delivered up by the judgment appealed from, those filed on behalf of the respondent, stating the amount as under $500, while the appellants showed by their affidavits that the amount thus in controversy would exceed $500.\nDuclos, for the respondent in support of the motion, cited the statutes of Canada, 50 & 51 Vict. ch. 16, secs. 51-53, as amended by 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 26, sec, 8, and referred to the authorities mentioned in Audette, Exchequer Court Practice, pp. 114-116.\nSinclair for the appellant contra. The affidavits filed against the motion should be received as shewing the amount to be over $500 and therefore there is an appeal as of right under the statute[2]. As to establishing value by affidavits in cases such as this, see the remarks of Mr. Justice Strong at page 338 in Joyce v Hart[3]. The Patent Act gives an appeal in every case[4], and in any event there is no necessity of getting a judge's order until after the appeal has been taken.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The judgment appealed from affects a patent of invention. The respondents move to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction, upon the ground that as the actual amount in controversy does not exceed $500, under sections 51 and 52 of the Exchequer Court Act, the appeal could not be taken unless allowed by an order obtained from a judge of this court, which has not been done. The judgment appealed from declares that the appellants have infringed respondents' letters patent, and condemns them to deliver up to the respondents certain articles of an undetermined value, and refers the case to the registrar to take an account of the gains and profits made by the infringement. The respondents filed with their motion to quash, an affidavit that the total amount in controversy in the case is less than $500. The appellants, in answer to that motion, filed two affidavits that the value in controversy exceeds $500. Under these circumstances the motion to quash must be dismissed, but the appellants must pay the costs. The case was not an appealable one, as of right, unless it appeared that the value in controversy exceeded $500. That did not appear until the appellants filed their affidavits in answer to respondents' motion. As the record stood when the motion was made, it was well founded.\nMotion dismissed, with costs against the appellants, taxed at $25.\nMotion refused with costs against the appellants.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Foster, Martin & Girouard.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Atwater, Duclos & Mackie.\n[1] 6 Ex.

That the engineer shall be the sole judge of work and material in respect of both quantity and quality, and his decision on all questions in dispute with regard to work or material, or as to the meaning or intention of this contract, and the plans, specifications, and drawings, shall be final, and no works or extra or additional works or changes shall be deemed to have been executed, nor shall the contractor be entitled to payment for the same, unless the same shall have been execuled to the satisfaction of the engineer, as evidenced by his certificate in writing, which certificate shall be a condition precedent to the right of the contractor to be paid therefor but before the contract was signed by the parties the words \"as to the meaning or intention of this contract, and the plans, specifications and drawings\" were struck out.\n\u201c25. Cash payments to about ninety per cent of the value of the work done, approximately made up from returns of progress measurements and computed at the prices agreed upon or determined under the provisions of the contract, will be made to the contractor monthly on the written certificate of the engineer that the work for, or on account of, which the certificate is granted has been duly executed to his satisfaction, and stating the value of such work computed as above mentioned and upon approval of such certificate by the minister for the time being, and the said certificate and such approval thereof shall be a condition precedent to the right of the contractor to be paid the said ninety per cent or any part thereof. * * * * * * * * * * * *\nA difference of opinion arose between the contractor and the engineers as to the quantity of earth in certain embankments which should be paid for at an increased rate as \"water-tight\" embankment under the provisions of the contract and specifications relating to the works and the claim of the contractor was rejected by the engineer, who afterwards, however, after the matter had been referred to the Minister of Justice by the Minister of Railways and Canals, and an opinion favourable to the contention of the contractor given by the Minister of Justice, made a certificate upon a progressive estimate for the amount thus in dispute in the usual form but added after his signature the following words:\u2014\"Certified as regards item 5, (the item in dispute,) in accordance with letter of Deputy Minister of Justice, dated 15th Jan., 1896.\"\nThe estimate thus certified was forwarded for payment, but the Auditor General refused to issue a cheque therefor.\nHeld that under the circumstances of the case the certificate sufficiently complied with the requirements of the twenty-fifth section of the contract; that the decision by the engineer rejecting the contractor's claim was not a final decision under the eighth clause of the contract adjudicating upon a dispute under said eighth section and did not preclude him from subsequently granting a valid certificate to entitle the contractor to receive payment of his claim, and that the certificate given in this case whereby the engineer adopted the construction placed upon the contract in the legal opinion given by the Minister of Justice, was properly granted within the meaning of the twenty-fifth clause of the contract.\nMurray v. The Queen, 26 Can. S. C. R. 203, discussed and distinguished.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] rendered on the 11th January, 1897, by which the preliminary decision of that court at the time of the trial was set aside and the appellants claim upon the reference made, under the provisions of the Exchequer Court Act[2], by the Minister of Railways and Canals, was refused without costs. The Minister of Railways and Canals under the provisions of the twenty-third section of the Exchequer Court Act, (50 & 51 Vict. c. 16) referred to the Exchequer Court of Canada for adjudication the claim of the appellant arising in respect to work done by him under a contract with the Department of Railways and Canals of Canada on the construction of part of the embankments of the Soulanges Canal. Under this reference the trial took place in the Exchequer Court at Ottawa and on 20th June, 1896, a preliminary judgment was rendered declaring the appellant entitled to recover $58,260 for the work in question, subject to that amount being increased or reduced in accordance with such reference as might be directed upon the application of either party for the purpose of ascertaining, upon the basis of the said judgment, the exact amount to which he might be entitled, and granting the appellant costs of suit. Leave was reserved to the appellant to move to increase the amount to $73,260 the full amount of his claim and to the respondent to move to set aside the judgment or to reduce the amount upon certain principles mentioned in the judgment. Motions on behalf of both parties were afterwards heard with the result that the judgment was set aside as above stated. The present appeal sought to have it declared that the appellant was entitled to be paid the full amount of his claim, or at least, that he was entitled to the amount declared to be due to him by the preliminary judgment rendered at the trial.\nThe chief points at issue in the case were as to the validity of the approval by the Minister of Railways and Canals of a certain certificate or estimate made by the Chief Engineer of the Department of Railways and Canals relating to amounts payable for work done in water-tight embankments, and as to the sufficiency of the certificate itself. The particulars of the case and circumstances under which the certificate in question was made are fully set out in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Sedgewick now reported. The clauses of the contract and specifications in question in the case are also quoted in the judgments reported.\nAt the close of the argument it was understood that, if the court should determine in favour of the Chief Engineer's certificate relied on by the claimant, the appeal should be allowed, and the case be at an end in this court, judgment being directed to be entered for the claimant for the amount claimed, and interest, if the court should so decide, after the parties were heard on the question of interest:\u2014But that if the court should hold that the claimant was not entitled to recover upon the certificate, then that both parties should be heard upon the contentions before the Exchequer Court as to \"alternative relief,\" and that all objections to the jurisdiction of this court and of the Court of Exchequer should then be open to the respondent as if the appeal were being heard for the first time; and in the latter case that no judgment should be entered in this court until after the parties should have been so heard on that second branch of the case.\nOsler Q.C. and Ferguson Q.C for the appellant. The opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Sedgewick at page 212 of the report in Murray v. The Queen[3], is mere dictum and is not a binding decision and, in any case, does not declare that they want of an express statement that the work had been executed to the satisfaction of of the chief engineer would be sufficient to defeat an action on such a certificate as he was discussing in that case. The expression of opinion, in that case, to the effect that the Minister of Railways and Canals must express his approval by counter-signing the certificate, is not well founded nor binding as authority because the point with reference to which it was given was neither argued nor involved in the decision of that case. See Elmes v. Burgh[4]; Roberts v. Watkins[5]; McGreevy v. The Queen[6], at page 401; Kane v. Stone Co,[7].\nThe certificate in this case shows sufficiently that the work was done in accordance with the contract and accepted, and the evidence shows it to have been done satisfactorily. See Hudson on Building Contracts (2 ed.) pp. 294, 299; Harmon v. Scott[8]; Clarke v. Murray[9]; Galbraith v. Chicago Architectural Iron Works[10]; Rousseau v. Poitras[11]; Wykcoff v. Meyers[12], at pages 145, 146; McGreevy v. The Queen (3), at page 405. The question before the court is a legal one as to the construction of the written contract and specifications annexed.\nThe engineer's position will appear on referring to Hudson on Contracts (2 ed.) p. 279, and the following cases. In re Carus Wilson v. Greene[13], at pages 7, 9; Sharpe v. San Paulo Railway Co.[14], at page 609; Ranger v. Great Western Railway Co.[15] at page 115; Farquhar v. City of Hamilton[16].\nIf, in the opinion of the Minister of Railways and Canals, or in that of his legal adviser, the position taken by the appellant with reference to any additional claim or allowance, depending upon a construction of the contract, specifications or plans was well founded, the Chief Engineer was acting in accordance with his duty in certifying as he did in this case. Appellant is entitled to judgment for the $73,260 upon the merits of the dispute, in view of the facts proved\/whether his contention as to the construction of the contract, specifications and plans in regard to his right to payment for earth in water-tight embankments is or is not correct. The formal reference is sufficiently wide in its terms, to include the reference of the claim upon its merits to the Exchequer Court, and the claim was before the Exchequer Court by virtue of that reference. The learned judge of the Exchequer Court had jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the merits, and ought to have adjudicated by his last judgment, in view of his findings, that the appellant was entitled to judgment upon the merits of the claim for the full amount of 173,260.\nThere was error in the deduction, in the judgment of the judge at the trial, provisionally of 100,000 cubic yards for \"mucked material, sand, &c.,\" which ought not, he thought, to be paid for as earth in water-tight banks as not being selected material, and in giving the respondent the right to a reference to show if possible a still larger quantity to be deducted under that head. The engineers considered the material all sufficiently good to put into the embankments, and rejected none of it as being unfit for that purpose, but passed it and directed or approved of putting it into the embankments, and the appellant is entitled to the price under item 5 of the schedule[17]. for the whole of it. The engineer had no authority, under the contract or specifications, after the material has been put into the embankments under his directions and to his satisfaction, to say that it should not all be paid for under item 5 as \"earth in water-tight banks.\"\nThe appellant also submits that he is entitled to interest and his costs in both courts. Ritchie Q.C. and Chrysler Q.C. for the respondent. The dispute became subject to arbitration under the clause in the contract, and the engineer had no power to grant the amended certificate. He had full power to decide questions depending upon the construction of the contract, and having done so by the former certificate became functus officio. Lloyd v. Milward[18].\nThe Act respecting the Department of Justice does not apply, because the chief engineer was not acting as the head of the department, requiring to be advised upon a matter of law connected therewith, nor was he, as to the certificate in question, acting as a servant or officer of the Crown whose duty it was to sign any certificate that he was advised or directed to sign. In theory he was appointed by both parties as arbitrator to stand between the parties and do justice to both. The position of the chief engineer, under clause 25 of the contract, is incompatible with that ascribed to him by the Exchequer Court judgment, and he was not a person whose duty it was to seek and accept the advice of the Department of Justice, as upon a matter of law connected with the Department of Railways and Canals. See Hudson, Building Contracts, vol. 1 (2 ed.) p. 301. The discussion of the position of the engineer, in Ranger v. Great Western Railway Company[19] at page 91, is not a correct statement of the position of the engineer under the present and similar contracts. See also Clements v. Clarke[20], at page 221; Sharpe v. San Paulo Railway Co.[21]; Kimberly v. Dick[22] at page 19; Farquhar v. City of Hamilton[23], and earlier cases there referred to, and Peters v. Quebec Harbour Commissioners[24]. The question was not wholly one of construction of the contract, but was partly a question of fact as to what had been laid out by the engineers as watertight embankments, and how much of the banks had been constructed in accordance with the specification and of selected material. Upon both of these questions the determination by the Department of Justice, that the whole bank should be so paid for, was opposed to the views of the engineers as expressed in the certificate or therein included by reference. The certificate, as found by the learned judge himself, was in fact wrong, because upon the most favourable view for the contractor it included at least 100,000 yards of material not according to specification and was, upon the facts, given for at least $15,000 too much. Thus it is very clear, that the giving of the certificate was not a pure question of construction of the contract, to be determined by the Department of Justice, overruling the Chief Engineer.\nThe Department of Justice did not, in fact, advise the giving of a certificate for the full amount, and it seems to have been signed under a misapprehension, as to the scope or effect of the advice contained in the letter from the Department. The letter of the Deputy Minister merely contained an intimation that the late Minister of Justice, who at the time had ceased to be such minister, and was no longer the responsible adviser of the Crown, had come to the conclusion that the contractor's claim should be entertained. The duty and power of the Chief Engineer under clause 25 of the contract, was not affected by the omission from clause 8 of the usual provision making his judgment upon questions of the construction of the contract final. The cases cited show that the claim of the contractor to recover upon this certificate is inconsistent with the claim urged in the alternative, that the proceeding is a reference of a matter in dispute. Clause 33 of the contract was only intended to be made use of in cases where the work was finished, and the Chief Engineer had finally certified under clause 25, and has no application to work under a pending contract. It contemplates a special reference of a matter in difference, and the evidence shews that there was no matter in difference but that the question was, whether the claimant had a valid certificate capable of being enforced by action. The decision of the Exchequer Court Judge is that of an arbitrator and is final and not appealable to the Supreme Court.\nUpon the evidence it seems clear that the certificate is bad, on the grounds that it does not express the judgment of the engineer; that the parties agreed to accept his certificate; that he is the person designated by the contract, and the Crown are not bound by the decision or judgment of any other person. Clause 25 requires that two facts or findings by the Chief Engineer shall be stated in writing:\u2014That the work has been duly executed to his satisfaction. The value of the work computed as therein above mentioned and this has not been done. The question as to how much earth was placed in the water-tight embankments, laid out and made up in accordance with the specification, was a matter peculiarly given to the engineer, and upon which the engineer's judgment was required; it was one of the things as to which his satisfaction had to be expressed under clause 25 of the contract. The certificate not only does not state that the work was done to the satisfaction of the engineer, but, by reference to the documents incorporated with it, expressly states the contrary. See Eads v. Williams[25] at page 686; Ellison v. Bray[26]. Other cases are collected in Redman on Awards, p. 98, and Russell on Awards (7 ed.) 207. See also In re Eastern Counties Railway Co. & The Eastern Union Railway Co., Arbitration[27]; Jackson v. Barry Railway Co.[28]. The question is referred to incidently in Peters v. Quebec Harbour Commissioners[29] at page 696, by Strong J. and by Gwynne J. at page 698, and Patterson J. at page 700.\nThe certificate is also bad because it does not fulfil the requirements of clause 25 of the contract; Murray v. The Queen[30]; The Queen v. Stars[31]. The certificate is invalid because the question was previously finally determined by the Engineer's decision. In regard to the classification of the same material in the former certificate or progress estimate, (no. 23,) is also final, and he had no power to revoke or recall his decision so given. Certificate no. 23 finally determined the rights of both parties, and the progress estimate now sued upon was void, as being made by an officer who had already given a final decision upon the same question, and was therefore functus officio, as to that question. The approval of the Minister, which should be in writing and is also a condition precedent to the right of recovery, was not established.\nIn any event, if the court assumes jurisdiction under clause 33, to determine the meaning of clause 11 of the specification, the judgment of the court should merely be a declaratory one, leaving the contractor to obtain a certificate under clause 25 of the contract, for the amount which may appear to be due to him, applying the principle of construction declared by the court.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I have had communication of the elaborate notes of my brothers Sedgewick and Girouard and I agree with them that this appeal should be allowed.\nWithout dissenting from any of the grounds upon which they have reached this conclusion, I deem it necessary to state concisely my views of the case. The claim referred to the Exchequer Court and now before us is the claim of the appellant for $73,260, based upon the Engineer's certificate no. 24. I am of opinion that this certificate under clause twenty-five of the contract, approved of by the Minister as it has been, is sufficient to entitle the appellant to his claim. It is clearly a certificate that the work \"for which it is granted has been duly executed to the satisfaction of the Engineer\" in the terms of the contract. It is, coupled with Munro's certificate, a certificate that this money is due under the contract and he was the sole judge of it. We cannot go behind it, and take upon ourselves to ascertain whether or not this amount is due, after he has certified that it is. I concur fully in what is said upon this point by my brothers Sedgewick and Girouard. If I mistake not such would have been the judgment of the Exchequer Court, if it had not been for a misconception of Murray v. The Queen[32]. I agree also that certificate no. 23 does not militate against appellant's claim. Clause twenty-five of the contract expressly says that the value certified to under these certificates given during the construction is merely approximate, and clauses twenty-six and twenty-seven indicate clearly that there is no final certificate at all, under the contract, but the one to be given at the final completion of the work, an event which has not yet occurred.\nThe Crown's contention that because by certificate number twenty-three the engineer had not the power to issue certificate number twenty-four for that part of the work in question, is equivalent to nullify entirely clauses twenty-five and twenty-six and render them meaningless. The chief engineer's certificate number twenty-four must, in my opinion, be read as if all the words under the signature \"Collingwood Schreiber\" were struck out. I understood counsel for the Crown at the argument to rely exclusively on those words, and on certificate number twenty-three, in support of their case.\nThe appeal is allowed with costs and judgment is ordered to be entered for the appellant for $73,260 with costs, Mr. Justice Gwynne and Mr. Justice King dissenting. We will hear counsel as to the question of interest.\nGWYNNE J\u2014The question which is before us upon this appeal is whether or not the claimant is entitled to recover the sum of $73,260, which upon the evidence in the case he claims to be entitled to recover under the terms and provisions of the contract set out in his statement of claim.\nUpon the 9th May, 1893, the appellant entered into a contract with Her Majesty, represented by the Minister of Railways and Canals of Canada, for the performance of certain work upon sections 4, 5, 6 & 7 of the Soulanges Canal in the contract mentioned. For the determination of the present appeal it will be necessary to consider only a few of the clauses of the contract and of the specifications which are referred to therein, and made part thereof.\nBy the specifications which were made part of the contract it was provided among other things as follows:\n5. There will only be two classes of excavation recognized or paid for, namely, \"earth\" or \"solid rock.\"\n6. The price tendered for \"earth excavation\" must cover the entire cost of excavating, hauling and forming into embankments, all kinds of materials found in the pits for lock, weirs or other structures, and in the prism of the canal, raceways, side ponds or wherever excavation is necessary, except solid stratified quarry rock. This price shall include the cost of removing boulders of all sizes, indurated clay, hard pan, &c., for none of which will any extra or additional allowance be made. It is also distinctly understood and agreed upon that no excavation shall be paid for below the exact grade line of the bottom of the canal works, or outside the line of the slopes, unless the same be executed under the written instructions of the engineer.\n7. No allowance whatever beyond the prices tendered for excavation will be made for haul. The surplus material arising from the prism, &c., on section no. 7 shall, after making up the banks on that section, be carried forward to widen the embankments of sections to the eastward; and the surplus on section no. 6 shall be dealt with in the same manner, so that all the excavation arising from the sections embraced in this contract west of lock no. 5, will be disposed of in making the embankments on each side of the summit level, between stations 180 and 460, filling around the various structures, &c. This distribution of material to be made as will be directed by the engineer without entitling the contractor to any extra allowance whatever. The attention of parties tendering is specially drawn to this section of the specification.\n11. Wherever the surface level of the water in the canal is higher than the ground alongside, water tight banks shall be made when so directed. In these cases the top soil must be removed for such width and depth as may be considered necessary to form the embankment seats. The material arising from this mucking to be deposited where pointed out. It will be paid for as ordinary earth excavation. The seats shall also be well roughed up with a plough so as to make good bond with the first layer of earth forming the base of the embankment. Puddle walls or cut-offs to be made where required\u2014the puddle to be prepared and laid as specified hereafter.\nWhen the bank seats are properly prepared, inspected and approved, and not till then, the bank shall be carried up in layers of selected material, of about eight inches in thickness, well spread, the lumps broken, watered, trodden down or otherwise compacted and carefully shaped to the heights and slopes given by the engineer.\nOnly such portions of the embankments as shall be laid out by the engineer, and made up in strict accordance with the foregoing specifications, will be paid for as \"earth in water tight banks.\"\n99. The plans now exhibited are only intended to show the general mode of construction adopted; but detail drawings which must be strictly carried out will be supplied for the guidance of the contractor as the work proceeds. By the contract it was specially covenanted and agreed by and between the parties among other things as follows:\nParagraphs. That the contractor will at his own cost provide all and every kind of labour, machinery and other plant, materials, articles and things whatsoever necessary for the due execution and completion of all and every the works set out or referred to in the specifications hereunto annexed and set out or referred to in the plans and drawings prepared and to be prepared for the purposes of the work, and will execute and fully complete the respective portions of such works and deliver the same complete to Her Majesty on or before the day of (a day not material on this appeal) the said works to be constructed of the best materials of their several kinds and finished in the best and most workmanlike manner, in the manner required by and in strict conformity with the said specifications and the drawings relating thereto, and the working or detail drawings which may from time to time be furnished, (which said specifications and drawings are hereby declared to be part of this contract), and to the complete satisfaction of the chief engineer for the time being having control over the work.\nParagraph 8. That the engineer shall be sole judge of work and material in respect of both quantity and quality and his decision on all questions in dispute with regard to work or material shall be final, and no works or extra or additional works or changes shall be deemed to have been executed, nor shall the contractor be entitled to payment for the same, unless the same shall have been executed to the satisfaction of the engineer as evidenced by his certificate in writing, which certificate shall be a condition precedent to the right of the contractor to be paid therefor.\nParagraph 9. It is hereby distinctly understood and agreed that the respective portions of the works set out or referred to in the list or schedule of prices to be paid for the different kinds of work, include not merely the particular kinds of work or materials mentioned in the said list or schedule, but also all and every kind of work, labour, tools, plant, materials, articles and things whatsoever necessary for the full execution and completing ready for use of the respective portions of the works to the satisfaction of the engineer, and in case of dispute as to what work, labour, material, tools and plant are or are not so included, the decision of the engineer shall be final and conclusive. Paragraph 24. And Her Majesty in consideration of the premises, hereby covenants with the contractor that he will be paid for and in respect of the works hereby contracted for and in the manner set out in the next clause hereof, the several prices or sums following:\n* * * * *\nearth excavation, per cubic yard, 20 cents, earth in water-tight embankments, per cubic yard, 15 cents.\nParagraph 25. Cash payments equal to about ninety per cent of the value of the work done, approximately made up from returns of progress measurements and computed at the prices agreed upon or determined under the provisions of this contract will be made to the contractor monthly on the written certificate of the engineer that the work for or on account of which the certificate is granted has been duly executed to his satisfaction, and stating the value of such work computed as above-mentioned and upon approval of such certificate by the Minister for the time being; and the said certificate and such approval thereof shall be a condition precedent to the right of the contractor to be paid the said ninety per cent or any part thereof. The remaining ten per cent shall be retained, &c., &c. (unimportant on the present appeal).\nAs the work of construction progressed, the engineer gave to the contractor monthly progress estimates which at first were for earth in excavation only as no embankment had as yet been commenced, but in the month of August, 1893, he gave a progress estimate for July, 1893. in which he estimated for earth excavation at 20 cents per cubic yard 85,300 cubic yards and for earth in water tight embankments at 15 cents per cubic yard, 20,000 cubic yards. In September, 1893, he in like manner gave an estimate for the month of August, for earth excavation 121,700 cubic yards, and for earth in water tight embankments 30,000 cubic yards, and in like manner in October, 1893, he gave an estimate for September for earth excavation 169,800 cubic yards, and for earth in water tight embankments, 43,000 cubic yards, and in November, 1893, he gave an estimate for the month of October, for earth excavation 230,000 cubic yards, and for earth in water tight embankments 67,500 cubic yards. Payments were made to the contractor in accordance with all these progress estimates. In the month of November, 1893, the contractor made a complaint to the Minister of Railways and Canals as to the manner in which his contract was being dealt with by the engineer, in a long letter dated 16th November, 1893, which is before us, contained in eight pages of the printed case. It is unnecessary to enter into the lengthy argument offered by the contractor in support of his complaint; it is sufficient to say that it related to three specific items, namely:\nFirst. The interpretation of the specifications as to whether the 15 cents per cubic yard should be paid for the whole of the embankments formed from the excavation.\nSecond. The blue clay on sections 6 and 7, &c. &c.\nThird. The difficulty and expense of bringing building for concrete to the site of the proposed lock, &c.\nIt is only with the first that we have to deal, and as to this it is sufficient to say that the whole of the contractor's argument in relation to it was to the effect that the contract and specifications afforded no warrant whatever for the action of the engineer in estimating for part only of the earth put into the embankments as to be paid for at 15 cents per cubic yard; and that by his contract and the specifications he was entitled to be paid 15 cents per cubic yard for every cubic yard of material put into the embankments in addition to the 20 cents per cubic yard on earth measured in excavation, and he added that even if the work should be done under the most favourable conditions these combined sums made but a moderate price for the work for which he claimed them, and he prayed that this his interpretation of his contract should be accepted as final and conclusive as to his right to the 15 cents for every cubic yard in embankments, or that he should be released from his contract upon certain terms proposed in his letter. The Minister of Railways and Canals submitted this letter to the late Sir John Thompson, then Minister of Justice, for his opinion, and his opinion was, by a letter from the Department of Justice dated 28th February, 1894, communicated to the Minister of Railways and Canals, which in short substance is that the specifications do not admit of the construction contended for by the contractor; which opinion was communicated to the contractor in a letter from the Department of Railways and Canals, wherein the contractor was informed that in view of such opinion the Department must decline to entertain his claim.\nIn the meantime, while this complaint of the contractor was before the Minister of Justice for his opinion, and subsequently to that opinion having been given, the engineer continued to give to the contractor monthly progress estimates distinguishing as before between earth in excavation at 20 cents per cubic yard, and earth in water tight embankments, at 15 cents per cubic yard, until the 13th December, 1895, when the engineer gave to the contractor a progress estimate numbered 23 for the month of November, 1895, containing among other things as follows:\nEarth excavation\u20141,103,713 cb. yds. at 20c...\n$220,742 60\nEarth in water tight\nembankments......450,733 cb. yds. at 15c...\n67,609 50\nThese two sums together make...............\n$288,352 10\nIn the month of March, 1895, however, the contractor had renewed his complaint to the Minister of Railways and Canals in a letter dated March 22nd, 1895. This complaint was referred to the engineer, who after hearing the contractor upon the subject made his report to the Minister of Railways and Canals upon the matter adversely to the contractor's claim. The letter of the 22nd March together with various supplemental arguments supplied by the contractor between that date and the 10th December, 1895, was also submitted to Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper, who had succeeded the late Sir John Thompson as Minister of Justice, for his opinion.\nThe contention of the contractor as laid before Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper is substantially the same as that which had been laid before the late Sir John Thompson, although expressed in a more elaborate argument which is contained in thirty pages of the printed case laid before us. This elaborate argument, however, resolves itself simply into the contention that the question submitted is wholly one of law involving simply the legal construction of the contract, with which the engineer has nothing to do but to conform to it, and that such legal construction is: That it is apparent from the drawings upon which the contractor tendered for the work; that what was contemplated was one continuous embankment along each side of the canal to be constructed; that the position of the embankments indicated plainly that they must be made water tight, and that the contract gave to the contractor 15 cents for every cubic yard of earth put into these embankments within the dimensions assigned to them by the specifications; that the contract does not contemplate any such thing as a portion of the embankments respectively being made watertight, or authorise the engineer to estimate for a portion of the embankments as being water tight for the purpose of thereby limiting the allowance of 15 cents per yard to such part only; and that all that the contract excludes from the allowance of 15 cents per cubic yard is such part of the embankments, if there should be any, construced by the contractor outside of the limits of the embankments as designed by the engineer and in excess of the dimensions assigned to them by him in the specifications and drawings relating thereto.\nIn this is contained the whole substance of the elaborate argument presented on behalf of the contractor.\nWe have not the reasons for the conclusion at which the Minister of Justice arrived, but of his conclusion we are informed by a letter dated the 15th January, 1896, addressed by the Deputy Minister of Justice to the Secretary of the Department of Railways and Canals which is as follows:\nSir,\nReferring to your letter of the 4th October last, enclosing additional correspondence and the report of your Chief Engineer with regard to Contractor Goodwin's claim as to payment for the construction of water tight embankments on the Soulanges Canal, I have the honour to state that Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper while Minister of Justice, gave the matter very careful consideration and heard Mr. Goodwin in support of his claim. The Minister came to the conclusion that the claim was one which should be entertained by your Department, but he resigned his office before that advice could be communicated to you. He desired me, however, to inform you that he had reached the conclusion which I have stated.\nThe question now arises: Which of those opinions should prevail? If that of the late Sir John Thompson, which by the letter from the Department of Justice, dated the 28th November, 1894, of which only the result is given above, appears to have been identical with that of the engineer in accordance with which all his monthly progress estimates up to and including that of the 13th December, 1895, for the month of November of that year were given, then it is manifest that the matter was one which by the contract was submitted to the final judgment of the engineer whose decision has been adverse to the claimant.\nThe question arises before us in this manner: The claimant in his statement of claim filed in the Exchequer Court under the provisions of section 23 of ch. 16 of 50 & 51 Vict., rests his claim upon what he contends is a certificate of the engineer, dated the 28th February, 1896, given in accordance, as he alleges, with the provisions of the contract in that behalf.\nThe respondent in the statement of defence sets out the material part of the contract and specifications as already given above, and in short substance and effect, insists that the document dated the 28th February, 1896, and relied upon by the claimant was not given, nor does it upon its face purport to have been given, as expressing the judgment or decision of the engineer as contemplated by the contract, but was given as shewn upon its face in deference to the opinion given by the Minister of Justice, Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper, as to the true construction of the contract, and did not express the judgment of the engineer, whose judgment and decision in the matter is contained in the certificate given by him dated the 13th December, 1895, which alone, as is contended, is binding, and that the claimant had received the amount so certified and that therefore his present claim should be dismissed.\nTo this defence the claimant filed a replication which is in substance and effect a renewal of his contention and the argument in support thereof submitted to the respective Ministers of Justice as already mentioned, and he insists that the certificate of the 13th December, 1895, was erroneous, inasmuch as it reported only 450,733 cubic yards as for earth in water tight embankments, and that the certificate of the 28th February, 1896, was given by the engineer to correct the error in his former certificate by giving credit to the claimant for 993,340 cubic yards as earth in water tight embankments instead of 450,733 cubic yards, as had been erroneously certified in the certificate of December 13th, 1895.\nThe first point thus raised is whether the certificate of the 13th December, 1895, was erroneous as alleged, and this is precisely the question which had been submitted to the respective Ministers of Justice for their opinion, namely: Does the contract entitle the claimant to be paid 15 cents for every cubic yard of material put into the embankments constructed under the contract, or only for the earth put into such portions of those embankments as were laid out by the engineer for the purpose of being made, and as were required by him to be made, watertight and as should be certified by him as having been so made?\nNow it cannot be disputed that as insisted by the claimant in his argument presented to the Ministers of Justice and urged before us on this appeal, that the drawings upon which the claimant made his tender, clearly shew that the embankments proposed to be constructed were two, namely, one continuous embankment (with which as extending from station 180 to station 460 on each side of the canal, proposed to be excavated, we alone have to deal); but the specifications upon which the claimant tendered also very clearly shew that for the earth to be deposited in a portion only of these embankments was the contractor to received sum per cubic yard to be agreed upon, and that for the earth deposited in all the residue of the embankments he was to be paid per cubic yard measured excavation.\nThe 11th section of the specifications which provides for the construction of water tight banks can have relation to nothing else than to certain portions of these embankments on each side of the canal. It is in these embankments that the water tight banks are to be made when directed by the engineer, and the mode of constructing these water-tight banks (as they are called) is specially described thus:\nThe top soil must be removed for such width and depth as may be considered to be necessary to form the embankment seats.\nThese words \"embankment seats here used, plainly mean the seats of the portions to be made water-tight, and the material taken therefrom, that is, from the seat of the water tight portions, is to be removed from such seats and deposited where pointed out by the engineer, and wherever placed is to be paid for as earth measured in excavation only. From this direction it is obvious that the material so removed is to be deposited outside of the \"water tight banks,\" as they are called, which are to be constructed in the embankments. Then the seats themselves from which such material shall be removed shall be roughed with a plough so as to make good bond with the first layer of earth forming the base of the embankment. This layer of earth plainly means that one first laid on the part so prepared by the plough. That all this applies to the portions only of the embankments which portions are designated in the specification \"water tight banks,\" is very apparent from the whole tenor of the 11th specification, which goes on to provide that when the bank seats (already spoken of), and being to be constructed as the seats of water tight banks in the embankments are properly prepared, inspected and approved, and not till then, the bank shall be carried up (on the bank seats so prepared, inspected and approved) in layers of selected material of about eight inches in thickness, well spread, the lumps broken, watered, trodden down, or otherwise compacted, and carefully shaped to the heights and slopes given by the engineer, only such portions of the embankments as shall be laid out by the engineer and made up in strict accordance with the foregoing specifications will be paid for as \"earth in water-tight banks.\" This clause in plain language limits the right of the contractor to 15 cents per cubic yard to the earth put into those portions of the embankments which shall be laid out and so prepared as and for the water-tight banks in the embankments.\nThen by the evidence we see that the portions so intended by the engineer to be made water tight were laid out by him and plainly indicated by stakes planted in a line at the distance in sections 5, 6, 7, of 112 feet from a line staked to mark the centre line of the prism of the canal, and in section 4 at the distance of 101 feet from such centre line except for the distance of 600 feet where the line was staked at the distance of 112 feet from such centre line. The spaces between these lines on either side of the canal and the southern and northern limit respectively of the prism of the canal were so laid out by the engineer as the portions of the embankments required to be made water tight, and were prepared with the plough for that purpose as directed by the specifications, and the material removed from such portions was as directed by the specifications removed by the claimant and placed by him by direction of the engineer outside of the portion so staked for the purpose of being made water tight, but within the base of the embankments, the outside limit of which was marked at such distance from the stakes planted to indicate the limit of the water tight portions on one side of the canal as would enable the top of the embankment to be fifty feet in width and on the other side thirty feet only. This disposition of the material so removed from the base or seats of the portions intended to be made water-tight plainly indicated that the part of the embankments in which such material was deposited, was not within the parts designated by the specifications as being required to be made watertight, and while the contract and specifications expressly provide that the contractor shall receive J 5 cents per cubic yard only for such portions of the embankment as should be laid out by the engineer for the purpose of being made water-tight, the contractor by the adoption of the construction put upon the contract by Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper would receive 15 cents per yard for the earth removed from the seats prepared as the base of the water-tight portions as directed by the engineer and for which by an express provision in the contract and specifications he is to be paid only, where-ever it should be placed, as earth measured in excavation, and by the evidence it appears that there is on a rough calculation 100,000 cubic yards so removed amounting to $15,000. It was argued further that the portions required by the engineer to be made watertight, being so made the whole of the embankments were made water-tight; but the contract is very express that the 15 cents per cubic yard is to be paid only for earth in \"portions of the embankments\" and there cannot be any doubt that such portions are those only which were so as aforesaid required by direction of the engineer to be made water-tight and staked out by him for that purpose. This appears to be the plain construction of the contract and section 34 provides that:\nNo implied contract of any kind whatsoever by or on behalf of Her Majesty shall arise or be implied from anything in this contract contained.\nI can therefore come to no other conclusion than that the opinion of the late Sir John Thompson was correct and that the contractor is by his contract entitled to the 15 cents per cubic yard, only for the earth placed in the portions of the embankments so as aforesaid staked out by the engineer for the purpose of being made water-tight, and prepared for that purpose as prescribed by the specifications. It was objected in argument that there was no slope given for the rear line of these portions, and that there was a variance in the mode adopted by the sub-engineers for the measurement of the earth in these portions in section 4 from that adopted in sections 5, 6 and 7, but as these portions were laid out as being well within the area of the whole of the respective embankments there could be no such rear slope. In such case the rear line of the portions laid out to be made water-tight would naturally seem to be a line drawn perpendicularly from the rear line of the base of such intended water-tight portions to the top of the embankments, and as to any variance in the mode of measuring the earth in such portions, hitherto there has been no controversy between the contracting parties upon that point; if any should arise the engineer is not only competent to correct any error if such there be, but is by the contract made final judge upon such a question. Neither of these objections, however, have any weight whatever upon the question raised by this appeal, which is simply as to the construction of the contract, namely whether it gives to the contractor 15 cents per cubic yard for all the earth in both of the embankments, the area of one of which is two-fifths larger than the area of the other, or only for the earth placed in the portions staked out by the engineer for the purpose of being made water tight, the areas of which in both embankments are equal.\nIt was further contended before us that whether the opinion of Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper was right or wrong mattered not, that is to say that whether the contract according to the true construction of it did or did not entitle the contractor to the 15 cents per yard for all the earth in the embankments as maintained by that opinion mattered not, for that the document upon which the claimant relied as the certificate of the engineer given under the provisions of the contract having been approved of by the Minister of Railways and Canals, the right of the claimant to the amount claimed was now incontrovertible. I do not think we need upon this appeal decide whether, if an engineer should ever intentionally or in error, give a certificate for an amount in violation of the terms of a contract, such amount could ever be recovered in an action founded upon the contract. In the present case the certificate no. 23, the amount certified by which was paid to the contractor, equally required the approval of the Minister before it could have been paid, and the difference between that certificate and the one numbered 24 required explanation. The statement of defence filed in the present case opened an inquiry into the whole of the circumstances under which that certificate was given, and distinctly disputes the intent (as construed by the claimant) and the validity of that document. The claimant by his replication rests his support of that document upon the allegation that it was given by the engineer to correct an error alleged to have existed in no. 23, and has thus raised the specific issue: Did such error exist in no. 23?\nNow, that alleged error consisted in this, that the engineer only estimated for the earth placed in the portions of the embankments laid out by him for the purpose of being made water tight, as the earth for which the 15 cents per yard was to be paid instead of certifying (as is contended by the claimant he should have certified) for all of the earth in the embankments as entitled to be paid for at such price, and the correction relied upon by the claimant is the statement which is made in no. 24 of the amount which would be due to the claimant assuming the opinion of Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper to be correct as the claimant contends that it is. If, however, that opinion cannot be sustained, there was no error in no. 23 to be corrected, and so the issue raised by the claimant in support and justification of certificate no. 24 must fail and that certificate must therefore also fail.\nNow the evidence plainly shews that certificate no. 24 does not represent and was not given for the purpose of representing the engineer's own opinion as to what the claimant was entitled to under his contract, which opinion is still as is stated in no. 23, but merely to show the quantity of all the earth in the embankments and the amount which would be due to the claimant if in accordance with the opinion of Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper he was upon the true construction of his contract entitled to be paid 15 cents for every cubic yard of earth in the embankments instead of as had been estimated by the engineer only for the earth placed in those portions of the embankments which had in point of fact been laid out and prepared for that purpose and required by him to be made watertight. The certificate no. 24 moreover shows upon its face that it is intended to be qualified by reference to other specified documents which must be referred to, and which being referred to, show that the certificate no. 24 was given for no other purpose than as just stated. Under these circumstances it appears abundantly clear that whatever force might be given to the certificate no 24 if the opinion of Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper as to the true construction of the contract could be supported, as that opinion cannot be maintained no. 24 cannot have no force to invalidate certificate no. 23 which is in accord with the true construction of the contract, nor can its approval by the Minister of Railways and Canals which must be intended also to be based upon the opinion of the Minister of Justice and must therefore fail with it, give it any force whatever. For the above reason I must say that I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014Prior to the month of May, 1893, the Government of Canada had adopted the policy of so improving the navigation of the River St. Lawrence that there should be continuously fourteen feet in depth of navigable water between the great fresh water lakes of the Dominion and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. As a part of this scheme the construction of the Soulanges Canal, a canal on the north side of the River St. Lawrence to be used in substitution for the Beauharnois Canal, a canal on the south side of the river, was undertaken. The proposed work was divided into sections, and on the 9th of May, 1893, a contract was entered into between the Crown and the present appellant for the construction of four of these sections. The clauses in the contract and specification especially affecting the questions involved in this appeal are as follows:\nClauses of contract:\n3. * * * The said works to be constructed of the best materials of their several kinds, and finished in the best and most workman like manner, in the manner required by and in strict conformity with the said specifications and the drawings relating thereto, and the working or detail drawings which may from time to time be furnished (which said specifications and drawings are hereby declared to be part of this contract), and to the complete satisfaction of the chief engineer for the time being having control over the work.\n8. That the engineer shall be the sole judge of the work and material in respect of both quantity and quality, and his decision on all questions in dispute with regard to work or material, shall be final, and no works or extra or additional works or changes shall be deemed to have been executed, nor shall the contractor be entitled to payment for the same, unless the same shall have been executed to the satisfaction of the engineer, as evidenced by his certificate in writing, which certificate shall be a condition precedent to the right of the contractor to be paid therefor. 24. And Her Majesty; in consideration of the premises, hereby covenants with the contractor, that he will be paid for and in respect of the works hereby contracted for, and in the manner set out in the next clause hereof, the several prices or sums following, viz:\nNo. of Items.\nDescription of Items.\nRate.\n8 cts.\n*\n* * * * * * * * *\n*\n4\nEarth excavation, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 15, 19, 21,\n63, 64, 70, 76........................ Pere. yd.\n20\n5\nEarth in water-tight embankments, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 7, 11.. do\n15\n* * * * * * * * *\nN.B.\u2014All materials to be measured in the work, and all cement used in the works of sections Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 7 will be furnished by the Department of Railways and Canals on the conditions set forth in section No. 89 of the specification. The figures placed after the various items in the above form of tender refer to the sections of the specification wherein they are described.\n25. Cash payments equal to about ninety per cent of the value of the work done, approximately made up from returns of progress measurements and computed at the prices agreed upon or determined under the provisions of this contract, will be made to the contractor monthly on the written certificate of the engineer that the work for, or on account of, which the certificate is granted has been duly executed to his satisfaction and stating the value of such work computed as above mentioned, and upon approval of such certificate by the Minister for the time being, and the said certificate and such approval thereof shall be a condition precedent to the right of the contractor to be paid the said ninety per cent or any part thereof. The remaining ten per cent shall be retained till the final completion of the whole work to the satisfaction of the Chief Engineer for the time being, having control over the work, and within two months after such completion the remaining ten per cent will be paid. And it is hereby declared that the written certificate of the said engineer, certifying to the final completion of said works to his satisfaction shall be a condition precedent to the right of the contractor to receive or to be paid the said remaining ten per cent or any part thereof. 26. It is intended that every allowance to which the contractor i fairly entitled, will be embraced in the engineer's monthly certificates; but should the contractor at any time have claims of any description which he considers are not included in the progress certificates, it will be necessary for him to make and repeat such claims in writing to the engineer within thirty days after the date of the dispatch to the contractor of each and every certificate in which he alleges such claims have been omitted.\n27. The contractor in presenting claims of the kind referred to in the last clause must accompany them with satisfactory evidence of their accuracy, and the reason why he thinks they should be allowed. Unless such claims are thus made during the progress of the work, within thirty days, as in the preceding clause, and repeated, in writing, every month, until finally adjusted or rejected, it must be clearly understood that they shall be for ever shut out, and the contractor shall have no claim on Her Majesty in respect thereof.\n33. It is hereby agreed, that all matters of difference arising between the parties hereto upon any matter connected with or arising out of this contract, the decision whereof is not hereby especially given to the engineer,\u2014shall be referred to the Exchequer Court of Canada and the award of such court shall be final and conclusive.\nClauses of the Specification:\u2014\n3. Dimensions of canal. The canal will be generally 300 feet wide at bottom with slopes in excavation of 2 to 1 throughout. The embankments forming the sides shall be of such top widths as will be directed, and be carried up to the height of 161 feet above datum on the summit level. Below lock no. 5, the top bank shall be 143 feet above datum or such other height as may be directed.\n5. Classification of materials. There will only be two classes of excavation recognized or paid for, namely, \"earth\" or \"solid lock.\"\n6. Earthwork. The price tendered for \"earth excavation\" must cover the entire cost of excavating, hauling and forming into embankments, all kinds of materials found in the pits for lock, weirs or other structures, and in the prism of the canal, raceways, side ponds or wherever excavation is necessary, except solid stratified quarry rock. The price shall include the cost of removing boulders of all sizes, indurated clay, hard pan, &c., for none of which will any extra or additional allowance be made. It is also distinctly understood and agreed upon that no excavation shall be paid for below the exact grade line of the bottom of the canal works or ontsid e the line of the slopes, unless the same be executed under the written instructions of the engineer.\n7. No allowance or haul. No allowance whatever beyond the prices tendered for excavation will be made for haul. The surplus material arising from the prism, &c., on section no. 7 shall, after making up the banks on that section, be carried forward to widen the embankments of sections to the eastward; and the surplus on section no. 6 shall be dealt with in the same manner, so that all the excavation arising from the sections embraced in this contract west of Lock no. 5, will be disposed of in making the embankments on each side of the summit level between stations 180 and 460, filling around the various structures, &c. This distribution of material to be made as will be directed by the Engineer without entitling the contractor to any extra allowance whatever. The attention of parties tendering is specially drawn to this section of the specification.\n11. Watertight banks. Wherever the surface level of the water in the canal higher than the ground alongside, water tight banks shall be made when so directed. In these cases the top soil must be removed for such width and depth as may be considered necessary to form the embankment seats. The material arising from this mucking to be deposited where pointed out. It will be paid for as ordinary earth excavation. The seats shall also be well roughed up with a plough so as to make good bond with the first layer of earth forming the base of the embankment. Puddle walls or cut offs to be made where required\u2014the puddle to be prepared and laid as specified hereafter.\nWhen the bank seats are properly prepared, inspected and approved\u2014and not till then\u2014the bank shall be carried up in layers, of selected material, of about eight inches in thickness, well spread\u2014the lumps broken\u2014watered\u2014trodden down or otherwise compacted and carefully shaped to the heights and slopes given by the engineer.\nOnly such portions of the embankments as shall be laid out by the engineer, and made up in strict accordance with the foregoing specification, will be paid for as \"earth in water-tight banks.\"\nThe plan shown to the contractor at the time of the execution of the contract, and which formed part of it, so far as the question involved in this case is concerned, is as follows:[33] This plan shows the surface of the ground before any work was done, the intended bottom of the canal, the water-line when completed, and the embankments on each side, the northern embankment having a top fifty feet wide and the southern embankment thirty feet. The work, for payment of which the appellant has made the claim in controversy upon this appeal, has connection solely with the embankments on each side of the canal, and the only question is as to the amount which he is entitled to receive for the construction of these embankments. The work in question was to be done at places where the surface level of the water in the canal, when completed, would be higher than the ground alongside, and section 11 of the specification provided that in that particular case water-tight banks should be constructed on each side, but that before commencing these banks the top soil should be removed for such width and depth as might be considered necessary to form the embankment seats, the cost of removing this \"muck\" as it was termed, to be paid for as ordinary earth excavation, at 20 cents per cubic yard; (clause 24 of the contract); and that the ground where this mucking was taken from should be well roughed up with a plough so as to make good bond with the first layer of earth forming the base of the embankment. Further, that when the bank seats were properly prepared, inspected and approved\u2014and not till then\u2014the bank should be carried up in layers of selected material of about eight inches in thickness, well spread\u2014the lumps broken, watered, trodden down or otherwise compacted and carefully shaped to the heights and slopes given by the engineer, and that only such portions of the embankments as should be laid out by the engineer and made up in strict accordance with the specification would be paid for as \"earth in water-tight banks,\" at 15 cents per cubic yard. (Clause 24 of the contract). It was further understood that the material of which the water-tight embankments on each side of the canal were to be made was to be taken from the excavation of the prism, if such material were suitable for the purpose, so that in effect it was provided that the contractor was to receive 20 cents per cubic yard for all earth excavation, and that in so far as this earth excavation was suitable for, and was used in, the construction of the water-tight embankments in pursuance of the terms of the specification, 15 cents per cubic yard in addition was to be paid. When the contractor entered upon his work the engineers of the government had laid out the line of the canal, indicating by stakes its central thread and the northern limit of the north embankment and the southern limit of the south embankment; indicating, too, that portion of the bed from which the top soil had to be removed in order to form the embankment seats; but there was nothing shown either upon the ground or upon any specification or plan, or by any verbal or other direction given to the contractor, that the position, height and width of the embankments themselves were to be other than indicated on the plan forming part of the contract and upon the faith of which the work was executed by the contractor. The embankments were built substantially according to the plan. The removal of the mucking or top soil to form the embankment seats was done, and the material deposited as provided by section 11 of the specification.. Selected material of the character therein specified, taken from the prism of the canal, was, under the direction and with the approval of the Government engineers, and substantially in the manner specified in the clause last mentioned, used in the construction of the embankments and they were eventually completed as originally intended and as described in the original specifications and plans. There has never been any question or controversy between the Crown and the contractor, or between the Government engineers and the contractor, as to the work upon the embankments or the material of which they were composed, whether in respect of quantity or quality. All parties are satisfied that, so far as these matters are concerned, the appellant has fulfilled in every respect his contractual obligations; but it happened that after the completion of this particular work a dispute arose as to whether the contractor was entitled to be paid for the whole of the selected material used in the construction of the embankments, or only for a portion thereof. Sketch \"D\" in evidence at the trial clearly indicates the contention of the Government engineers. A line is drawn between \"G\" and \"P\" in each embankment, the bottom of the line indicating that portion of the bottom of its bed to which from the prism of the canal the top soil was to be removed and the seats prepared so as to make a good connection with the first layer of earth forming the base of the embankment, and the Government engineers claim that they have a right to draw from that point to the top of the embankment\u2014each engineer upon the different sections having a different angle\u2014and to say that only that portion of the embankments marked as \"F\" is a \"water-tight embankment\" within the meaning of the specification, the remaining portion of the embankments marked as \"G\" forming no part of such embankments, and that the contractor is not entitled to payment for that portion of them. As I have stated, there is no dispute as to the amount of material either in \"F\" or \"G,\" whether as regards quantity or quality. The lines drawn as in the sketch through the embankments are purely imaginary ones. There is no difference in any respect between the work or material in \"F\" and in \"G\" (except as to the foundations), nor was there anything communicated to the contractor nor any indication given to him, but that the whole of the embankments as originally planned and as eventually constructed were to be otherwise than indicated in the plan forming part of the original contract. It was admitted at the argument, and the evidence showed, that had the embankments been built in the shape indicated in \"F\" they would have been altogether insufficient for the purpose; that they might possibly last for a season or so, but that they could not be considered as permanent or as properly constructed water tight embankments. Notwithstanding this, however, the engineers insisted that they had a right of their own motion, without reference to the contractor, to divide by an imaginary line the completed embankment, and to say that only a small portion of it (I have not been able to ascertain what particular portion or the dimensions of that portion) should be paid for by the Crown.\nUpon the completion of the embankments a progress estimate, purporting to be under section 25 of the contract, was made by the Chief Engineer of Government Railways, based upon this view of the engineers upon the ground, and the contractor was allowed for earth in water-tight embankments 450,733 cubic yards, amounting in price at 15 cents per cubic yard to $67,609.95. As a matter of fact the quantity of earth in those embankments, being selected material used in construction, was 1,103,713 cubic yards, the price for which, after deducting 10 per cent for shrinkage, at 15 cents per cubic yard, would be $149,001, making a difference in price of the amount claimed by the appellant on this appeal (less the 10 per cent deduction). The date of this progress estimate was 13th December, 1895. It appears that before this progress estimate or certificate was given by the chief engineer there had, as was natural, been differences and arguments between the contractor and Mr. Schreiber, who was Chief Engineer and Deputy Minister of Railways and Canals as well, as to whether the basis upon which the measurements for the material composing the water-tight embankments was correct in principle under the terms of the contract. The question was referred to the then Minister of Justice by the Department of Railways and Canals, and he gave an opinion based upon the statements then submitted to him as facts, that the contention of the engineers was the sound one, and it was acting upon that opinion as well as upon his own view that the chief engineer gave the limited certificate to which I have referred, of the 13th December, 1895. The contractor was dissatisfied with this action on the part of the chief engineer.. He prepared a new statement of his case, presenting additional evidence and urging its re-consideration. This new statement, together with all the papers in connection with the case, was again referred by the Department of Railways and Canals for opinion to the then Minister of Justice (Sir John Thompson having in the meantime died). In replying to this reference the law officers of the Crown advised the Department of Railways and Canals, in effect, that the appellant's contention was correct, and that his claim should be considered by the chief engineer as a legal one under the terms of the contract. Influenced by that opinion the Minister of Railways and Canals authorized the issue of a progress estimate in order to entitle the appellant to payment of his money, and thereupon the certificate in question upon this appeal was issued That certificate is as follows: FORM No. 7.\nTO THE ENGINEER MAKING THE ESTIMATE, INSERT AT\n1.

The Queen[34], the learned judge gave judgment in favour of the Crown; hence the appeal to this court.\nOnly one question has so far been fully argued before us, namely, the question of the validity of the certificate of the 27th February, 1896, but the merits of the case were necessarily involved in that question and were therefore incidentally touched upon, and it was understood at the close of the argument that if we were of opinion that the certificate was good the appeal should be allowed, and that no further argument as to the merits of the claim would be necessary.\nIt was contended at the argument before us that the certificate was bad, first, because it was not in the form prescribed by clause 25 of the contract, inasmuch as it did not specifically state that the work had been done to the satisfaction of the engineer; secondly, that it was bad because there had been a decision by the engineer upon the question in dispute, and that by section 8 of the contract such decision was final and irreversible; and thirdly, that it was bad because the certificate of the engineer was his certificate in form only; that in substance it was the certificate of a \"third party,\" namely, the Minister of Justice, upon whose opinion it was said to have been issued, and that such a certificate was no certificate within the meaning of section 25 of the contract.\nUpon the first of these points I am of opinion that the certificate sufficiently complied with section 25 of the contract, when taken in connection with the evidence and the circumstances of the case. The clause requires a certificate that the work for or on account of, which the certificate is granted, has been duly executed to the engineer's satisfaction, and that it should state the value of such work computed at the prices agreed upon or determined under the provisions of the contract. The schedule part of the certificate which has been set out states that it is a progress estimate of work done and materials delivered from the beginning of the work up to the 30th November, 1895; and it then states the price, the items, and the different kinds of work done up to that date. The chief engineer's letter to the secretary of his Department, enclosing the estimate, states that he encloses therewith duly certified for payment the estimate in question for work done and materials delivered in connection with the sections in question. The following is a copy of the letter above referred to:\u2014\nEXHIBIT 4.\nOFFICE OF THE CHIEF ENGINEER OF RAILWAYS AND CANALS.\nOTTAWA, 28th February, 1896.\nSir,\u2014I enclose herewith duly certified for payment an estimate, in favour of Mr. Geo. Goodwin for work done and materials delivered in connection with sections Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 7 on the Soulanges Canal up to the 30th November, 1895.\nGross Estimate, $376,970.40.\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nCOLLINGWOOD SCHREIBER,\nChief Engineer.\nPer L. K. JONES.\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment Railways and Canals,\nOttawa, Ont.*\nIn these documents constituting the certificate there is, therefore, over the signature of the Chief Engineer the statement that the \"estimate is correct,\" that the amount of money \"mentioned is due,\" and that the estimate has been \"duly certified.\" Having in view these statements it appears to me that it cannot be successfully contended that the certificate does not show that the work thereby certified for had been duly executed to the engineer's satisfaction. If the work was done as he certifies, it must mean\u2014done in accordance with the contract\u2014which means done to his satisfaction. When he said, as he did in the certificate, that the money was due, did it not necessarily mean that the work had been done to his satisfaction as the contract required? It necessarily meant this, otherwise he could not say that any money was due in respect of it. And if he said as he did, that the estimate was duly certified for payment, he, the chief engineer, knowing the requirements of clause 25, must be taken to have said that the work had been executed to his satisfaction, otherwise the requirements of the clause as to the certificate had not been duly complied with, and the estimate had not been duly certified. As a matter of fact that the work was done to the satisfaction of the engineer is proved beyond dispute. The evidence of Mr. Schreiber, conspicuously free as it was from impartiality or bias, is clear upon this point, as well as that of Mr. Coutlee, one of the engineers upon the ground, and others. There are no judgments of any court whose decisions we are bound to follow directly bearing upon the question, but such opinions or decisions as there are are all in favour of the validity of the certificate.\nIn Hudson on Building Contracts, second edition, page 294, that author states that it is his opinion on the authorities cited that\nif a certificate of payment and satisfaction is required, a certificate for payment will imply a certificate of satisfaction.\nIn Harman v. Scott[35] the contract provided for progress payments, and also that the balance of the stipulated price should be paid by the proprietor to the contractor within fourteen days from the architect's certificate being given that the works are completed to his satisfaction.\nThe architect gave a certificate in this form:\nI hereby certify that Messrs. S. Brothers are entitled to the sum of \u00a3135 13s 5d, being balance of amount due to them on account of extras for your house at S.\nThe New Zealand Court of Appeal held that this was a sufficient certificate by the architect under the contract that the works were completed to his satisfaction. Sir George Arvery, in delivering the judgment of the court, composed of himself and three other judges, said, at page 418:\nIn the present case the certificate of the architect implies the approval of the work done. He certifies the balance of amount due to the builder by the employer on account of the contracts on which his certificate was based, and in pursuance of which he issued that certificate which he knew he had no power to give except and until the works were completed to his satisfaction. Assuming therefore that the certificate was honestly given, it is not consistent with any other supposition than that the architect was satisfied with the manner in which the works had been completed.\nIn Clarke v. Murray[36] the contract provided that percentage payments should be made to the contractor at intervals during the progress of the works at the discretion of the architect upon certificates in writing under his hand, and the balance when the whole work was completed to his satisfaction and his certificate given to that effect. The architect certified that the contractor was entitled to receive the sum of \u00a364 19s 9d, this being the final certificate in full. The Supreme Court on a case reserved for the opinion of the full court held that that was a certificate to the effect that the whole of the work was completed to the architect's satisfaction, though the fact of satisfaction was not in terms expressed in the certificate. In Galbraith v. Chicago Architectural Iron Works[37], where the building contract provided as a condition precedent for payment that the architect should certify that the work had been done to his satisfaction, and upon the completion of the work the architect made his certificate omitting any reference to \"his own satisfaction,\" the Court of Appeal held that the certificate that the work was completed implied that it was done as the contract required and to the satisfaction of the architect.\nThe New York Court of Common Pleas, in 1894, in Snaith v. Smith, reported in 27 New York Supplement 379, held that an architect's certificate that \"there is now due to 'the contractor' the final payment of his contract,\" specifying the amount sufficiently complies with a contract requiring final payment within thirty days after completion provided that the architect should certify in writing that all the work upon the performance of which the payment is to become due has been done to his satisfaction.\nThese decisions confirm me in the opinion which I hold that the certificate, so far as this point is concerned, is sufficient in form and that the appellant's contention in this respect is the right one.\nAs to the second objection, namely, that the certificate of December 13th, 1895, had the effect of res adjudicata under clause 8 of the contract, I entertain no doubt whatever. This contention is based upon the assumption that there was a dispute within the meaning of clause 8; that there was an adjudication of such dispute, and that the certificate was the evidence of that adjudication. Now the evidence establishes conclusively that there never was in connection with this case any decision or adjudication at a]l by the engineer in a matter which under the contract he had authority or jurisdiction to decide. The question in dispute, as I have already indicated, was not a dispute as to the quantity or quality of the work or material, but as to the construction of the contract, the point being as to whether the embankment, as a whole, was to be paid for so far as it consisted of selected material, or whether it was competent for the government engineers after it was completed to divide it into two portions by an imaginary line and declare that only one of these portions was to be paid for and not the whole. That was a legal question, not a question of fact, the decision whereof was not given to the engineer but was a question to be settled by process of law, or as provided for by clause 33 of the contract, by a reference to the Exchequer Court. The decision of the engineer had no legal effect whatever so far as the legal question was concerned, whether that opinion was based upon advice of the law officers of the Crown or not. But even if it were so, the certificate of the engineer is not a decision within the meaning of the contract. The only office of the certificate under the contract is that it is a voucher to the department charged with the disbursement of public moneys that the claim is due, and at the same time the existence of such a certificate is a condition precedent to enable the contractor to obtain any money at all. That is its only purpose. It may of course be used by the claimant against the Crown in an action brought for the recovery of the money therein referred to as evidence in support of his claim, although even that in ordinary cases may be questioned. In the present case the certificate signed by Mr. Schreiber as chief engineer, in connection with the letter above set out from him to the Auditor General, writing in his capacity of Deputy Minister of Railways and Canals, does, in the absence of anything to the contrary, furnish conclusive evidence of the suppliant's claim. It may too be of service as evidence of a decision under clause 8 of the contract in a case where the engineer has jurisdiction, but even that is doubtful, as I think that the contract as a whole contemplates a written decision.\nMr. Goodwin in the present case is called a contractor because he has entered into a contract with the Crown. He is employed to do mechanical work for the Government. He is a contractor in the same way as any other employee is, and is entitled to be paid for his work when it is done. All parties are at liberty to make any stipulation they please as to the time and manner of compensation. It has been agreed in the present case that the contractor shall be paid for his monthly labour at the end of each month, subject to a reduction of ten per cent as security for good faith and as a guarantee that the whole contract will be completed; but it is further provided that a certificate of the kind specified must be produced before payment can be exacted. The certificate is nothing more, as I have said, than an instrument required to be signed by responsible officers of the Crown as evidence that the money demanded has been duly earned.\nThese considerations help us to come to a conclusion upon the third objection to the certificate, viz.: that it is not Mr. Schreiber's certificate, but the certificate of Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper, the then Minister of Justice. I am not prepared to say that even if Mr. Schreiber had under the contract authority to make a decision upon a question of law as the present is, he would not be perfectly justified in applying to the law officers of the Crown for advice and of following that advice even if he, a layman, were of opinion that such advice was erroneous. A judge in investigating a question which he is called upon judicially to decide may endeavour to obtain light from any source. He may consult books, the opinions of his brother judges whether verbally expressed or forming part of written jurisprudence generally, and he may act upon the opinions which he has heard or read, even though they may not at first commend themselves to his judgment.; But in the present case it was clearly Mr. Schreiber's duty to seek legal advice from the authority appointed by statute to give it, (see R. S. C. ch. 21, secs. 3 and 4), upon the legal question to be settled, before he could give a certificate at all. The contractor had been already paid, as I understand, for the work as originally allowed. Whether he should be paid the balance of the claim depended upon the conclusion to which the department came as to the merits of the legal controversy. It was only upon the settlement, so far as the Railway Department was concerned, of that legal question that any certificate could be given in respect to the remainder of the claim, and upon the settlement of it by the department upon the advice of the Minister of Justice it then became the clear duty of the chief engineer to measure the work and to compute the price for it under the provisions of the contract in that regard. It must be borne in mind that neither Sir John Thompson nor Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper expressed or was asked to express an opinion upon the quality, quantity or price of the work in question. They in no way sought to influence or did influence the engineer in his conclusions upon these points. In regard to them he exercised his jurisdiction and delivered his judgment solely upon his own responsibility and upon the information furnished him by his subordinate officers. The effect of the certificate so far as this point is concerned is that Mr. Schreiber has adopted the law as laid down by the law officers of the Crown and has made the measurements and fixed the price, assuming that opinion to be correct. I do not think the certificate can be objected to upon that ground. Further, I think it is reasonably clear from the special provisions of the contract, namely, clauses 26 and 27, which are above set out, that the monthly certificate was not a decision upon any legal question. Doubtless the contractor complied with the provisions of these two clauses and this claim was made and repeated in pursuance thereof.\nOne other point remains to be considered, viz., how far the decision in Murray v. The Queen[38] affects this case. We are all of opinion that it does not, notwithstanding the perhaps just criticism of the learned Exchequer Court Judge upon the phraseology of certain portions of it. In that case there was no question as to the form of the certificate, because all such objections were, at the instance of the court, formally waived, and the statement upon which the learned judge relies was a statement, not made in the course of a discussion of law involved in the case, but merely in a statement of the reasons which moved the court to insist upon a specific waiver. Inasmuch then as it was not a point in controversy in the argument of that case as to what form a certificate like the one in question must necessarily take, any statements of law upon that point were obiter dicta, and therefore, though entitled to consideration, not binding upon other tribunals.\nIt was further argued before us that the judgment in that case was conclusive upon the contention to which I have already referred, that the first certificate was an adjudication and that the engineer was functus officio at the time he made the second certificate, but the contract in that case was in this particular essentially different from the contract in the present case. By its express terms it was there provided that the engineer should not only have the authority which he has in the present case, but that all matters in dispute whether of fact or law might be decided by him, and that his decision was to be final. In this contract his power to decide is of a much more limited and restricted character. He can decide and only decide upon disputes as to quantity or quality.\nI would have dealt at greater length with some of the questions involved, had they not been most fully and satisfactorily discussed by my brother Girouard.\nIn consequence of the agreement come to at the close of the argument, there must be judgment for the appellant, we being of opinion that the certificate of the 27th February, 1896, is sufficient in form to comply with the provisions of clause 25 of the contract, and that its production satisfies the condition precedent therein specified, and that so far as it is concerned the appellant is entitled to judgment. The original judgment of Mr. Justice Burbidge enlarged unconditionally to the amount of the certificate stated upon the reference will stand to take effect from its date, the appellant being entitled to all costs in this Court and the Exchequer Court.\nThe parties will be heard on the question of interest.\nKING J.\u2014The works contracted for were, in the main, of the kind\" where the surface level of the water in the canal was higher than the ground alongside.\" The price for earth excavation\u201420 cents per cubic yard\u2014covered the hauling and forming of it into embankment, as well as the excavating, but it was provided that, in the case of such portions of the embankment as might be made water-tight under clause 11 of the specifications, there was to be a further allowance of 15 cents per cubic yard of embankment.\nClause 11 is as follows:\nWherever the surface level of the water in the canal is higher than the ground alongside, water-tight banks shall be made when so directed. In these cases the top soil must be removed for such width and depth as may be considered necessary to form the embankment seats. The material arising from this mucking to be deposited where pointed out. It will be paid for as ordinary earth excavation. The seats shall also be well roughed up with a plough so as to make good bond with the first layer of earth forming the base of the embankments. Puddle walls or cut offs to be made where required\u2014the puddle to be prepared and laid as specified hereafter. When the bank seats are properly prepared, inspected and approved\u2014and not till then\u2014the bank shall be carried up in layers, of selected material, of about eight inches in thickness, well spread\u2014the lumps broken\u2014watered\u2014trodden down or otherwise compacted and carefully shaped to the heights and slopes given by the engineer. Only such portions of the embankments as shall be laid out by the engineer, and made up in strict accordance with the foregoing specification, will be paid for as \"earth in water-tight banks.\"\nThe plans exhibited at the time, and forming part of the contract, showed the general embankment, but did not in any way distinguish the water-tight portion. Detail drawings as the work proceeded were, however, provided for, but so far as regards the water-tight banks no detail drawings were at any time given to the contractor. Certain things, however, were done on the ground and certain directions given which, it is claimed, sufficiently indicated what was to be done.\nThe centre line of the canal, as also the inner and outer side-lines of the general embankments, were shown upon the ground by lines of stakes. Between these latter, and at a distance from the centre line of the canal of from 101 to 112 feet, another line of stakes was set by the engineer. These were called mucking stakes, and their clear and understood purport was to indicate that the top soil was to be removed from the area of the general embankment as far back as this line of stakes with a view to the forming of the seats of the water-tight embankments.\nThis top soil was accordingly removed by the contractor, and deposited by direction of the engineer upon the adjacent embankment area lying immediately outside of the line of mucking stakes. Here also was deposited the top soil taken from the prism of the canal, and also that from an outer space required for a ditch. The effect of this was to accumulate upon that part of the area of the general embankment lying outside of the mucking stakes, a considerable body of loose and porous top soil which, ex hypothesi of the specification, was not deemed suitable for the formation of watertight bank. The stripped portion of embankment area was then roughed up with a plough in order that it might form a good bond with the first layer of earth which, when deposited, would form the base of the water-tight embankment.\nThis completed the preparation of the seat of the water tight embankment, and, when inspected and approved, the bank, i.e. the water-tight portion of the embankment, was then to be carried up,\u2014by which is meant that it was to be carried up upon its base, the layer of earth in contact and bond with the prepared seat,\u2014in layers of selected earth of about eight inches in thickness, well spread, the lumps broken, watered, trodden down, or otherwise compacted, and carefully shaped to the heights and slopes given by the engineer.\nThe excavated material taken from the prism of the canal after removal of the surface soil was of a kind peculiarly well suited for the making of water-tight bank, and, in the opinion of the engineer, it was possible to dispense with the special requirements for compacting mentioned in the specification. The evidence shews that the minimum of labour was put upon it. Then inasmuch as about all the excavated material was of this select quality, it was used in the formation of the entire embankment, the only difference in the treatment of it being, (as stated by Mr. McNaughton), that more care was taken in the spreading of it as far back as the mucking stakes. As completed, the front and the rear portions of the embankment differed then in this:\u2014that the front portion was composed of the select material from top to bottom, and its base rested on and formed a bond with the prepared seat, while the rear portion was composed, above, of the select material, but below it was an accumulation of discarded and porous surface soil, resting on other surface soil in a natural and unprepared state, and therefore manifestly, and upon the evidence, not impervious to water that might reach it.\nThe omission of plans shewing the exterior slope of the front portion of the embankment, and the omission in point of fact to give to it an independent shaping, were not material, considering the uniform good quality of the material (apart from the top soil) used throughout the entire formation. To require this could only have involved the contractor in unnecessary expense, and, like the dispensing with the requirements for compacting, was advantageous to the contractor.\nIt was suggested that, in the absence of plans of water tight banks, the whole embankment is to be taken as having been laid out by the engineer as such But it seems to me that neither could the engineer have intended to lay out for water-tight embankment the area upon which he directed the discarded porous surface soil to be deposited, nor could the contractor reasonably have supposed, from anything done or omitted to be done by the engineer, that it was so intended. Of course the question is not whether the embankment was or was not water-tight in fact, nor whether it needed to be kept in position by the support of other material, but whether it was laid out and directed to be constructed as for water-tight embankment having regard to the description of it contained in the contract.\nWhen, therefore, the chief engineer had occasion early in the execution of the contract to estimate the quantity of earth formed into water-tight embankment, he correctly treated such embankment as limited to what was carried up upon the prepared seats.\nOn the 16th November, 1893, the contractor, in a letter addressed to the Minister of Railways and Canals, objected to this, and claimed that \"according to the contract the whole of the embankment should be paid for at 15 cents per yard,\" alleging that the whole had been laid out by the engineer as watertight embankment.\nThis claim, although renewed, was as often rejected by the chief engineer, in successive estimates. In March, 1895, the contractor presented to the Minister a fully reasoned statement in favour of his view. This appears to have been submitted to the chief engineer, who, after full inquiry and hearing the contractor, decisively rejected the claim, both in departmental communications, and by his certificate number 23 covering all work down to and including the month of November, 1895. In this the total of earth excavation was given at 1,103,713 cubic yards, and the total of earth in water-tight embankments at 450,733 cubic yards. The amount found to be due on this estimate was paid to the contractor less amounts paid on previous certificates.\nThe contractor continued notwithstanding to press his views upon the department, and in the result, in consequence of an opinion from the Justice Department to the effect that the contractor's claim ought to be entertained, another estimate (no. 24) was prepared to give effect to this view covering the same work and period as that of no. 23. In this the number of cubic yards of excavation was given, as before, at 1,103,713, but the quantity of earth in water-tight embankment at the full quantity of excavated earth with deduction for shrinkage, making 993,340 cubic yards instead of 450,733, as before, that is to say, the entire canal embankment was treated as water-tight bank under the contract.\nIn certifying this the chief engineer, in words inserted by him between the signature of his name and that of his office, declared that as regarded item No. 5, i. e., as to the earth in water-tight embankment, he certified in accordance with the letter of the Deputy-Minister of Justice dated 15th January, 1896.\nBefore the money was paid upon this, the department reverted to the opinion of the chief engineer, and in these proceedings questions the binding character of the certificate.\nUnder this contract the engineer was impliedly empowered to determine, at least provisionally, all questions that might require decision in order to enable him to make his certificate, but he was (amongst other things) to compute the value of the work according to the prices named. His position was similar to that of the surveyor in McDonald v. Mayor of Workington[39], of whom Lord Esher said:\nHe is an independent person. His duty is to give the certificate according to his own conscience, and according to what he conceives, to be the right and truth as to the work done, and for that purpose he has no right to obey any order or any suggestion by these people who are called his masters. For that purpose they are not his masters.\nBut the works owner may waive a certificate to the extent that it makes for him or to such end may discharge the certifying engineer from the obligation to exercise his own judgment. This in effect is what was done here. The department in effect says to him: \"Never mind your own opinion. We know what you think, but we think differently, and we desire you to act on our opinion and not upon your own.\" And to show that his own mind did not go with his act the chief engineer was careful to explain how he came to add his signature. Such a certificate may be evidence of an admission of liability on the part of the works owner, or some evidence tending towards proof of waiver, but it is not, as it seems to me, the certificate contemplated by the contract.\nFurther, if the certificate had purported to express the mind of the chief engineer, and there had been no assent to it, it would have been open to objection by the works owner as being ultra vires inasmuch as the engineer had previously rejected the claim. By clauses 26 and 27 it is provided that in case claims of the contractor are not included in the progress certificate he may, until such claims are finally adjusted or rejected, repeat them in writing to the engineer within thirty days after the date of the despatch to the contractor of each and every certificate in which he alleges such claims to have been omitted. Claims might be of such a nature that their omission from a progress certificate would not imply their rejection, but the claim here made by the contractor was such that the determination in certificate no. 23 that the total quantity of earth excavation was 1,103,713 cubic yards, and that the quantity of earth in water-tight banks was but 450,733 cubic yards, was a rejection (after a full hearing) of the contractor's claim to be allowed, as for earth in water-tight embankment, the quantity of earth in the entire embankments, and it was not competent for the engineer afterwards to reverse this determination.\nThe consent of the works owner to this being done did not amount to a contract, but was a bare assent to the engineer doing something, or rather a direction to him to do something which under the contract it was not competent for him to do. Under the contract a certificate of the engineer made within its provisions would, if approved by the Minister, create a debt due; and in relation to matters within the competence of the engineer to decide, I am inclined to think that an ascent of the works owner adopted by the engineer as his own conclusion could not be retracted after the making of the certificate. But here the effect sought to be given to the certificate in question is to give to it a validity which, without such assent, it could not have, and this in two respects, viz.: in reversing his own determination expressed after hearing the contractor, and secondly, in computing the value of the work otherwise than according to the contract, as for example, in the allowance of more than 20 cents per cubic yard for top soil removed in the process of mucking.\nFor these reasons i think the appeal should be dismissed.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014Besides the reasons which have been advanced by Mr. Justice Sedgewick, I propose to offer a few remarks upon the validity of the engineer's certificate, which is the only point submitted for our determination.\nThe principal, and I may say the only, serious objection raised by the Crown to the form of the monthly estimate of the engineer of the 26th of February, 1896\u2014which it is sufficient to examine independently of the reservations made by the resident superintendent engineer\u2014is that it has been certified by the chief engineer on the 27th of the same month \"in accordance with letter of Deputy Minister of Justice, dated 15th January, 1896.\" Taking for granted that he was sole judge of all matters in dispute under the contract, did he agree to the views embodied in that letter? Undoubtedly he did and deliberately so. He had ample time to consider the matter, the letter having been written more than a month previously. We must suppose that he is an intelligent, competent, firm and fair man as he is represented to be the sole arbiter between the parties, though in Her Majesty's service in the double capacity of Chief Engineer and Deputy Minister of the Department of Railways and Canals. He did not remonstrate nor resist, but very properly, in my opinion, accepted the final decision of the Minister of Justice, the law adviser of the Crown designated by statute, upon a point which was considered by him and both the Crown and the contractor as one of construction of contract, and a legal question. Naturally, he certified the estimate in accordance with that decision, thereby concurring in it. No threat or coercion was used to induce him to sign. I am inclined to apply here the general rules which govern consent in contracts; error, fraud, violence or fear alone vitiate such consent. Nothing of the kind is suggested.\nThe estimate of the 26th of February, 1896, was certified by the chief engineer on the 27th as above stated, but on the following day, the 28th, he despatched by letter his certificate to the Department of Railways and Canals without any qualification whatever, enclosing at the same time the estimate \"duly certified for payment\"; and on the same day that Department likewise requested, in the usual form, the Auditor General to pay the appellant without any reservation. The Crown informs us in its statement of defence that the Auditor General refused to do so. It is conceded, however, that this refusal has no importance to the determination of the case.\nThe letter of the 28th of February clearly shows that the chief engineer never intended that his signature of the 27th \"in accordance with letter of Deputy Minister of Justice, dated 15th January, 1896,\" should be regarded as qualifying the certificate; in doing so, he properly thought\u2014and says so in his evidence\u2014that upon a question of this kind, he should express that he was guided by the opinion of the Minister of Justice; and it seems to me no better authority could be consulted or quoted so far as the Crown is concerned. At all events, his letter of the 28th establishes beyond doubt that on that day at least he considered the estimate as \"duly certified for payment.\"\nOn the same day the engineer's certificate was approved in writing, without any qualification, by the Deputy-Minister of Railways and Canals, duly authorized to do so under the provisions of the Act respecting the Department of Railways and Canals[40], and it is further proved that, as a matter of fact, this approbation was given with the express sanction of the Minister personally; so both the Minister, Mr. Haggart, and his Deputy, Mr. Schreiber, declare under oath. Mr. Haggart\u2014and the respondent had an opportunity to cross-examine him\u2014says in his affidavit:\n2. That I was fully aware long before the fifteenth of January last, of the nature of the claim of the claimant in question herein, and it was with my approval that the questions raised by said claim were referred to the Minister of Justice for opinion.\n3. That I read the opinion of the Minister of Justice of the 15th of January last, in reference to said claim shortly after said date and before the progress estimate of February last in question herein was given. 4. That I approved of the said estimate being given by the chief engineer and of the action of the Deputy-Minister in requesting by his letter of the 28th of February last the Auditor General to pay the same.\nIt is contended that Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper, Minister of Justice, referred to in the statement of defence, for reasons I do not appreciate, as \"a third party,\" although not named, had no power to interfere, as the matter had already been disposed of by Sir John Thompson, his predecessor in the Department. But the statute, creating the Department of Justice, imposes upon its Minister the duty to \"advise the Crown upon all matters of law referred to him by the Crown,\" and as Attorney-General, to advise \"the heads of the several departments of the Government upon all matters of law connected with such departments\"[41], no matter how many times they are referred to him. Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper came to a conclusion different from that of Sir John Thompson, but after a new hearing and the production of fresh evidence, and more particularly of an exhaustive and elaborate statement from the claimant, a report from the resident superintendent engineer and three letters from his assistants, who moreover were examined orally.\nThe main objection to the validity of the certificate is, that by considering the claim of the appellant in the first instance the engineer has put an end to his authority and is functus officio. But even if he had jurisdiction in the matter his certificate was not the final one; the contract directs that monthly certificates will be issued by the engineer, and expressly provides that the contractor may repeat any claim or claims omitted \"until finally adjusted or rejected.\" The following are the clauses in the contract upon this point; 26. It is intended that every allowance to which the contractor is fairly entitled, will be embraced in the engineer's monthly certificates; but should the contractor at any time have claims of any description which he considers are not included in the progress certificates, it will be necessary for him to make and repeat such claims in writing to the engineer within thirty days after the date of the despatch to the contractor of each and every certificate in which he alleges such claims to have been omitted.\n27. The contractor in presenting claims of the kind referred to in the last clause must accompany them with satisfactory evidence of their accuracy, and the reason why he thinks they should be allowed. Unless such claims are thus made during the progress of the work, within thirty days, as in the preceding clause, and repeated in writing every month, until finally adjusted or rejected, it must be clearly understood that they shall be forever shut out, and the contractor shall have no claim on Her Majesty in respect thereof.\nOn the 16th of November, 1893, in due time and form, the appellant first presented his claim to the Department of Railways and Canals for a certain increase of the certificate for work relating to earth and water-tight banks, contending that a true interpretation of the specifications justified the same. It was considered by Sir John Thompson, Minister of Justice, and by him rejected for reasons which are fully set forth in his written opinion of the 28th of February, 1894; but his decision was given or communicated only to the Department of Railways and Canals, and not to the contractor, who was merely advised by the Secretary of Railways and Canals on the 28th of August, 1894, that in the opinion of the Minister of Justice, \"the specifications do not admit of the construction placed on them by you,\" and that \"the department therefore in view of such opinion must decline to entertain these claims.\" From that date, that is the 28th of August, 1894, as before, his claim was simply ignored in the monthly estimates or certificates, which moreover were never \"despatched\" to him as directed in clause 26 of the contract, except at the time of the institution of the present proceeding or reference, when he was allowed to have a copy of the same; until then cheques only for their respective amounts were given to him from time to time.\nThe chief engineer did not reach any conclusion until the 20th of August, 1895, when the matter had been re-opened and was still pending before the Minister of Justice at the request of the contractor and by the direction of the Minister of Railways and Canals. His decision was never delivered, or communicated or even mentioned to the contractor except after the commencement of the present proceeding.\nTherefore, so far as the contractor was concerned, his claim stood at all times as having been simply \"omitted\" in the monthly certificates. As I read clauses twenty-six and twenty-seven of the contract, even claims coming within the exclusive jurisdiction of the engineer, and repeated by the contractor, but simply \"omitted\" in the progress certificates, may be considered and reconsidered by the engineer till his authority is exhausted by the completion of the work and the despatch of his final certificate, and he may do so as often as he pleases, \"until finally adjusted or rejected;\" and even if finally adjusted or rejected, I am inclined to think that he may reconsider his decision by and with the consent of the parties; (see Amer. & Eng. Encycl. of Law, vo. \"Arbitration and Award,\" 2 ed. pp. 790, 791, 808); but it is not necessary to decide that question this case\u2014which is very different from Murray v. The Queen[42], where the revision was made by a succeeding engineer at the request of the Crown only. It is sufficient to say that no previous adjustment or rejection, no adjudication in fact, as contemplated by the contract was ever made; and consequently the certificate of the 27th of February, 1896, purporting to adjust the claim of the appellant, approved by the Minister of Railways and Canals, and accepted by the contractor, is valid, final and binding.\nFinally, and this seems to be the decisive argument, it must be borne in mind that the engineer is not, as in Murray v. The Queen[43], the sole judge and arbitrator of all matters and differences which may arise under the contract. Under clause 8, he is the sole judge of work and material in respect of both quantity and quality, and his decision on all questions in dispute with regard to work or material shall be final.\nBut the question involved is not one of work and material, quantity or quality; there is no dispute as to that; it is one of construction of the contract, or, to speak more correctly, of the specifications which are declared to form part of the contract; it is a legal question, and was so considered by the engineer, the Crown and the contractor, and also by Sir John Thompson, Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper and the trial judge; all agree as to that point, and it is admitted in the statement of defence of the Crown:\n9. The said engineer was not, under said contract, authorized to decide any question as to the meaning or intention of the contract, specifications and drawings, and the respondent will contend that in so far as the certificate referred to in the statement of claim determined or purported to determine a question of construction of said contract or specifications, it is not binding.\nUnder clause thirty-three of the contract, a question of such a nature must be determined, not by the engineer as formerly under Government contracts, but by the Exchequer Court of Canada.\n33. It is hereby agreed that all matters of difference arising between the parties hereto upon any matters connected with or arising out of this contract the decision whereof is not hereby especially given to the engineer, shall be referred to the Exchequer Court of Canada, and the award of such court shall be final and conclusive.\nIt is difficult to understand how this clause of the contract can be worked out fairly to both parties. Of course, it is not sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the Exchequer Court; it contemplates a reference under section twenty-three of the Exchequer Court Act. But what will be the remedy of the contractor if the Minister of Railways and Canals refuses or neglects to refer the special case to the Exchequer Court? Perhaps he would be entitled to a Petition of Right. It is not necessary to examine this point, as the present claim has been duly referred to that court.\nClause thirty-three shews beyond doubt that legal differences do not fall within the exclusive province of the engineer; they are in fact excluded from it by the very terms of the contract. If any should arise, he should call the attention of the parties to it, if not known to them, and wait till a binding decision be reached by them; and finally, by framing his certificate in accordance with the legal decision he receives from them, he merely performs a ministerial duty, so as to comply with clause twenty-five of the contract which requires the engineer's certificate as a condition precedent.\nThat decision may be reached in two ways; first, judicially, by obtaining the award of the Exchequer Court of Canada; or secondly, by coming to a mutual solution. It is not supposed that the opinion of the Minister of Justice is binding upon the crown any more than it is upon the contractor; but if carried out by the engineer in his certificate and accepted by the parties, as undoubtedly it was in this case, namely, by the contractor and the Minister of Railways and Canals representing the Crown in the contract under powers conferred upon him by the statute[44], upon what ground of law or equity can the Crown now object to the engineer certifying upon that advice, and appeal to the Exchequer Court? None can be set up seriously; and it seems to me the Crown is estopped from doing so.\nAs long as the parties consider that a just decision has not been reached in respect of such legal or any other exceptional matter, not coming within the exclusive province of the engineer, it is competent for, and indeed the duty of, the Crown, acting by its duly constituted representatives, to rectify that decision and direct at any time, either before or after a reference to the Exchequer Court, the engineer to issue a certificate according to law and justice, and thus avoid useless and expensive litigation before the Exchequer Court and this court. Unless such a course can be adopted the Department of Railways and Canals never can legally settle a claim like the present one, and in every instance an award of the Exchequer Court will be the only remedy, a conclusion utterly untenable in my opinion. Such a rule would seriously impede the administration of a great department like that of Railways and Canals.\nI consider, therefore, the certificate of the Chief Engineer of the twenty-seventh of February, 1896, approved by the Minister of Railways and Canals, as perfect and final and binding upon the Crown and the contractor; and judgment should be entered in favour of the appellant for the amount of the same, in principal and costs as prayed for; the question of interest being reserved in pursuance of agreement between the parties.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A.

(Plaintiffs)\nRespondents\n1898: Feb. 15; 1898: May 6.\nPresent:\u2014Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick, King and Girouard\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nAssignment for benefit of creditors\u2014Preferred creditors\u2014Money paid under voidable assignment\u2014Levy and sale under execution\u2014Statute of Elizabeth.\nWhere an assignment has been held void as against the statute, 13 Eliz. c. 5, and the result of such decision is that a creditor who had subsequently obtained judgment against the assignor and, notwithstanding the assignment, sold all the debtor's personal property so transferred, becomes entitled to all the personal property of the assignor levied upon by him under his execution, such creditor has no legal right and no equity to an account or to follow moneys received by the assignee or paid by him under such assignment in respect to which he has not secured a prior claim by taking the necessary proceedings to make them exigible.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], dismissing an appeal by the present appellants and affirming the judgment of the trial judge which declared that a certain deed of assignment was fraudulent and void as against the creditors of the assignor, appointed a receiver to his estate and directed accounts to be taken of such portion thereof as may have come into the hands of the present appellants either under the said deed of assignment or otherwise.\nOne Neil McKinnon made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors, to Selden W. Cummings, a solicitor, who acted under a power of attorney from the appellants. Shortly after the making of the assignment, Robert Taylor, one of the appellants, recovered judgment, which he recorded against the lands so assigned and issued an execution thereon against McKinnon under which the sheriff levied upon and sold the assignor's personal property remaining at the time of levy. The assignee thereupon took action against the sheriff for the conversion of the said personal property, and the sheriff justified under the execution, and attacked the assignment under the statute, 13 Eliz. ch. 5. The trial judge in that action decided in favour of the plaintiff, and upheld the assignment, and his judgment was sustained on appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banc, but on further appeal, was reversed by the Supreme Court of Canada[2].\nIn January, 1895, between the date of the argument of the last appeal and the delivery of judgment by the Supreme Court of Canada, the assignor brought his books to the appellants' office and assigned the book debts to them.\nThe present action was commenced in June, 1895, by the respondents, judgment creditors of McKinnon, against him, his assignee and two preferred creditors, the appellants and The Peoples' Bank of Halifax, claiming:\u2014(a) A declaration that the said deed of assignment was fraudulent and void as against the plaintiffs and other creditors of the said assignor; (b) An account from the appellants of all property, money and assets received or paid by them under the provisions of said deed of assignment; (c) Payment of the respondent's claim out of any property, moneys, and assets received by the appellants under said assignment; (d) The appointment of a receiver for all the property, moneys, and assets hereinbefore mentioned; and the usual injunction, orders, directions, and so forth.\nThe appellants admitted the deed to be void for the reasons expressed in McDonald v. Cummings[3], but denied any liability to account for the moneys received by them or for the book debts assigned to them. They set up (a) the sale of the personal property of the insolvent under the execution of the plaintiff, Robert Taylor; (b) that all the moneys received for goods or debts, with the exception of $169, had been paid over by the debtor to creditors; (c) that these payments amounted to $839.88 and were made before the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada above referred to, and to the creditors intended to be preferred by the said deed of assignment, including the Peoples' Bank of Halifax, and (d) that the balance of the moneys, said $169, came into the hands of the defendant, Selden W. Cummings, and was by him paid over to the appellants shortly after the said judgment in pursuance of an order made shortly before the said judgment by the debtor McKinnon on the said Selden W. Cummings, in favour of the appellants, creditors of the said Neil McKinnon. They alleged also that McKinnon at the same time assigned the balance of his book debts, the only other asset outside the land, to the appellants, and after the said judgment and before this action was commenced that the respondents delivered the books of account to the appellants and assented to the transfer.\nThe action was tried before Townshend J. without a jury and the learned judge, so far as the respondents on this appeal are affected, decided that, at the time the moneys were received by them, and the debts were assigned to them, they were aware that the deed had been attacked as fraudulent and void and under the decision of the court in Cox v. Worrall[4] they could not retain the same against the creditors in the action.\nThe result was that the deed of assignment made by McKinnon to Selden W. Cummings, was declared fraudulent and void as against the creditors of the assignor; that a receiver was appointed for all the moneys, assets and property of the assignor, and that an account was ordered to be taken of the same which have come into the hands of defendants, William Cummings & Son, either under the deed of assignment or otherwise, and also from the defendant, McKinnon.\nA decree was taken on that judgment, and the present appellants appealed therefrom and from the decree thereon to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc. The appeal was heard before Weatherbe, Graham and Henry JJ. who were unanimous in dismissing the appeal, and the formal judgment dismissing the appeal of William Cummings & Son, also dismissed an appeal of the defendant, McKinnon, and made each of the said appellants liable for all the costs of the appeal. From that judgment the present appeal is taken.\nLovett for the appellants. In this action the plaintiffs, the present respondents, sought to follow the sum of $200 paid by the assignor, McKinnon, to the Peoples' Bank under the deed of assignment, into the hands of that corporation. Their action was dismissed by the trial judge and the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on the ground that the Peoples' Bank was a bon\u00e2 fide payee for value without notice, and on appeal to this court the judgments below were affirmed[5]. We refer to the opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Sedgewick at pages 592 and 593. The trial judge decided against the present appellants in deference to the opinion of the majority of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in Cox v. Worrall[6], now overruled and expressly stated that but for that case he would have dismissed the action as against them, and the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia also followed Cox v. Worrall.\nThere are only two views to be taken of the facts. 1st. William Cummings & Son being creditors of Neil McKinnon received the assets under the deed on account of the claim due to them by McKinnon and for which they were preferred. 2ndly. They received these assets from the debtor independent of the deed and in payment of a bon\u00e2 fide claim against him. In the first view of the facts the appellants are clearly within the decision quoted above. In the second view their position is still stronger because they are in the position of creditors obtaining payment from their debtor, and if other creditors have no equity to follow money paid by the assignee under the deed, they certainly have no equity to follow payments made by the debtor to other creditors independent of the deed.\nThe appellants refer to the following authorities:\u2014Higgins v. York Buildings Co.[7]; Reese River Silver Mining Co. v. Atwell[8]; Cornish v. Clark[9]; Bott v. Smith[10]; Blenkinsopp v. Blenkinsopp[11]; In re Maddever[12]; Longeway v. Mitchell[13]; Wills v.

Worrall[23], per Townshend J.\nSo far as the assignment of the book debts is concerned that instrument is not impeached in this action and there was no evidence on which it could be impeached.\nThe receiver is not entitled to recover from these appellants the money and property received by them in right of the debtor, since the transaction remains good as between the debtor and the appellants and in any event the appellants could set off their debt in an action by the receiver and he can not recover in right of the assignee, he is not put in the assignees shoes, and, in any event, the assignee could not recover the property. It is not established that the creditors attacking the deed have any equity to recover back property received from the debtor by other creditors. The statute of Elizabeth confers no such rights and outside of the statutes the equities are equal and the appellants are in possession.\nMcNeil for the respondents. The appellants were parties to the assignment and to the fraud which rendered it void, Cummings v. McDonald[24]. See also decision by Graham J. in the court below[25] at pages 168 et seq. Being parties to the fraud, although creditors of the assignor, they cannot retain what they obtained by virtue thereof. No person [can take advantage of his own wrong. Cox v. Worrall (1); Bury v. Murray[26]; Winslow's Private Arrangements between Debtors and Creditors, pp. 156-7; Knight v. Hunt[27]; Howden v: Haigh[28]; Higgins v. Pitt[29]. A person cannot avail himself of the fraud of another, unless he is innocent and has given some valuable consideration. A fortiori, a person who is cognizant of the fraud and a party to it cannot avail himself of the benefit gained thereby. Bury v. Murray[30] at page 84; Scholefield v. Tempter[31]; Huguenin v. Baseley[32] at page 289; Daubeny v. Cockburn[33] at page 643; Topham v. Duke of Portand[34] at page 569.\nThe respondents, before this action, recovered judgment for their debts against the assignor, and issued thereon legal executions, and realized all they could by virtue thereof. The assignment was in this action declared fraudulent and void, under the statute 13 Elizabeth, ch. 5, the appellants being not only cognizant of, but parties to the fraud which vitiated the deed. In an action to avoid the deed under such circumstances the respondents are entitled to an accounting from the appellants for all they received under the void deed, and all consequential relief by way of equitable execution.

Cummings by the assignment for the benefit of creditors, dated November 11th, 1892, and this was known to William Cummings;\u2014Because, the assignment for the benefit of the creditors was binding between the parties, and he was a party to the assignment, his firm, as creditors of the assignor, having executed the same, and,-\u2014Because after this assignment had been executed by the as signor, assignee, and any of the creditors, it was irrevocable.

The majority of the court, however, have come to the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Was of opinion that the appeal should be allowed for reasons given by Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014On the 11th November, 1892, one Neil McKinnon made a general assignment to the defendant Selden W. Cummings, he then being in insolvent circumstances. Robert Taylor, one of the present plaintiffs, who subsequently obtained judgment against McKinnon notwithstanding this assignment, issued execution, recorded it in the county where McKinnon's lands were situated, and under it sold through the sheriff all the personal property transferred by the assignment. The assignee, Selden W. Cummings, then brought his action against the sheriff claiming under the assignment. That action was decided in favour of Cummings by the courts in Nova Scotia, but upon appeal to this court we held that the assignment was void as against the statute, 13 Eliz., chap. 5[55], the result being that Taylor, the present plaintiff was held entitled to the proceeds of all of the personal property of McKinnon, levied upon by him under his execution. After that determination the plaintiff Taylor instituted these proceedings, making the insolvent trustee under the assignment, and William Cummings & Sons and the Peoples' Bank of Halifax, the latter having received benefits under it, defendants, by which they sought:\u2014\n(a.) A declaration that the assignment in question was fraudulent as against the plaintiff and the other creditors. (b.) An account from the defendants, other than the insolvent, of all moneys received under the assignment.\n(c.) Payment of the plaintiff's claim out of such moneys.\n(d.) The appointment of a receiver; and\n(e.) An injunction.\nIn that action a judgment was entered for the plaintiffs giving them the declaration and account asked for, and appointing a receiver. That judgment was sustained upon appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, except in regard to the Peoples' Bank, against which the action was dismissed. This is the second appeal before us from the judgment in question.\nIn the first appeal we decided that the claim of the plaintiff for an account against Wm. Cummings & Sons and the Peoples' Bank, with a view of making them pay over to the creditors the moneys received by them under the assignment on account of the assignor entitled to them was untenable; that under English law, in the absence of any right of, or interest in, property transferred no decree could be made dealing with it, except a decree setting aside the assignment attacked. It follows, we think, as a necessary consequence, that this appeal must be allowed. The plaintiffs are entitled to whatever benefits they can get from the fact that the assignment in question has been declared void and may adopt such remedies as they see fit in order to obtain recovery of the balance of their debt from any debts, personal property, or real estate upon which they have or had any lien or charge or other right under their judgments or under any execution issued upon them. But so far as the evidence shows they have never taken any steps by garnishee process to obtain a charge upon the debts of the insolvent, and as to the personal property they have already obtained the proceeds of it under their execution. As they have no interest, either legal or equitable, in the debts of the insolvent, they have no legal right except by taking the necessary statutory proceedings to make them exigible, nor have they any equity to follow the moneys received by the assignee under his deed or paid by him under it. If the decree in this case can be supported there would appear to be but little necessity for a bankruptcy law, as, if it can be supported, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia is itself a bankruptcy court empowered by its judgment, without any statutory or other authority that I am aware of, to take possession of an insolvent's estate and distribute it as it may think fit, whether ratably or otherwise, amongst creditors. The decree appealed from may be sustained so far as it contains a declaration that the assignment in question is void, but inasmuch as no case has been made out for the taking of an account or for the appointment of a receiver, the decree must be amended in that regard, the appellants being allowed all costs both here and in the court below.\nKING and GIROUARD JJ. concurred in the dismissal of the appeal for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: H.

LEE (PLAINTIFF)\nRespondent.\n1898: Feb 19; 1898: May 6\nPRESENT.\u2014Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick, King and Girouard JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEENSS BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE.)\nMaster and servant \u2014Negligence\u2014Accident, cause of\u2014Contributory negligence\u2014Evidence.\nIn an action for damages by an employee for injuries sustained while operating an embossing and stamping press, it appeared that when the accident causing the injury occurred, the whole of the employee's hand was under the press, which was unnecessary, as only the hand as far as the second knuckle needed to be inserted for the purpose of the operation in which he was engaged. It was alleged that the press was working at undue speed, but it was proved that the speed had been increased to such extent at the instance of the employee himself, who was a skilled workman.\nHeld, reversing the judgment sf the Court of Queen's Bench, that the injury occurred by a mere accident not due to any negligence of the employer, but solely to the heedlessness and thoughtlessness of the injured man himself, and the employer was not liable.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court, District of Montreal in favour of the plaintiff for $3,000 damages and costs.\nThe plaintiff brought his action for $6,000 damages for injuries sustained whilst employed by the defendants in operating an embossing and stamping press, which, he alleged, worked irregularly, and at too great speed and was not in good order, and that upon being urged to hurry his work his right hand was crushed in the press and had to be amputated. The defence was in effect that no fault was to be attributed to the defendants, but that the accident was due to the carelessness of the plaintiff himself in thrusting his hand too far into a dangerous machine in a manner quite unusual, unnecessary and improper.\nThe trial judge, Mr. Justice Archibald, found the defendant guilty of negligence, because it appeared that up to about two months previous to the accident the machine was geared to run at about 18 revolutions per minute; that the speed was increased so that it ran at the rate of about 29 revolutions per minute and that after the accident the machine was restored to its previous speed; that the operation of the machine was irregular, probably owing to the variable resistance offered by one or more large machines which were attached to the same shaft in defendant's premises; and that the lever provided to throw the press out of gear when necessary was uncertain in its action. The learned judge concluded that the speed at the time of the accident was excessive and dangerous, more especially when combined with the irregularity of the operation of the machine, and that the defendant, through his agent, was aware of the unsatisfactory condition and running of the machine previous to the accident in question, and should be held responsible in damages. The Court of Queen's Bench on the appeal affirmed the decision of the trial judge for practically the same reasons.\nG. Stuart Q.C. and Francis McLennan for the appellant. The plaintiff was a skilled workman and had himself asked to have the speed of the machine increased. No fault attributable to the defendant is shewn to have caused the accident, but it was rather the result of plaintiff's own imprudence. The defendants cannot be held liable for injuries unless they were actually the result of negligence clearly charge able against them. See remarks of Lord Chief Justice Coleridge in Smith v. Baker ([1]) at page 519, and by Mr. Justice Girouard in The Montreal Rolling Mills Co. v. Corcoran ([2]) at pages 599 and 600.\nSaint-Pierre Q. C. for the respondent cited 2 Sourdat, Responsabilit\u00e9, Nos. 912, 913, 913 ter; 20 Laurent, Nos. 474 and 475; Arts. 1053, 1055 C. C. and Lefebure Y. The Thomas McDonald Co. ([3]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGWYNNE J. The cause of action stated in the plaintiff's statement of claim in this case is: that the plaintiff was in the employment of the defendant in the working of an embossing and stamping press which is alleged to have worked irregularly and at too great speed, and was not in good order; that while engaged in this occupation his hand was crushed by the press; that in consequence his right hand had to be amputated, \" and that the accident was caused by the fault and negligence of the defendant who had urged the plaintiff to hurry his work.\"\nNow, as to this hurry, which thus appears to be made the gist of the action, all that appeared was that the plaintiff was given 5000 cards to emboss, and was told that the defendants wished to have them done that day and the evidence showed that the pies was capable of embossing ten thousand cards in nine hours. As to the speed at which the press was being worked it appears that the plaintiff, being a good workman, had himself some months previously procured the speed to be increased to that at which it was being worked when the accident occurred. As to the alleged irregularity in the working of the press all that appeared was that there was on the premises a large machine called a plating calendar which when worked was propelled by the same belting as that which propelled the embossing press at which the plaintiff worked, and when this plating calendar was set at work the effect which it had on the embossing press was to make it go a little slower and gradually to recover in a short time its regular speed; the irregularity thus caused was in the language of a witness: \"just a slight variation in the speed, but nothing noticeable, and it did not make the press dangerous.\" However the evidence showed that this plating calendar was not in operation at all on the day upon which the accident happened, so that all idea of the accident having been due to the alleged irregularity in the speed of the embossing press was dispelled.\nRobert Massie, one of the plaintiff's witnesses, alone gave intelligent evidence as to the actual cause of the accident. He saw the plaintiff immediately after its occurrence, he cleaned the press after the accident and had an opportunity of observing how it worked on that day and he said that it worked with perfect regularity. He said that he saw how the accident happened by finding on the floor a card having stamped on it the whole of the plaintiff's hand, which showed as indeed the hand itself did, that it had been for its whole length under the press when in operation, and the evidence showed that for the performance of the work in which the plaintiff was engaged, this was unusual, unnecessary and improper; that the hand need not be and should not be ever inserted further than the second knuckle either for the purpose of inserting or of withdrawing a card. It thus appears, we think, very clearly, that the plaintiff's misfortune occurred by the merest accident, due not to any negligence of the defendants but solely to the heedlessness, thoughtlessness and misadventure of the unfortunate young man himself. We are of opinion therefore that the appeal must be allowed with costs and the action dismissed out of the court below with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hatton McLennan.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Saint Pierre, P\u00e9lissier & Wilson.\n[1] [1891] A.

The plaintiff propounded the theory based upon her own evidence that in jumping to her position upon a box, upon which she was obliged to sit when at work, and which was insecurely fixed, she started the machinery by accidently pushing a lever with her knee and in falling thrust her other foot through the open front of the printing press into the machinery whilst in motion, whilst the defence suggested another theory, supported by evidence of the plaintiff's frivolous conduct at her work, that the injuries she received resulted wholly from her own recklessness and imprudence.\nStuart Q.C. and Franc\u00eds McLennan for the appellant.\nRobidoux Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is certainly a very singular case and an important one, not only as affecting the plaintiff who in some way or other has suffered an injury which has necessitated the amputation of the tips of two of her toes, but also as regards the character of the evidence necessary to be established in order to charge the defendants with responsibility for the injury. The case presented by the plaintiff in her evidence given upon her own behalf is that she was in the employment of the defendants working a small printing press; that on the morning of the 12th of February, 1896, she had got down from her seat where she had been working the press, for the purpose of putting away some ink, and she stopped the machinery; that shortly afterwards she returned to her seat, and that standing upon the left side of it she put one hand on the seat and the other on the table which was in front of the press, upon which she put her paper when at work, on the press and proceeded to make a jump into her seat, when, but how it happened she could not say, she pushed with her left knee the arm or lever by which the press is set in motion and her right foot got injured under the table which was in front of the press, but how or in what part of the press she could not say. All the explanation she could give was that on putting her hand on the seat it slipped a little. She gripped the table, and her foot was caught under the table but how or where she could not say. It appears however that she did get up on her seat, for she says that she remained for a few minutes upon it after the accident had happened, but that the pain was so great she came down and sat upon the frame of a window (which appears to have been behind her seat and about four feet distant therefrom); there she took off her shoe and found her shoe and her stocking cut and her foot bleeding. Another young woman who was working in the same room at the time, at the distance of about twenty feet from the plaintiff's seat, neither saw the accident occurring nor knew anything of its occurrence until she saw the plaintiff sitting on the window frame, when she went over to her and saw that she has injured.\nMr. Guyon, inspector of industrial establishments, was called as a witness for plaintiff. He examined the premises the day after the accident. He knew the machine. There are several in use in Montreal. The press he said was a good press, well fitted up in every particular, and furnished with all the protection against accidents known to the present time. He could not understand how the accident could have taken place. The plaintiff's foot, in his opinion, must in some way or other, but how he could not understand, have got into a coupling; that is the only way in which, in his opinion, the foot could have been caught. The couplings are on either side of the machine and two and a half feet apart. They are at the distance of thirty-three inches from the floor, and about ten or twelve inches under the table at which the plaintiff worked, in front of the press and just on a level with her seat; below that point there was no dangerous place whatever, none where the accident could, in his opinion, have occurred, and how her foot could have got there he could not understand; he never had heard of such an accident having occurred before. The plaintiff in performing her work had no occasion to put her foot there. The table in front of the press is about fifteen inches wide and the place where her foot must have caught being only ten or twelve inches under the table and on a level with her seat, she could have had no need of lifting her foot so high. It was, however, he said, much more easy to understand that the accident had occurred while she was sitting on her seat than that it should have occur red while she was getting into it when she would be standing on the floor. He does not think that an accidental blow struck with her knee upon the arm or lever with which the machinery is set in motion could have set it in motion to do that would require a pressure made with sufficient force to move from sixty to eighty pounds weight, but then to get the right foot into the coupling where it was injured while the left knee was pressing on the lever would, he says, have placed the plaintiff in a very extraordinary position in which she could not have well been without knowing it; a glance at the press, a plan of which was in evidence, will show this.\nThe coupling in which Mr. Guyon says that the plaintiff's foot must have been caught is just at the rear ex-231\/2 tremity of, and a few inches above, the lever which sets the machinery in motion. Now when the plaintiff proceeded to take her seat when she met with the accident she was standing, she said, on the left side of her seat with one hand which must have been her right hand, on the seat, and the other, the left, upon the table. She was thus standing between her seat and the handle of the lever with her back to the handle which projected a little from under and in front of the table in front of the press. She then made a jump to reach her seat, which having reached, the accident, according to her, must have occurred while she was in the act of jumping; and if during that period her left knee was pressing on the lever with such force as to set the machinery in motion while her right foot was in the coupling where it was injured, the position in which the plaintiff must have been would seem to be that she must have been pressing upon the lever, not with her left knee only, but with the whole weight of her body as its sole support. That certainly would have been a most extraordinary position for the plaintiff to have got into as incidental to a jump made to reach her seat, but it would be something more than extraordinary that a jump attended with such circumstances, or with any circumstances whatever they may have been which occasioned the injury to the plaintiff, should have terminated in placing her upon her seat, which by her own admission it certainly did. It is not surprising that Mr. Guyon should have been of opinion that it was easier to understand that, and more probable that, the accident must have occurred while the plaintiff was upon her seat rather than when in the act of getting on it. In the former case it would be possible for the plaintiff to have gotten her foot into the coupling, in the latter to all appearance impossible. The plaintiff could give no explanation whatever as to how her foot got into the place where it was injured. Mr. Guyon could not understand how the accident could have happened. It was the most extraordinary occurrence he had ever heard of: no like accident had ever occurred to his knowledge. The only evidence upon the point which was offered upon the part of the plaintiff was her own evidence and that of Mr. Guyon, and at the close of the plaintiff's case it was a matter Wholly of speculation and conjecture of which no intelligent explanation has been offered as to how the accident did in fact occur and what was its cause. Mr. Guyon said that he had instructed the defend ants to put some sort of a lattice in front of the lower part of the press, but he said that no press in Montreal, of which there were several like the one in question, had any such guard as that which he ordered. He did not order this with any view of thereby obviating any apparent or probable danger for he said that the press itself was furnished with all precautions against accident known to the present time, and he said that in no part of the press below the coupling was there any dangerous place. He did not order anything to be put in front of the coupling doubtless because in the ordinary use of the press for the purpose for which it was constructed it was impossible for the foot of any person whilst working at the press to get into that place, and as he could not understand how this accident could have occurred, he could not intelligently set about preventing its occurrence or he more probably rightly judged that there was no necessity of trying to obviate the occurrence of an accident which could not occur in the ordinary and proper use of the press, and which was of such an extraordinary nature that he could not understand how it could have occurred, and which having occurred no intelligent explanation of its occurrence had been offered. He also directed the defendants to furnish a seat with a back to it, not that such a seat would give any better security than the previous one against the recurrence of such an extraordinary and unexplained accident, but merely that young girls working the press, when tired, might have some support in order to rest themselves.\nThe defendants called some witnesses who pro-pounded a theory as to the place where the accident might have occurred other than the coupling spoken of by Mr. Guyon. Their evidence may be summarized as follows :\u2014They were of opinion that the plaintiff's foot had not been caught in the coupling. If it had been more than the tip of the toes would have been affected, and if the machinery had been in motion plaintiff's shoe and foot would have been cut clean across whereas the toe of the shoe was merely bent. It was impossible for the accident to have occurred either at the coupling or at any other part of the press unless when the plaintiff was sitting on her seat and then only by her purposely extending her leg and raising her foot to a point in the front part of the press where it had no business to be at the distance of from ten to twelve inches below the table. That as to the plaintiff having set the machinery in motion by a blow or a push with her left knee, this was quite impossible. That in point of fact the mode by which the machinery was set in motion was by a strong pull of the handle of the lever and not by a blow or a push upon it at all. Here it may be observed that if the plaintiff had had any intention of going to work at the press when she proceeded to take her seat in the manner described by her, it seems singular that she should not have pulled the lever to set the machinery in motion before proceeding to take her seat. However, according to the theory of the defendants the accident might have occurred without the machinery having been in motion. It appears that the plaintiff was in the constant habit, although frequently cautioned against continuing the practice, of amusing himself when not engaged at her work in rocking herself backwards and forwards on her seat assisting herself so to do by catching the table with her hands. Now in the upper part of a metal guard in the centre front of the press at a point at the distance of from ten to twelve inches below the table there is a small aperture which the right foot of the plaintiff could have reached if her leg had been properly extended under the table from her seat, but that was a position which the plaintiff could not be in if engaged in working the press. Now, into this aperture the toe of the plaintiff's right foot, if her leg should have been so extended, might (not easily but still possibly) have been inserted, but not so as to reach the machinery. If then when rocking herself backwards and forwards for her amusement her right leg had been so extended, her right foot might have reached this point and the tips of her toes might have become inserted, and either in the act of being inserted or in the exertion made to extricate the foot, might have received the injury which they did suffer without the machinery having been in motion. Then, as to the seat, instead of its having been as alleged in the statement of claim four feet six inches in height, it was only thirty-three inches high including a plank of three inches in thickness on which it stood. The seat was made of a box open in front with a wooden bar across the opening upon which to rest the feet. There was also at the bottom of the metal guard in the centre front of the press an iron bar for the feet to rest upon. The depth of the box from front to rear was just eleven inches and its width the other way two feet. It stood upon a three inch plank which was three feet long by ten and threequarter inches wide. It was said to have been perfectly safe and that the plaintiff had no occasion whatever to make a jump in order reach the seat in the manner described by her. A young girl who had worked at the press for nine months before the plaintiff worked at it and who is not so tall as the plaintiff found it always quite safe and always got into it by merely touching the table and sliding along the seat; she never had any difficulty in thus seating herself; it was the only mode at all necessary and there is evidence that the plaintiff herself had been repeatedly seen seating herself in precisely the same manner. Upon the whole of this evidence, we are of opinion that it does not warrant a judgment which pronounces the accident to have been caused by the fault and neglect of the defendants. The utmost that the evidence warrants is that the cause of the accident still is, as it was at the close of the plaintiff's case, a matter merely speculative and conjectural, and that there appears more probability in the theory suggested by the defendants than in that propounded on behalf of the plaintiff. The appeal must therefore be allowed and the plaintiff's action dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hatton & McLennan.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Robidoux, Chenevert & Robillard.\n"}

It is, when dry, liable to explode easily by friction or contact with flame, but has the property of burning slowly without exploding when saturated with moisture. It was the duty of defendants\u2019 foreman twice a day, to provide a sufficient quantity of the mixture for use in his special compartment during the morning and in the afternoon, and to keep it properly dampened with water, for which purpose he was furnished with a sprinkler. It was also the foreman's duty to fill the empty shells with the fulminating mixture as they were handed to him set on end in wooden plates, and then pass them on, properly moistened, through a slot in his compartment, to a shelf whence they were removed by another employee and the charges pressed down to the bottom of the shells by means of a pressing machine worked by C at a table near by. An explosion took place which appeared from the evidence to have originated at the pressing machine, and might have occurred either through the fulminate in the shells having been allowed to become too dry from carelessness in sprinkling, or from an accumulation of the mixture adhering to and drying upon the metal portions of the pressing machine. It was the duty of C, the person operating the pressing machine, to keep it clean and pre vent the mixture from accumulating and drying there in dangerous quantities. When the explosion occurred, the foreman and C and another employee were killed, but a fourth employee, who was blown outside the wreck of the building and survived, stated that the first flash appeared to come from the pressing machine, and the explosion followed immediately. The theory propounded by the plaintiff, the father of C, assumed that nothing was known of the actual cause of the explosion, nor where it in point of fact originated, but inferred from a supposed condition of things, that the fulminate had not been sufficiently dampened, and that this indicated carelessness on the part of the foreman and raised a presumption that the explosion originated through, his fault. The evidence of the survivor led to the conclusion that the explosion originated though C's neglect to clean the pressing machine. There was evidence to show that the defendant had taken all reasonable precautions to diminish risk of injury to their employees in the event of an explosion, and that conformity with rules prescribed and instructions given by them to their employees for the purpose of securing their safety would be sufficient to secure them from injury.\nHeld, Taschereau and King JJ. dissenting, that as it appeared under the circumstances of the case, that the cause of the accident was either unknown or else that it could fairly be presumed to have been caused by the negligence of the person injured, whose personal representative brought the action, that there could not be any such fault imputed to the defendants as would render them liable in damages.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench of Lower Canada (appeal side), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which condemned the defendants to pay the plaintiff One thousand dollars damages with costs.\nThe plaintiff's action was for damages for the death of his son, a minor, caused through alleged negligence of the defendants, in whose service he was employed. The neglect specially charged against the defendants was carelessness on the part of the foreman of the detonating department of their factory in allowing fulminate of mercury, (which it was his duty to place in brass shells), to become so dry that it exploded, whilst the shells were being pressed in a machine operated by the plaintiff's son, and caused his death, whereas if the fulminate had been kept properly moistened by the foreman the operation of pressing it in the shells could have been carried on with perfect safety. The plaintiff's theory as to the cause of the explosion depended entirely upon inferences to be drawn from testimony as to careless acts of the foreman upon former occasions, the survivor being unable to give any evidence beyond the fact that the first flash was seen by him at the pressing machine operated by the plaintiff's son and the explosion followed immediately. Further particulars, as to the arrangement of the factory and precautions taken for the safety of the employees, are given in the head note and in the judgments reported.\nMacmaster Q.C. and Fleet for the appellants. There was no absence of care on the part of the employers; Parrott v. Wells (\" The Nitro-Glycerine Case\") ([1]); and nothing done by them could naturally and reasonably be supposed to have caused the injuries; Victorian Railways Commissioners v. Coultas ([2]). The presumptions are rebutted and there is evidence to support the theory that the deceased was himself responsible for the accident. See Montreal Rolling Mills Company v. Corcoran ([3]) and cases there cited. The appellants should not be condemned upon mere theory, they must be shewn to have committed a fault. Mercier v.Morin ([4]); Judet v. Compagnie de Ch\u00e2tillon-Commentry ([5]); \"The Nitro-Glycerine Case\" (1). Even if the fulminating mixture had dried prematurely owing to the great heat of the day that would not be a reason for holding the appellants liable; The Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Chalifoux ([6]). The employers took reasonable precautions, made rules and gave instructions which were sufficient to have secured their employees safety, if conformed to by them. An employee neglecting such rules and instructions is barred by his own rashness, volenti non fit injuria. See Paterson v. Wallace ([7]); Desroches Gauthier ([8]) per Dorion C. J. at page 28; The Canada Southern Railway Company v. Phelps per Henry J. at page 148 ([9]); Grand Trunk Railway Company v. Bourassa ([10]); Tooke v. Bergeron ([11]).\nTrenholme Q,C and Hutchins for the respondent. The defendants must be answerable for their foreman's carelessness in allowing the dangerous mixture to become dry and explosive even though there may be no actual proof of the immediate cause of the explosion, Corner v. Bird ([12]); 20 Laurent No. 475; 1 Beven on Negligence, 141. The use of rough target paper by the foreman as shewn in evidence may have caused an explosion in his compartment where the larger quantity of the explosive mixture was kept and thus caused the explosion of his supply of fulminate as well as of all the cartridges in course of manufacture. The want of care in using rough paper and in his probable neglect to use the sprinkler were faults in the defendants' system of manufacture. Res ipsa loquitur. Au undue number of cartridges were allowed to accumulate and become too dry for pressing with safety. The defendants owed their young and inexperienced employees the special duty of protection against injury or loss of life; 1 Beven (2 ed.) 789; Grizzle v. Frost ([13]) per Cockburn C.J. at page 625; O'Brien v. Sanford ([14]); 22 R. L. Rep. vo.'. Responsibilit\u00e9\" nos. 83-84. See also Robinson v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. ([15]); St. Lawrence Sugar Refining' Co. v. Campbell ([16]); Evans et al. v. Monette ([17]); Allan et al. v. Pratt ([18]); Tremblay v. Davidson ([19]); Poitras v. The Globe Woollen Mills Co. ([20]) and the authorities therein cited; Calhoun v. The Windsor Hotel Co. ([21]).\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by.\nGWYNNE J. This is an action instituted by a father for damages for the death of his son caused, as is alleged, by the negligence and default of the appellant company in whose service the son was employed.\nThe material allegation in the plaintiff's statement of claim is that\nOn the twenty-first day of June, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-two, through the carelessness and wilful neglect of the company defendant, an explosion took place in the detonating room at their works in Brownburgh aforesaid by which the said James Cairns, junior (the plaintiff's son), lost his life.\nIt appeared in evidence that four persons worked in the building which was wholly blown up and destroyed by an explosion which took place in it whereby three of the persons employed therein, namely, Gunn, Curran and Cairns, were instantly killed, the fourth, named Bourck, being the sole survivor. The building so destroyed was used as a detonating-room,\" that is to say, as a room in which copper shells were charged with fulminate of mercury and chlorate of potash.\nThe building was described as being a perfectly safe building for the purpose of the operations which were carried on in it. It was built as the evidence discloses, of the very best materials, but purposely slight, for the express purpose of diminishing the risk of damage to the persons employed, in the event of an explosion taking place; and in fact that, great as the explosive power of the mixture used undoubtedly is, conformity with the rules prescribed by the company and the instructions given by them to their employees for the purpose of securing their safety, would be abundantly sufficient to secure immunity from all risk of injury.\nTo supply the evidence of a witness since deceased whose testimony, after having been taken down in writing had been lost, the plaintiff admitted as a fact. which that witness had testified unto, that in the management of their factory \" all possible care and diligence had been used by the defendants,\"\nThe work in the building was conducted as follows: Copper shells were brought from an outbuilding in boxes and placed upon a table on one side of the building where Gunn and Bourck worked; a hardwood plate with two hundred holes in it nearly pierced through, was then filled by Gunn and Bourck with copper shells which stuck up about the one-eighth of an inch; these plates when so filled, were one by one taken by Bourck across the room to a place partitioned off where Curran, who was foreman in control of all the other persons employed in the room, worked. Bourck passed the plates filled with shells through a hole in the partition, facing where Gunn worked, to Curran to be charged by him with the explosive mixture and he pushed each plate, as charged with the fulminate mixture, through a sliding opening, in another partition of his, Curran's, department, at right angles with that through which he had received the plates from Bourck and facing the place where Cairns worked a pressing machine, to be there pressed. These plates Cairns took from the sill on which they were so placed by Curran and pressed the fulminate in the shells at the press worked by him, and when so pressed, Bourck took the plates of shells as pressed back to the table where Gunn and he worked and thence they were taken to a drying house outside of and some distance from the detonating building.\nA theory was propounded by a witness on behalf of the plaintiff as to how the explosion, in his opinion, might possibly have taken place. He admitted, however, that as to the actual cause of the explosion he knew nothing. That in point of fact he did not know where the explosion had originated, and that his opinion w as not based upon any facts shown to have existed when the explosion took place, but wholly upon the supposition of the existence of certain conditions which he mentioned, and which, assuming them to have existed, the explosion, in his opinion, could have originated, and in his opinion probably did originate where Curran worked and by reason of carelessness on his part.\nThere was evidence utterly denying that some of the conditions upon which that witness proceeded as constituting negligence did, assuming them to have existed, constitute any carelessness whatever or any thing at all improper in the performance of the work entrusted to him; but it is unnecessary to decide on this, for we have the evidence of Bourck, the sole survivor of the disaster, who speaks to facts observed by him which make it quite impossible to say that the explosion originated in or at the place where Curran worked.\nThe only evidence of any fact pointing to the origin of the explosion is that given by Bourck, the sole survivor of the catastrophy. He had just returned to his seat at the table where he and Gunn worked from the table where Cairns worked whither he had gone in the expectation of receiving an empty plate from Cairns, but found him pressing the shells with the plate fully half full before him, that is, with still one hundred loaded shells upon it. He returned to his seat across the room, immediately behind Cairns and sat watching him at work and waiting for him to complete the pressing of the shells in the plate for which he was waiting. In a short time he observed a flash of fire issue from the press machine which was instantaneously followed by the explosion which destroyed the building, killed the three other persons employed in it and blew Bourck outside of the wreck.\nUpon the evidence it must be held that the explosion originated at the press at which Cairns was at the time pressing cartridges. There were on the table in front of him one hundred loaded cartridges and one hundred more which had been pressed and dropped into a box on the floor under the table. All these exploded. There was evidence that the explosion of the two hundred cartridges was alone sufficient to blow up and destroy the building, and there were three several causes for the explosion originating at the press machine mentioned, which, assuming them to have existed, would naturally account for the catastrophy and be due to carelessness on the part of Cairns who had been cautioned as to them and instructed how to prevent their occurrence.\nBourck also testified that upon the sill outside of the window in the partition through which Curran was in the habit of passing the plates of shells for Cairns to press, there were two plates of shells\u2014four hundred in all. It may be that, and very probably it was, negligence in Curran to place these two loaded plates so near the machine at which Cairns was working before he was prepared to take them away, but this negligence did not form any part of the theory upon which the plaintiff rested his claim. There is no doubt that not only these shells but also all the explosive matter in Curran\u2019s compartment were exploded together. As, however, the whole went off in one explosion which originated at the press which was being worked by Cairns, it is unnecessary, as it is impossible, to attempt to determine to what extent the effect of the explosion may have been increased by the proximity of the loaded plates, at the window in the partition in Curran's compartment, to the pressing machine where the explosion originated. For the de termination of the present case it is sufficient to say that the evidence shows that the explosion originated at the press which was at the time being worked by Cairns; and that the evidence not only does not war rant an adjudication that the explosion was not caused by any negligence on the part of Cairns, but on the contrary does warrant the fair presumption that it was caused by his negligence. If not caused by his negligence the evidence fails to show what did in fact cause it, and it cannot therefore be imputed to the defendants. The appeal must therefore, in my opinion, be allowed with costs and the action dismissed in the court below with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J. dissented but gave no written reasons for judgment.\nKING J. dissenting. I think that there is evidence of negligence in this case sufficient to support the Judgments below. Assuming the contention of appellants to be correct, that the explosion originated at the pressing machine worked by the deceased lad Cairns, the proper conclusion, from the evidence of the witness Flood, is that no explosion causing serious or at least fatal injury could be expected to result from it if the fulminate was sufficiently moist. According to him and according to Howard, a man of great experience, the working in these high explosives is made practically possible and safe upon condition, and only upon condition, that the proper degree of moisture is maintained; and while, with this, there might be minor and inconsiderable explosions, there could not be any involving serious damage to life or approaching in its effects what is here proved to have taken place.\nFlood is described in his deposition as a fulminate maker in the employ of defendants, and at the time of giving his evidence was their foreman in this branch of their work. His capacity and experience and his fairness towards them is therefore unquestioned and he says that the failure to keep the fulminate properly moist is the only source of danger of explosion; and he also says what the whole evidence shows that the duty of keeping it properly moist was upon the fore man, for whose neglect, if any, the company would, according to the law of Quebec, as I understand it, be responsible to Cairns.\nFlood's evidence is as follows:\nQ. Now, you are working at a very dangerous business, are you not?\u2014A. I do not know, if I go according to orders, that it is very dangerous.\nQ. You do not consider it dangerous, what you are doing?\u2014A. Not if I go according to the orders.\nQ. You think it can be run safely do you? A. I think so,\nQ. Wherein consists the danger in working that business? How is there danger?\u2014A. If you let your powder get too dry; that is the principal danger, I guess.\nQ. If the powder is kept moist then there is no danger, is there?\u2014 A. No, sir.\nQ. You mean by powder the fulminate you put into these detonators?\u2014If that is kept properly moist, you say there is no danger in the business?\u2014A. No sir.\nQ. But if it is allowed to get dry there is danger, is there not? -- A Yes, sir. Q. Because when it gets dry it will explode?\u2014A. If it gets any cause.\nQ. Will it very easily explode?\u2014-A. Yes, sir.\nQ. Now, in running that business, you have said if it is kept properly moist there is no danger. Now, do you see that it is kept properly moist yourself?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\nQ. You make a point yourself of attending to that?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\nQ. Who has the watching of that? A. I have.\nQ. It is your duty to moisten that, is it not?\u2014A. Yes sir.\nQ. The man who charges these detonators, it is his duty to keep that properly moist, is it not?\u2014\u2014A. Yes, sir.\nQ. And that his failure to do that is the only source you know of danger of explosion?\u2014A. That is all.\nQ. The only one?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\nQ. Now, is that very dangerous work the boy is put to, the boy running the pressing machine\u2014is that not very dangerous work?\u2014 A. No I do not consider that it is.\nQ. You do not consider that it is dangerous at all? A. No sir.\nQ. Why?\u2014A. If the powder is damp enough, there is no danger.\nQ. That is, if the plates, as passed to him, are damp enough, there is no danger of explosion?\u2014A. No.\nBy the court:\nQ. So that the explosion would not take place there, at the pressing machine?\u2014A. Not if the powder was damp enough.\nQ. Did you ever know one of these detonators to go off in the machine?\u2014-A. I have\nQ. What was the cause of that?\u2014A. Of course if the boy that was running the machine allowed powder to gather around the point of the punch, it might explode in that way\u2014that is, the punch that presses the shell.\nQ. Did you ever know a detonator to explode there?\u2014A. Through that? Yes, sir; in that way.\nQ. And what was the result? Did it hurt the boy? A No, sir.\nQ. Why did it not hurt the boy?\u2014A. There was a guard on the machine for one thing\nQ. He is protected against an explosion in that way is he? A. Yes sir.\nQ. That was the same as in the old building, supposing he was protected?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\nQ. So that if an occasional detonator went off in a machine it would not hurt the boy, would it? A. No, sir\nQ. The boy has not been hurt since you have been there, by any of those explosions, has he? A. No. In the absence therefore of proof of other cause, resipsa loquitur and points to a deficiency of moisture in the fulminate mixture as the efficient cause.\nA circumstance pointing to the same conclusion exists in the fact that the foreman was charging the shells unnecessarily long before the time when the pressing could be undertaken. Two plates of 200 detonators each were charged in advance and lying on the sill prepared for Cairns to press them on completion of the plate he was working at. The day is proved to have been one of the hottest of the season, and in such a slight and small structure as that in which the operations were carried on it is manifest that the process of evaporation would go on rapidly, and there is no evidence to warrant the suggestion that the shells were sprayed after they were charged and, in the nature of things, it is quite unlikely.\nIt is said that Cairns was negligent, but any neglect on his part could not reasonably result in any serious injury providing that the mixture was in the proper condition he had a right to expect it to be in, and besides there is really no proof of neglect at all on his part. Bourck speaks of having previously seen particles of the fulminate on the top of the dial of Cairns' machine, but he saw nothing of this sort when at the machine just before the accident took place According to the rules the foreman was to see to the taking apart and cleaning of the machine every two hours.\nIn the operation of pressing from 14,000 to 15,000 caps per day slight slips would be unavoidable and were to be expected, and this, consistently with reasonable care on the part of the person so employed considered in his relation to the employer. Indeed slight accidents at the machine from one cause or another seem to have been calculated upon as likely to occur as a steel shield was placed in front of the operator to protect him from their effects.\nThe courts below were not required to adopt the strained theories of the president of the company, who seems to have very different notions from Flood and Howard as to the protective value of moisture in ensuring safety. As for the boy Bourck, he manifestly had no experience that would warrant confident statements by him as to modes and causes of explosions. Besides, his evidence is affected by his admission that he had declined to give information to the plaintiff's solicitor on the ground that he was going to give evidence for the defence.\nAt all events the courts below have not adopted the theories of these witnesses, and in the evidence of Flood, already alluded to, they had sufficient upon which to base a judgment for the plaintiff. I therefore think that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Robertson, Fleet & Falconer.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Stephens & Hutchins.\n[1] 15 Wall. 524.\n[2] 13 App. Cas. 222.\n[3] 26 Can.

If the sole arbitrator appointed by the judge, or any arbitrator appointed by the two arbitrators dies before the award has been made, or is disqualified, or refuses or fails to act within a reasonable time, then, in the case of the sole arbitrator, the judge, upon the application of either party, and upon being satisfied by affidavit or otherwise of such death, disqualification, refusal or failure, may appoint another arbitraror in the place of such sole arbitrator; and in the case of any arbitrator appointed by one of the parties, the company and party respectively may each appoint an arbitrator in the place of its or his arbitrator so deceased or not acting; and. in the case of the third, arbitrator appointed by the two arbitrators, the provisions of section one hundred and fifty-one shall apply; but no recommencement or repetition of the previous proceedings shall be required in any case.\"\n(Section 151 provides for the appointment of a third arbitrator either by the two arbitrators or by a judge.)\nHeld, that the provisions of the 157th section apply to a case where the arbitrator appointed by the proprietor died before the award had been made and four days prior to the date fixed for making the same; that in such a case the proprietor was entitled to be allowed a reasonable time for the appointment of another arbitrator to fill the vacancy thus caused and to have the arbitration proceedings continued although the time so fixed had expired without any award having been made or the time for the making thereof having been prolonged.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which quashed the writ of prohibition in this matter with costs.\nThe following statement of the facts in the case is taken from the judgment of the court rendered by His Lordship Mr. Justice Taschereau:\nThe controversy between the parties arises from proceedings upon an arbitration under the Railway Act of Canada, 51 V. c. 29. The respondents on the 19th of June, 1896, gave the statutory notice to appellant of their intention to expropriate part of her land, offering $600 as compensation, and appointing one Brodie as their arbitrator. The appellant thereupon named one Davidson as her arbitrator, and the two named one McArthur, as a third. On the 12th of August, 1896, at their first meeting, the three arbitrators, as required by the statute, fixed the 15th of October following as the day on or before which the award had to be rendered. Meetings were held on the 17th and 22nd of August. On the latter date the meeting was adjourned sine die. On the 11th of October, Davidson died. On the 15th the two surviving arbitrators met and, seeing that no other arbitral tor had been appointed by the appellant, adjourned sine die. On the 6th of November following, appellant gave notice of the appointment of one Hadley as her arbitrator; and on the 10th of November notice was given by two of the arbitrators, McArthur and Hadley, that the arbitration would be proceeded with on the 14th. The company's arbitrator, though pre sent, refused to take part in this meeting as he considered that his functions had ceased on the 15th of October preceding. The arbitrators having adjourned to the 30th Of November and named the 30th of January, 1897, for the rendering of the award, were about to proceed, when a writ of prohibition was served on them by the company. The petition set out the above facts and prayed that a writ should issue against the arbitrators, enjoining them to cease and discontinue to receive evidence, examine witnesses, or do any official act in connection with the above expropriation. Appellant was mise-en-cause in the case and contested the petition. The Superior Court maintained her contestation, dismissed the petition and quashed the writ of prohibition. But the Court of Queen's Bench maintained the writ and granted the conclusions of the company's petition. it is from this judgment that the present appeal is taken.\nHolt for the appellant. The judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, (two out of the five learned judges dissenting,) was based upon the ground that the arbitrators did not extend the time for rendering their award which had been fixed, and that thus the arbitrators had on the 15th October become functi officio, and had no right to proceed and therefore declared the prohibition absolute against the arbitrators. This judgment gave no effect to section 157, under which appellant had appointed another arbitrator in place of Davidson, deceased, and assumed that, the time for rendering the award having expired, there was no provision in the statute for relief. The appellant submits that section 157 gives the party whose arbitra-tor dies the right to name another arbitrator, and the right once given, the power and the time to exercise that right is necessarily also given, and that section 157 contains an exception to the general rule laid down in section 156 On the death of any of the arbitrators the provisions of section 157 apply and necessarily the general rule in section 156 is modified. The party whose arbitrator dies must then have reasonable time allowed to find a new arbitrator, give notice of his appointment and to have him sworn in, and the three arbitrators must then give notice calling a new meeting of the completed board of arbitrators for the purpose of proceeding. This appears to be the meaning and intention of the Act, and we respectfully submit it to be the duty of the court to give it effect. We refer to the general principle laid down in the Interpretation Acts ([1])\nThe arbitrator, Davidson, died on the 11th October, a Sunday, the date for the award being fixed for the 15th. It is quite clear that no one but his relatives would know of his death before, in all probability, the Tuesday following which would give the appellant one day only in which to search for a new arbitrator, explain the position of maters so as to induce him to act, give notice to the company, have the arbitrator sworn in, and allow the new arbitrators time to call a meeting. It would be impossible to do this. To show further the disastrous results which might ensue if the respondents' pretensions were to prevail, appellant respectfully submits, that if the railway company's arbitrator were to die or resign upon the day fixed for the award, and that in consequence no award should be given, respondents could consistently claim that the proprietor must take the amount Offered by them. The proprietor might object that it was through no fault of his that the company's arbitrator had died, but the company could consistently invoke section 156, and insist that time having expired the owner must take what they offered. It is immaterial for the purposes of this argument which arbitrator has died. The company admits the right to appoint a new arbitrator, but denies the time within which to do so. The proprietor claims the right to name a new arbitra-tor and also to the time to find him and appoint him.\nAs to the objection raised to the jurisdiction of this court to hear the present appeal the appellant submits that there is no limitation in the second section of the statute 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 25, and that it gives the right of appeal in all matters of prohibition irrespective of the question or amount in controversy.\nLajvie for the respondents. This appeal is entirely upon the writ of prohibition. The question is whether the arbitrators had or not jurisdiction; there can be no questoin of title to lands or value in controversy being over $2,000, because, even should this appeal be dismissed respondents will have to take other and further proceedings to obtain title to the land. The only point at issue is the right of the arbitrators to arbitrate, and in such a case, the Supreme Court Act gives no appeal from judgments rendered in matters of prohibition in the Province of Quebec. We therefore submit that the court has no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The arbitrators were functi officio after the 15th of October, the date fixed for the rendering of the award. The 156th and 157th sections of the Railway Act cause a forfeiture to operate in the nature of p\u00e9remption In the absence of any consent or resolution prolonging the time for making an award the court can give no relief. See Russell on Arbitration (7 ed.) p. 147; Rolland de Villargues, vo \" Arbitration,\" No. 99. The powers of arbitrators are strictly limited by the statute and no power to extend the time is given in the event of the death of one of their number. The Railway Act must govern, and it makes no distinction. Once the time has expired any rights the parties may have had are determined by the statute.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment upon a writ of prohibition. The respondent raised an objection to the jurisdiction of this court on the ground that the Act 54 & 55 V. c. 25, sec. 2, which gives the right to appeal in such cases, does not apply to the Province of Quebec. But this contention cannot prevail. The enactment applies to the whole Dominion.\n(His Lordship then stated the circumstances under which the controversy arose as given above.)\nThe sections of the Railway Act that govern the case are sections 156 and 157, which read as follows:\n156. A majority of the arbitrators at the first meeting after their appointment, or the sole arbitrator, shall fix a day on or before which the award shall be made; and if the same is not made on or before-such day or some other day to which the time for making it has been prolonged, either by the consent of the parties or by resolution of the arbitrator, then the sum offered by the company, as aforesaid, shall be the compensation to be paid by the company.\n157. If the sole arbitraror appointed by the judge, or an arbitrator appointed by two arbitrators dies before the award has been made or is disqualified, or refuses or fails to act within a reasonable time, then, in the case of the sole arbitrator, the judge, upon the application of either party, and upon being satisfied by affidavit or otherwise of such death, disqualification, refusal or failure, may appoint another arbitrator in the place of such sole arbitrator; and in the case of any arbitrator appointed by one of the parties, the company and party respectively may each appoint an arbitrator in the place of its or his arbitrator so deceased or not acting; and in the case of the third arbitrator appointed by the two arbitrators, the provisions of section one hundred and fifty-one shall apply; but no recommencement or repetition of the previous proceedings shall be required in any case.\nThe company's contention is that, as the time for making the award had elapsed, and not been extended under section 156, the appellant has to be satisfied with the $600 they had originally tendered as compensation for the land taken from her. No fault or negligence on the part of the appellant can be reason-ably contended for. She could not have been expected between the 11th and 15th of October to find another arbitrator willing to act, and have him sworn in. She possibly was not even then aware of Davidson's death. The company contends that, in the case of a sole arbitrator, if he dies say the day before the date fixed for the award, the proprietor's claim is gone altogether. Can it be that the statute is so unreasonable and unjust? It should require a very clear text to have a court of justice so decide.\nWe are bound to construe the sections in question go as to ensure the attainment of their object, and the carrying out of their provisions according to their true intent, meaning and spirit.\nThe company would have us read section 156 textually and gain an advantage over the expropriated owner by a fortuitous event. But section 157 cannot so be read out of the statute, and that section clearly provides for the appointment of another arbitrator when one of the two named by the parties or both of them, or the third arbitrator, die, at any time before the arbitration is at an end, be it the day before.\nThat is conceded, but it is argued on behalf of the company, that if the delay has not been extended, the award, not being made on the day fixed, section 156 ends the arbitration. That cannot be. The right to name an arbitrator to replace a deceased one would be vain and illusory if the company's contentions were to prevail. It would be virtually refusing to a party whose arbitrator dies under these circumstances, the right to appoint another one, whilst section 157 clearly gives him that right. Nay, more, if it was the company's arbitrator who had so died the arbitration would likewise be at an end, and the owner's claim extinguished, according to the judgment under review.\nWe cannot, in my opinion, so construe this legislation. I would allow the appeal with costs and restore the judgment of the Superior Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Morris & Holt.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Bisaillon, Brousseaw & Lajoie.\n[1] R.

Notices were sent in writing to the consumer that his gas would be shut off at a certain number on a street named unless he paid arrears of gas bills due upon another property.\nHeld, that such notices could not be considered as notices given under the contract for the purpose of cancelling it.\nThe Act to amend the Act incorporating the New City Gas Company of Montreal and to extend its powers, (12 Vict. ch. 182,) provides: \"That if any person or persons, company or companies, or body corporate supplied with gas by the company, shall neglect to pay any rate, rent or charge due to the said New City Gas Company, at any of the times fixed for the payment thereof, it shall be lawful for the company or any person acting under their authority, on giving twenty-four hours previous notice, to stop the gas from entering the premises, service pipes, or lamps of any such person, company or body, by cutting off the service pipe or pipes, or by such other means as the said company shall see fit, and to recover the said rent or charge due up to such time, together with the expenses of cutting off the gas, in any competent court, not with standing any contract to furnish for a longer time, and in all cases where it shall be lawful for the said company to cut off and take away the supply of gas from any house, building or premises, under the provisions of this Act it shall be lawful for the company, their agents and workmen, upon giving twenty-four hours previous notice to the occupier or person in charge, to enter into any such house, building or premises, between the hours of nine o'clock in the forenoon and four in the afternoon, making as little disturbance and inconvenience as possible, and to remove, take and carry away any pipe, meter, cock, branch, lamp, fittings or apparatus, the property of and belonging to the said company.\"\nHeld, Taschereau J. dissenting, that the powers given by the clause quoted are exorbitant and must be construed strictly; that the company has not been thereby vested with power to shut off gas from all the buildings and premises of the same proprietor or occupant, when he becomes in default for the payment of bills for gas consumed in one of them only; and that the provision that the notice to cut off must be given \" to the occupier or person in charge,\" indicates that only premises so occupied and in default should suffer.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which ordered a peremptory writ of mandamus to issue enjoining the defendant to furnish gas to the plaintiff on the conditions usual for such supply in the City of Montreal with costs of suit against the defendant.\nThe company cut off the supply of gas at plaintiff's residence in Montreal which was not in default for non-payment of bills for gas consumed there, claiming the right to do so on account of there being unpaid arrears due by him for gas consumed in a building belonging to him in another part of the city. The circumstances under which the controversy arose and the questions at issue are stated in the head-note and fully referred to in the judgment of Mr. Justice Girouard now reported.\nSt. Jean for the appellant.\nBrosseau for the respondent.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. When the statute says that if any person neglects to pay any rate, rent or charge due for gas, it is lawful for the company to stop the gas from entering the premises of any such person (d'emp\u00eacher le gaz de s'inroduire dans les edifices de telle personne) I do not feel at liberty to hold that it does not mean what it says; when it says les \u00e9difices, it means tous les \u00e9difices, the premises, all the premises. To restrict this enactment as the appellant contends should be done, would be legislation, not interpretation of the law. The judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench is clearly right.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014The appellant is applying for a writ of mandamus to compel the respondent to supply him with gas at his private residence, number 282 St. Charles-Borromm\u00e9e Street, in the City of Montreal. The Superior Court (Mathieu J.) granted the petition, but in appeal, this judgment was reversed for two reasons:\u2014First, the agreement of the fourth of May, 1887 under which the respondent undertook to furnish gas to the appellant, contains an express provision that\neither of the contracting parties will have the right to cancel this contract by giving twenty-four hours notice in writing\nand that such notice was served upon the appellant; and secondly, the appellant having failed to pay his bill for gas supplied, upon his order, to premises known as number 1125 of Notre Dame Street, occupied by a tenant of the appellant, the respondent was justified, under section twenty of its charter, (12 Vict. ch. 183), incuting off their supply of gas from number 282 St. Charles-Borromm\u00e9e Street, where he was not in default.\nIt is not necessary to express any opinion as to whether under the contract of the fifteenth of November, 1895, with the City of Montreal, the respondent could enforce the power to cancel stipulated in the agreement of the fourth day of May, 1887. It is sufficient to say that the respondents were in duty bound to supply the citizens of Montreal with gas unless duly relieved from that duty by contract or its charter; as to the contract, we have come to the conclusion that the stipulation above quoted does not apply.\nWhen the respondents cut off the gas they did not intend to enforce it in the present case. No notice in writing was ever given to cancel the contract with the appellant. Witness Burke, one of the clerks in the office of the respondents, says that\non the first of November I sent notice in writing that we should shut off the gas at number two hundred. and eighty-two St. Charles Borromm\u00e9e Street unless he paid the account for number eleven hundred and twenty-five Notre Dame Street, but he took no notice of that.\nAnother similar notice was sent on the second of December, 1895, and, appellant having paid no attention to it, the gas was shut off on the fifth of the same month.\nThe collector of the respondents, Darling, corroborated this statement. He notified, verbally, the appellant, that unless the account was paid immediately on the Notre Dame Street premises, the gas supply would be discontinued at number 282 Saint Charles-Borromme Street.\nIt is therefore plain that no notice to cancel the contact was given or even intended to be given, and that the notice sent was the one contemplated by section twenty of 12th Vict. ch. 183.\nBy that section it is enacted that :\u2014\u2014\nIf any person or persons, company or companies, or body corporate, supplied, with gas by the company, snail neglect to pay any rate, rent or charge due to the said New City Gas Company, at any of the times fixed for the payment thereof, it shall be lawful for the company or any person acting under their authority, on giving twenty-four hours previous notice, to stop the gas from entering the premises, 25 service pipes or lamps of any such person, company or body, by cutting off the said service pipe or pipes or by such other means as the said company shall see fit, and to recover the said rent or charge due up to such time, together with the expenses of cutting off the gas, in any competent court, notwithstanding any contract to furnish for a longer time, and in all cases where it shall be lawful for the said company to cut off and take away the supply of gas from any house, building or premises under the provisions of this Act, it shall be lawful for the company, their agents and workmen, upon giving twenty-four hours' previous notice to the occupier or person in charge, to enter into any such house, building or premises, between the hours of nine o'clock in the forenoon and four o'clock in the afternoon, making as little disturbance and inconvenience as possible, and to remove, take and carry away any pipe, meter, cock, branch lamp, fittings or apparatus., the property of and belonging to the said company.\nThe reading of this clause brings us to the consideration of the second reason advanced by the Court of Appeal in support of their judgment. We do not attach any importance to the use of the word, edifices in the French version of the statute, to arrive at the true meaning of the word \"premises\" used in the English version. We believe that the word \u00e9difices here simply means lieux where the gas is consumed and not paid for, and not distinct buildings or premises where no fault exists. u Premises\" cannot mean \u00e9difices only, as gas may be, and is in fact consumed out of edifices or buildings, for instance, in the open air, gardens and grounds, parks, streets and avenues. Exorbitant powers like those conferred by section twenty must be construed strictly, and if ever intended to cover all the buildings or premises of the same proprietor, or occupant, when in default with regard to one of them only must be granted in clear and no ambiguous language. The express provision contained in that section that the notice to cut o it must be given to the occupier or person in charge,\" plainly indicates that only premises so occupied and in default most suffer. Clause six of the contrast of the respondents with the city of Montreal, containing a stipulation that they will \" collect and. receive the several sums of money at any time due by the gas consumers from the latter only,\" and not from the city, conveys the same idea. Cutting off the gas is the most efficient mode of collection and must therefore be enforced against the consumer that is the occupant only of the premises in default. To allow a different interpretation of the words of the statute would lead to the most absurd consequences, as for instance, when the proprietor has ordered gas meters for several premises occupied by different tenants in the same or separate buildings, or when a corporation like the city of Montreal neglects to pay its gas bill on its buildings, or some of them, but not on its streets. These results must be avoided if a reasonable construction of the statutes would permit us to do so. We believe that the interpretation given by the Superior Court is not only reasonable, but that it is the only one contemplated by the legislature. Shefield Waterworks v. Carter ([1]); In re The Commercial Bank of Canada and The London Gas Company ([2]).\nFor these reasons we are of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Superior Court restored with costs in all the courts.\nGWYNNE, SEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Pr\u00e9fontaine, St. Jean, Archer & D\u00e9cary.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bisaillon, Brosseau & Lajoie.\n*Leave has been granted for an appeal from this judgment to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\n[1] 8 Q.

McDougall (Cass. Dig. 2 ed. 429), discussed and distinguished.\nK. B. made an agreement with T. for the purchase of the output of his sawmill during the season of 1896, a memorandum being executed between them to the effect that T. sold and K. B. purchased all the lumber that he should saw at his mill during the season, delivered at Hadlow wharf, at Levis; that the purchasers should have the right to refuse all lumber rejected by their culler j that the lumber delivered, culled and piled on the wharf should be paid for at prices stated; that the seller should pay the purchasers $1.50 per hundred deals, Quebec standard., to meet the cost of unloading cars, classification and piling on the wharf; that the seller should manufacture the lumber according to specifications furnished by the purchasers; that the purchasers should make payments in cash once a month for the lumber delivered, less two and a half per cent; that the purchasers should advance money upon the sale of the lumber on condition that the seller should, at the option of the purchasers, furnish collateral security on his property, including the mill and machinery belonging to him and obtain a promissory note from his wife for the amount of each collage, the advances being made on the culler's certificates showing receipts of logs not exceeding $25 per hundred logs of fourteen inches standard; that all logs paid for by the purchasers should be their property, and should be stamped with their name and that all advances should bear interest at the rate of 7 per cent. Before the river-drive commenced, the logs were culled and received on behalf of the purchasers, and stamped with their usual mark, and they paid for them a total sum averaging $32.33 per hundred. Some of the logs also bore the seller's mark and a small quantity, which were buried in snow and ice, were not stamped but were received on behalf of the purchasers along with the others. The logs were then allowed to remain in the actual possession of the seller. During the season a writ of execution issued against the seller under which all moveable property in his possession was seized, including a quantity of the logs in question, lying along the river-drive and at the mill, and also a quantity of lumber into which part of the logs in question had been manufactured, at the seller's mill.\nHeld (Taschereau J. taking no part in the judgment upon the merits), that the contract so made between the parties constituted a sale of the logs, and, as a necessary consequence, of the deals and boards into which part of them had been manufactured.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Superior Court for Lower Canada, sitting in Review, at Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Beause which dismissed the appellants' opposition afin de distraire, with costs.\nThe appellants filed an opposition afin de disiraire claiming ownership, under a written contract, in effect as stated in the head-note, of a quantity of logs and lumber worth $3500 seized in executing under a writ of fi.fa. de bonis issued by the plaintiff, (present respondent), upon a judgment recovered by him in an action in the Superior Court, District of Beauce, against Alphonse Taschereau, the defendant, for $11957 and costs, being the full amount of his demand in the action. The plaintiff, as execution creditor, contested the opposition and after the adduction of evidence and hearing upon the issues joined, the Superior Court at Beauce, dismissed the opposition with costs. The judgment now appealed from was rendered in the Court of Review at Quebec, affirming the decision at the trial.\nA motion was made to quash the present appeal on the ground that the amount in controversy was limited to the amount of $119.57 demanded by the plaintiff's action, and that consequently the Supreme Court of Canada had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. After hearing the parties on the motion to quash, the court reserved judgment and directed the hearing upon the merits to be proceeded with, and that the questions raised both upon the motion to quash and upon the merits of the case should. be disposed of together.\nFitzpatrick Q.C., (Solicitor General), and Taschereau Q.C. for the appellants. The opposition is a distinct \"judicial proceeding\" within the meaning of sec. 29 of \"The Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act,\" and raises a new controversy as to the ownership of a quantity of logs and lumber worth more than the sum or value of $2000. See Turcotte v. Dansereau ([1]). The issues between the plaintiff and the defendant in the original action are not now in question, but new issues tried between the opposant, and the contestant, as to the logs and lumber seized quite aside and apart from the plaintiff's claim by his action or under the execution See Miller v. Dech\u00e8ne ([2]) per Casault J. at page 22. An opposition of this kind is to all intents and purposes a new action in revendication.\nThe agreement amounted to an absolute sale of the mill output for the season the clauses in relation to advances of money to carry on the log making in the bush and the river-drive to the mill do not alter the character of the bargain made for the purchase of the lumber output. See La Banque d'Hoehelaga v. The Water ous Engine Works Company ([3]). The delivery of all the logs was competed at the time of the culling and marking in the bush Church v. Bernier ([4]) and the defendant never had any possession of them there after except as the agent of the opposants and for their benefit and purposes. The boards and deals manufactured out of these logs were consequently the property of the opposants and, although in the defend ant's temporary possession, they never ceased to belong to the opposants. See Price v. Hail ([5]). There was merely a bailment of the logs for the purpose of having them sawn into boards and deals and delivered at the Hadlow wharf after manufacture. Articles 1025-1027 1472, 1492 and 1493 O. C. apply. See also 24 Laurent, no. 167; 6 Marcad\u00e9 p. 223; Vankouginet v. Maitland ([6]); Young v. Lambert ([7]); Ross v. Thompson ([8]); Tourvllle v.

This is not a question of goods sold by weight or measure but a \" lump \" sale of effects, certain, fixed and well defined.

There is no jurisdiction in the Supreme Court of Canada to hear this appeal as the amount demanded and recovered and for which the execution was issued is less than the requisite appellate amount of $2000; R. S. C. c. 135, s. 29. The opposant seeks to avoid an execution for $119577 and costs and at the present moment the payment of $119.57 with a few dollars for interest and costs would put an end to all controversy in this matter, and release the property from seizure. As to the question of jurisdiction we rely upon Gendron v. McDougall ([10]); Champoux v. Lapierre ([11]) Flatt v. Ferland ([12]); Kinghorn v. Larue ([13]); The Bank of Toronto v. Le Cur\u00e9 et Les Marguiliers de V \u0152uvre et Fabrique de la paroisse de la Nativit\u00e9 de la Sainte Vierge ([14]).\nThere was no sale to the appellants, and they did not obtain delivery and possession of logs or lumber at the date of the agreement, for the defendant had not then cutany logs, and even the culling was not done until long afterwards Whilst the defendant was cutting and driving the logs he had the exclusive control of the men who did the work under him; he had sawn at his mill all the lumber seized; he alone was bound at his own expense to deliver the deals upon the wharf at Hadlow. With the exception of the culling, the appellants never interfered in the operations of the defendant. The marking of the logs was merely to identify them as having been culled. The agreement establishes that the moneys given by the appellants to the defendant at each culling were only advances to help him in his operations and did not constitute the real and definite price of the logs, and by its very terms it appears that no complete and definite sale took place of a fixed and determined quantity of movable goods. Arts. 1474 and 1026 of the Civil Code apply. See Kelly v. Merville ([15]); LeMesurier v. Logan ([16]); Contant v. Normandin ([17]); Ross v. Hannan ([18]); Vil leneuve v. Kent ([19]); Archambault v. Michcaud ([20]). Until the measurement and culling of the lumber had been completed there was no perfect sale, and, until these formalities were accomplished no payment was exigible, and collateral security was provided for to ensure the repayment of the advances made.\nThe appellants may have rights and certain privileges as pledges in connection with this lumber, but they are not in possession of it, and the respondent claims with respect to it, rights and privileges in preference to those of the appellants under 57 Vic. c. 47 (Que.) and Art. 1494 of the Civil Code.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014In this case a certain quantity of logs and deals having been seized by the respondent in execution of a judgment for $119, he had recovered against the defendant, the present appellants fyled an opposition afin de distraire, alleging that these logs and deals, worth $3,500, are their property. Upon contestation by respondent of this opposition, the judgment appealed from maintained this contestation, and dismissed appellants opposition.\nThe respondent moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction upon the authority of Champoux v. Lapierre ([21]), and Gendron v. McDougall ([22]). Not relying on the summary of these decisions as given in the digest I have referred to the cases themselves to ascertain precisely what was the nature of the appeals therein, and the grounds upon which it was held that this court had no jurisdiction. It was at that time, I may premise, though perhaps unnecessarily, the amount in controversy upon the appeal to this court that ruled not, as it is now, the amount of the original demand, when the extent of our jurisdiction depends upon the amount in controversy. In Champoux v. Lapierre ([23]), Champoux who had recovered judgment asrainst the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction for $640, had caused an immovable property of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 to be seized in execution of that judgment, Lapierre fyled. an opposition to this seizure, not claiming the owner ship of this property, not in any way questioning the title to it, but simply on the ground that Champoux, with the other directors, had agreed that this property would not be sold without his, Lapierre's, assent, as long as he, Lapierre, was not paid a claim of $31,000 which he had against the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Champoux con tested this opposition, not at all denying that Lapierre had a claim of $30,000 against the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 defendant, but controverting his right to oppose the sale on the grounds he alleged. The judgment appealed from to this court by Champoux maintained the opposition and set aside the seizure. Und\u00e9r the circumstances we held that as the amount in controversy upon the appeal did not amount to $2,000, the appeal should be quashed. Such is the entry in the minute book. There was clearly nothing there in controversy before this court other than Champoux's right to sell this property in execution of his judgment for $640. There was no controversy about Lapierre's claim of $30,000, no controversy as to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s title to this property. These two facts were admitted by all the parties. The case has, therefore, no application here.\nIn Gendron v. McDougall ([24]), Grendron had seized a certain immovable property, the value of which was not alleged or proved, upon a judgment against Ogden for $231. McDougall fyled an opposition, claiming this property as owner. Gendron answered that McDougall held it as pledge, not as owner. The amount for which this property was so held in pledge, if at all, was admitted on the record to be $637. The judgment appealed from to this court by Gendron, though maintaining McDougall's op position, denied him the ownership of this property, simply declaring that he had a right to retain it as pledge without saying for what amount. (It was one of the grounds of appeal, that the judgment was ultra petita). McDougall submitted to that judgment which. rejected his claim to the ownership, so that there was no question of title to land upon Gendron's appeal to this court. All that he claimed, all that was in controversy upon the appeal, was Gendron's right to have it sold for $231, and McDougall's right to retain it and oppose the sale till he was repaid his disbursements of $63 , if the evidence is coupled with the judgment, or disbursemenrts to an undetermined amount if the judgment appealed from is taken alone, and the entry in the minute book is \"appeal quashed for want of jurisdiction, the amount in dispute being under $2,000.\" That case again is clearly distinguishable.\nHere it is the ownership of $3,500 worth of lumber that is in question. The appellant, by his opposition, intervened in the original case to assert his title to this lumber that the respondent had caused to be seized. Upon that opposition the respondent has recovered a judgment which holds that the appellant is not the owner of this lumber. From this judgment the appeal is taken.\nI do not see how, on this appeal, [upon what is clearly a judicial proceeding, Turcotte v. Dansereau ([25]),] it can be denied that the matter in controversy, and demanded by that opposition, is of the value of $2,000 or over. Macfarlane v. Leclaire ([26]) is in that sense. 1 analyzed that case in Kinghon v. Larue ([27]). In Mc Corlcill v. Knight ([28]) certain lots of land seized in execution of a judgment against appellant's brother for $730 were claimed by her, the appellant, as her property. plaintiff, respondent, had as here obtained the dismissal of the opposition from which appellant appealed. Objection was taken at the hearing that this court had no jurisdiction because the amount in controversy, that is to say, the amount of the judgment recovered by respondent in the original suit, was only $730. But upon an affidavit and an extract from the valuation roll on fyle in the registrar's office, that the property in question on the opposition was of -a value exceeding $2,000, the appeal was heard and determined on the merits ([29]). This is a precisely similar case.\nThe motion to quash is dismissed with costs\nOn the merits, I do not take part in the judgment.\nGWynne Sedgewick and King JJ. concurred in the judgment dismissing the motion to quash with costs, and were of opinion that the appeal should be .allowed with costs and that the conclusions of the -appellants' opposition should be granted.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014On the 13th day of August, 1896, the respondent brought a personal action in the Superior Court in the district of Beauce, against the defendant, Alphonse Taschereau, lumber dealer and proprietor of a sawmill in Saint Joseph de la Beauce, for the sum of 1119.57, owing him for wages as a river-driver and also for board of drivers in his employ during the spring of the same year.\nOn the 21st of August he obtained judgment upon a confession, and on the 24th of the same month, by consent, he issued a writ of fieri facias de bonis, and; caused to be seized for the benefit of all his creditors all the defendant's movable property, and among other things, a certain quantity of boards, deals and saw logs the boards and deals fully described in the proc\u00e8s verbal, of seizure and being in the neighbour hood of the defendant's mill or near the station of the Quebec Central Railway, and 8,000 sawlogs lying\" along the rivers Chaudi\u00e8re and Conway from the mill upwards.\nOn the 26th of August, 1896, the appellants, King Brothers lumber merchants of Quebec produced an opposition afin de distraire to this seizure and claimed' as their sole and exclusive property all the sawlogs and a certain quantity of boards and deals among those seized, under a certain agreement in writing, or con ventionsous seing priv\u00e9, dated Quebec, the 11th day of December 1895.\nit appears by that document that Taschereau\nvends et King Brothers, de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec ach\u00e8tent tous les madriers, en \u00e9pinette et en pin, que le vendeur devra scier \u00e2 son moulin la saison de 1896 livrables au quai des acheteurs \u00e0 Hadlow (at Levis), pas plus tard que le m\u00e8me Septembre.\nLes madriers devront \u00eatre bien et correctement sci\u00e9s et les acheteurs auront le droit de laisser tons les madriers reiet\u00e9s par leur culleur.\nPrix: Les prix pour les madriers livr\u00e9s des chars cull\u00e9s, et empill\u00e9s sur les quais dss acheteuss \u00e0 Hadlow seront: Etc.\nHere follows the enumeration of the divers prices according to the size and quality of the deals. The parties further agreed:\nIl est covenu que le vendeur paiera aux acheteurs $1.50 par 100 madriers Q. S (Quebec standard) Dour rencontrer les frais de recevoir le boss des chars, le classifier et l'empiler sur le quai.\nLe vendeur s'engage de faire scier les billots d'\u00e9pinette, tant que possible en madriers de 11 pouses, mais il est entendu que les acheteurs auront le droit de faire scier les billots en autres largeurs ou en autres \u00e9aisseurs et que leur notification \u00e2 cet effet sera assez.\nLes acheteurs feront prendre la specification du bois re\u00e7u une fois par mois, et ils paveront au vendeur la balance qui lui sera due, comptant moins 2 et demi par cent;\nLes acheteurs auvergneront sur l'ach\u00e2t de madriers aux conditions suivantes:\nPourvu que le vendeur fournira comme sur\u00e9t\u00e9 un acte de vente en r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 de sa \"propri\u00e9t\u00e9 v inclus le moulin et toute la machinerie qui l'appartient, ou qu'il fera passer par sa femme un billet promissoire pour le montant de chaqee culiage, comme suret\u00e9 collat\u00e9rale, \u00e0 l'option des acheteurs les dits acheteurs avanceront sur le certificat du culleur qu'il a re\u00e7u tant de billots un montant \u00e0 chaque cullage pas exc\u00e9dant $25 par 100 billots de la toise de 14 pouces.\nTous billots pay\u00e9s pour par les acheteurs seront leur propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et seront re\u00e7us et \u00e9tamp\u00e9s dans leur nom.\nToutes avances porteront int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 raison de sept par cent.\nIt is not alleged, nor does it appear from the evidence that this contact was in fraud of the creditors. The appellants were not creditors of Taschereau except for a small balance of about ten dollars. A fair price was stipulated for the deals and boards; it represented in fact the current market value in Quebec. It is not even suggested either that on the 11th December, 1895, and during the following winter and spring, Taschereau was insolvent or even in financial difficulties. His insolvency only came out during the summer of 1896, about the time he was sued by the plaintiff and other creditors, long after the logs had been driven down the rivers Calway and Ohaudi\u00e8re to his mill or near it and partly turned into deals and boards.\nIt is also in evidence and not disputed, that before the river-drive commenced the logs were culled and received on behalf of the appellants on the shores of the Calway, and stamped by their culler with their initials or usual mark \" K.B.\" according to the practice prevailing among lumbermen. The last culling and stamping was made on the 13th of April, 1896, in the presence of the respondent himself. Upon the receipt of the returns of the culler in Quebec the appellants paid Taschereau for the logs a total sum of $3,131.38, or 32.33 per hundred logs, when they had agreed to advance only $25. The payment for the last culling was made on the 16th April, 1896.\nIt is stated that some of the lofts bore also the stamp of \"A.T.\" the initials of the defendant and that a small quantity of them was not stamped at all. The stamp of the defendant affixed before the appellants put their own could not defeat their rights the defendant admitting himself that the property of the logs was transferred to the appellants. (4 Mass\u00e9, n. 160 ). As to the small quantity of logs which were not stamped because they were buried in the snow or covered by ice, they were received by the culler of the appellants on their behalf along with the others and although the stamping is prim\u00e2 facie evidence of ownership any other proof is admissible and the reception of the whole lot by the appellants from the defendant is sufficient, especially as the monies paid by them to him exceed the amount they agreed to pay him for the same. Art. 1493. C.C\nThese facts are established by the book-keeper of the appellants, E. Quirouet and their culler Gr. McNaughton, and admitted by the defendant Taschereau. When examined as a witness for the appellants he says:\nQ. Veuillez prendre communication de l'opposition afin de dis traire des opposants en cette cause et dire lo.\u2014d'o\u00f9 proviennent les billots qu'ils revendiquent, qui a achet\u00e9 ces billots et \u00e2 quills ont \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9s et au nom de quills ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tamp\u00e9s: 20. \u2014d'o\u00f9 proviennent les planches et madriers qu'ils revendiquent aussi?\u2014R.

Est-ce la marque dont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement se servent les opposants pour indiquer les billots qui leur appartiennent?\u2014R. Je crois que oui\nQ. Est-ce qu'il ne se trouvait pas dans les \" drives \" du printemps, de l'\u00e9te et de l'automne dernier, une certaine quantit\u00e9 de billots portant votre nom seul ou vos initiales et qui n'\u00e9taient point frapp\u00e9s des initiales K.B.?\u2014R. Il pouvait s'en trouv\u00e9r quelques-uns mais pas beaucoup et ils auraient d\u00fb tous porter la marque des opposants.\nFinally, when examined by the respondent, and speaking of the logs, he says:\nQ. Si quelques-uns de ces billots n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rev\u00eatus les lettres K.B. c'est donc qu'ils \u00e9taient recouverts de neige et de glace? \u2014 R. .Oui, ou bien par negligence, car ils anraient d\u00fb tous \u00eatre marqu\u00e9s des lettres K.B. car j'en avass tout vendu le boss aux opposants.\nIt has been contended that Taschereau was hostile to his creditors and favourable to the appellants. The trial judge who heard and saw the witnesses, does not consider him so nor does he throw any suspicion or discredit upon his character or credibility; the record rather shows an inclination on his part to favour his creditors generally. He gave to the respondent a confession of judgment and consented that an execution he taken out at once for the benefit of all his creditors even against the timber of the appellants; and when pressed, later on, to make a cession de biens, he did not resist, but immediately submitted. The record further discloses the fact that he is an honest man. Having consented that the whole of his movable estate should be sold en justice, to satisfy all his creditors in consequence of his insolvency, but remembering that, by mistake, he had omitted a portion of it, he went to the bailiff and insisted upon his taking possession of the same.\nIt must finally be remarked that the respondent claims a privilege upon the logs for the amount of his claim. Whether he has such a privilege or not, whether he can yet enforce it having parted with his possession of the logs, it is not necessary to consider. Such a privilege is no answer to the opposition of the appellants, if they are the true and lawful owners of the property seized, and we therefore believe that the demurrer fyled by them should have been maintained, and it is hereby maintained with costs.\nThe real question to be decided is, whether, under the said contract and the circumstances of the case, the appellants are the owners of the movable property they revendicate; in other words, does the agreement between the parties amount to. a sale? The Superior Court (Pelletier J.), held that the appellant were mere pledges not in possession, and the Court of Review (Caron and Andrews J J , Sir L. N. Casault C.J. dissenting), confirmed this judgment for the reasons given by the Superior Court:\nConsid\u00e9rant que la convention entre les opposants et le d\u00e9fendeur et telle qu'interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e par eux, n'\u00e9tablit pas une vente parfaite, mais seulement un engagement par lequel les acheteurs ont fait des avances au vendeur, qui, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 s'est oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 fournir des garanties en vue de la livraison d'une ceraaine quantit\u00e9 de madriers moyennant un. prix u\u00e9termine lors quils serott livr\u00e9s, compt\u00e9s et empil\u00e9s sur le quai. des opposants \u00e0 Levis. 26 It is apparent from the wording of the written agreement of the 11th day of December, 1895, that though two contracts were entered into by the parties one affecting the deals and boards and the other respecting the logs \u2014 only one transaction was intended, and only one object was in view, namely, the owner ship of the timber by the appellants upon the payment of a fixed price.\nAs to the deals and boards, the terms of the agreement leave no doubt that the parties intended to make a sale of the same. But was it a sale of something uncertain or determinate within the meaning of article 1026 of the Civil Code, or a sale of movable things by weight or measure and not in the lump, contemplated by article 1474? The appellants con tend that it was not, Taschereau selling not so many thousand pieces or feet of lumber to be counted or measured, but \"all the pine and spruce deals that the vendor shall cut in his mill during the season of 1896, to be delivered at the purchasers' wharf at Hadlow.\" The thing sold, they argue, is therefore certain and de terminate and in the lump, and is not by the number or measure. The price is certain and fixed, and the amount of the purchase money alone is uncertain and indeterminate and can be ascertained only when the deals and boards are delivered from the railway cars, culled and piled up at Hadlow. Under articles 1025,1027 and 1472, they say finally, the sale was perfect by the mere consent of the parties, irrespective of any delivery, even against third parties in good faith. There is no doubt much force in this argument but it is far from being free from difficulty; it has caused a great deal of diversity of opinions among the commentators and the tribunals of France under Art. 1585 C.N., which is not so sweeping as art. 1474 of the Quebec Code. We do not intend to pronounce upon this delicate point and we prefer to base our judgment upon that part of the contract which deals with the logs. were the logs actually sold? Taschereau understood it so and he so declares in his deposition quoted above. Both Mc Naughton and Quirouet, employed by the appellants, had the same understanding of the transaction It is very well known that the best mode of acquiring the property of logs by lumbermen is to stamp them with the initials or trade mark of the purchaser. McNaughton says that is the custom, and if we consult the law reports of the various provinces, we will see that that custom prevails over the whole Dominion and, we may add, over the entire continent of America. That custom has been sanctioned by high judicial authority both in France and in the Province of Quebec, and also by the Canadain Parliament: Criminal Code, Art. 338; VanKoughnet v. Mailand ([30]); Paris 15th April, 1579, reported by Charondas; Cass. 26th January, 1808; lal. R\u00e9p. Vo. Biens, n. 45-46; 21st June 1820, S.

The Roman law also recognized the stamping of timber as proof of sale and delivery. Videri autem trabes traditas quas emptor signasset, says Paul. So held Straccha, Menochius, Favre and Casageris, quoted by Mass\u00e9. The ownership is presumed from the mere stamping of the logs, unless the contrary be proved; in this case the presumption is supplemented by oral evidence that a transfer of property was really intended. But there is more. The proof of the sale appears upon the face of the written agreement. It is therein stipulated that u all logs paid for by the purchasers shall be their property and shall be received and stamped with their name.'' The price to be paid is mentioned, viz: $25 for each 100 logs of 14 inches standard which, and more, has been paid by the appellants to Taschereau.\nIt is contended that the next paragraph destroys the above stipulation, inasmuch as it provides for the charge of interest at 7 per cent on all advances,\" and. that therefore the parties intended to make a pledge and not a sale, to secure the payment of those advances Here and elsewhere in the contract the word \"advances \" does not mean a loan of money, but a payment in advance on the price of the deals to be delivered at Hadlow, and the contract says so in. express terms; \" The purchasers shall advance on the price of the deals on the following conditions, etc.\" The parties intended to operate a sale of the logs; they so declare under oath, and the stipulation made in the written agreement that they will become the property of the appellants would receive no effect if a pledge only was created. No pledge can. convey any permanent or absolute right of ownership; it merely gives to the creditor the right to be paid by privilege, and the thing pledged remains in his hands only as a deposit to secure his debt. Here there was no debt, but a mere payment by anticipation on the deals; morever, it matters very little if the monies paid by the appellants were advanced in [relation to or independently of the sale of the deals; the parties intended to make and did make a sale and delivery of the logs. It was the natural sequence of the sale of the deals. Without it Taschereau could not secure the necessary material, and it is only reasonable that the ownership of the two should be vested in the same name. The transaction could not be carried out successfully in any other manner. Any other conclusion would seriously disturb the business operations of dealers in lumber, if not render them unsafe and impossible in many cases.\nIt is also argued that after the stamping, Taschereau remained in possession of the logs; so he did, but for the benefit and in the name of the appellants, to carry out his part of the contract to drive the logs down the river to his mill saw them and deliver them at Had low. His possession was the same as that of any other driver who would undertake to carry the lumber of any merchant, or of a mill owner who uses the material of another; his possession was qualified and limited to those objects only. Finally it is proved that the appellants advanced $400 to pay the men who made the drive, and that they had a man named Olivier Cot\u00e9, to oversee the drive.\nIt is finally stated that the fact that the appellants required further security for their advances, for instance, a deed of sale \u00e0 rem\u00e9r\u00e9 of his mill or a note of his wife, demonstrate that the logs formed the subject matter of a separate, transaction, in fact a debt independent of the deals. The written agreement proves the very r\u00e9verse. The additional security mentioned was only reasonable, as privileges for a large amount might be allowed to be taken on the logs by workmen in the shanties or in the mill, or by river drivers. As a matter of fact, the appellants did not exercise the option given to them of additional security, whether in con sequence of neglect on their part, or by reason of being satisfied that Taschereau would act honestly with the money paid to him in advance, the record does not show. The ownership of the logs being established, that the deals and boards cut out of the same must follow (art. 434, C. C.) the appellants having more than paid the cost of workmanship fixed by the contact. The statements and the evidence produced show that Taschereau was entitled to a total sum of $6,19.63 for deals and boards delivered at Hadlow both before and after the seizure, whereas the appellants actually paid and disbursed the sum of $7,809.61 on account of the deals and boards received at Hadlow, as well from Taschereau as from one Joseph Morin, who, after security being furnished by the appellants in due Corse, sawed the logs remaining not cut at the time of the seizure. Even as pledges in possession of the logs, it would seem, upon the authority of the Privy Council in Young v. Lambert ([31]), that the appellants are entitled to succeed. But it is not necessary to examine this point. We hold that the written agree ment and the evidence show that the contact between the parties constituted a sale of the logs, and, as a necessary consequence, of the deals and boards.\nFor these reasons, we are of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Court of Review reversed. The opposition afin de distraite of the appellants is therefore maintained with costs before all the courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Taschercau, Lavery & Rivard.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.

Emmett v. Quinn (7 Ont. App. R. 306) distinguished.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (24 Ont. App. R. 599) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of Meredith C.J. at the trial[2].\nA lease of land for a term of twenty-one years with right of renewal and purchase of the fee was mortgaged to the plaintiffs. The equity of redemption was afterwards assigned to the defendant MacKenzie, who eventually purchased the fee. The plaintiffs by their action claimed that their mortgage became a charge upon the fee, while the defendant claimed that as owner of the reversion he had priority of lien over the mortgagees and a right to collect the ground rents from the mortgagees in possession and the sub-tenants. Both courts below held against the latter contention.\nThe facts are fully set out in the judgment of the court. Armour Q.C. and Saunders for the appellant. If the equitable owner of the term had purchased the reversion there might have been a merger, but not where it has been acquired by a second mortgagee, the owner of the term still being a tenant.\nMerger is entirely a question of intention. North of Scotland Mortgage Co. v. German[3], And see Snow v. Boycott[4] as to the doctrine of merger under the Judicature Act.\nAs between the first and second mortgagees the acquisition of the reversion is not subject to the mortgage. Nesbitt v. Tredennick[5]; Aberdeen Town Council v. Aberdeen University[6]; Randall v. Russell[7]; Rawe v. Chichester[8].\nThe right to purchase in the lease could only be enforced against the original lessors and not their assignees; Emmett v. Quinn[9]; so that the purchase from the assignee was not under the lease. If it was, the usual terms of repayment of money paid out should have been imposed. See Keech v. Sandford[10]; In Re Lord Ranelagh\u2019s Will[11]; Phillips v. Phillips[12].\nScott Q.C. and Allan Cassels for the respondents. McKenzie acquired the fee as assignee of the equity of redemption and thus enlarged the estate for the benefit of the mortgagee. Doe d. Gibbons v. Pott[13]; Doe d. Ogle v. Vickers[14].\nIn the following cases it was held that a mortgage of a term was a charge upon the fee acquired subsequently. Moody v. Matthews[15]; Trumper v. Trumper[16]; Leigh v. Burnett[17]; Phillips v. Phillips10; and see Coote on Mortgages, 4 ed. p. 268; Fisher on Mortgages, 5 ed. p. 333.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGWYNNE J.\u2014By an indenture of lease bearing date the first day of July, 1885, James Austin and William Arthurs did demise and let unto one William Snowden Thompson certain lands and tenements situate in the city of Toronto, particularly described in the said indenture, whereof they, the said James Austin and William Arthurs were then seized in fee simple, to have and to hold to the said Thompson, his executors, administrators and assigns, for the term of twenty-one years from the said first of July, and recoverable at the expiration of the said term in the manner in the said indenture of lease provided. The said lessee in the said indenture did thereby for himself, his executors, administrators and assigns, covenant with the said lessors, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, to pay rent and taxes and to keep the buildings to be erected thereon insured to an amount not less than five thousand dollars. And the said lessors, for themselves, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, did by the said indenture covenant and agree with the said lessee, his executors, administrators and assigns, among other things as follows:\nThat the lessee, his executors, administrators and assigns may at any time during the first ten years of the term hereby granted, purchase (and the lessors agree to sell to him or them at any time within the said term of ten years) the fee simple in said lands for fourteen thousand dollars to be paid in cash at time of purchase and ground rent paid to such date.\nBy an indenture of demise by way of mortgage made upon the 10th day of November, 1885, the said William Snowden Thompson did assign and transfer unto the Building and Loan Association (the plaintiffs in this action), their successors and assigns, the lands and tenements in the said indenture of lease mentioned, to have and to hold the same together with the said lease and the term thereby granted subject however to redemption upon payment of the sum of six thousand dollars by the instalments and at the times in the said indenture by way of mortgage mentioned, and subject also to the proviso that until default in such payment the mortgagor, his heirs and assigns, should have and retain possession of the said lands and of the rents, issues and profits thereof.\nBetween the day of the date of the last mentioned indenture and the month of January, eighteen hundred and ninety-one, the said demised premises and the said indenture of lease and the residue of the term thereby granted, and all the estate and interest of the said lessee, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, and all the benefit of the covenants therein contained upon the part of the said lessors therein, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, to be observed and kept, became by mesne assignment vested in one Charles Joseph Smith, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, subject to the said indenture of assignment by way of mortgage to the plaintiffs, and being so vested in the said Charles Joseph Smith, he by an indenture bearing date the 31st day of January, 1891, in consideration of the sum of forty thousand dollars therein acknowledged to have been paid to him by William McKenzie (the above appellant), did grant, bargain, sell and assign unto the said William McKenzie to have and to hold unto him, his executors, administrators and assigns, the tract of land and premises comprised in and demised by the said indenture of lease, together with the said indenture, for the residue of the term thereby granted, and for all other the estate, term, right of renewal and other the interest of him the said Charles Joseph Smith therein subject to the payment of the rent and the observance of the lessee\u2019s covenants and agreements in the said lease reserved and contained, and the said Charles Joseph Smith did thereby for the consideration aforesaid, further assign, transfer and set over unto the said William McKenzie, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, the right to purchase the freehold in the said premises in the said indenture of lease contained, and all benefit and advantage to be derived therefrom.\nBy the said indenture, the said Charles Joseph Smith for himself, his heirs, executors and administrators, covenanted with the said William McKenzie, his executors, administrators and assigns, that he and they subject to the said rent and the lessee\u2019s covenants and agreements in the said lease contained should enjoy the said demised premises for the residue of the said term by the said lease thereof granted, and any renewal thereof (if any) for their own use and benefit without the let, suit or hindrance of the said Charles Joseph Smith or any other person whomsoever free from all incumbrances whatsover excepting only the mortgage made by the said William Snowden Thompson to the said Building & Loan Association. This indenture was duly registered in the registry office of the division in which the demised lands were situate, on the third day of February, 1891, and upon the thirteenth of that month the appellant caused his solicitors, by a letter of that date, to notify the respondents that he had purchased the said leasehold premises whereon they held their mortgage.\nIn the month of June, 1895, the appellant being and claiming to be owner of the equity of redemption in the said leasehold term and premises, and to be entitled to purchase the reversion in the said premises in fee in virtue of the assignment to him contained in the said indenture bearing date the 31st day of January, 1891, of the benefit of the covenant in the said indenture of lease to the said Thompson in relation to the purchase of said reversion, caused a deed to be prepared by one A.J. Sinclair, as his solicitor, and to be presented to a Mr. Britton who was then seized of the said reversion in fee for execution; and thereupon the said Mr. Britton executed the said deed so prepared and presented to him. This deed bears date the 21st day of June, 1895, and thereby after reciting therein the said indenture of lease of the 1st of July, 1885, and the privilege thereby granted to the lessee therein and to his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, to purchase the fee simple in the said lands upon the terms and conditions and within the time therein reserved and contained, and that the said lease and the benefits and all the conditions therein contained had become vested in the said William McKenzie (the now appellant), and that he desired to purchase the fee simple in said lands, the said Mr. Britton did, in consideration of fourteen thousand dollars, then paid by the said McKenzie to him, the said Mr. Britton, grant the said lands and premises unto and to the use of the said William McKenzie, his heirs and assigns for ever.\nNow by the terms of the said indenture of the 31st of January, 1891, it is apparent that the equity of redemption in the said term and the whole of the estate and interest of the said Charles J. Smith in the premises so as aforesaid mortgaged to the respondents, did become absolutely vested in the appellant, and that as the assignee of such the estate and interest of the said Charles J. Smith, he became entitled also to the benefit of the covenant in the lease contained in relation to the purchase of the fee simple in the said lands at and for the sum of fourteen thousand dollars, and he became by the said indenture liable, as such assignee, for the payment (to the ground landlord for the time being) of the rent reserved by the lease of the 1st of July, 1885.\nNow, the time within which the right to purchase the fee simple at the price named in the lease must be exercised, being about to expire on the 1st of July, 1895, the position of the appellant in the month of June when he procured the deed above stated to be executed by Mr. Britton was this: the rent which as owner of the equity of redemption he was then by force of the indenture of the 31st of January, 1891, bound to pay to the ground landlord, then being Mr. Britton, was $840 per annum, or 6 per cent upon the $14,000 settled as the price to be paid for the purchase of the fee; when, therefore, the appellant procured the execution by Mr. Britton of the deed of the 21st June, 1895, he was very probably making an advantageous bargain for himself by reason of the depreciation of the interest obtained for the use of moneys. By paying the $14,000 the effect of his operation was that he became thereby for the whole residue of the term granted by the lease relieved from his liability to pay $840 per annum, ground rent.\nShortly after the execution of the deed of the 21st June, 1895, that is to say, upon the 28th of the said month, the gentleman who had acted as solicitor of the appellant in preparing and procuring to be executed by Mr. Britton the deed of the 21st June, 1895, sent in writing to the respondents\u2019 manager the following notice:\nTake notice that on behalf of the owner of the equity of redemption in the leasehold property known as Nos. 37, 39, 41 and 43 Wellington Street East, Toronto, and more particularly described in a certain mortgage of the said leasehold property made by one W.S. Thompson, to the said Building and Loan Association, that I will, at the expiration of six months from the 30th day of June, 1895, pay off the principal money remaining unpaid and owing to the said Company on account of the said mortgage together with any accrued interest there may be due thereon. Yours, truly,\nA.J. SINCLAIR,\nSolicitor for the said owner.\nNothing having been. done in pursuance of this notice the respondents commenced the present action on the 25th day of February, 1896.\nUpon the 30th March, 1896, the appellant wrote to the manager of the respondents informing him that he, the appellant, had become owner of the freehold of the mortgaged property, and demanding payment of $210 ground rent coming due upon the 1st of April under the provisions of the lease to Thompson. This sum the respondents\u2019 manager paid under protest and specially without prejudice to their claims in the present action which had then been commenced, and was subsequently proceeded with to judgment. The appellant\u2019s defence to the action is that notwithstanding the terms of the indenture of the 31st January, 1891, he is only a second mortgagee of the leasehold term of which the respondents are first mortgagees, and that he is, in his own independent right, seized of the fee simple estate in the mortgaged premises, and as being so seized he is entitled to demand and receive from Smith, and failing him, from the respondents, as mortgagees, and from the subtenants of the said mortgaged premises, to the prejudice of the respondents, as mortgagees, the ground rent reserved in the lease to Thompson during the residue of the term thereby granted, and finally that there is no privity between the appellant and the respondents to give the latter any action against the former. In support of this contention the appellant produced at the trial a letter written by himself to Smith, and another, dated the 6th of February, 1891. This contention does not appear to be made by the desire of nor in the interest of Smith, who, from anything in evidence, does not appear to claim to have any estate or interest in the said leasehold premises in virtue of anything contained in this letter which is produced from his own possession by the appellant himself, who seeks by it to change and subvert the whole intent of the indenture of the 31st of January, 1891, as expressed therein, and as the evidence shows, it was understood and acted upon by the appellant until the defence set up in this action. The letter, however, was received at the trial and is before us on this appeal. It is as follows:\nTORONTO, 6th February, 1891.\nMessrs. C.J. SMITH and J.F. COLEMAN, Toronto:\nDEAR SIRS,\u2014I beg to say that it is my understanding of our agreement with reference to the $30,000 loan that the several deeds respectively dated the 31st day of January, 1891, and executed by C.J. Smith to me, the particulars whereof are as follows:\n1. Deed of Conveyance of lots 9 and 10 on King Street, and lots 11 and 12 on Brock Street, Plan D 253, registered as number 2458R.\n2. Deed of Assignment of lease part of the triangular block between Wellington and Front Streets, Toronto, and known as the \u201cBowes property,\u201d registered as number 2459R;\n3. Transfer under the Land Titles Act of the part of the aforesaid triangular block known as the \u201cWatson property\u201d; are to be considered merely as a mortgage to me upon those properties to secure the sum of $30,000 which I have advanced upon the security of a note dated the 2nd February, 1891, signed by C.J. Smith, and indorsed by J.F. Coleman, payable one year after date for $30,000 with eight per cent interest payable half yearly, and that upon payment of the said note at maturity I am to execute all proper deeds for the reconveyance of these properties as you direct. If the said note is not paid at maturity it is to bear interest at eight per cent per annum until paid, and upon default being made in payment of the said note or the first half year\u2019s interest thereon I am to be entitled forthwith to all the rights and remedies of a mortgagee.\n(Signed) Yours truly,\nWM. McKENZIE.\nWe agree to the above.\n(Signed), C.J. SMITH,\nJ.F. COLEMAN, Attorney.\nJ.F. COLEMAN. Mr. Sinclair who prepared the deed for the conveyance to the appellant of the fee simple in the lease hold premises, was called as a witness for the appellant. He stated that he had no instructions from the appellant in relation to the notice of the 28th June, 1895; he said that a short time previously he had gone to see Mr. Gillespie, the respondents\u2019 manager, to see if he would take the money due on the mortgage, and he said he would not receive it without six months interest or six months notice, and so that he gave the notice of his own accord without any authority from Mr. McKenzie. Being asked on cross-examination who was the \u201cowner of the equity of redemption,\u201d referred to in the notice he said that he himself was, that it had been conveyed to him by Mr. McKenzie for the purpose of endeavouring to effect a loan upon the property and therewith to pay off the respondents\u2019 mortgage, and that having failed to effect the loan he had reconveyed the equity of redemption to Mr. McKenzie. By the evidence of this witness, it also appeared that about January, 1892, he had been employed to act as solicitor in the interest of McKenzie, Smith (and one Coleman who also then claimed to have had some interest in the premises) to collect the rents from the tenants of the houses on the demised premises, and after payment thereout of the ground rent, taxes, and the sums coming due on the respondents\u2019 mortgage to pay the residue to Mr. McKenzie. It also in like manner appeared that Mr. McKenzie dealt with the other properties mentioned in the letter of the 6th of February, 1891, as the absolute owner of the estate and interest expressed in the deed conveying them to him and that Mr. Sinclair acted as his solicitor in those cases. It is thus apparent that whether Mr. Sinclair had or had not instructions or authority from Mr. McKenzie in relation to the notice of the 28th June, 1895, he was acting in the interest of the latter and in virtue of the authority vested in him, Mr. Sinclair, by the assignment to him by Mr. McKenzie, of the equity of redemption for the express purpose of enabling a loan to be effected thereby out of which the respondents\u2019 mortgage was to be paid. That Mr. McKenzie quite understood himself to be absolute owner of all of Smith\u2019s interest in the mortgaged premises is thus apparent; indeed on his examination in this case he admitted that from the time of the execution of that deed he supposed he was owner of the equity of redemption in the mortgaged premises. The learned counsel for the appellant also in his argument before us admitted the intention of the transaction to be, (as he said was a common practice with conveyancers in Toronto) to vest the absolute estate of Smith as expressed in the deed of the 31st January, 1891, in Mr. McKenzie so as to enable him to deal with the property as the owner thereof, and in such manner as should seem to him best to raise funds to be applied in paying off all charges on the property including his own advances.\nTo that extent it may be admitted without any prejudice to the respondents\u2019 claim in this action, that the appellant holds the estate in the term conveyed to him by the indenture of the 31st January, 1891, and also the right to acquire the fee simple upon the terms mentioned in the indenture of lease to Thompson as security for his, the appellant\u2019s advances; but whatever may have been the secret understanding between Smith and the appellant as to the intention of the indenture of the 31st January, 1891, it is certain that under that indenture the appellant acquired the only interest he ever had in the leasehold term, and that such interest was as assignee of the term and the premises subject to the respondents\u2019 mortgage, and that thereby he became liable as assignee of the term subject to the respondents\u2019 mortgage, to pay the ground rent reserved by the lease. In the discharge of this obligation by the appellant the respondents, as holders of the mortgage, subject to which the appellant became possessed of all Smith\u2019s interest in the term, have a very material interest which no secret arrangement between Smith and McKenzie could avail to impair.\nNow the appellant having in virtue of such the estate and rights so vested in him by the indenture of the 31st January, 1891, acquired the fee simple in the mortgaged lands and premises the sole material question upon this appeal really is: Can he in the character of owner in fee of the reversion in the leasehold premises, levy from the respondents or from the subtenants of the leasehold premises, the rent reserved in the lease of the term which by the effect of the indenture of the 31st January, 1891, he became himself under the obligation to pay, and thus impair the value of the respondents\u2019 mortgage subject to which he became possessed of the term? And the answer we think both upon principle and upon the authority of all the cases is, that he cannot. It was urged by the learned counsel for the appellant that the Court of Appeal for Ontario overlooked a decision of their own in a case of Emmett v. Quinn[18], and upon the authority of that case, and of Rawe v. Chichester[19], he contended that the appeal should be allowed. As to the decision of Emmett v. Quinn, whether well or ill decided we need express no opinion, for we think that, as no doubt the Court of Appeal for Ontario also thought, it has no application in the present case. Neither has Rawe v. Chichester, and for a like reason The ground of the contention was, that the frame of the covenant in the lease as to the purchase of the; reversion in fee was such that the lessors only, personally, and not their assigns, were under any obligation to convey and that therefore Britton was under no obligation to convey the fee to the appellant, and it was contended that therefore Britton is to be regarded as having conveyed under a mistake as to his being under an obligation to do so, and that thus the case comes within the principle of Rawe v. Chichester, and that the appellant, by reason of this alleged mistake, whether it be of Britton or of the appellant, is now entitled to hold the fee simple in the reversion as a purchase made by himself wholly independently of the assignment to him made by the indenture of the 31st of January, 1891, but the covenant in the lease which is the covenant of the lessors for themselves and their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, is express that the lessee, his executors, administrators or assigns may at any time during the first ten years of the term purchase the fee simple in the said lands for fourteen thousand dollars. Now, in the deed prepared by the appellant and presented to Mr. Britton for execution, the original indenture of lease and the covenant therein contained, in the form I have just stated (leaving out the words \u201cand the lessors agree to sell\u201d,) is quite correctly stated, and the deed further recited that the said lease and the benefits and all the conditions therein contained had become vested in the appellant, and that he desired to purchase the fee simple. Now this recital contains correctly both in point of fact and of law the right in virtue of which the appellant was calling upon Mr. Britton to convey the reversion whereof he was seized as assignee of the original lessors, to him, and he without any objection whatever or suggestion that he was not bound by the covenant in the lease and in consideration of the payment by the appellant of the price named in that covenant, executed the deed so presented to him and thereby conveyed the fee simple to the appellant. It is impossible under these circumstances to say that there was here any mistake of fact or of law, and if of the latter only, Rawe v. Chichester has no application. The right in which the appellant was desiring and claiming to have the fee conveyed to him, is very plainly and quite correctly stated, and Mr. Britton, whether under any obligation or not matters not, recognized the appellant\u2019s claim and in acknowledgement of it complied with it.\nThen, again, the learned counsel contended that Leigh v. Burnett[20] upon which among other cases the learned Chief Justice Meredith rested his judgment is in favour of, and not adverse to, the contention of the appellant, his contention being that the appellant\u2019s position in the present case is precisely analogous to the position in which Mrs. Leigh would have been in that case if the reversion had been conveyed to herself, but in truth the appellant having been the owner of the equity of redemption in the mortgaged premises, and the assignee of the right to purchase the reversion in the terms of the indenture of the 31st January, 1891, and having in that character applied for and obtained the reversion to be conveyed to him he occupies rather, as the learned Chief Justice Meredith held, a position analogous to that held by Newton in Leigh v. Burnett. The case in fact is simply resolved to this: Can the appellant, who acquired the reversion in virtue of the estate and interest assigned and transferred to him by the indenture of the 31st January, 1891, levy to his own use out of the mortgaged premises to the prejudice of the mortgagees, the ground rent reserved by the lease which by force of the terms of the indenture of the 31st of January, 1891, he was himself under an obligation to pay? That he cannot is the effect of the judgment now in appeal, and the like result would have followed whether he purchased the reversion in virtue of the covenant in the lease or otherwise. The appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Kingsmill, Saunders & Torrence.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Cassels & Standish.\n[1] 24 Ont.

Leclaire, 15 Moo. P. C. 181, distinguished; Sauvageau v. Gauthier, L. R. 5 P. C. 494, followed).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court of Lower Canada, sitting in Review, at Montreal, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which maintained the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe bank had granted a pension to a former cashier, A.A. Trottier, as a retiring allowance at the rate of $3,000 per annum for the first five years, and to be continued after that time at the rate of $2,000 per annum, payable monthly, during his lifetime, and paid the same regularly for some years notwithstanding that he was indebted to the bank in a large amount of money. It finally became evident that the financial affairs of the bank were so involved that creditors could not be paid in full, and the directors stopped payment of the pension, retaining the monthly instalments as they became due in compensation of the debt due to the bank. Mr. A. A. Trottier then assigned his claim for pension to one Bousquet, who afterwards assigned it to the plaintiff who brought the action to recover $1,166.99 for seven of the monthly payments alleged to be due up to the time of the suit. The bank set up their claim of over $30.000, against A. A. Trottier, in compensation to the extent of the amount claimed by the plaintiff's action, and upon issues joined, the trial court rendered a decision in favour of the plaintiff, and dismissed the plea set up by the defendant. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Review, and from this judgment the present appeal is taken.\nMOTION by the respondent to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction on the ground that the case did not involve any matter in controversy amounting to the sum or value of $2,000, and did not come within the exceptions stated in the 29th section of \"The Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\"\nMadore for the motion, cited Rodier v. Lapierre ([1]); O'Dell v. Gregory ([2]); Raphael v. Maclaren ([3]); Mac donald v. Galivan ([4]).\nGeoffrion, Q.C., contra. The plea of compensation sets up a claim for $30,000 which is the amount brought in controversy as a set off against the present and all future claims for pension until that amount may be fully satisfied by compensation. Again, the demand is for an annual rente, or pension in the nature of an alimentary allowance, payable by installments so long as Mr. A. A. Trottier may live, and the decision in this suit will have binding effect upon the right of the bank to set off its debt against any future instalments of the pension accruing to their debtor. The appellant's position is supported by the decisions in Macfarlane v. Leclaire ([5]); Sauvageau v. Gauthier ([6]); Gilbert v. Gilman ([7]); The Gitizens' Light and Power Company v. Parent ([8]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGIROUARD J.-This motion must be granted, and the appeal quashed with costs. The amount claimed by the action is for less than \u00a3500 sterling in fact it is for only $1,166. The appellant alleges that it affects future rights, but the jurisprudence of this court has been laid down in several cases that mere personal alimentary pensions or allowances do not constitute future rights within the meaning of the Supreme Court Act. A decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in Macfarlane v. Leclaire (1), has been quoted by the appellant as binding upon us, and determining this question in its favour as the bank bas an interest in the case exceeding \u00a3500 sterling, in fact exceeding $25,000. The bank may have such an interest against A. A. Trottier, but the latter is not in the case. The appellant has no interest against the respondent except to the amount of the plea of compensation in issue, or as alleged in the pleas \"jusqu'\u00e0 due concurrence en compensation \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente action.\" The case of Sauvageau v. Gauthier (2), quoted by the appellant, and likewise decided by the Privy Council, is contrary to his pretention.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Geoffrion, Dorion & Allan.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Madore, Guerin & Perron.\n[1] 21 Can.

(Gwynne and King, JJ., contra.)\nWhere a claim against the Crown arises in the Province of Quebec and there is no contract in writing, the thirty-third section of \"The Exchequer Court Act\" does not apply, and interest may be recovered against the Crown, according to the practice prevailing in that Province.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], upon a reference by the Minister of Railways and Canals, in favour of the plaintiffs for the amount of their claim for lumber sold and delivered, with interest and costs. The plaintiffs' claim was for the recovery of lumber sold and delivered to Her Majesty for the construction of the Wellington bridge and the Grand Trunk bridge over the Lachine Canal, at Montreal.\nThe following statement of the facts of the case, as disclosed at the trial, is taken from the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Taschereau.\nOn the twenty-sixth of November, 1892, the Government through their officer, Edward Kennedy, Superintendent of the Lachine Canal, invited tenders for the supply of lumber and timber required in the construction of the Wellington Street Bridge across the Lachine Canal at Montreal. The respondents tendered, and, their tender being accepted, they commenced in the month of December, 1892, to supply and deliver lumber and timber to the Government officers in charge of the works. There was no formal contract entered into and nothing further than the tender and acceptance of it took place, so far as any written agreement was concerned.\nShortly after the construction commenced the respondents were requested to furnish and did furnish large quantities of lumber and timber of sizes and kinds differing from those mentioned in the invitation for tenders, and during the month of December, 1892, and the months of January, February, March and April, 1893, they, at the request and upon the orders of the officers in charge of the works, supplied and delivered at the works for the Wellington Bridge and for another bridge in course of construction by the Government in the same locality, called the Grand Trunk Bridge, a quantity of timber and lumber largely in excess of what was originally contemplated when the invitation for tenders was issued. The value of the timber and lumber so supplied and delivered amounted to the sum of $64,427.44. The value of the approximate quantity which, in the contemplation of the Government, at the time the tender was made, would be required amounted to $14,025.25, so that the quantity of timber and lumber actually supplied and delivered by the respondents, amount to $50,402.19 in excess of the amount mentioned in the invitation for tenders. This increase in quantity of timber and lumber so delivered and supplied was caused largely by circumstances to which it is unnecessary to refer. Suffice it to say that it is clearly proved that during the whole of the work of construction of these bridges, the officers of the Government in charge of the construction, from day to day sent their orders and requisitions to the respondents for lumber and timber. There was no distinction made by them as to whether the lumber and timber required were within the kinds and quantities of lumber and timber in the original tender, or whether it was of a different kind altogether. The respondents upon all of such requisitions delivered the timber and lumber so ordered by the officers of the Government, and at all times during the continuance of the said works, they supplied all demands made upon them for lumber and timber to be used upon the construction of the said bridges.\nAt the end of each of the months of December, 1892, and January, February, March and April, 1893, they prepared and furnished detailed accounts of all the lumber and timber supplied and delivered to the officers of the Crown under their orders as aforesaid, and these accounts, amounting in all to the sum of forty-three thousand, eight hundred and sixty-five dollars and six cents, were duly certified and forwarded to the Department of Railways and Canals and paid. The account for lumber and timber supplied and delivered for the month of April, 1893, was likewise duly prepared in detail and duly certified, but the Government refused to pay it and upon such refusal the respondents obtained from the Minister of Railways and Canals a reference to the Exchequer Court of their claims to, amongst other sums, the amount thereof, namely $16,155.65.\nThe present appeal is from the judgment of the Exchequer Court, upon the reference, in favour of the plaintiffs for their claim with interest and costs.\nChrysler Q.C. for the appellant. No contract has been established binding upon the Crown, under the provisions of R. S. C. ch. 37, secs. 6, 11 and 23. No contract can be implied which would enable subordinate officers and servants of the Grown to bind the Crown indirectly, in cases where they could not do so directly; and the statute applies to a contract whether wholly or partially executed. The appellants rely upon: Hunt v. Wimbledon Local Board[2]; Young v. Mayor of Leamington Spa[3]; British Insulated Wire Co. v. The Prescot Urban District Council[4]; Waterous Engine Works Co. v. The Town of Palmerston[5]; Wood v. The Queen[6] per Richards C. J. at page 645; Bernardin v. Municipality of North Duferin[7].\nThe Crown cannot be held liable for goods of which no benefit has been received, and it has been shown that a very large quantity of the lumber and timber charged for as delivered on the Government works, was not used in the works, nor required for use there, but was stolen and wasted. It is also clear that the respondents must have been aware of these misappropriations and misfeasances, from the nature of their dealings with the officials in charge of the works. As to the alleged omissions, for which the sum of $4,219.26 has been allowed, the evidence is wholly insufficient to warrant the opening up of accounts which have been accepted and paid: No sufficient explanation is given. If from the course of dealing a contract may be implied to pay for goods delivered under the same circumstances as those which were paid for by the Crown, and included the sum of $43,862.06, then such implied contract can only apply to goods delivered to and accepted by the officials upon the canal appointed for that purpose and upon accounts rendered to and certified by them. The claimants cannot by verbal testimony surcharge and prove omissions in accounts rendered by them as full statements to date, audited and certified by the officers in charge of the work. Even if a contract should or may be implied against the Crown, there cannot be any implied contract to pay for goods not accepted, received or certified for by the agents of the department appointed for that purpose.\nAs to the right of the claimants to recover interest, the Exchequer Court judge states[8], that the interest was allowed upon the authority of St. Louis v. The Queen[9], and not because he had formed any decided view that the plaintiffs were entitled to it; and apart from that case, he was not at all sure that the Crown was bound by the practice prevailing in Quebec to allow interest from the service of the writ. The appellant submits that, in any result of the case, interest should not be allowed against the Crown. See The Queen v. MacLean, et at[10]; In re, Gosman[11]; Toronto Railway Company v. The Queen[12]. The case of The Exchange Bank of Canada v. The Queen[13] is clearly distinguished.\nHogg Q.C. for the respondents, (Greenshields Q.C. with him). The learned judge of the court below has found, as a matter of fact, that the lumber and timber claimed by the respondents to have been supplied to the Government of Canada, and for which they bring their action, was actually sold and delivered to the Crown; and that such lumber and timber had been ordered and accepted by the officers and agents of the Crown. There is ample evidence in support of these findings of fact and it is uncontradicted. During the previous months, (December, January, February and March), lumber and timber ordered by the same officers in large quantities, for the purposes of construction of the bridges, were supplied and delivered by the respondents, although the original tender quantities had been during those months largely exceeded, and the government, knowing that the quantities then supplied, were greatly in excess of the original tender, knowing that these quantities were being procured from the respondents upon the orders and requisitions of their officers, knowing that no new tender had been authorized or asked for, raised no objections to the course of dealing between the officers and the respondents, but paid these four monthly accounts, as they were presented, upon the certificates of these officers. The effect of this conduct on the part of the Crown, was to ratify not only the course of dealing for the delivery of the lumber and timber during these previous four months, but to ratify and approve of the whole actions of the officers with the respondents respecting the obtaining and delivering of lumber and timber for the bridges, and the Crown is bound in like manner to pay the present account, both for lumber and timber supplied in April and for other material delivered during the five months, but by error omitted from their accounts as rendered. This material was, according to the evidence of the respondents, delivered during the whole period of the dealings between the parties, and ascertained by report of the referee, supported by evidence and confirmed by the judge in the court below. The twenty-third section of the Railways and Canals Act applies only in the case of contracts in writing and is no answer to a claim made for payment for goods actually delivered and accepted and used by the Crown. See Wood v. The Queen[14].\nThe respondents were not responsible for the acts and dealings of the government officers and workmen with the lumber and timber after it had been delivered, and any such evidence as that produced by the Crown, as to misappropriations and malfeasances by its own officers can have no effect. The contentions based upon such evidence must fall to the ground.\nThis matter is governed by the law and practice in force in the Province of Quebec as to interest and we are entitled to have interest from the date of the judicial demand[15] i. e., the filing of the reference in the Exchequer Court.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014(After stating the facts of the case.) This is an appeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, upon a reference by the Minister of Railways and Canals, of a claim made by the respondents for lumber sold and delivered to the Crown for the construction of bridges over the Lachine canal at Montreal.\nThe Exchequer Court has found as a matter of fact that the lumber and timber claimed by the respondents to have been so supplied to the Government, was actually sold and delivered to the Crown, and that such lumber and timber had been ordered and accepted by the officers and agents of the Crown. The evidence is all one way as to this fact.\nBut the Crown base their principal defence to the respondents' claim on the twenty-third section of the Act respecting the Department of Railways and Canals[16], which enacts that\nNo deed, contract, document, or writing relating to any matter under the control or direction of the Minister, shall be binding upon Her Majesty unless it is signed by the Minister, or unless it is signed by the Deputy of the Minister, and countersigned by the secretary of the department, or unless it is signed by some person specially authorized by the Minister, in writing, for that purpose.\nWe are of opinion with the Exchequer Court, that this enactment has no application. The word \"contract\" therein, means a written contract. Here the lumber claimed for was delivered under verbal orders from the Crown officers, and the statute does not apply to goods actually sold, delivered and accepted by the officers of the Crown, for the Crown.\nThe cases of Hunt v. Wimbledon Local Board[17], and Young v. Mayor of Leamington Spa[18], have no application. There is no statute here imperatively requiring that all contracts by the Crown should be evidenced by a writing, and in the absence of such a special statute the Crown cannot refuse to pay for materials bought by its officers in the performance of their duties and delivered to them for public works.\nIf Parliament had intended that no oral contract should be binding on the Crown, it would have been so easy to say so in unambiguous terms that we should not, by a forced construction of language in the section in question, make it say what it does not unambiguously say.\nIt is obvious that the every day business of the railways and canals of the country from the Atlantic to the Pacific could not be carried on, if for every small article required, every nail to be bought, accident or no accident, emergency or no emergency, necessity or no necessity, the officers of the department on the spot could not legally contract for the Crown.\nIf this construction of the Act is contrary to the intentions of Parliament, the remedy lies in Parliaments own hands.\nThe contention that some of this lumber was stolen or wasted need hardly be noticed. After delivery it was not the respondents' duty to see that it was not stolen or wasted. It was then the property of the Crown and in the Crown's possession. If the Crown did not get the benefit of it, it is not the respondents' fault.\nThere is an item of $4,219.26, claimed by the respondents which the Crown, upon this appeal, specially objects to. It appears that after their accounts had been rendered, the respondents discovered that certain quantities of lumber and timber which had been delivered on the works, had by error been omitted from the said accounts, and they add the amount thereof in their claim against the Crown. In the Exchequer Court the ascertainment of the quantity and value of these omitted items was referred to the registrar, who after investigation, reported that they amounted to the said sum of $4,219.26. The learned judge confirmed that report. There remains for us but a question of fact involved on this branch of the case, and upon that question of fact, the finding of the Exchequer Court, for which there is ample evidence, cannot be disturbed. A third ground of appeal taken by the Crown is upon the question of interest which the judgment appealed from allows to the respondents upon the amount of the judgment since the date of the reference to the Exchequer Court.\nUpon this point also the appeal fails. The law of the province of Quebec rules this case, and according to that law, such interest must be allowed upon a claim of this nature. This is not a case upon a written contract, so that section thirty-three of the Exchequer Court Act does not apply.\nGWYNNE J. (dissenting.)\u2014The claimants in their statement of claim allege that on the 9th of December, 1892. Her Majesty acting through the proper officers of the Dominion of Canada in that behalf entered into a written contract with the claimants whereby they agreed to supply certain specific quantities and description of timber at certain specific prices for the construction of a certain public work of the Dominion of Canada called the new Wellington Bridge over the Lachine Canal at Montreal. They then allege that subsequently to the making of the said contract Her Majesty acting through the officers aforesaid commenced the construction of another bridge called the Grand Trunk Railway Bridge over the said Lachine Canal at Montreal. They then allege:\n5. That during the construction of the said bridges the claimants received requisitions from the said officers from time to time for the supply and delivery of timber and lumber, and in compliance with said requisitions they supplied and delivered to Her Majesty's said officers during the month of December, 1892, and the months of January, February, March and April, 1893, a large quantity of timber of various kinds and dimensions to wit, 3,613,000. feet board measure.\n6. That the claimants from time to time during the construction of the said bridges rendered accounts to Her Majesty's said officers of the timber and lumber so supplied and delivered as aforesaid which accounts were received, approved and duly certified by the said officers for payment by Her Majesty.\n7. That the total amount of the accounts for the timber and lumber so delivered as aforesaid was the sum of 167,474.43 on account of which Her Majesty paid and the claimants received the sum of $43,862.06 leaving a balance due to the claimants of $23,612.37 for which balance with interest thereon Her Majesty is indebted to the claimants.\nThis claim in so far as it relates to timber and lumber delivered under the written contract of December 9th, 1892, is not disputed. That contract is not questioned. It is admitted, and in fact has been overpaid. It is only as to the amount now claimed by the claimants in excess of the sum of $43,862.06 which they acknowledge to have received, that the Attorney General of the Dominion resists the present claim. Much of that sum if it had not been paid in the manner hereafter appearing might have been open to the same objection as that which is offered to the portion which is demanded in excess of what has been paid; but having been paid the Dominion Government do not now assert any claim in respect thereof. The defence offered to so much of the claimants demand as has not been paid relates wholly to timber and lumber which the claimants allege that they have supplied _and delivered under requisitions which they allege that they received \"from the said officers,\" that is to say, \"from the proper officers in that behalf \"\nThe Attorney General of the Dominion after setting out the written contract alleges that save as in and by that contract Her Majesty did not purchase from the claimants any timber or lumber, and as to the alleged requisitions in the statement of claim mentioned he specially pleads that\nHer Majesty did not authorise the engineer in charge of the work, nor the superintendent thereof nor any other officer of Her Majesty to contract for, or order, or give requisitions for timber or lumber except as and when authorised by the Minister of Railways and Canals acting on behalf of Her Majesty, and the alleged requisitions if any were given which Her Majesty does not admit, but denies, were not in fact authorised by the said Minister of Railways and Canals.\nAnd he farther pleaded that\nif it should appear in the evidence that Her Majesty's officers did in fact duly certify and approve of some of the accounts, then Her Majesty avers that the accounts so certified and approved amounted to the sum of $43,862.06, and that the said accounts were duly paid by Her Majesty and the said sum was received by the claimants in satisfaction and discharge of the claimants' said accounts so certified and approved, and Her Majesty avers that except as to said accounts so satisfied and discharged no accounts rendered by the claimants were delivered to Her Majesty nor were any of the said accounts approved or certified for payment by Her Majesty's officers.\nNow it appeared in the evidence of Mr. Schreiber, the chief engineer, and who is also Deputy Minister of Railways and Canals, that a Mr. E. H. Parent was engineer in charge of the construction of the work for supplying the timber for which the contract of the 9tli December, 1892, was entered into and one Mr. Kennedy, a Civil Engineer, was appointed overseer of the work under Mr. Parent. Neither Mr. Parent nor Mr. Kennedy had any authority whatever to enter into any contract for supplying timber or lumber for any public work or to order or make requisitions for the delivery of any timber in relation to the particular work mentioned in the contract of the 9th December, 1892, other than that covered by that contract. It was part of Mr. Parent's duty as engineer in charge of the work to certify upon the accounts from time to time presented by the vendors of the timber that the prices charged therein were in accordance with the prices specified in the contract which was in his possession, and a stamped form to be put upon the accounts was in use for that purpose thus:\u2014\"Prices just and fair\" which he signed. It was part of Mr. Kennedy's duty as overseer of the work to sign a certificate on each account in a stamped form, \"I certify the above account to be correct in all details and particulars.\" It was also the duty of some subordinate officer under Mr. Kennedy employed to receive and measure the lumber contracted for, as and when delivered, to sign a certificate upon the claimants' accounts presented for payment also in a stamped form as follows: \"Received above goods.\" These certificates in these forms were required for the security of the department and for the information of the Chief Engineer at Ottawa whose approval of each account and his certificate of such approval were necessary in order to obtain payment of the accounts. The perfect accuracy of these certificates was most important as the Chief Engineer acted upon the faith of their accuracy in approving of the accounts and certifying for their payment. At the close of the month of December, 1892, the claimants rendered an account for timber delivered which at the prices named in the contract amounted in the whole to $6,421.66. This account was certified in the respective forms above mentioned, signed by Mr. Parent and Mr. Kennedy, and also by two persons whose names were subscribed to the words \"Received above goods.\"\nIn the month of January, 1893, the claimants presented an account for lumber delivered in that month to the value in the whole of $7,240.14 which was certified in the same manner and by the same persons respectively as was the account for December, 1892. The claimants in like manner presented an account for the month of February, 1893, amounting to $14,728.26. This account was certified by Mr. Parent and Mr. Kennedy in the respective forms above mentioned and the words \"received above goods\" were signed as follows:\u2014\"C. McGinley, culler\"; \"Thomas McConnomy, storeman\"; \"P. Coughlan, clerk and culler.\"\nThe claimants also presented an account for timber delivered in the month of March, 1893, amounting to $15,472. This account was certified by Mr. Parent and Mr. Kennedy in the respective forms above mentioned, and the certificate for receipt of the goods was signed by Thos. McConnomy, storeman; E. H. Mox, C. McGinley, timber culler. All of these accounts were upon the faith of the bona fides and accuracy of the above certificates approved and certified for payment by the Chief Engineer, and accordingly were paid to the amount in the whole of $43,862.06 which is in the statement of claim acknowledged to have been paid. In the month of April, 1893, the claimants presented an account as for goods delivered in that month to the amount of $16,155.65. This account was certified in the above form by Mr. Parent who, however, qualified that certificate by adding the following: \"All purchased without requisition, but according to contract, except sawn lumber, charged $30 per M. ft.\"; it was also certified by Mr. Kennedy in the prescribed form for him to certify in, and the receipt of the goods was signed \"C. McGinley, culler.\" This account the Chief Engineer refused to approve and certify for the reason that he began to think there was something wrong and upon looking into the matter, on his attention having been drawn to it, he did not think such a quantity of timber as was charged for could have been delivered by the claimants or required by the Government, and he formed the opinion that it never could have been measured, and further that more timber had been paid for in the accounts which had been settled than ever could have been required or delivered. The claimants were therefore referred to the Court of Exchequer under an order made by the Minister of Railways and Canals in pursuance of the provisions of section 23 of 50 & 51 Vict. ch. 16.\nNow the whole of this account for April amounting to $16,155.65 is for lumber alleged to have been delivered in excess of and outside of the contract of December, 1892, $12,642.50 of that amount is for sawn lumber and $1,227.70 for tongued and grooved boards, neither of which articles were called for or covered by that contract. These two sums make $13,870.20. Then as to the other items in the account amounting to $2,285.45 part is for timber of different sizes from those named in the contract of December, but charged for at the prices named in that contract for the sizes there contracted for, and the residue is for similar articles to, but in excess of, the quantities named in the contract of December, 1892, at the prices however named in that contract, in fact fully two-thirds of the accounts which had been paid was for lumber in excess of that which was covered by the contract, and very largely for lumber of a different description from that named in the contract of December, 1892. The claimants were well aware of this. The claimant, Norman B. T. Henderson, who gave evidence on his own behalf, says that the timber covered by that contract amounted to about $13,600, all in excess of that he delivered upon the verbal and written orders of McGinley and others, and the directions of Mr. Kennedy. He said that in the very first account presented he had distinguished the timber coming under the contract from that outside of it, as to which latter he charged prices he considered fair and just, but that Mr. Kennedy refused to certify them unless he should insert prices named in the contract, and he therefore took back his account and prepared it in the shape it is as certified. Now, upon referring to that account of December, 1892, we find lumber there which is not in the contract at all, namely, sawn lumber, and the charge there inserted for it is $20 per M, that is the highest price named for any lumber covered by the contract, and this item alone amounts to $2,908.63; accordingly in his subsequent accounts for January, February and March, although the fair prices for some of the lumber supplied was less, and for some more than any price named in the contract for the lumber thereby covered the claimants always inserted a price named in the contract. In the April account, however, they charge $30 per M, although in the prior accounts they had for the reason already given charged only $20 per M. It may be as well to give Mr. Henderson's evidence in his own words. He says:\nI might say that in December when we made out the account, first we made out an account for the contract stuff at contract prices, and another account for the stuff for the temporary work at different prices, what we considered then fair prices, that we hadn't a contract for, and when we took it in to Mr. Kennedy he said I can not pass those now because you have altered the prices. We had not agreed on any price\u2014that we ought to put them in at contract prices and fight the Government afterwards for the other prices. If I did not do that we could not get our money. We wanted our money pretty bad and we agreed with Mr. Kennedy to make all the stuff out at contract prices in the mean time any way.\nWhatever may have been Mr. Kennedy's motive for this arrangement as testified by Mr. Henderson, it is obvious that it was very improper and well calculated, as Mr. Henderson must have seen, to conceal from the department the fact that irregular orders, unauthorized by the Minister were being given to the claimants for the supply of lumber for which no contract had been entered into with the minister. When Mr. Parent qualified his certificate by the words,\nall purchased without requisition, but according to the contract, except sawn lumber, charged for at $30 per M.\" he must have meant that as regards the whole of this April account no requisition had been given, that is to say that no order had been given by any person having authority so to do, for the lumber charged for in the account, but that the prices charged were contract prices for the lumber there except as to the sawn lumber, and this was not in the contract of December, 1892, at all. It is in evidence that Lavery and Huot, two carpenters employed under the overseer, Mr. Kennedy, had directions from him to order whatever lumber they should require whenever they required it, and that they did, so repeatedly but verbally, and through McGinley, and McGinley gives evidence that Mr. Kennedy had directed him to get from the claimants whatever lumber the carpenters might require, and that he did so repeatedly on slips of paper, a number of which have been produced by the claimants, most of them having no date. The form of all will appear save as to date, from that of two subjoined which do bear a date the one of the 1st and the other of the 3rd April, 1893. That of the 1st of April is as follows in pencil:\nHENDERSON BROTHERS.\n15 pcs. 25 ft. S., 2 sides.\n16 \" 12 in thick.\n15 \" 37 ft. \"\nFor Huot, 1,000 3-in. deals.\nC. McG.\nAnd that of the 3rd April as follows:\nHENDERSON BROTHERS.\nFour loads of boards, good quality. C. McG.\nNow, this man McGinley, who thus signed these orders entered the employment of the Government on the 18th January, and left it on the 18th April, 1893. He recognized his signatures under the words, \"received above goods \"on the accounts for February, March and April. When he subscribed these words on the April account he was not in the service of the Government. He never checked the account for the purpose of seeing whether it was correct or not. He signed it because he was asked to do so by an assistant of Mr. Kennedy's. Neither did he check the accounts for February and March which he had also signed; the only account which he ever checked was that of January, which he assisted Mr. Coughlan to check. All of the others he signed merely because he was asked to do so. Mr. Coughlan, whose name is subscribed to the certificate of receipt of goods on the February account says that he never checked that account, and that he signed just because Mr. Kennedy asked him to do so. He was then employed as time keeper. The claimants now in addition to the April account amounting to $16,155.65 claim two other sums, namely, one for $4,219.26, which they allege to be for lumber delivered, but by some error omitted from some or one of the accounts rendered for December, January, February or March, but what are the particular items and in what month omitted they cannot say, and a further sum of $2,077, which they claim as the loss sustained by them by reason of their having in accordance with Mr. Kennedy's suggestion when their first account was submitted to him in December, 1892, charged prices named in the contract for lumber not called for or covered by the contract, and which was of greater value than any named in the contract.\nThe learned Judge of the Exchequer Court has allowed the first two items less the sum of $478.80 for lumber shown to have been sent back to the claimants, making $19,986 11, with interest at 6 per cent from the first of October, 1896, amounting in the whole to $21,021.18, from which however is to be deducted the sum of $1,024.22 being for that amount allowed\n[Page 443\non a counter claim. The learned judge was of opinion that section 33 of ch. 37 of the Revised Statutes of Canada has no application in the present case for the reasons expressed by the late Sir Wm. B. Richards in the Court of Exchequer in Wood v. The Queen[19]. That case proceeded upon sections 7 and 15 of 31 Vict. ch. 12, which were substantially the same respectively as sections 11 and 23 of ch. 37 R. S. C.\nThe question there came up on demurrer, and no question arose as to the authority of the person or persons who had employed the suppliant to do the work for which the petition of right was filed. The claim was for services alleged to have been rendered to the Government of the Dominion in preparing plans, models, specifications and designs for the laying out, improvement and establishment of the Parliament Square in the city of Ottawa, and for superintending the work and construction of said improvements. To this claim two pleas were pleaded which were demurred to. In one it was pleaded that no such contract as was required by the 7th section was ever made or entered into with suppliant, and in the other that the employment alleged by the suppliant would have involved the expenditure of a large sum of money and that by section 15 of the Act such expenditure would have required the previous sanction of Parliament, and that no such sanction had been given. The learned Chief Justice allowed the demurrer as to the former of these pleas, and disallowed it as to the latter. As to the former he held that while the plea would have been good if the contract alleged in the petition of right was still executory it did not meet the petition of right which alleged that the contract had been executed; his laguage is: I am of opinion that the contract set out in the suppliant's petition is not binding as such, and under it he would have no right to recover damages for not being allowed to complete the work referred to in his petition. I do not think, however, that the 7th section would prevent the suppliant recovering for the actual value of the work done by him and accepted by the department. I see no reason why the law may not imply a contract to pay for work done in good faith and which the department has received the benefit of. Suppose instead of work done the contract had been to furnish a quantity of lumber\u2014the lumber had been supplied and worked up by the workmen of the department in finishishing one of the public buildings. Suppose for some reason the department repudiated the verbal contract and refused to be bound by it, could it be said that the property of the suppliant could be retained and used for the purposes of the department and he not be paid for it because the statute said the contract on which it was furnished was not deemed binding on the department. I should say not, the contract which is binding is that which arises from the nature of the transaction, having received the benefit of the contractor's property he ought to be paid for it under the new contract which the law implies. * * * If only the seventh section were considered I should as at present advised say the suppliant is entitled to recover what the services rendered by him were worth under the implied contract. It may be that on further consideration my views as to the suppliant's right on this point would be less favourable[20];\nNow, as it appears to me what the learned Chief Justice intended to convey and has conveyed by this language is that, on demurrer to a plea which impliedly admits that the work sued for had been executed for the department as in the petition of right alleged but not under such a contract as that mentioned in the 7th section of the Act, it must be held that the plea offers no defence to the suppliant's right to recover, under such implied contract what the services rendered by him were worth, but that when the facts came to be considered under the other pleas on the record the learned Chief Justice's opinion as to the suppliant's right to recover might be less favourable. The point adjudicated upon was simply a point of pleading. This language is similar in effect to the preliminary language of Blackburn J., at page 33, in Thomas v. The Queen[21] the petition of right in that case alleged an executed oral contract for breach of which the suppliant prayed relief. The question arose upon a demurrer to the petition of right and was simply whether a petition of right would lie for breach of contract, or to recover money claimed to be due by way of debt or damages, and such being the point raised by the demurer the learned judge premises his judgment which was the judgment of the court thus:\nWe leave it for future discussion to determine who have authority to make contracts on behalf of Her Majesty, and whether the contracts upon which the suppliant proceeds were in fact made by any one on behalf of Her Majesty, and if so made, whether they were made within the scope of that person's authority. On these points we express no opinions.\nBut the language plainly intimates that even in the case of an alleged executed contract it remains as a material point to be considered whether the person who made the contract had authority to act on behalf of Her Majesty and whether in making the contract he acted within the scope of his authority.\nThen upon the demurrer to the other plea in Wood v. The Queen the learned Chief Justice, while holding that the plea that the expenditure had not been authorized by the legislature, was good, adds the following, plainly because these judgments upon demurrer did not dispose of the suppliant's right to recover upon the whole record, but only disposed of points of pleading. He says:\nI assume the parties desire the opinion of the court on the broad question whether the suppliant can recover, and in the view I take of the 15th section the suppliant can only recover if the work and services rendered come under the exception referred to in that section and in which necessity would also justify the omitting to advertise for tenders under the 20th section.\nAnd again, It was contended on the argument that Parliament has made appropriations for these works and so sanctioned the expenditure. If that be so and the work done was of the kind that might properly be executed by the officers and servants of the department, then I apprehend no contract would be necessary to bind the department for the work done, and so suppliant should recover for work so done, and in my view also for the work actually done if the expenditure was previously sanctioned by Parliment, that, of course, is a matter of fact and must be proved as any other matter of fact.\nNow these observations of the late learned Chief Justice were made by him not as a judgment pronounced upon matters before him for judication, for all that was so before him consisted merely of questions of pleading, but as an expression of opinion as to the suppliant's rights upon the facts as stated by him as derived from the pleadings before him on the demurrers and some statements of counsel in argument as to a particular fact. Now in the petition of right it was alleged and impliedly admitted on the pleas demurred to that it was by the Government of the Dominion of Canada the suppliant was employed to do the work which he had done, and for payment for which he was suing, and the opinion of the learned Chief Justice was that for work so executed the suppliant was entitled to recover without a contract executed in the form prescribed in the 7th section of the Act. The judgment on the demurrer disallowing the plea and the opinion at the close, as above, rest wholly upon the distinction made between the case of an executory and an executed contract. Now, with the greatest difference for the opinion of the late learned Chief Justice Sir W. B Richards, for which I have the highest respect, I am unable to concur in this distinction in a case like the present. It is not, in my opinion, warranted by the decided cases. The cases which have arisen in England in respect of claims for work done for the corporations called \"Local Boards,\" and in the Province of Ontario in respect of claims against municipal corporations for work done for them without the formality of a contract under the seal of the corporation have no application in the present case. In Bernardin v. Municipality of North Dufferin[22] I endeavoured to point out the distinction between such cases and Hunt v. Wimbledon Local Board[23], Young v. The Mayor, etc., of Lemington Spa[24], and such like cases, namely that, in the former cases, the courts proceeded upon this principle that the right to recover against a corporation for work done for them on a verbal contract or on a quantum meruit, was regarded as an exception judicially established from the common law rule that corporations were bound only by instruments executed with their corporate seal, whereas in Hunt v. Wimbledon Local Board and such like cases they were governed by the express provisions of Acts of Parliament to which the courts would recognise no exception. I again drew attention to this subject and expressed the same opinion in Waterous Engine Works Co. v. The Town of Palmerston[25], and I have seen no reason to change the opinion there expressed. I stated the rule[26] as established by the courts to be\nthat where the managing body of a corporation aggregate contracts by parol for the execution of any work in respect of a matter within the purposes for which the corporation was created and the work has been executed in accordance with the contract and accepted as complete it would be a fraud in the corporation to refuse to pay for the work so executed the stipulated price or, in the absence of a stipulated price, the value thereof, and so to repudiate the contract upon the ground that it was not executed with the corporate seal.\nSuch cases have no application, in my opinion, in cases against Her Majesty as representing the Dominion Government and in the interest of the public. Now Frend v. Dennett[27], Hunt v. Wimbledon Local Board[28], and Young v. Mayor etc., of Leamington Spa[29], and the same case in the House of Lords[30] were all cases of executed contracts, and it was held that the language of the statutes which governed these cases were imperative, and could not, for that reason, be relaxed in any particular by the courts. Now, the clause of the statute under consideration in the present case, viz., sec. 23 of ch. 37, R. S. C., is fully as imperative as the clause of the statute referred to in the above cases. It enacts in the most express, and in my opinion, most unmistakable language that no contract which relates to any matter under the control or direction of the minister shall be binding on Her Majesty unless it is signed by the Minister, etc., as in the section is stated. The expression\nno contract relating etc., etc., shall be binding on Her Majesty, unless, etc., etc.,\nis precisely equivalent to\nevery contract relating, etc., in order to be binding on Her Majesty shall be signed by the Minister, etc., etc., etc.\nIt is, however, contended, upon grounds which appear to be hypercritical in the extreme, that the words \"no contract\" in the twenty-third section of the Dominion statute[31] are to be read as if the expression used had been\nno contract in writing relating etc., etc., shall be binding, etc., etc., unless, etc., etc.\nThis introduction of words, not used in the Act, which would have the effect of qualifying in a most material manner the plain ordinary and natural meaning of the language which has been used is rested upon the fact that the word \"contract\" is used in the same sentence and in connection with the words \"deed, \"document\" and \"writing.\" which are all written instruments, and it is argued that therefore the words \"no contract, etc.,\" and it must be read as if the expression used had been \"no written contract,\" etc., and that thus parol contracts are by implication excepted from the section, and that being so excepted they are valid. But if valid they would be equally so to maintain a suit for executory as for executed contracts, and so the distinction drawn in Wood v. The Queen[32] between executory and executed contracts would be unnecessary and irrelevant. If the section could be read as containing the words \"no written contract, etc., etc., etc., a matter which is sufficiently provided for in the words \"no deed, document or writing,\" then it must be admitted that the section contains a very emphatic pleonasm\u2014a defect in composition not lightly to be attributed to an Act of Parliament.\nThe only object and effect of reading the section as if it contained the words \"no written contract,\" etc.... etc., is to support the argument that parol contracts are excepted from the operation of the section; but it cannot be questioned that the words \"no deed, document, writing,\" etc., as used in the section, admit grammatically of no exception whatever. Every \"deed,\" every \"document,\" and every \"writing,\" \"relating to,\" etc., in order to be binding upon Her Majesty must be signed as required in the section So precisely in like, manner the words \"no contract,\" etc., admit grammatically of no exception, and so every contract relating to, etc., etc., in order to be binding on Her Majesty, must be signed as required by the section. It is true no doubt that the contract tp be signed as required by the section must be in writing, and in that sense it may be admitted that it is to written contracts only that the section applies, namely, as the only ones which can by signature as required be made valid and binding upon Her Majesty. This is very different from reading the section, as if the words used were \"no written contract relating to, etc., shall be binding, etc., unless, etc, etc.,\" and then construing those words as making parol contracts relating to matters under the control and direction of the minister quite valid and binding by implication. For my part I find it impossible to put any such construction upon the section, or any other than this, that no contract shall be valid unless signed, etc., and therefore, that no valid parol contract can be made relating to matters under the control and direction of the Minister. There is not, in my opinion, under the constitution of the Dominion of Canada, any mode by which authority can be conferred upon any individual to bind Her Majesty by a parol contract having the effect of imposing a burden upon the public funds of the Dominion other than by an Act of Parliament. It is the duty of everyone who deals with persons who affect to bind Her Majesty as representing the Dominion Government by contract relating to the public service to assure himself of the power and authority of such person to enter into the proposed contract. Nor is there any hardship in this, for everyone runs the risk of the person with whom he enters into a contract having power and authority in law to enter into the particular contract; and if he enters into a contract with a person who affects to bind another, he must be content to depend upon the responsibility of him with whom he contracts, if it should turn out that he had no authority to bind the person whom he affected to bind. The vast importance of the question involved in the present case must be my excuse for having dealt with it at such length. The looseness, the irregularities, not to say the malfeasance of some of the subordinate employees of the Government disclosed in the present case, in which the Plaintiffs seem to have taken part as appearing by their own acknowledgment of the arrangement made by them with Mr. Kennedy in December, 1892, as to the mode of presenting their monthly accounts until a more favourable time for fighting the Government should arise, seem to point to the necessity of having a final adjudication of two very important questions, namely, 1st: Whether in view of the provisions of chapter 37, R.S.C., any implied contract can arise from any, and if any, from what circumstances, whereby the public funds of the Dominion can be burdened by proceedings against Her Majesty as representing the Dominion Government, and 2ndly: Whether any parol contract entered into by any person, and if so, by whom, relating to matters under the control or direction of the Minister can be binding upon Her Majesty as representing the Dominion Government. In my judgement chapter 37, R.S.C., was framed as it has been with the view, in so far as the Department of Railways and Canals is concerned, of preventing the public funds of the Dominion being affected, by such loose, improper and unauthorized proceedings as have been disclosed in the present case, and that if this appeal should fail, the object of the Statute would be frustrated. I have not drawn attention to the fact, although it appears, I think, to have been abundantly established in evidence that fully nine hundred thousand feet of lumber have been charged for by the claimants more than have been used or required by the Government works. As to that quantity the. Government have derived no benefit, and the whole of the present demand of the claimants in money value covers less than the 900,000 feet. There is, therefore, this element wanting which was in Woody. The Queen[33] upon which the learned Chief Justice there laid so much weight. However, the points with which I have dealt seem to me to involve matters of such importance as to make it unnecessary to dwell upon this latter, which is one of such minor consideration. I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs, and that the claim of the claimants in the Exchequer Court should be dismissed with costs, and that the judgment in favour of Her Majesty upon the counter claim should be affirmed.\nSEDGEWICK J\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons stated in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Taschereau.\nKING J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I concur in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs for the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Taschereau.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the Appellant; Chrysler & Bethune.\nSolicitors for the Respondents: O'Connor, Hogg & Magee.\n[1] 6 Ex.

C.\nA steam sawmill was totally destroyed by fire, during the term of the lease, whilst in the possession of and being occupied by the lessees. The lease contained a covenant by the lessees \"to return the mill to the lessor at the close of the season in as good order as could be expected considering wear and tear of the mill and machinery.'' The lessees, in defence to the lessor's action for damages, adduced evidence to show that necessary and usual pre cautions had been taken for the safety of the premises, a night watchman kept there making regular rounds, that buckets filled with water were kept ready and force-pumps provided for use in the event of fire, and they submitted that as the origin of the fire was mysterious and unknown it should be assumed to have occurred through natural and fortuitous causes for which they were not responsible. It appeared however that the night-watchman had been absent from the part of the mill where the fire was first discovered for a much longer time than was necessary or usual for the making of his rounds, that during his absence the furnaces were left burning without superintendence, that sawdust had been allowed to accumulate for some time in a heated spot close to the furnace where the fire was actually discovered, that on discovering the fire the watchman failed to make use of the water-buckets to quench the incipient flames but lost time in an attempt to raise additional steam pressure to start the force pumps before giving the alarm.\nHeld, that the lessees had not shown any lawful justification for their failure to return the mill according to the terms of the covenant; that the presumption established by article 1629 of the Civil Code against the lessees has not been rebutted and that the evidence showed culpable negligence on the part of the lessees which rendered them civilly responsible for the loss by fire of the leased premises. Murphy v. Labb\u00e9 (27 Can. S. C. R. 126), approved and followed.\nAppeal by the defendants from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), ([1]) which reversed the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Ottawa ([2]), dismissing the plaintiffs action, and ordered a judgment to be entered in favour of the plaintiff for $10,000 damages and costs; and Cross-Appeal by the plaintiff to have the assessment of the damages under the same judgment increased.\nThe defendants leased a steam sawmill at Aylmer Que., from the plaintiff, for the milling season of 1896, a written memorandum of lease being signed by both parties, containing the covenant recited in the head note. The mill was destroyed during the month of May, 1896, during the night time, by a fire which originated in some unknown and mysterious manner in a heap of sawdust which had accumulated near the furnaces, in which a slow fire was kept up during the night to facilitate getting up steam for starting the machinery in the morning. Fire buckets filled with water were kept on the premises in convenient positions and force pumps provided, to be worked by steam, in the event of fire. A night-watchman also was employed by the lessees, his duty being to make periodical rounds of the mill premises and lumber yard and attend to the furnaces while the mill was shut down for the night. From the evidence it appeared that after the night-watchman attended to the furnaces at a quarter past eleven on the night of the accident, he had not returned to them until the discovery of the fire about three and a half hours later, and that there was no person left in charge of the furnaces during the time the watchman was making his rounds, which usually occupied about an hour and a half. On discovering the fire the watchman stated that he began to \" fire up\" for the purpose of increasing the steam pressure from 20 lbs., then showing on the gauge, to the 40 lbs. pressure necessary to work the force pumps, but that as the fire spread rapidly he raised the alarm. He stated that he began to call \" fire \" about ten or fifteen minutes after he first saw the flame. Another witness who saw the fire from some distance soon after it started, stated that it could have been extinguished then by throwing a pail of water upon it but this was not done In the trial court Mr. Justice Gill, dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs, but on appeal this judgment was reversed and damages awarded to the plaintiff with costs.\nJ.M. McDougall Q.C. and Lafleur for the defendants, appellants and respondents on the cross-appeal.\nGeoffrion Q.C, and Henry Aylen for the plaintiff, respondent and appellant on the cross-appeal.\nTASCHEIEAU J.\u2011 The lease in question contains covenant that the said Klock & Co. shall return mill to said Lindsay at close of season in as good order as can be expected considering usual wear and tear of mill and machinery Klock Co have failed with out any lawful justification to so return the mill as they had covenanted to do They are therefore liable would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAs to the cross-appeal on the amount of damages we do not see anything in the record which would justify us in interfering with, the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nGWYNNE J. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs for the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Girouard, and was also of opinion that the cross-appall should be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. were of opinion that the appeal and cross-appeal should both be dismissed with costs for the reasons stated in the judgments reported.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014The respondent, proprietor of a sawmill in Aylmer, Que., demands from the appellants the sum of $20,000 being the value of the mill machinery and other accessories, which were destroyed by fire on the 29th of May, 1896, while they were in the possession of the appellants as his lessees. The action was dismissed by the Superior Court (Gill, J.), the defendants having, in the opinion of the learned judge, rebutted the presumption of law created by article 1629 of the Civil Code, but this judgment was unanimously reversed in appeal, (Lacoste, C. J., and Boss\u00e9 Blanchet, Hall and W\u00fcrt\u00e9le, JJ.,) and the defend ants were condemned to pay the sum of ten thousand dollars. Hence the present appeal by the defendants, and also a cross-appeal by the plaintiff who asks for an increase of the amount awarded.\nThe rules of law governing a case like this have been laid down by this court in Murphy v. Labb\u00e9, ([3]) and we have nothing more to say on the subject, and we Simply refer to that decision. As to the facts, we entirely agree with the Court of Appeal and fully concur in the elaborate review of. the evidence made by Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9, and have no hesitation in adopting his conclusions:\u2013\nLe fait d'avoir laiss\u00e9 dans ces conditions et sans surveillance pendant un si long temps les fourneaux allum\u00e9s constitue une grave imprudence. Un bon pre de famille n'aurait pas agi ainsi.

En fait c'est l\u00e0 que le feu a origin\u00e9. Cette n\u00e9gligence n'est pas celle d'un bon pere de famille.\nLe fait de ne pas jeter sur ce commencement de flamme l'eau des sceaux qu'il avait sous la main, et de perdre un temps pr\u00e9cieux dans une tentative d\u00e9raisonnable pour obtenir une pression de vapeur additionnelle, quand ii lui en fallait au moins 40 lbs. pour faire fonctionner la pompe, est une faute grave du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 dont le proposant est responsable. Et de tout ceci, il r\u00e9sulte que, loin d'avoir repouss\u00e9 la pr\u00e9somption de faute \u00e9tablie par notre texte, les d\u00e9fendeurs ont montr\u00e9 qu'ils avaient commis trois fautes distinctes qui, en dehors de cette disposition denotre code, suffiraient pour engager leur r\u00e9ponsabilit\u00e9.

C. 433, followed.\nAn action does not lie against a municipal corporation by the proprietor of lands for damages in respect thereof, through the mistake or misfeasance of the corporation or its officers, alleged to have occurred prior to the acquisition of his title thereto.\nA municipal corporation is not civilly responsible for acts of its officers or servants other than those done within the scope of their authority as such.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, (appeal side), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, in so far as it had dismissed the defendants' incidental demand with costs, and maintaining the said incidental demand as to the sum of $251.52, with costs in compensation and set off against the amount recovered by the plaintiff in the original action, and reserving defendants' recourse for such further damages as might accrue from time to time, from the continuance of the nuisance complained of. The plaintiff brought an action for the recovery of special assessments for the widening of a portion of Notre Dame street in the city of Montreal, and to charge the defendants' lands for payment of the same, and the defendants, by an incidental demand, claimed damages against the city for negligence and misfeasance in permitting a nuisance to be created, to the injury of the defendants' property, by knowingly allowing a building on the adjoining land to be constructed so as to project about ten or twelve inches beyond the homologated street line and obstruct the view of a show-window in the defendants' building subsequently constructed upon the proper street line. It was alleged that an official from the city surveyor's office had pointed out the line incorrectly at the time the adjoining building was in process of construction, several months prior to the purchase of lands in question by the defendants, and it appeared that defendants had been refused permission by the civic officers, to erect their front wall upon the same line and thus an angle was made where the buildings adjoined, causing the obstruction complained of. The material facts proved in evidence are mentioned in the judgment reported. The judge in the trial court found a verdict for the plaintiff for $863.48 with interest and costs, and dismissed the defendant's incidental demand with costs, for the following reasons:\u2014\" Consid\u00e9rant que la projection provient du fait que la maison sur le lot No. 1791 a \u00e9t\u00e9 construite durant l'ann\u00e9e qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la d\u00e9molition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des maisons sur la rue Notre-Dame, pour 1' \u00e9largissement de la dite rue, et qu'une erreur paralt avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 commise alors au sujet de l'alignement: que cette projection de 8 \u00e0 9 pouces est insignifiante, si l'on prend en consid\u00e9ration la hauteur et la largeur de la b\u00e2tisse, l'\u00e9l\u00e9vation et la grandeur des vitrines, et qu'elle ne peut causer aucun dommage appr\u00e9ciable \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, soit comme maison de commerce, soit comme r\u00e9sidence.\" In the Court of Queen's Bench the former part of this judgment (maintaining plaintiff's action.) was affirmed and the present appeal is asserted only as to the reversal of the decision upon the incidental demand in the court below, and the reservation as to further actions for similar dam ages based on an annual indemnity for loss of rent or depreciation of the property.\nCoyle Q. C. and Ethier Q. U. for the appellant. On this appeal the only questions for the consideration of the court are: 1st. Is the appellant responsible for \"the encroachment complained of? 2ndly. If so, have the respondents proved any damage for which the .appellant can be responsible? and 3rdly. Is the basis of damages allowed, i.e., an annual indemnity for loss .of rent or depreciation of property, correct?\nThere has been no act proved to have been done by the plaintiff, or for which plaintiff can be held civilly responsible, by which the lands can have suffered since the defendants purchased the lands in question. No public nuisance is proved to have existed. The mistake charged against the plaintiff is alleged to have been committed whilst the lands belonged to other persons and is consequently res inter alios acta. In any case unliquidated damages cannot be set off against actually ascertained amounts due for taxes on and. Art. 1188 C.C.\nThe opinions of the respondents' witnesses on the question of possible damage are in direct conflict with the views of the witnesses for the appellants, who are fully as intelligent and competent and the evidence being of equal weight, damages should not be granted against appellants, the presumption being in their favour. The respondents have failed to prove any actual damage suffered to their property or to their business. The evidence of the witnesses for the respondents appears to be based on mere generalities and the witnesses have little or no experience in valuing properties, whilst the evidence for the appellant is based on facts and figures and given by men of many years experience in the business, and whose ability and impartiality cannot be questioned. There is no evidence to shew any actual loss in the respondents' business that can be attributed to the projection of the building. This trifling projection of 8 or 9 inches in the front is no more than the depth of the pilasters which decorate the fronts of a large proportion of similar business buildings, and the contention that the respondents have suffered damages from it is wholly unfounded. The basis of valuing the damages in the Court of Queen's Bench is unjust and erroneous, and of a nature to allow speculative damages. The loss of rent allowed is a spedies of perpetual charge or insurance to guarantee to the respondents the same rental every year whether the property be well or badly administered, or whether there may or may not be general business depression. The indemnity allowed is ultra petita, not having been asked for in the pleadings. If damages are to be allowed, the proper basis for calculation is the value of the immovable itself. The appellants contend that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench should be reversed as to the incidental demand exclusively, and the Superior Court judgment restored in its entirety.\nLafleur and Sicotte for the respondents. The plaintiff neglected the duty imposed under the city by-laws and also gave an incorrect line, and tolerated the encroachments which resulted from this negligence and mistake. The plaintiff was bound to have caused the projecting wall to be demolished: and to abate the nuisance. The defendant's have the right to demand the abatement of the nuisance and to claim damages in consequence. See Pettis v. Johnson ([1]); State of Indiana v. Berdetta ([2]); and cases cited in 1 Am. & Eng. Enc. of Law, (2 ed.) at page 235 under the heading \" Abutting Owners and 2 Dillon \" Municipal Corporations,\" pars. 731, 732.\nDamages of this nature may be opposed in the pre sent case in compensation because they result and flow from the same cause as the action, which asks for the assessment resulting from the expropriation, and the damages result also from the same expropriation and alteration of the street line. See Davidson v. DeGagn\u00e9 ([3]).\nThe judgment for damages is a finding of fact with which this court ought not to interfere; Demers v. Montreal Steam Laundry Co. ([4]). As to the amount of damages awarded no gross error has been committed and they have not been based upon false principles of law: Levi v Reed ([5]); Cossette v. Dun et al. ([6]) Gingras v. Desilets ([7]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J. This is an action for the recovery from the defendants as now being the owners of a lot in the City of Montreal, known as lot no. 1790, on Notre Dame Street, in St. Anne's Ward, certain installments of an assessment imposed and charged upon that lot of land by by-laws of the City of Montreal, passed in the year 1890 for the widening of Notre Dame Street before ever the defendants acquired an interest in lot 1790 To this action the defendants have pleaded the same matter by way of defence to the action and by way of incidental demand. The matter so pleaded has been held to offer no defence to the action and it is only with the incidental demand that we have to deal The material facts upon which the incidental demand is based are these: The owners of lot number 1791 on Notre Dame Street, which lies to the east of and adjoining to the lot 1790, in the summer of the year 1890 erected a house upon their lot 1791 the foundation of which encroached across the homologated line of the street into the street for the distance of twelve and three quarters (123\/4) inches. Upon the foundation from the level of the street columns were constructed upon which the front wall was built, which columns extend only 8 to 9 inches into the street. On the 17th November, 1890, the defendants acquired the lot 1790 by purchase, and in the summer of 1891 they proceeded to erect a house upon the front of their lot on Notre Dame Street. It was then found that the house erected in the previous year upon lot 1791, before ever the defendants had acquired any interest in lot 1790, encroached upon the street to the extent above mentioned, and the defendants applied to the city officials for leave to erect their house upon a line in continuation of the line Upon which the house on lot 1791 had been built. Neither any official of the city nor the city corporation itself had any power or authority whatever to authorise any encroachment across the homologated line of the street, and the defendants being so informed by the city officials proceeded to build their house along such homologated line. To this action, which was commenced in the month of August, 1892, the defendants on the 3rd of December, 1892, file this incidental demand which is for $5,000 damages alleged to be sustained by them by reason of the encroachment upon the street of the building erected on lot 1791 which, as is alleged, has made the defendants building on lot 1790, less suitable for their trade and has diminished its value. The damage alleged is that the projection of the building on lot 1791 for the distance of from 8 to 9 inches into the street prevents persons coming from the east along the same side of the street from seeing the defendants' show-window as soon as, but for the above encroachment, they could, and that thereby the defendants' trade is damaged and their house lessened in value to the defendants' damage of $5000. The learned judge who rendered judgment in the case in the Superior Court, according to his appreciation of the evidence, was of opinion that this projection of the adjacent building beyond the homologated line of the street was insignificant and did not cause any appreciable damage to the defendants and he therefore dismissed the incidental demand and rendered judgment for the plaintiff in the action for the whole of their demand. If this case turned wholly upon the question whether the projection spoken of causes actionable damage to the defendants I should entirely concur with the judgment of the learned judge of the Superior Court. It is true that in the evidence taken at the enqu\u00eate there were not wanting expert valuators produced by the defendants who on their examination in chief, singularly concurred in estimating the defendants' damage caused by the projection at $300 per annum, but none of them gave any satisfactory explanation of their mode of arrival at this estimate; one, indeed, whose estimate however only reached $250 per annum, gave his reasons very confidently which may be taken to be the reasons of all. One of these gentlemen, while he admits that there are no data to go upon, nevertheless thinks that the loss occasioned to the defendants by their show windows being obstructed by the 9 inch projection would probably be from $300 to $400 per annum. Another gentleman, while he cannot say there is any loss upon rental, nevertheless thinks the defendants loss to amount to from $300 to $400 per annum, because he thinks a showwindow is a good mode of advertising and the view of the showwindow is obstructed by the 9 inch projection to persons coming up the same side of the street from the east. A third, who in like manner estimates the defendants damage at $300 per annum, gives no reason for his opinion further than that a prominent window is of great value for the business of merchant tailors doing business for cash. A fourth, who also estimates defendants' loss at $300 per annum, says that he speaks only from information, that he has been informed that the projection spoken of would to persons in the business of the defendants, that is merchant tailors, make a difference of $300 per annum in the rent. The fifth, who alone gives his reasons, a Mr. Rielle, says:\nThe effect of the projection is that the defendants door cannot be seen by persons moving west on that side of the street until they are practically opposite the door itself, and as a consequence many a one may pass their door without seeing it, and in the event of the adjoining store being occupied for the same kind of business the defendants window could easily be taken for the show-window of the adjoining building.\nIt is not then, in the opinion of this witness, the view of the show-window which is obstructed, but a door which is at the angle of defendants building immediately contiguous to the projection. \"It is difficult,\" he says, to estimate with precision \"the damage resulting from such a condition of things,\" and he accordingly proceeds to solve the difficulty, \" from two points of view \" thus:\u2014\u2014\nFirst, a certain number of people, transient customers, will undoubtedly pass the defendants' door without seeing it and will consequently make their purchases elsewhere. Assuming one such case to happen daily, and an average loss of seventy-five cents or a dollar in each, we have a yearly loss of two hundred and fifty dollars, say four thousand dollars at five per cent; or assuming again that the sale o one suit of clothes per week is lost on which five dollars would be netted, we have $250 per annum of loss.\nAgain he says:\nOne simple remedy would be to take down the front of defendants' building and set it up again in a line corresponding with the projecting building. The cost of such an operation would in my opinion represent the measure of damage suffered by the defendants and I estimate it as follows:\nHis estimate then is for pulling down and reerecting the front wall on the new line etc. $3,250\nLoss of rent of two stores, say 1,200\nLoss of business during operation, say 250\n$5,700\nand he concludes thus:\u2014\nI take the ground that the only real way to decide the problem is to take down the front of the building and re-erect it on the line of the adjoining property, and that is my estimate of such an undertaking\u2014 five thousand seven hundred dollars including loss of rent and loss of business.\nThis witnesses estimate which is founded wholly upon assumptions, amounts to this, that assuming the daily or weekly loss to be as assumed, the yearly loss would amount to $250, and the only way in the opinion of this witness to compensate such loss is to estimate the cost of pulling down the defendants' building and to re-erect it on a line with the building on lot no. 1791 and by so extending the encroachment on the street to transfer to the adjoining neighbour the damage of which the defendants complain as being caused to them by the nine-inch projection on lot 1791.\nThe defendants also called two of their salesmen whose mode of estimating the damage alleged to be caused by the projection is no less singular. They undertook to prove the damage by comparison of their sales in different years. It is necessary here to premise that the defendants' building was completed in February, 1892, and that in December of that year, after ten months' occupation, they profess to have discovered the damage of which they complain in their incidental demand. The building was erected so as to have in it two shops capable of being used separately with domiclles above. In February 1892, the defend- ants entered into occupation of the shop in the half of the building next adjoining lot 1791, the other or westerly half in which was constructed the show window spoken of as being so good as an advertising medium they did not occupy that year. Now the sales in the year commencing in February, 1892, amounted to $20,797.82; in the year 1893, to $25,699.15. During this year they occupied both shops and had the benefit of the show window in the westerly shop. In the year 1894 they let this shop, retaining in their own occupation the shop next adjoining lot no. 1791, and which they had occupied in 1892; this diminution of $4,811.33 from the sales of the previous year they attribute to their not having had the benefit of the window in the westerly shop which they had had in the previous year. The tenant of that shop had the benefit of the window in it. Then in 1895 their sales in the shop which they had Occupied in 1892 and 1894 amounted to $17,466 and the conclusion sought to be drawn from this evidence is that the amount of the sales in 1895 being $4,811.33 less than the amount of the sales in 1894, and $3,321.76 less than the amount of the sale in 1892, the first year of occupation is attributable to the 9-inch projection complained of which was in existence, and had the same operation during the whole period for which the sales are given.\nThe plaintiff also called several witnesses all of whom unanimously concur that the projection complained of is absolutely innocuous to the defendants, that it does not in any respect diminish the value of defendants' building whether for sale or rental or use for purposes of trade; they say that such projections, in one form or other, as columns, pilasters, porticos and such like are quite common in the city of Montreal and nobody thinks of complaining of them as damaging to an adjoining building, and in the opinion of some of the witnesses not one person in ten thou sand would think of complaining of the projection in the present case. Some of the witnesses who have passed the place hundreds of times never in point of fact noticed the projection until their attention was called to it for the purposes of the present suit. All of those witnesses give their reasons for the conclusion in which they all concur as to the projection being innocuous to the defendants in an intelligent and clear manner and one, by a plan which he has made, and lines drawn thereon from several points to the defendants' shop, seems to demonstrate almost the correctness of that conclusion. In short, comparing the evidence given on the part of the plaintiff with that given on the part of the defendants who present this incidental demand, the former so appears to carry conviction with it and the latter to be so imaginative, speculative, assumptive and illusive, that for my part I find it impossible to arrive at any other conclusion than that arrived at by the learned judge who rendered judgment in the case in the Superior Court.\nBut the case in my opinion does not rest solely upon a question as to whether or not the defendants have in point of fact sustained damage to any, and if any to what amount occasioned by the projection into the street which is complained of. An action of this nature cannot be sustained unless it is alleged in the pleadings and proved in evidence that the corporation have committed a breach of some duty alleged to have been owed by them to the party complaining from which breach of duty the damage complained of has arisen. The incidental demand in the present case does not allege any breach of any duty alleged to have been due by the corporation to the incidental plaintiffs. It does not allege the committal by the corporation of any public nuisance for damage arising from which the defendants as parties specially injured were en titled to sue. It alleges no act of misfeasance whatever by the corporation as giving a right to the defendants to present their incidental demand. It does not allege either any single act of non-feasance by the corporation of any duty owed to the public which is contended to have given to the defendants ground in law for presenting their incidental demand. That the non-finance of any such duty would not give any cause of action to an individual injured thereby unless an action should be expressly given by statute, [see the judgments of the Privy Council in Municipality of Pictou v. Geldert ([8]), and Municipal Council of Sydney v. Bourke ([9]),] must be taken to be conclusive; and there is no such statute in the present case. The allegation in the incidental demand is simply to the effect that the incidental plaintiffs are suffering damage by the decrease in value of their property by the city of Montreal allowing the proprietors of lot No. 1791 to build beyond the homologated line of Notre Dame street or not obliging them to build in a straight line, and allowing them to hide the incidental plaintiffs' place of business. .There is not a single act alleged whereby the corporation of the city of Montreal professed to allow the owners of lot 1791 to encroach upon the street when erecting their building. The corporation had no power what ever to allow any such encroachment. If they had assumed to do so such, action on their part would have been simply inoperative and void, and would not in the slightest degree have interfered with the defend ants' right themselves to indict the encroachment as a nuisance, or to bring an action against the persons maintaining the erection in the street for the damage alleged to be thereby caused to them. The construction of the incidental demand as pleaded, and the only construction which can be put upon the expression therein \"in allowing \" etc., must be, and the sole foundation upon which the incidental demand is based is a contention that the plaintiff is liable to an action at the suit of the defendants for damages suffered by them and occasioned by the owners of lot 1791 having wrongfully erected their building so as to encroach upon the public street, and so as to do to the defendants the damage complained of. No cause of action which is maintainable at law against the corporation is involved in such a statement of facts. There is no allegation that the corporation is given by any Act of Parliament power to abate the nuisance complained of propri\u00e2 manu, or otherwise than by the same process of law as is open to the defendants who, if they really suffered the damage of which they com-plain had a substantial motive to act themselves, and as already observed upon the authority of the Privy Council in the cases above referred to, neglect of the corporation to take action to abate the nuisance and so to remove the cause of damage would not give a cause of action to the defendants to recover the damages alleged to be attributable to the nuisance unless such action be expressly given by statute.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench in appeal have reversed the judgment of the Superior Court and have given judgment against the plaintiff upon the incidental demand for the sum of $250 per annum, the precise amount of the annual damage occasioned, by the encroachment as estimated by the witness Rielle for the reasons given by him as already stated. This judgment proceeds upon the ground therein alleged that the line upon which the building upon lot 1791 was erected in 1891 was given by the corporation and that the persons who \"erected that building were bound to conform to the line so given. But there is not any allegation in the incidental demand that the corporation did give to the owners of lot 1791 the line upon which they constructed their building. There is no issue raising such a point, and consequently no evidence was admissible for the purpose of establishing the existence of a fact not alleged and as to the existence of which there was not any issue joined to be tried With submission I find it difficult to see how a mistake if one was made, by the corporation in giving the line in 1891 to the owners of lot 1791 can be invoked by the defendants who at that time had no interest whatever in the lot 1790, upon which in 1892 they erected the building alleged to be damaged, the mistake, if made, was wholly res inter alios acta, and if the fact of the mistake having been made by the corporation was a fact necessary to be established in order to support the incidental demand, the corporation of the City of Montreal surely have a right to insist that the facts necessary to be established to enable the defendants to recover should be alleged upon the record. Such a mistake if made, may have given to the owners of lot 1791 a cause of action against the corporation for any damage occasioned to them by the mistake, but how the defendants can avail themselves of such a mistake as giving to them a cause of action against the corporation in the absence of any statute to that effect I fail to see; no such cause of action is expanded upon the record. If ever the question of the liability of the corporation should arise between them and the owners of lot 1791 it will be necessary to consider whether a mistake in the line of a street can be established to have been made and given by the corporation otherwise than by the production of a proc\u00e8s-verbal mentioned in sec. 12 of by-law no. 3 of the consolidated by-laws of the corporation which enacts that it shall be the duty of the City Surveyor.\nwhen required by any person wishing to build oh any street or public place in the city to establish, by a survey, the line of such street or place in the city and to draw up a proc\u00e8s-verbal of the same a copy of which shall be delivered to the proprietor or person requiring such alignment on payment of a sum of two .dollars to be accounted for to the-City Treasurer.\nIt is, in my opinion, only by force of this by-law, that the corporation assumed any obligation to give to a proprietor of a lot abutting on a street the boundary line of his lot upon the street. There is no such, obligation imposed by the common law, nor is it suggested that there is any Act of Parliament which imposes such an obligation; neither does there seem to be any good reason why an owner of a lot should' not himself incur the responsibility of ascertaining the boundary lines of his own land which is situate-upon, a street; that he can do so is apparent on the by-law, for by it the corporation is only called into action by a requisition of the person desiring to build on his laud, There is an homologated plan of the line of the streets which is accessable to everyone, and any surveyor or civil engineer employed by the lot owner is as competent to determine the line with reference to the homologated plan as is the City Surveyor, but by the above by-law, and by that alone, the city corporation have assumed the obligation as therein stated, and such being the mode by which the obligation is incurred, it will have to be considered and determined. whether or not it is not by the by-law that the city must be judged upon a question arising as to the fulfilment of the obligation; in other words whether it is not only by a proc\u00e8s-verbal given as directed by the by-law, that the act of the City Surveyor, or of his subordinates, can be held to be the act of the corporation. It is a. matter of grave importance to municipal corporations like the city of Montreal that acts of their servants should not be deemed to be acts of the corporation unless they are done within the scope of the authority conferred upon the servant doing the act, and as a mode is prescribed by the by-law, (by which alone the obligation is assumed), to be followed for the purpose of procuring the corporation to give to a proprietor the line of his lot where it abuts upon a street in the city, that that mode alone should be pursued in order to make the act of the servant the act of the corporation. The defendants have always had, and still have the right if they are damaged in the manner alleged, to bring their action against the person who erected and maintains the building which does the damage alleged. I have already said that in my opinion the incidental demand as pleaded did not warrant the reception of any evidence for the purpose of establishing a fact not alleged, namely, that the city corporation gave to the owners of lot 1791, as the homologated line of the street, the line upon which they erected their building, but evidence, with that view was offered by the defendants and taken down at the enqu\u00eate, and, as the judgment now in appeal has proceeded upon that evidence, I must say that in my opinion it was wholly insufficient for the purpose for which it was adduced, even if it had been admissible as upon a point put in issue in the case. The evidence was that of the mason who was employed to erect the building by the owners of lot no. 1791. He said that a person, whom he did not know but who, he supposed, came from the office of the City Surveyor, made certain marks upon the old side walk and upon the old building which was about to be removed for widening Notre Dame street there, and that this person told witness that the homologated line of the street was 21 feet 6 inches, to the best of the witness's recollection, from those marks, and that he, the witness, measured such distance, and so himself determined the site of the line of the street, and so non constat but that the error was committed by the witness himself, for no error appears in the line of the street at either side of the building erected on lot 1791. Now this evidence does not disclose any act whatever which can be said to have constituted a breach of any duty which the corporation owed to the defendants, nor can the act of the person who made the marks spoken of by the witness, even assuming him to have been a subordinate in the City Surveyor's office, be said to have been the act of the corporation upon the true construction of the by-law which seems to me to have been framed so as to prevent the corporation being affected by any such loose act open to the confliction in evidence incident to oral testimony, and held responsible for it as an act of the corporation, even though committed by one of their servants.\nFor all of the above reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs, and the judgment of the Superior court restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Roy & Ethier.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Sicotte, Barnard & Macdonald.\n[1] 56 Ind. 139.\n[2] 38 Am.

Each member of the force contributed a percentage of his pay for the purposes of the fund, and one of the rules provided as follows: \u201cNo money to be drawn from the fund for any purpose whatever until it reach the sum of eight thousand ($8,000) dollars\u201d * * *\nHeld, that in case of a member of the force dying before the fund reached the said sum the gratuity to his family was merely suspended and was payable as soon as that amount was realized.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThis was an action brought on the 27th March, 1895, by the widow and children of George Miller, deceased, against the Hamilton Police Benefit Fund, a society incorporated by that name under the Benevolent Society\u2019s Act, R.S.O. (1887) ch. 172, as amended by 53 Vict. ch. 39, sec. 9, and A.D. Stewart, John Muir and G.F. Jelfs, the Hamilton Police Commissioners. The relief sought is the payment of the proportion of the share of a certain benefit fund to which it is alleged that the plaintiffs have become entitled as wife and children respectively of the deceased. In the alternative it is asked that the incorporation of the defendants may be \u201ccancelled\u201d and the benefit fund distributed among those who may be found to be beneficiaries under the direction of the court.\nThe deceased, George Miller, became a member of the Hamilton police force about the month of September, 1869, and so continued until the time of his death on the 25th October, 1891, In September, 1890, when the salaries of the members of the force were about to be increased, it was resolved by the Commissioners that a Police Benefit Fund should be established for the purpose of providing pensions, gratuities, etc., and in case of long service, illness, death, etc., and on the 21st October the members of the force, including the deceased Miller, signed the following declaration:\n\u201cWe, the undersigned members of the Police Force of the city of Hamilton, in consideration of our salaries being increased by the Board of Police Commissioners, do hereby agree to allow three per cent of our salaries to be retained monthly by the City Treasurer, for the purpose of forming a Police Benefit Fund.\u201d\nThe city corporation were the paymasters of the force. Rules and regulations for the management of the fund were adopted by the committee of management in October, 1890, and approved by the Commissioners on the 8th December, 1890, though the fund appears to have been maintained in the manner contemplated from the time of its institution in the previous year. The rules of the society in force at Miller\u2019s death, and necessary to be considered, are:\u2014\nRULE 2. \u201cThe object of this fund shall be to grant gratuities and pensions for long service in the force, and to assist members of the force who may be disabled in the actual execution of their duty, or incapacitated from duty by long sickness, and to make provision for old age, and for families in case of death.\u201d\nRULE 3. \u201cThe Police Benefit Fund shall be under the management and control of a committee subject to the approval of the Board of Commissioners, which shall be called the Benefit Fund Committee.\u201d\nRULE 12. \u201cEvery application for a pension gratuity or aid, must come before the committee when the whole circumstances of the case will be fully gone into, and a report sent in for the sanction of the Board of Police Commissioners, and in case of differences between the committee and the commissioners, the committee shall be heard in person by the commissioners, and if possible concurrence arrived at, but in the case of failure to concur, the judgment or decision of the Police Commissioners shall be final.\u201d\nRULE 15. \u201cThe Board of Police Commissioners to contribute all moneys at their disposal now or hereafter which may be legitimately applied to the fund.\u201d\nRULE 16. \u201cAll the members of the force to contribute 3 per cent of the gross amount of their pay monthly towards the fund.\u201d\nRULE 17. \u201cThe percentage to be deducted on the pay sheets in like manner as any other stoppage, and to be paid over monthly in a lump sum to the treasurer of the fund.\u201d\nRULE 18. \u201cThe Chief Constable shall be treasurer of the fund, but no money shall be paid out of the said fund unless ordered by the committee and sanctioned by the chairman of the Board of Police Commissioners.\u201d\nRULE 23. \u201cIn estimating the length of service, members who were on the force previous to the 1st of January, 1890, are entitled respectively to reckon two-thirds of the period of their service anterior to the above date.\u201d RULE 24. \u201cOld scale, which shall only apply to members who have joined the force before the 1st of January, 1890,\u201d\u2014and by sub-section 9 of Rule 24, it is provided as follows:\nIX. Any member dying in the service, his widow, child or children, shall receive an allowance according to the following scale:\n1 years\u2019 service.................... $ 250 00\n2 years\u2019 service.................... 300 00\n3 years\u2019 service.................... 350 00\n4 years\u2019 service.................... 400 00\n5 years\u2019 service.................... 450 00\n6 years\u2019 service, and upwards, one and one-half month\u2019s pay for each year\u2019s service, but in the event of a member dying unmarried and without issue, his heirs shall receive an allowance granted in such cases on a report of the committee, and sanction or approval of the Police Commissioners.\u201d\n[That part of the rule relating to the \u201cNew Scale\u201d applies only to members joining the force from and after the 1st January, 1890.]\nRULE 25. \u201cNo money is to be drawn from the fund for any purpose whatever until it reaches the sum of eight thousand (8,000) dollars, unless in certain cases, such as members disabled in the execution of their duty, or in case of death, to be considered and reported on by the committee and sanctioned by the Board of Police Commissioners as aforesaid.\u201d\nThe plaintiffs say that the number of years\u2019 service of Mr. George Miller in respect of which they are entitled to receive allowance and payment, is two-thirds of his period of service, prior to the 1st January, 1890, viz., thirteen and a half years, and subsequent thereto the full period until his death, one and five-sixth years; the amount of such allowance estimated under rule 24, clause 9, being at the rate of one and a half months pay for each year\u2019s service, in all $1,294.27. This sum they claim to be legally entitled to under the rules and regulations of the society.\nThe defendants, on the other hand, contended\n(1) That the granting of the allowance is not as of right but depends, under rule 12, upon the report of the Committee and sanction of the Police Commissioners, authorizing it after consideration of the whole circumstances of each particular case:\n(2) That the amount of the fund at the death of George Miller having been no more than $2,485, the only sum to which the plaintiffs could under any circumstances be entitled, was that reported on by the committee and sanctioned by the Police Commissioners under rule 25, viz., $175.\nThe defendants also contended that the fund was illegally constituted, the provisions of the Ontario Benevolent Societies Act, R.S.O. (1887) ch. 172 not having been complied with.\nThe trial judge, Mr. Justice Rose, held that plaintiffs were only entitled to the sum awarded by the Police Commissioners under rule 12, namely, $175, and gave judgment for that amount. The Divisional Court held them entitled to the allowance according to the scale in rule 24, and that payment of this amount was only supended while the fund was under $8,000. It also held that the fund was properly constituted, not being affected by the Act relating to Benevolent Societies, or by the Ontario Insurance Act.\nIn the Court of Appeal the judgment of the Divisional Court was reversed and that of the trial judge restored. From this judgment the plaintiffs appealed to this court.\nWatson Q.C. for the appellants.\nTeetzel Q.C. for the respondents. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014We are of opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Divisional Court restored. We have been unable to come to the conclusion that the rules governing the fund in question provide that there shall be no liability whether prospective or in presenti against the fund in case of death, etc., until the fund reached $8,000. Rule 25 indicates that there should be a postponement only of payment. No matter what the intention of the founders of the fund may have been, and there are strong reasons to suppose that their intentions were, as is claimed by the respondents, that intention has in no way been manifested in the rules themselves, and we do not feel it proper to read between the lines or import words into them giving them a construction of which they are not susceptible.\nThe question of the construction of the Ontario Insurance Act as amended by 53 Victoria, Ch. 39, was disposed of at the argument. We do not think that there is anything in the statute which affects the right of the appellants to payment out of the fund. The appeal is allowed with costs, and the appellants will be entitled to their costs in all the courts below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Thomas C. Haslett.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Teetzel & Harrison.\n"}

On the expiration of his term of service no change was made, and he continued for a month longer at the same salary, but was then informed that if he desired to remain his salary would be considerably reduced. Having refused to accept the reduced salary he was dismissed, and brought an action for damages claiming that his retention for the month was a re-engagement for another year on the same terms.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (24 Ont. App. R. 296) which reversed that of Meredith C.J. at the trial (27 O.R. 369) that as it appeared that the foreman knew that the business before the sale had been losing money and could not be kept going without reductions of expenses and salaries, as he had been informed that the contracts with the employees had not been assumed by the purchaser and as upon his own evidence there was no hiring for any definite period but merely a temporary arrangement, until the purchaser should have time to consider the changes to be made, the foreman had no claim for damages, and his action was rightly dismissed.\nWhere the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain an appeal is doubtful the Court may assume jurisdiction when it has been decided that the appeal on the merits must be dismissed. Great Western Railway Company of Canada v. Brai (1 Moo. P.C.N.S.101) followed. By 60 and 61 V. c. 34 s. 1 s.s. (c), no appeal lies from judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario unless the amount in controversy in the appeal exceeds $1,000, and by subsec. (f), in case of difference, it is the amount demanded, and not that recovered which determines the amount in controversy.\nHeld, per Taschereau J., that to reconcile these two subsections, paragraph (f) should probably be read as if it meant the amount demanded upon the appeal. To read it as meaning the amount demanded in the action, which is the construction the court has put upon R.S.C. c. 135 s. 29 relating to appeals from the Province of Quebec, would seem to be contrary to the intention of Parliament. Laberge v. The Equitable Life Assurance Society (24 Can. S.C.R. 59) distinguished.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of Meredith C.J. at the trial[2] in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nGibbons Q.C., for the appellant.\nOsler, Q.C., and S.H. Blake, Q.C., for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Objection to our jurisdiction in this case was taken by the respondent in limine, on the ground that the amount demanded does not exceed the sum of $1,000 as required by 60 and 61 V. ch. 34 (D). The amount claimed by the action exceeds $1,000, but the amount awarded to the plaintiff by the court of first instance is only $408. Upon appeal by the defendants, the Court of Appeal dismissed the action in toto, and now upon this appeal by the plaintiff, all he claims is that the original judgment in his favour for $408 be restored. And that being so, the respondent argued that as the amount demanded does not exceed $1,000, the case is not appealable under paragraph \u201cf,\u201d of section 1 of said statute, the amount de- manded, in that section, meaning as he contended, the amount demanded upon the appeal.\nWe held that under the ruling in Laberge v. The Equitable Life Assurance Society[3], it is the amount demanded originally by the action, not the amount demanded upon the appeal, that governs where the right to appeal is dependent upon the amount in dispute, and the case proceeded upon the merits. As no reference has been made to paragraph \u201cc\u201d of the same section of the statute, it was taken for granted that the enactments in pari materia, as to Quebec appeals, were the same as those now existing by the said statute for the Ontario appeals, but since, upon reference to the statutes, I find that for the Quebec appeals, it is the amount in controversy that governs, whilst for the Ontario appeals it is the amount in controversy in the appeal. So that to reconcile paragraphs \u201cc\u201d and \u201cf\u201d of section 1 of this statute, 60 & 61 V. c. 34, we should perhaps read paragraph \u201cf\u201d as if it meant the amount demanded upon the appeal. However, as we are to dismiss the appeal upon the merits, it is unnecessary in this case to rehear the parties on this question of jurisdiction, or to further consider it. And what I say of it now is a mere expression of my personal opinion upon the question, as at present advised. I may add, again speaking for myself, that it clearly appears by the preamble of this last Dominion statute, that the intention of Parliament was to confirm the Ontario Acts on the subject. Now, these Acts[4] clearly restrict the right of appeal to cases where the amount in controversy in the appeal exceeds $1,000. So that to apply the ruling in Laberge v. The Equitable Life Assurance Society to Ontario appeals would seem to be contrary to the intention of Parliament. On the merits, assuming that we have jurisdiction, (The Great Western Railway Company of Canada v. Braid[5],) we are of opinion the appeal should be dismissed.\nThe learned judge who tried the case found that the appellant had been dismissed without reasonable notice, and was entitled to damages[6]. The Court of Appeal, however, held that upon the evidence there was no definite engagement of appellant, but merely a temporary employment, and dismissed his action. It cannot at the present day be contended that, as a rule of law, where no time is limited for the duration of the contract of hiring and service, the hiring has to be considered as a hiring for a year. The question is one of fact, or inference from facts, the determination of which depends upon the circumstances of each case. Here, we think, with the Court of Appeal; first, that it was to appellant\u2019s knowledge that the Hay Company\u2019s business had before May, 1895 been a losing concern, which it was impossible to keep going without reductions of expenses and salaries; secondly, that on the 18th May, in the only interview between Anderson and appellant that took place, there was upon appellant\u2019s own evidence no hiring for any definite period, but merely a temporary arrangement until Anderson should have time to consider the changes to be made after the new organization was completed. Appellant was expressly told by the foreman that Hay\u2019s contracts with his employees had not been assumed by Anderson, and he had to admit in his examination that he anticipated there would be changes. On the 22nd of August, they notified him that his salary thereafter would be reduced to $600 if he desired to remain in the service of the new company. Now, under all the circumstances, this is nothing but the notice he must have expected every morning since the first of the month. There is nothing in the evidence which justified him in thinking that he would not be subject to the reductions to be made in the salaries. I feel certain that if on the 18th of May or at any time afterwards, he had told Anderson that he did not intend to remain in the service of the new company if not paid $1,500 a year, as he had been by the old company, Anderson would have immediately told him he could not be re-engaged.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gibbons, Mulkern & Harper.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Finkle & Mullen.\n[1] 24 Ont.

In 1875 improvements were made to a drain discharging upon the premises of S., and a culvert was made connecting with it. In 1887, S. erected a building on his land and cut off the wall of the culvert which projected over the line of the street, which resulted in the flow of water through it being stopped and backed up on the land of O., who brought an action against S. for the damage caused thereby.\nHeld, that S. having a right to cut off the part of the culvert which projected over his land was not liable to O. for the damage so caused, the remedy of the latter, if he had any, being against the municipality for not properly maintaining the drain. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the Chancery Division in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts of the case are thus stated by Mr. Justice Moss in the Court of Appeal.\nThe locus of this litigation is the unincorporated village of Frankford, situate in the township of Sidney, in the county of Hastings, at the confluence of the River Trent and its tributary Cole Creek. It is not shown when the farm lots on which the village is situate were first laid out in streets and building lots, but in some of the conveyances put in there is a reference to a plan of part of the village made in 1837, by one G.S. Clapp, P.L.S., and to a plan of the village made by one J.D. Evans, P.L.S. The evidence shows this latter plan to have been made in 1870. The plaintiff and defendants are the proprietors of adjoining parcels of land, fronting on the south side of a highway called Mill Street, and extending south to the waters of Cole Creek. The plaintiff\u2019s premises have a frontage of 20 feet on Mill Street, and are wholly covered by a building used by him as a chemist\u2019s shop and dwelling. At a distance of 68 feet from the N.E. corner of plaintiff\u2019s building is Trent Street, a highway running north and south and intersecting Cole Creek, at a distance of 43 feet from the corner of Mill and Trent streets. Immediately to the west of the plaintiff\u2019s buildings are the premises of the defendants. They consist of a considerable parcel of land with a frontage of about 166 feet on Mill Street, on which are now erected two buildings, one a storehouse or warehouse, the other a grist mill. When the plaintiff acquired this property, (in the year 1872), the defendant\u2019s land was vacant though there had been on the westerly portion a grist mill which had been burned down. When the defendants purchased there was a covered ditch or drain crossing Mill Street from the north side, and discharging upon the defendant\u2019s premises at a place to the east of the site of the old grist mill. It conducted water, which was collected on the north side of Mill Street by means of ditches and drains constructed by the municipality and land owners, across the highway and discharged it upon the premises now owned by the defendants over which it flowed to Cole Creek. The covered drain was constructed of floats or logs placed atop of one another forming a box or pipe about 18 inches wide and 8 or 10 inches in height, covered over by planks on which were put earth and gravel to the level of the highway. It had been placed there probably twenty or more years before. There had been on the ground at this place a shallow depression into which the surface water from the surrounding lands flowed. This depression extended from north of the highway across it and on to the lands now owned by the defendants and the construction of the box drain was the work of the township authorities, done for the purpose of improving the highway by gathering the waters into a convenient conduit and levelling the highway. By these means the waters were concentrated and brought to defendants\u2019 lands in increased volume, and discharged with increased force. The land sloped gradually from the south side of Mill Street to Cole Creek, and the water coming through the covered drain cut away the earth and formed a sloping course, along which it was found convenient for persons in vehicles to drive down to Cole Creek, and there ford the stream. In 1875, considerable alterations and improvements were put upon the drain by the township authorities. It was thought to be of insufficient capacity to carry away all the water collected on the north side of Mill Street. It was too near the surface and was liable to freeze up in cold weather. The bottom of a ditch running along the north side of Mill Street from the west, which took and conveyed surface waters from lands to the north of the street and west of where the box drain crossed the highway, had become worn to a level below that of the bottom of the box drain. To remedy these defects a wider and deeper excavation was made. A trench more than 2\u00bd feet wide was cut down to the rock. The sides were built up with loose stones to a height of about 20 inches and the top was covered with 2 inch planks, upon which was put earth to the level of the crown of the highway, thus producing a culvert 2\u00bd feet wide by about 20 inches high with its bottom something more than 4 feet beneath the surface of the highway. It connected with the ditch or drain on the north side of Mill Street and extended beyond the south limits of the highway for a distance of 12 or 15 feet into and upon the defendants\u2019 premises. The discharge from its mouth was into the same place as the discharge from the box drain and the water from it found its way to Cole Creek in the same direction and along the same course as formerly, but the quantity of the discharge was apparently materially increased and the effect of its action was to cut a much more defined channel from the mouth of the culvert through the defendant\u2019s premises to the creek; and if there was a servitude in respect of the former drain it was largely increased by the new culvert. The water formerly brought to and discharged through the box drain and thereafter through this culvert was chiefly surface water collected by means of drains and ditches and conducted to a ditch or drain constructed by the municipality of Sidney along the north side of Mill Street, which at one time conducted water from west of King Street but for the past fifteen or more years only from a point to the east of the east side of King Street. At one time there was an occasional accession of water from an overflow, in times of freshet, of a pond situate on the corner of Albert and Scott Streets some distance to the north and west of the corner of King and Mill Streets, but this was cut off about the year 1890, by a drain constructed by the municipality. There was also an occasional overflow from a spring situate some distance to the north of Mill Street, nearly on a line with the point where the culvert crosses Mill Street, but about the year 1884 this also was cut off and the water drained to the Trent river. One Chapman who owns a parcel of land on the north side of Mill Street directly opposite the defendants\u2019 premises and through whose premises was the natural depression above spoken of, put down a drain from his premises and cellar about the year 1868 and thereby conducted to the drain on the north side of Mill Street, the waters collected by means of his drain. But these and nearly all the other waters that flowed through the culvert were waters cast upon the surface of the ground in the shape of either rain or melted snow, and the quantity consequently varied very considerably, there being sometimes a very considerable volume, while at others, and for the most part, the discharge was comparatively small and intermittent.\nThis was the state of things when in 1887 the defendants commenced the erection of the building in respect of which the controversy has arisen and which is generally spoken of in the evidence as the storehouse or warehouse. It is a brick structure upon a stone foundation, its eastern wall coming within a few inches of the western wall of the plaintiff\u2019s building and extending south to Cole Creek. The south wall extends to the west about thirty-four feet. The eastern wall extends northward from the south wall to within about ten feet of the south line of Mill street. It is then turned to the east a distance of about ten feet and is then turned to the north, about ten feet, to the south line of Mill street. The north or front wall extends easterly along or slightly over the street limit to the west wall. There is thus formed at the north-west corner on the building what is spoken of as an \u201cL\u201d about ten feet square. There is left between the warehouse and the grist mill an alleyway about ten feet wide. The culvert comes upon the defendants\u2019 premises near the corner formed by the west wall of the \u201cL.\u201d In excavating for the foundation of the warehouse the defendants cut away the planks covering the culvert and removed its stone wall for some distance and built the foundation wall across its course from the rock upwards to some distance above the level of the street, but did not move the culvert back to the line of the street and its point of discharge was still upon the defendants\u2019 premises. The superstructure was completed in 1888, and then the defendants, in order, as they say, to protect their foundation wall from the waters coming through the culvert and to conduct them to Cole Creek, removed the stone walls of the culvert to the line of the street and made an excavation in a diagonal line from the corner of the \u201cL\u201d fronting on Mill street to the lower corner on the alleyway and placed a barrier of planks across the base of the \u201cL\u201d from the rock to above the level of the street. The space behind this barrier and between it and the foundation wall was filled in with earth and gravel. The space in front was not filled in, but on the contrary the defendants say they caused a cutting to be made from the drain to the alleyway so as to conduct the water coming from the culvert to the alleyway, and enable it to flow down into the creek. Whether this provision for carrying off the water would have been sufficient if it had continued is not known, for before long the space in front of the barrier began to be filled up with earth, stones, ashes and other debris thrown or collected there without the action or concert of the defendants, so that in less than a year the mouth of the culvert was completely covered and stopped up, and the space became filled almost, if not wholly, to the level of the ground. The effect of this was to entirely stop the flow of water from the culvert. In 1890, upon occasion of heavy rains, water began to come into the plaintiff\u2019s cellar through the walls at the north-west corner of his building, more particularly in the west wall, and this continued from time to time up to the time of the commencement of this action on the 6th of September, 1892.\nThe Divisional Court held that the plaintiff was entitled to damages and reversed the judgment of the trial judge who dismissed the action. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of the Divisional Court and restored that of Falconbridge J., at the trial. The plaintiff then appealed to this court.\nAfter the appeal was lodged in the Supreme Court, it having been made to appear that the plaintiff had become insolvent an order of a judge in chambers added his assignee, Alexander Beatty, to the cause as an appellant.\nC.J. Holman and Porter for the appellants. The plaintiff having suffered damages through the act of the defendant in obstructing the watercourse he is entitled to recover though not a reparian proprietor.

Coleman[14].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Mr. Justice Moss has in his able judgment so fully stated the facts of the case that it is unnecessary to repeat them.\nIt is sufficient to say that whatever may have been the condition fifty or sixty years ago of the premises where the culvert in question across Mill Street in the village of Frankford is situate, that is to say, whether there was then anything which could be called a natural watercourse, it is unnecessary to inquire, for it is clear upon the evidence that for nearly twenty years before the defendants in 1888 completed their building which is complained of, and perhaps ever since the village municipality came into existence the only waters passing through the culvert in question were the waters brought down from a drain constructed by Mr. Chapman upon his lot on the north side of Mill street about thirty feet distant from the mouth of the culvert and the rain and melting snow fallen on the street and land in the vicinity of a ditch along the north side of Mill street from Chapman\u2019s drain to the culvert. These waters were discharged through the culvert on the defendants\u2019 land, and what the defendants have done which is complained of is that in 1888 they completed the erection of a building of stone and brick on their own land on the south side of Mill street, the north wall of which is distant ten feet from the southern limit of the street, and they have cut off the walls of the culvert which projected over the line of the street whereby the waters passing through the culvert soak partly through the street and partly through the ten feet of defendants\u2019 land between their building and the street, and so possibly have done some damage to the plaintiff. But the defendants in so erecting their building and cutting off that part of the culvert which projected over their land, have only exercised their right, and if the plaintiff has been damnified thereby, his remedy is not against the defendants, but rather against the municipality who maintain the drain in an insufficient condition.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: E.

On motion to quash for want of jurisdiction when the appeal was called for hearing;\nHeld, that the case did not involve a question of title to real estate or any interest therein but was merely a controversy in relation to an amount less than the sum or value of one thousand dollars and that the Act 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 34, prohibited an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which affirmed the decision of the High Court of Justice maintaining the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs. The plaintiff, as assignee for the benefit of creditors of the estate of a firm of insolvent traders, brought an action to set aside a second mortgage for $2,200 on the lands of a member of the insolvent firm, on the ground that it had been given to secure an undue preference and was fraudulent and void as against the creditors in general of the insolvents. It appeared that, while the action was pending and before trial, the mortgaged lands had been sold, by virtue of the powers in a prior mortgage, for a sum sufficient to satisfy all claims thereunder, and that the surplus proceeds, amounting to $270, had been paid over by the first mortgagee to the defendant. At the trial His Lordship the Chancellor of Ontario made an order setting aside the second mortgage, and directing the defendant to pay the plaintiff the amount of such surplus proceeds so received by him in virtue thereof. On appeal the Court of Appeal for Ontario were equally divided, (Burton C.J. and Maclennan J. being of opinion that the appeal should be allowed, and Osler and Moss JJ. being for dismissal,) and accordingly the Chancellor\u2019s decision stood affirmed. The defendant then proceeded to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, and on objections on the ground of want of jurisdiction being taken to the allowance of the appeal bond, Maclennan J. held that a title to real estate or some interest therein was brought in question in the case, and that, consequently an appeal would lie under 60 & 61 Vict. (D.) ch. 34, s. 1 (a). The appeal was accordingly proceeded with, the case and factums printed and delivered, and the appeal inscribed for hearing in the usual course. Upon the appeal being called in the Supreme Court of Canada, a motion on behalf of the respondent was made to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction on the ground that the matters in controversy did not come within the exceptions mentioned in the first section of the statute, 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 34 (D).\nThe provisions of the Act affecting the appeal are as follows:\n1. No appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada from any judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, except in the following cases:\u2014\n(a) Where the title to real estate or some interest therein is in question;\n(c) Where the matter in controversy in the appeal exceeds the sum or value of one thousand dollars, exclusive of costs;\n(f) Whenever the right to appeal is dependent upon the amount in dispute, such amount shall be understood to be that demanded, not that recovered, if they are different.\nWallace Nesbitt, (Clarke with him), for the motion. The action was originally only to set aside a mortgage and the result was that the assignee for the benefit of creditors was declared entitled to $270, the whole remaining surplus, proceeds of the sale of the lands, unabsorbed by the prior mortgage under which the mortgaged lands had been sold. Even although the second mortgage was collateral security for $2,200 that amount is not in dispute. The prior mortgage absorbed all proceeds from the lands sold, except the $270 which is now the only subject in controversy. The assignee cannot possibly get at the land and cannot possibly recover, in any case, anything but this surplus of $270, and the controversy is reduced practically to a question as to costs. His Lordship Chancellor Boyd, recognising this, allowed costs only upon the lower scale, although it afterwards turned out that he was not authorised to make this reduction, and the judgment of the court actually gave full costs. Hamilton Cassels, contra. Subsection (a) of section 1 of the Act governs this appeal. The action was to set aside a second mortgage of lands as fraudulent, which raised a question of title to lands. There was a question of the respondent\u2019s title to some interest in real estate and to test its validity. Subsection (c) protects the appellant\u2019s right when it depends on the amount in dispute, and in this case we ascertain the matter in controversy and the amount in dispute by reading the prayer demanding that the mortgage on the land for $2,200 be declared fraudulent and set aside. Subsection (f) makes it clear that the demand was intended to be the test.\nAfter hearing the above arguments the court delivered judgment holding that as no sum was demanded by the action only a matter of $270 in money was in controversy on the appeal and that no title to real estate or any interest therein was in question. The appeal was quashed with costs as upon a motion to quash.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cassels, Cassels & Brock.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Beatty, Blackstock, Nesbitt, Chadwick & Riddell.\n"}

The plaintiff's action was for trespass by the municipality and breaking down his fences enclosing lands in the Town of Edmonton. The municipality claimed part of these lands as a public highway by reservation and dedication in the patent from the Crown and by long user. The case was tried in the Supreme Court for the North-west Territories, District of Northern Alberta, before Scott J., who dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs and this decision was affirmed by the full court, sitting en banc, Rouleau J. dissenting.\nThe circumstances under which the controversy arose and the matters in issue in the case are stated in the judgment reported.\nMcCaul Q.C. for the appellant. The appellant's title is unquestioned, unless the locus in quo is a public highway by express reservation in the Crown grant or by dedication, as the claim by prescription has been abandoned by the respondent, and claim by estoppel does not appear on the face of the pleadings.\nAll the judges of the court below are agreed that the respondent could not succeed upon the ground of reservation. Their lordships have found it impossible to say that the reservation in the patent\u2014\"the public road or trail crossing the said lot\"\u2014has reference to the particular trail to which the respondent endeavours to assign the words. As to the question of dedication, the trial judge, (Scott J.), held that the evidence was not sufficient to establish a dedication. Upon appeal, Richardson J., feeling bound by Turner v. Walsh[1] decided that from user alone there was sufficient evidence of dedication; Wetmore J., was of opinion that there was no sufficient evidence of dedication by reason merely of user alone, but that such user coupled with the reservation in the patent and some supposed admissions of the appellant in connection with certain expropriation proceedings, showed a sufficient intention on the part of the appellant (and his vendor, David McDougall, the patentee), to dedicate; while Rouleau J. held that there was no evidence of dedication. The trial judge dismissed the action on the ground of estoppel by representations; upon appeal Richardson J. and Wetmore J. gave no decided opinion, while Rouleau J. thought that the doctrine of estoppel had no application whatsoever. Therefore, although the judgments are largely in favour of the appellant, yet because of alleged admissions of the appellant at the expropriation proceedings, the judgment in appeal went against him.\nThe respondent contended that, in addition to Jasper Avenue, there exists a highway, part of an old irregular and straggling trail (which had been used as a public road prior to the Dominion Government survey in 1882) still surviving, though only as to a small portion, the rest having been obliterated by lots, streets and buildings. Now the grantee from the Crown did not and could not claim through the squatters who had occupied the land prior to the survey; Farmer v. Livingstone[2]; The Trustees, Executors and Agency Company v. Short[3]; and the trial judge expressly held that prior to patent, (in 1887,) he had \"no right or title to occupation,\" and \"was not in a position, to prevent\" any user of the property as a trail.\nThe \"reservation\" in the patent is in these words: \"Reserving thereout the public road or trail one chain in width crossing the said lot.\" There were, at the date of the patent, \"crossing the said lot,\" not only the roadway which the respondent claims to have been the trail or road reserved but also, towards the north, a well-travelled road which answered the description in the patent and also Jasper Avenue, the main street of the village or town, which had been cleared and was the principal travelled road in 1887. It is altogether probable that it was to Jasper Avenue that the patent referred, but if not, the next most probable road was the northerly one. It is certain, therefore, that the roadway in question is not that referred to in the patent as the \"public road or trail.\" In this all the judges agree.\nThe whole question of dedication is a question of fact; Belford v. Haynes[4]; Beveridge v. Creelman et al.[5] at page 37; depending on the assent or intention of the owner, which \"must be clearly proved before the court will take away a man's land from him,\" Rae v. Trim[6] per Blake, V.C., at p. 379. It was a question for the trial judge, (Scott J.) who distinctly held that there was no evidence of any intention to dedicate on the part of the patentee. While the fee was in the Crown, user cannot be relied upon as evidence of dedication because that user was without the knowledge of the Crown, and Nullum tempus occurrit regi. Harper v. Charlesworth[7]; Reg. v. Plunkett[8]; Dunlop v. The Township of York[9]; The Queen v. Moss[10]. Although there was a certain amount of travel over the lands in question the route was not of any considerable importance and in no sense a main-road or trail. It was merely one of innumerable local trails which arise in every waste territory, according to the convenience of straggling squatters. The western prairie, far from being a \"trackless\" plain, as so often described, was, and is, crossed and re-crossed by tracks and trails, in every conceivable direction. The main trail\u2014the principal artery of travel\u2014crossed the north end of the lot in question. One of the witnesses speaks of the roadway now in dispute as a mere footpath in 1882 and in fact it was a mere trespass road or short-cut, used until the main thoroughfare, (Jasper Avenue), was cleared and opened, and it has been completely obliterated both upon the east and west of the locus in quo, blocked, closed up, and built upon. The patentee in making his plan, three months after obtaining his patent, showed a distinct refusal to dedicate the property, and instead thereof dedicated, or rather, as he believes, conformed to the patent, in showing, upon his plan, Jasper Avenue, as the road reserved across his property and the respondent, since incorporation in 1892, assessed the owner of the property in question and collected taxes thereon for the years 1892, 1893, 1894, 1895 and 1896, up to the time of the trespass complained of. See Dillon \"Municipal Corporations,\" (4 ed.) par. 564, note p. 659. There never was any animus dedicandi; Poole v. Huskinson[11]; Elliott on Roads and Streets, p. 120.\nBeck Q.C. for the respondent. The respondent submits that the southerly trail is that intended to be reserved in the Crown patent. The Government plan shows the southerly trail to be a continuous one through the Village settlement, and a necessary highway affording the settlers access to the surveyed road allowances running north and south on each side of the village, while the northerly trail, so far as the map shows, stops short, no doubt because it was not clearly defined on the ground. The patents for lands in the vicinity, except that for lot 10, contain reservations of a trail, and describe the adjoining lands by express reference to the Government map which shows no continuous trail over them except the southerly trail. The omission of the reservation in the patent for lot 10 is clearly explained by the fact that prior to the issue of that patent the plan of subdivision had been registered giving a public highway over it, approximately corresponding with the southerly trail there. The plan of subdivision of the Hudson Bay Company's Reserve completed before the Dominion Government survey clearly shows which trail the company\u2014one of the public interested in both trails\u2014considered to be the more important, showing as it does the southerly, but not the northerly trail. User by the public has been shown since 1852, and evidence of intention to dedicate on the part of McDougall, the patentee, is clear in view of his legal rights as an occupant, and of his assumed rights recognized by the Crown. His conduct is clearly sufficient to establish a dedication as against both himself and the Crown. Reg. v. East Mark[12]; Reg. v. Petrie[13]; Elliott on Roads and Streets, pp. 100, 124, 125; Turner v. Walsh[14]. The reservation in the patent, and the conduct of McDougall in connection with the arbitration on recent expropriation proceedings, even if not amounting to estoppel, are both strong additional circumstances in support of the dedication.\nAs to estoppel, (even assuming there was waiver by not pleading it), the trial judge in dealing with the facts was at liberty to find either according to the facts or according to the estoppel if they led to different conclusions. Vooght v. Winch[15]; Trevivian v. Lawrence[16]. The plaintiff is estopped. David McDougall was a party to the arbitration proceedings, and the plaintiff was his agent and at the same time the nominal owner of the land in question, in trust for McDougall, subject to his own beneficial interest. McDougall raised the issue of the trail in question being a legally existing one or not, and the plaintiff gave evidence to show that there was a trail and that, therefore, a proposed extension of another street would be not only valueless to him but an injury. The appellant took the benefit of the arbitrators' finding on this point. In a question of estoppel, an award is equivalent to a judgment. Bigelow on Estoppel (5 ed.) p. 58; Russell on Arbitration (7 ed.) pp. 514, 555; Whitehead v. Tattersall[17]; Gueret v. Audouy[18]. The familiar cases of \"standing by\" are instances of this kind of estoppel. Ramsden v. Dyson[19] at pages 142 and 160; Gregg v. Wells[20]; Coles v. Bank of England[21]. Also under quasi-estoppel, Bigelow, pp. 673, 683-4-5-7; Birmingham v. Kirwan[22] at page 449.\nThere is no estoppel against the defendants. They were quite right in assessing the property. The right of way over it does not change its ownership, though it no doubt lessened its value, and a large part of the parcel assessed is unaffected by the right of way. The assessment and collection of taxes would in no case amount to an estoppel, except in proceedings relating directly thereto. At all events, there could be no estoppel in the circumstances under which this land was assessed. There has been no abandonment so far as this portion of the trail is concerned, for nothing more is shown than that the two buildings have been allowed to be built so as to encroach on the trail, but not so as in any degree to restrict the travel. Jasper avenue and Main street was not dedicated by registration of a plan of subdivision until after the issue of the patent. It was bush until 1885, when only the timber on it was cut. It was not brushed or cleared up till 1890 or 1891, and not graded until 1892. In order to establish an abandonment, it is necessary not only to show the opening of a new way which will answer the purpose of the old one, but also to show an entire and absolute disuse of the old road. Elliott. p. 658 et seq.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an action instituted in February, 1895, by the plaintiff against the Town of Edmonton, incorporated as a municipality by an ordinance of the North-west Territories in the month of January, 1892, for breaking and entering a close of the plaintiff, situate at the north-east angle of that part of river lot no. 8, in the Edmonton Settlement, which lies south of Jasper avenue, as it crosses the said lot, and for breaking down and destroying a fence of the plaintiff there being. The close in question consists of two small town lots fronting on the south side of said Jasper avenue for which the plaintiff's predecessors in title were assessed and taxed by the municipality defendants every year until the year 1895, when the plaintiff, being in possession, was assessed and taxed therefor. The defendant, notwithstanding the assessment of the said town lots, now pleads as a defence to the present action that at the time of committing the grievances complained of by the plaintiff the locus in quo was and for a long time had been a public highway within the limits of the municipality, and in support of such contention, it is alleged and pleaded; 1st. That the locus in quo forms part of river lot no. 8, in the Edmonton Settlement, and that the patent from the Crown for the said lot expressly reserves the said highway for the public use; and, 2ndly. That the highway was dedicated by the Crown and by the patentee as is evidenced by long user.\nPrior to the year 1882, when first these lands called river lots in the Edmonton District were surveyed and given boundaries by the Crown there was a trail across what is now river lot 10, and other lands east of it, in a devious, irregular route and without any defined limits, and westerly across what is now river lot no. 8, in a diagonal direction from the place where it entered upon the river lot 8, to where the western limit of the said lot, which is the eastern limit of the river lot 6, reaches a steep bank overhanging the Saskatchewan River, and thence along the top of such steep bank, across river lot 6, to the Hudson Bay Company's Reserve, which lies immediately west of the river lot 6, and so to a Trading Post of the Hudson Bay Company in such Reserve. This trail the settlers on the Edmonton Settlement, close to the river, had been in the habit of using for convenience of access to the Hudson Bay Company's said Trading Post.\nIn the year 1892 the present defendant brought an action against two persons named Brown and Curry, in which the contention of the present defendant was that Jasper avenue as laid across river lot 10 by the person who afterwards became patentee from the Crown of the greater part of that lot was adopted and dedicated by the Crown and confirmed by the letters patent for the several parts of the said river lot and was substituted for the old trail as it crossed said river lot 10, which upon the opening of Jasper avenue, which was eighty feet in width, became absolutely obliterated and extinguished in so far as lot 10 is concerned. In that contention the present defendant finally succeeded by the judgment of this court delivered upon the 1st May, 1894, and in that judgment will appear how the Dominion Government acted in so adopting Jasper avenue as a substitute for the old trail on river lot 10. The judgment was unfortunately mislaid and therefore not reported, but has recently been discovered and can now be reported[23].\nIn the present action the defendant as part of its case proved, by admission of the opposite party but still as part of the defendant's case, that letters patent from the Crown were issued upon the 30th September, 1887, a month after the issue of the letters patent for lot 10, which has been in like manner proved in the present case, granting said river lot 8 to one David Macdougall the purchaser thereof, in fee \"reserving thereout the \"public road or trail, one chain in width, crossing the said lot.\" The defendant has thus established the issues entered on the record in favour of the plaintiff unless the locus in quo should be established to be, as pleaded, a public highway.\nDavid McDougall, the patentee of this river lot 8, upon acquiring his title under the said letters patent immediately extended Jasper Avenue across his lot to a greater width than it has across lot 10, as appears by the registered plan produced, and upon either side of it he laid out building lots, those upon the south side numbering from the western to the eastern limit of the lot where are situated the lots constituting the locus in quo. The old trail ran diagonally across land now comprised within the limits of four of these lots, all of which have been continuously assessed and taxed by the municipality ever since its incorporation to the patentee or persons claiming title under him. Thus in so far as in him lay the patentee declared his clear intention to close forever and he in point of fact so closed up the old trail at its very entry into the lot 8, and he substituted therefor Jasper Avenue which he dedicated as a public highway across his lot. It also appeared that the patentee of river lot 6 in like manner extended Jasper Avenue across his lot to the Hudson Bay Company's Reserve. The whole question then at the trial was: 1st. Whether the public road or trail reserved in and by the said letters patent to David McDougall was the trail which formerly crossed where is now the locus in quo in the present action; and 2nd. Whether a dedication by the Grown or the patentee could be presumed from the user which appeared in evidence. These questions underwent a thorough investigation during a trial which extended over seven days and at its close the learned trial judge upon the 17th December, 1895, reserved his judgment which was delivered by him on the 24th June, 1896, and thereby he found and adjudged as to the above issues joined, upon the record; 1st. That the highway or public road reserved by the said letters patent was not the trail which had crossed river lot 8, at the place where the locus in quo in the present action is, but that a public road or trail which crossed the northerly part of the said river lot 8, and which was the great thoroughfare from a very early period between the east and west for all the traffic of the Hudson Bay Company who had the monopoly of the trade of the country, and by which road the great majority of persons passing backwards and forwards into and through the Settlement travelled, was the public road reserved by the letters patent. He also found and adjudged, 2ndly. That the evidence was insufficient to justify the finding of a dedication by the Crown, and that there was nothing in the act or conduct of the patentee McDougall prior to the arbitration (next mentioned), from which a dedication could be implied. He thus found that from the time of the issue of the letters patent to McDougall up to the time of the arbitration taking place, at any rate the patentee and those claiming under him were absolutely seized in fee of the land over which the old trail had passed free from any claim whatever of the public to such land as being dedicated to the use of the public as a highway and for this reason he justified the assessment of the locus in quo up to and including the year 1894 as the property of the patentee and his assigns, and so liable to be assessed, but as to the assessment to the plaintiff in the year 1895, he could not see, he said, how that assessment could effect the matter in question. But the assessment of that year, equally as the assessments of the preceding years was, as was the plaintiff's contention, quite proper, and all for the same reason, namely, that the lots so assessed were the absolute property of the patentee and those claiming under him and did not nor did any part of them constitute land dedicated to the public use as a highway, as now claimed by the defendants. The weight of this evidence as relied upon by the plaintiff, was that it was clearly in rebuttal of any dedication to be presumed from user.\nNow as to this arbitration so referred to by the learned judge it appears that copies of the award made thereat, and of a paper purporting to be the evidence given by the plaintiff thereat, and of the by-law for the expropriation of the piece of land therein mentioned, under which the arbitration took place, none of which in any manner bear upon or relate to the matters in issue on the record, became to be filed as exhibits in the cause in some way or other not explained in the record before us; at what stage of the trial or for what purpose they were so filed nowhere appears. The plaintiff's counsel appears to have regarded the documents as wholly irrelevant; the defendant's counsel does not appear upon the record before us to have alluded to them during the trial nor at any time except at the close of his argument, after the trial he alludes to them thus:\nThe answer is an estoppel because plaintiff shews that he then had an interest in the property in question and upon the arbitration he claimed that the trail existed. It is singular, to say the least, that having, as is said here, an interest in the property in question he should be insisting upon the existence of a state of things which would utterly destroy his interest. However, in the argument before us this construction of the plaintiff's evidence is utterly repudiated and denied to be sound, what he actually did being said to be, that he gave evidence for the information of the arbitrators as to what could be done with the lot remaining not yet laid out if the trail was a public highway and what if it were not; and it is utterly repudiated that he said anything which could be reasonably construed into insisting that the trail is a public highway, or with intention to get the arbitrators to regard it as such. To have done so would certainly have been utterly inconsistent with his duty to the owner of the land and could not be binding on him. The learned judge read all these papers and formed the opinion that the evidence thereby appearing to have been given by the plaintiff leads to the conclusion that he was contending that the trail in question was a public highway and he thought that if the arbitrators had not found it to be a public highway they would not have awarded so much as they did. As to this observation it may be said that the suggestion is merely a surmise of the learned judge for, from the award, the arbitrators would seem to have attached little weight to the evidence of the plaintiff which certainly would seem to have been rather extravagant, for the value attached by him to the piece expropriated was $2,583.75, while the arbitrators allowed only $325. Again the learned judge says that he thinks that the representations of the plaintiff which the learned judge had spoken of as leading to the conclusion that the plaintiff was contending that the trail was a public highway were made with intent that the arbitrators should act upon such representations, but what these representations were is nowhere stated, although the conclusion which they are construed as leading to, is stated, and such being the assumed intent of the plaintiff in making the representations whatever they were, the learned judge was of opinion that upon the ground of good faith alone the patentee McDougall and the plaintiff should be estopped from denying that the trail in question is a public highway.\nI do not propose to inquire whether the opinions of the learned judge are well founded or not, for although he expressed the opinion, he concluded (as there were no pleadings on the record to raise the question involved) by merely directing that the defendant municipality might, if so advised, amend its defence in such manner as to raise a question as to estoppel, but nevertheless, while so directing and notwithstanding the material' issue joined or the record which he had found in the plaintiff's favour he ordered judgment in the action to be entered for the defentants and in accordance with such order a rule has issued out of the court dismissing the plaintiffs action with costs. From this rule the plaintiff appealed to the full court, and from the judgment of that court therein the appeal to this court has been taken.\nThe full court consisted of three judges, namely: Justices Richardson, Rouleau and Wetmore. All concurred with the learned trial judge that the trail in question was not that which was reserved as a public road by the letters patent. As to the residue, Mr. Justice Richardson was of opinion that dedication by user was established, resting his judgment upon the authority of Turner v. Walsh[24], and for that reason he was of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. Mr. Justice Wetmore entertained such great doubts as to the applicability of the doctrine of estoppel that he declined to pass judgment upon that point and leaving all question upon that point out of consideration he was of opinion that from the plaintiffs conduct at the arbitration coupled with the previous user a dedication of the trail as a public road might and ought to be presumed upon the authority of Turner v. Walsh (1). He regarded as he said the conduct of the plaintiff at the arbitration as being equivalent to McDougall himself appearing and saying: \"I am owner of this land and I concede that this is a way; i concede that it must be presumed that there has been a grant of this trail as a way,\" and so he held that there was established a dedication of the way by user and consent of parties.\nSo to construe what took place at the arbitration involves an assumption first, that the plaintiff had any authority to bind McDougall by any concession relating to his lands; and secondly, that such authority extended to making in his name a concession which, assuming it to have been made, would be in direct contradiction and reversal of McDougall's manifest intention and conduct in closing up the trail, in dedicating Jasper Avenue in its stead and laying out town lots on the trail itself where closed, disposing of them to others, some of whom built upon them and who, as well as he himself, have ever since the incorporation of the defendant as a municipality, paid to the defendant the taxes which the defendant assessed upon those town lots.\nMr. Justice Rouleau was of opinion that the learned trial judge was quite right in all his findings upon the issues upon the record, but that his opinion as to applicability of the doctrine of estoppel to the case was erroneous; and while doubting the applicability of the doctrine of Turner v. Walsh[25] to the case of user of a way over the waste lands of the Crown in the Territories before ever a survey was made of them by the Crown he showed very clearly, as we think, that even upon the authority of Turner v. Walsh (1) any presumption arising from user, if any did arise upon the evidence in the present case, was completely rebutted; and he was of opinion that judgment should be entered in the action for the plaintiff with ($40) forty dollars damages and his costs of the action and of his appeal. In this judgment we entirely concur and all that we wish to add to it is that while we cannot concur with the learned trial judge in the opinion he formed as to the construction of the plaintiff's conduct and evidence upon the arbitration, still no conduct of his or evidence given by him could, from anything appearing in the case, have the effect of divesting McDougall or his assigns of any estate or interest in their or any of their real estate, or could constitute a dedication by McDougall of any part of his real estate as a public highway to the public use. We are of opinion therefore that the learned trial judge should have rendered judgment for the plaintiff upon the issues found in his favour after a protracted trial of seven days.\nThis appeal must therefore be allowed with costs and judgment be ordered to be entered for the plaintiff in the action for $40 damages as stated in Mr. Justice Rouleau's judgment with all costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McCaul & Short.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Beck & Emery.\n[1] 6 App. Cas. 636.\n[2] 5 Can.

Mulcahy, her husband, against the defendant Donald Archibald, high sheriff of the county of Halifax, on the 2nd day of March, 1896, to recover 550 barrels of frozen herring, in bulk, which were seized by the said defendant on board the schooner \"Ocean Belle,\" which said vessel was owned by the said Addra Jane Mulcahy, and for damages for detaining the same and for refusing to deliver up the same to the said plaintiffs on demand. On the 3rd day of March, 1896, an order to replevy the said goods was issued under order XLV of the rules of the Supreme Court, 1884.\nThe defendant levied upon the said 550 barrels of frozen herring, on the 2nd day of March, 1897, under an execution issued on a judgment recovered by Narcisse Blais, as plaintiff, against Michael B. Wrayton, as defendant, on the 19th day of December, A.D. 1896; and the defendant claims that at the date of the said levy the said herring were the property of the said Wrayton.\nThe said schooner \"Ocean Belle\" was conveyed to the female plaintiff in 1891, by George E. Forsyth, for the sum of $800, of which $400 was paid by her in cash on July 11th, 1891, and the balance of $400 was secured by a mortgage of the said schooner for that amount, made by the female plaintiff to the said Forsyth, and a promissory note for $400 made by the female plaintiff and the said Wrayton in favour of the said Forsyth, dated July 7th, 1891, which was subsequently paid and satisfied by the female plaintiff.\nThe schooner \"Foaming Billow\" was purchased by the said plaintiff under similar circumstances in 1892.\nThe said Wrayton was master of the schooner \"Ocean Belle\" and managed both vessels on his own account with the assistance of advances made by said plaintiff until December, 1895, at which date the said Wrayton owed the said plaintiff upwards of $4,000 for advances, etc.\nThe schooner \"Ocean Belle\" arrived in Halifax, from a trading voyage on or about November 12th, 1895, with a cargo of fish consigned by said Wrayton to Billman, Chisholm & Co., which cargo was sold to Eisenhaur & Co., for $2,804.19. About one-third of this cargo had been purchased by said Wrayton, from said Blais, to whom Wrayton gave in payment for the same a bill of exchange drawn by him upon Billman, Chisholm & Co, for $925.50, dated October 19th, 1895, payable ten days after sight.\nAt that time (November 1895,) the said Wrayton owed the firm of Billman, Chisholm & Co., for goods, supplied for these trading voyages, the sum of $2,357.57; of which $1,260.32 was secured by promissory notes made by Wrayton and indorsed by the said plaintiff to the said firm. Billman, Chisholm & Co., as consignees of the cargo, demanded the proceeds of the sale of the cargo from Eisenhaur & Co., in settlement of their account, and a dispute arising they refused to accept Wrayton's said draft on them in favour of Blais for $925.50. Pending the adjustment of this dispute Eisenhaur & Co., paid the proceeds of the sale of the cargo to the Halifax Banking Company.\nThe dispute between Wrayton & Billman, Chisholm & Co., in which the female plaintiff was interested as an indorser of Wrayton's notes and as a creditor of Wrayton's, was settled by an agreement signed by the parties and by which Billman, Chisholm & Co., received payment of their claims in full, leaving a balance of $416.62 which was ultimately paid over to Wrayton and out of which he paid $275 for wages due to seamen.\nAt the time of the above settlement it was agreed between the plaintiff and Captain Wrayton that she was to take over, on account of what Wrayton owed her, the trading stores remaining on board the two schooners, and also the trading stores then in possession of Billman, Chisholm & Co., referred to in this agreement, and thereupon she fitted out the schooner \"Ocean Belle\" by her agents, Thomas Forhan & Co., for a trading voyage to Newfoundland in December, 1895, for which purchases to the amount of $610.23 were made and paid for by her. She subsequently employed Wrayton as master for said voyage on wages at the rate of $50 per month.\nWrayton proceeded on the said voyage, and purchased with these goods 550 barrels of frozen herring in bulk, for which a bill of lading was made to the said plaintiff or her assigns, dated at Burin, Newfoundland, February 19th, 1896, and forwarded by mail to her at Halifax.\nIn the meantime the said bill of exchange in favour of the said Blais, dated October 19th, 1895, having been protested by reason of the refusal of Billman, Chisholm & Co. to accept it, Blais recovered judgment on December 19th, 1895, against Wrayton, in the Supreme Court, for the amount due thereon and costs at that suit, which was not defended.\nOn the arrival of the schooner \"Ocean Belle\" at Halifax, on March 2nd, 1896, the said herring were seized by the defendant under execution issued on the said judgment, and the same day the plaintiff commenced this action.\nThis action was tried without a jury before Mr. Justice Meagher, who on January, 2nd, 1897, delivered judgment, in favour of the plaintiff, and decided that \"the sole question is whether the goods levied upon were the property of Wrayton or of the plaintiff,\" and that the said goods were the property of the plaintiff, inasmuch as \"the voyages (i.e. the December voyages) were undertaken by Wrayton as plaintiff's agent,\" and that \"he (Wrayton) ceased to act as principal and undertook to hold the goods (i.e. the goods on board the 'Ocean Belle,' prior to the commencement of the voyage) as her agent,\" that is, as agent of the female plaintiff.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, judgment was delivered by Graham J., and Townshend J., reversing the judgment of the trial judge, on the ground that the transfer from Wrayton to the female plaintiff of the goods on board the schooner \"Ocean Belle\" in November, 1895, was void under the statute of 13 Elizabeth, ch. 5; and that therefore the herring purchased in Newfoundland in February, 1895, with the proceeds of those goods and of the other goods purchased by the female plaintiff and placed on board the schooner \"Ocean Belle\" at the commencement of the December voyage, were the property of Wrayton, and not the property of female plaintiff.\nFrom this judgment the plaintiff asserts this appeal.\nHarris Q.C. for the appellants. It is not disputed that plaintiff gave value for the goods and even if they were transferred with intent to defeat the execution of Blais the transfer would not be void under the statute of Elizabeth. See Middleton v. Pollock. Ex parte Elliott[2]\nIt is well established in Nova Scotia that replevin of goods taken in execution will lie against a sheriff. Ring v. Brenan[3]; McGregor v. Patterson[4] per Bliss J. at page 226; Freeman v. Harrington[5].\nMcInnis for the respondent. Goods in the custody of the law cannot be replevied. George v. Chambers[6]; Calcutt v. Ruttan[7]. In Carty v. Bonnett[8] the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia so held.\nThe learned counsel argued on the other point that the transaction was only a scheme to defraud the defendant and was void under 13 Eliz. ch. 5.\nHarris Q.C. in reply. Carty v. Bonnett (1) was decided under a special statute which has since been repealed.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014On the 19th of December, 1895, one Narcisse Blais obtained judgment in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia against one Michael B. Wrayton, a brother of the present appellant, and under an execution issued upon that judgment the defendant as such sheriff levied upon 550 barrels of frozen herring which were then on board the schooner \"Ocean Belle,\" the property of the appellant, whereupon she claiming the herring, brought this action to recover the goods so levied upon, the question to be determined being whether they at the time of the levy were the property of Wrayton or the property of the present appellant. The learned trial judge, Mr. Justice Meagher, gave judgment in favour of the plaintiff, holding that there was a real transaction between Wrayton and his sister, and that no matter what the motive of Wrayton himself was in reference to one or more of certain other creditors the transfer to his sister having been in security for or in payment of a bon\u00e2 fide antecedent debt the transaction was not within the statute 13 Eliz. ch. 5. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia the judgment of the trial judge was reversed, and it was held that the transaction in question was void as a fraud by Wrayton against his creditors. We are of opinion that the judgment of Mr. Justice Meagher should be restored. There is little question as to the salient features of this case. At the time of the transaction impeached Wrayton owed the plaintiff upwards of $4,000. The goods which were transferred to her by Wrayton from the proceeds of which the goods levied upon were bought were transferred to her on account of this indebtedness. No doubt it was the intention on the part of Wrayton to prevent this seizure under the judgment which he expected Blais would very soon recover against him and for the very purpose of securing his sister at the expense of Blais and with intent either to delay him in his remedies or to defeat them altogether. The statute of Elizabeth, while making void transfers, the object of which is to defeat or delay creditors, does not make void but expressly protects them in the interest of transferees who have given valuable consideration therefor, and it has been decided over and over again that knowledge on the part of such a transferee of the motive or design of the transferor is not conclusive of bad faith or will not preclude him from obtaining the benefit of his security. So long as there is an existing debt and the transfer to him is made for the purpose of securing that debt and he does not either directly or indirectly make himself an instrument for the purpose of subsequently benefiting cannot be held void protected and the transaction cannot be held void. As Jessel M. R. said in Middleton v. Pollock[9] at page 108:\nIt has been decided, if decision were wanted, that a payment is bon\u00e2 fide within the meaning of the statute of Elizabeth, although the man who made the payment was insolvent at the time to his own knowledge, and even although the creditors who accepted the money knew it. * * * The meaning of the statute is that the debtor must not retain a benefit for himself. And that proposition was a mere re-affirmance of such previous decisions as Holbird v. Anderson et at[10]; Pickstock v. Lyster[11]; Wood v. Dixie[12]. Reference was made in Mr. Justice Townshend's opinion in the Court of Appeal to the case of Thompson v. Webster[13]; but I am unable to see the applicability of that case to the present one. The transaction impeached in that case was held to be valid, but it seems to me clear that the learned Vice-Chancellor Kindersley in the observations which he made to which reference is had was referring, not to transfers for valuable consideration but to voluntary debts. On the whole we are of opinion that the appeal should be allowed, the usual rule as to costs prevailing.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Harris, Henry & Cahon.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Drysdale McInnis.\n[1] 30 N.

On an appeal taken by the company to the Superior Court. district of Iberville under the 161st section of \" The Railway Act,\" this award was reformed by reducing the amount of the indemnity to $2,000, but on a further appeal by the present respondent the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, reversed the decision of the Superior Court and restored the award of the arbitrators with costs against the company, now appellant.\nThe property expropriated, about four and a half arpents in extent, consisted chiefly of a hill of sand or gravel covered by a considerable depth of arable soil, situated a few arpents from the respondent's dwelling-house, surrounded by respondent's remaining land, and is said to have been much the best and most profitable part of his farm. The appellant's object in expropriating it appeared to be for the use of the sand and gravel, which went down to a level considerably lower than the remainder of the respondent's property. Appellant offered $661.50 for the property, which was refused, and arbitrators were appointed under the provisions of \" The Railway Act,\" one by each party and a third by the court. Appellant having immediate need of the gravel, took possession of the property, under section 112 of the Railway Act, with-out awaiting the award of the arbitrators.\nThe arbitrators appeared to be all competent persons. of great experience in matters of expropriation, and in addition to having a number of witnesses examined on each side they personally visited and examined the property in question. The owner's arbitrator came to the conclusion that the indemnity should be $11,500, but afterwards agreed to an award of $5,000 as suggested by the third arbitrator, Mr. J. B. Resther, who had prepared a tabulated statement in support of his conclusions, by which it appeared that he had calculated the average valuation placed on the land by the witnesses examined on behalf of the owner, and in the same manner taken the average valuation as shown by the companys witnesses, and the ascertained mean average by adding the sums thus ascertained together and dividing the result in half. At the end of the statement he added the following:\u2014\u2014\n\"Recapitulation.\"\nMoyenne de la preuve sur la valeur. d'un arpent du coteau Coupal. 41\/2 arpents expropri\u00e9s, y compris la lisi\u00e8re de terrain perdue le long de la cl\u00f4ture de la Compagnie\n$ 591 68\n$2662 56\nN.

RESTHER,\nTiers arbitre.\nOn appeal, the Superior Court reduced, the award on the ground that the award was excessive and it was restored by the Court of. Queen's Bench on the ground that it was not contrary to but supported by the evidence, and that owing to the qualifications presumably possessed by arbitrators, their visit to the premises and the means of informing themselves to which the railway Act ([2]) allows them to resort, their award ought not to be disturbed by the courts, except in cases of fraud, partiality or flagrant error.\nLafleur for the appellant. In the Court of Queen's Bench, Mr. Justice Quimet refers to The Montreal and Ottawa Railway Co. v. Bertrand ([3]) Lertioine v. The Mayor etc. of the City of Montreal ([4]), and Mussen et al. v. Canada Atlantic Railway Co. ([5]), decided by the Supreme Court and the Privy Council, but those decisions do not go as far as the learned judges assume. Even where there are no irregularities, negligence nor partiality on the part of the arbitrators there might be error and injustice in their award and it is the duty of the Superior Court, sitting in appeal, to examine whether the arbitrators have rightly appreciated the evidence and to reform their award if it finds that they have not done so. See The Atlantic and North-west Railway Co. v. Wood et, al. ([6]) at page 263. - The valuation made by the owner's arbitrator was $11,500 for the 41\/2 arpents of farm land taken; this is sufficiently absurd and excessive to show that no credit can be given to his decision, which he after wards consented to reduce by more than half. If we refer to the statement of the third arbitrator Resther, accepted by the owner's arbitrator, we see that he has in no way used his judgment in the appreciation of the evidence. He puts in different columns the witnesses' different valuations of the land, damages and revenues, making the average of such valuation by taking every figure at its full face value without any appreciation whatever as to the ground of valuation of the witnesses. Even if all the figures were correct and they are not it is certainly not a fair and legal mode of appreciating the evidence.\nLafontaine for the respondent. This question is wholly one of fact\u2013\u2013the valuation of land. Two of the arbitrators, whose character and qualifications cannot be and are not disputed, have agreed on a valuation and their estimate has been confirmed by five out of the six judges who have already considered it. In such cases, this court has always declined to interfere. See Lemoine v. The. Mayor, etc, of the City of Montreal ([7]) and cases there cited by Taschereau J.\nTASCHEREU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. The Court of Queen's Bench rightly held that the arbitrators' award should not be interfered with. The evidence is contradictory. It always is in such cases more so than in others, perhaps. But how can an appellate tribunal be sure that any view it may itself have is more correct than the arbitrators' views who have been on the spot, are men of experience, personally cognizant of the subject matter, and who have heard the witnesses viva voce? For my part I would hesitate before holding that they came to a wrong conclusion. Such is the jurisprudence. Lemoine v. The Mayor etc. of the City of Montreal ([8]); Mussen et al. v. Canada Atlantic Railway Company ([9]); Canada Atlantic Railway Company v. Norris ([10]); Atlantic and Norh-West Railway Company v. Wood et al ([11]).\nThis is nothing else hut an appeal upon a question of fact, and we could not allow the appeal without ignoring the principles said down by the Privy Council on the matter.\nGWYNNE J.\u2013I agree that the appeal should be allowed, for the reasons stated in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am of opinion that the judgment appealed from must be reversed and the judgment of the Superior Court restored.\nThe award of the arbitrators was arrived at by a method of computation which cannot under any circumstances be supported. The arbitrator, Resther, has shown beyond any question how the amount was arrived at. He put forward four different ways or methods by which a conclusion might be arrived at as to the amount to which the claimant was entitled. First, by taking the average estimation of the lands and adding the damages making a total of $3,436.06, and if that were a correct method that should have been the amount of the award. Secondly, he took the average of the damages to the whole farm, that is, what the farm was worth before the expropriation and what it was worth after the expropriation, being $2,957.44 to which he adds $773 additional. That was another way suggested for getting to a right conclusion. Thirdly, he takes the average of the value of the land expropriated calculated on the revenue thereof per arpent, which he puts at $2,046 per arpent, making upon that basis the damages amount to $9,980.500. Finally, he estimates the alleged value of the gravel in the land expropriated, and upon that basis arrives at the sum of $5610.50. He then takes the four different amounts arrived at as above and makes an average of them which gives the sum of $5,689.40 and he determines upon the amount of the award upon the result of that average, less odd figures. I am at a loss to see how an award arrived at by such a method so absurd and contradictory, can be supported. In fact it seems to be admitted on both sides and by the course below that the award was an irregular one. His second method of computation would seem to approximate nearer to legal principles, but even that method was clearly vicious, because it was attended by a process of averages, giving to the evidence of each witness on each side the same value, adding up the amounts respectively sworn to by them all and arriving at the amount by dividing the total by the number of the witnesses. I cannot conceive how any award come to by any such process can be supported. The award therefore was necessarily set aside, and it thereupon became the duty of the court herein the appeal under section 161, sub sec. 2, of the Railway Act to decide the amount of damages upon the evidence taken before the arbitrators as in the case of original jurisdiction. Now, I entirely agree with what the learned Mr. Justice Ouimet in the Court of Queen's Bench says in regard to the respect which is to be paid to the award under the Railway Act following as he does what had been previously laid down in the case Mussen v. The Ganada Atlantic Railway Company before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ([12]) but it appears to me that the defects in this award are infinitely more gross than in any of the cases to which our attention has been drawn. The Superior Court having properly, in my view, set aside the award were called upon under the statute to properly perform the duties which the arbitrators had most signally failed to perform, and to decide from the evidence taken before the arbitrators what in their judgment was fair and right. That court has performed its duty in my view most liberally for the claimant, and its findings should not I think have been interfered with by the appellate tribunal.\nI am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nKING J. concurred in the opinion expressed by His Lordship Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I do not feel disposed to interfere with the award of the arbitrators No charge of partiality, dishonesty or misconduct is made against them or either of them. Their proceedings are regular. The arbitrator, Resther, perhaps, proceeded upon an erroneous principle of valuation when he arrived at his conclusion, although I am not prepared to say so; he took the average of the figures sworn to by all the witnesses, pro and con; but this proceeding cannot be fatal to the award, if not clearly against the evidence. In the first place, I do not consider that the evidence shows that that conclusion was clearly wrong. In the second place the arbitrators visited the premises and as they were experts, they might have acquired and undoubtedly did acquire, the knowledge of certain material facts which are not before us and which permitted them to control the figures of the witnesses and decide that their average would be a fair indemnity to the proprietor, and for that reason the award of the arbitrators should have more force than the verdict of a jury. In Venning v. Steadman ([13]) this court held that it would not set aside a verdict and grant a new trial upon the ground of excessive damages except when the damages assessed are \"unreasonably large\" or \"clearly too large.\" According to the rule laid down also by this court in several cases, the appellate courts should not interfere with the award of arbitrators, unless the sum awarded is so grossly and scandalously exaggerated as to shock one's sense of justice. The fact that it has received the unanimous sanction of five judges sitting in appeal in high authority that this is not one of those cases; and as I appreciate the evidence, I entirely agree with them. There is evidence that the conclusion arrived at by the majority of the arbitrators was not clearly wrong a result which is fully demonstrated in the elaborate review of the facts made by Mr. Justice Ouimet. I am therefore of opinion that the case should not be referred to a new board of arbitrators, but that the award appealed from should be maintained. See Benning et at. v. The Atlantic and North- West Railway Company ([14]); The Queen v. Charland ([15]); The Queen v. Paradis and The Queen v. Beaulieu ([16]); Lemoine v. The Mayor etc. of the City of Montreal ([17]) and authorities therein quoted by Mr. Justice Taschereau. See also Oldfield v. Price ([18]); Russell. 7th ed. 307; Rolland v. Cassidy ([19]); Re Collins and The Water Commissioners of the City of Ottawa ([20]); In re Kirkleatham Local Board and Stockton and Middlesborough Water Board ([21]).\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.

Whilst proceeding along the line of the railway, in the direction of an adjacent public highway, he was struck by a locomotive engine and killed. There was no depot or agent maintained by the company at Lucan Crossing, but a room in a small building there was used as a waiting room, passenger tickets were sold and fares charged to and from this point and, for a number of years, travellers had been allowed to make use of the permanent way in order to reach the nearest highways, there being no other passage way provided. In an action by his administrators for damages.\nHeld, Taschereau and King JJ. dissenting, that, notwithstanding the long user of the permanent way in passing to and from the highways by passengers taking and leaving the company\u2019s trains, the deceased could not, under the circumstances, be said to have been there by the invitation or license of the company at the time he was killed and that the action would not lie.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] which had reversed the judgment of the trial court, (Meredith C.J.,) dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 action with costs. On the 8th of February, 1895, one William McKenzie purchased from the railway company a return-ticket from the Village of Ailsa Craig, a station on the main line of the Grand Trunk Railway, to the City of London. He was carried safely to London, and when at that station, just before commencing the journey home to Ailsa Craig, was informed and warned by the defendant that he would not be able to reach Ailsa Craig that night, as the passenger trains on the main line had been cancelled on account of an extraordinary blizzard and snowstorm, then prevailing, having caused a blockade on the line. He, nevertheless, journeyed as far as Lucan Crossing, a station on the line of the railway, about three miles from Ailsa Craig, where the train became blocked by the storm and he there left the train and proceeded in the face of the storm to walk along the line of the railway towards the public road leading to Ailsa Craig, although warned as to the danger in doing so, and whilst walking along the road-bed between the railway tracks he was struck and killed by the engine of a freight train.\nLucan Crossing is a point where the main line of the Grand Trunk Railway crosses a line of railway, from London to Wingham by an overhead crossing, which railway, (from London to Wingham) was originally a line of an independent company, but had become part of the Grand Trunk system about ten years prior to the accident. There are platforms along each of the railway lines, and a stairway connecting them, for the convenience of passengers transferring from trains on one railway to connecting trains on the other, but no depot or station-building is maintained there, although passengers were allowed to await the arrival of trains in a room in the company\u2019s \u201csection-house.\u201d The lines of railway are both fenced in and there is no entrance to or exit from this crossing point to any public highway, the nearest public road being a distance of twenty-five and one-third rods to the eastward, and there being also another highway to the westward, distant about one mile and forty-six rods, all the lands at the crossing being those taken and used by the defendant for the railway lines, thirty-three yards in width. The company had no agent at the crossing but tickets were sold to and from the crossing and conductors were in the habit of collecting fares in cash from residents in that vicinity travelling on these railways and these people climbed over the fences or came through the gates at their farm-crossings and passed along the line of the railway, in taking or leaving the company\u2019s trains at the crossing. This use of the permanent way had continued for a number of years, prior to the accident.\nThe action was brought, under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, by the administrator and administratrix of deceased, and it was agreed at the trial that if there was any evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant towards the deceased which would entitle the plaintiffs to have the case submitted to the jury, judgment should be entered for the plaintiffs for $3,000. His Lordship Chief Justice Meredith who tried the case, dismissed the action. The plaintiff thereupon appealed to the Divisional Court which allowed the appeal, directed that the judgment entered at the trial should be vacated and set aside and that $3,000 be paid into court to be apportioned among the widow and children of the deceased. From this judgment the defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario where the decision of the Divisional Court was affirmed.\nIt is from this judgment that the present appeal is taken.\nOsler Q.C. for the appellant. The question is whether the proximate cause of the accident was the negligence of the deceased, or such negligence on the part of the company as would entitle the plaintiffs to have the case submitted to the jury. The first inquiry must be whether the deceased was on the line of the railway at the time of his death by the invitation, express or implied, of the company. There is no such evidence, and the deceased was not lawfully there for the following reasons:\u2014The ticket sold to the deceased entitled him to travel only from London to Ailsa Craig, and though such a ticket might entitle him to leave the train at any regular station of the company and proceed to the highway at the company\u2019s risk, it did not permit him to leave the train at any intermediate point at which the train might happen to stop and attempt to reach the highway unless he did so at his own risk. Lucan Crossing is not a \u201cregular\u201d station as understood in Parsons v. The New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company[3]. It is a station only to such an extent as is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of section 240 of \u201cThe Railway Act\u201d to afford facilities for receiving and forwarding traffic arising from another railway, and though the railways at present belong to the same system, yet, at the time the crossing was built, the Wingham Branch was an independent line, and the crossing still falls within that section. The station was not placed there by the company for the purpose of receiving passengers, but only for the convenience of those changing from one line to the other; nor was there any ticket or telegraph office established there. The fact that the company sold tickets to this crossing from regular stations does not, under the circumstances, make the crossing a \u201cregular\u201d station. See Land v. Wilmington and Weldon Railroad Company[4]. The deceased could not claim the right to use the road-bed as a way of necessity since he was warned in London that he would not be able to proceed further than Lucan Crossing and should, therefore, have left the train at the nearest regular station, but, having chosen to travel to Lucan Crossing, his attempt to reach the highway was made at his own risk.\nThe present case is not on a par with the case of an accident between two stations, for in the latter case the person could not be expected to foresee the accident which would detain him between the two stations, whereas in the present case he was specially warned. In any event if the deceased under the circumstances was entitled to leave the train at the crossing and proceed towards the highway he had no right to use for such purpose, except at his own risk, any part of the railway line which was dangerous by reason of the passing trains, but merely to use for that purpose that part not immediately occupied by tracks, specially as the danger on the track was greatly increased at the time by reason of the storm then raging. The trespassing that may have occurred from time to time on the part of people who wished to board the train at Lucan Crossing instead of proceeding to the nearest regular station did not give any license to the public to use the road-bed, and in any event could not apply to a person ticketed to another station; Central Rail-road of Georgia v. Brinson[5]; Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company v. State of Maryland[6]. Even if the company had acquiesced in the use of the track for pedestrian purposes merely by not objecting to such use this would not be sufficient to prove a license to so use it; Carrington v. Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company[7] at pages 544 and 546. And further, had there been such a license to use, the licensee in the user assumes all risk and there is no implied guarantee that the traffic of the road should not proceed in the ordinary way; Jones v. Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada[8]; Richards v. Chicago, St. Paul and Kansas City Railroad Company[9]. No custom such as is claimed can be established in the face of section 273 of \u201cThe Railway Act\u201d[10].\nAylesworth Q.C. and McEvoy for the respondents. No means of ingress to or egress from the Lucan Crossing Station had then been provided by the defendant company, and passengers set down at that station, or taking trains there, had for many years been, with the knowledge of the company\u2019s officers and servants and without any objection, permitted to use, and had used, the line of track and road-bed of the railway as means of getting to the nearest highways east or west of the station.\nThe company having established a station for passengers at Lucan Crossing, were bound to furnish a safe and reasonable means of ingress to and egress from the same. A waiting-room for passengers is provided in a building at the station, furnished with a stove and benches; the station has the usual platform and other accessories; tickets are sold to and from the station itself on the trains and at all other stations exactly as for any ordinary station upon the railway. The evidence shows that, especially on market days, there is a very considerable passenger traffic to and from the station in question, and that regular passenger trains both on the branch line and on the main line are timed to stop there. Upon these facts it was negligence on the part of the company to furnish no means of access whatever to the station in question, and to compel passengers to walk along the tracks of the railway in going to or departing from the station. When damage has resulted, in direct consequence of such negligence, it is actionable negligence. Oldright v. Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada[11]; Patterson, Railway Accident Law, secs. 251-254. Passengers were justified in using the road-bed as the only passage-way held out by the carrier as a means of entrance and exit to and from the public highways. Collins v. Toledo etc., Railroad Company[12].\nThe evidence is clear that from the time the train emerged from the cutting, fifteen rods from the highway, until it had crossed the highway and struck McKenzie, the whistle was not sounded nor the bell of the engine rung, a clear infraction of section 256 of \u201cThe Railway Act\u201d[13]. McKenzie had no warning of the train behind him when it was at a considerable less distance from him than that which the statute fixes as the limit for the first warning to be given as an engine is approaching a highway crossing. This is alone a sufficient circumstance of negligence to support this action. The liability for damages sustained by reason of any such neglect on the part of the company\u2019s servants is not limited to travelers upon the highway. The statute (sec. 256), declares that in the case of such neglect the company shall be liable for all damages \u201csustained by any person\u201d by reason of such neglect. It was incumbent upon the defendant to exercise special care and observe special precautions in the running of trains past the station in question. The company had full knowledge that for many years it had been customary for passengers to walk along the main line of the track east and west of the cross- ing, using the road-bed as the only means of reaching or leaving the station. The train on which deceased travelled was a regular train, stopping at this station at the same hour every afternoon, and usually carrying several passengers to or from this station. The regular west\u2011bound passenger train on the main line is timed to stop at this station to make close connection with the train on which deceased travelled. Sometimes main line freight trains stop at this station to take up passengers. On this particular day, although on account of the storm, there were no passenger trains running on the main line, it was none the less incumbent on those in charge of the freight train to observe even more than ordinary precautions in passing over this portion of the main line track. Wherever a particular point on a line of railway has been used for purposes of travel by pedestrians, with the permission of the company, such circumstances enhance the duty of servants of the company to exercise caution and prudence in the operation of the road at that place. Illinois Central Railroad Company v. Hammer[14]; Murphy v. Chicago etc. Railroad Company[15]; Harty v. Central Railroad Company of New Jersey[16]; Kansas Pacific Railway Company v. Pointer[17]; Kay v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company[18]; Pennsylvania Railroad Company v. Lewis[19]; Daley v. Norwich and Worcester Railroad Company[20]. In Byrne v. The New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company[21], it was held that where the public for a long period of time had been in the habit of crossing a railroad at a point not in a travelled public highway with the acquiescence of the railroad corporation, this acquiescence amounted to a license and imposed a duty upon the corporation, as to all persons so crossing, to exercise reasonable care in the running of its trains so as to protect them from injury. Where a railway company permits persons to cross its lines or premises it is bound to exercise care, and it cannot treat them as trespassers. Murphy v. Boston and Albany Railroad Company[22]; Barry v. New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company[23]; Barrett v. Midland Railway Company[24]. See also Gallagher v. Humphrey[25]; Thomson v. North British Railway Company[26]; Wright v. Midland Railway Company[27]; Brown v. Great Western Railway Company[28]. The defendants allowed deceased so to use their track, if they did not compel him to do so. He was there with their license at all events, and they had a duty imposed upon them to take care of him; they must be taken to have held out to their passenger a guarantee that he might use it with safety. See Rogers v. Rhymney Railway Company[29], and The Dublin Wicklow and Wexford Railway Company v. Slattery[30], especially the opinion of Earl Selborne in the latter case at pages 1187 and 1188. See also the subsequent decisions of the Court of Appeal in England in Crowther v. Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company[31]; and in Coburn v. Great Northern Railway Company[32]. At the trial the learned judge seemed to consider that the deceased by alighting at Lucan Crossing station before arriving at the terminus of his journey, and by leaving such station on foot, lost his character of passenger with the company. This view is erroneous. We contend that until the deceased reached a highway he was entitled, as against the defendants, to all the rights of a passenger. See Parsons v. New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company[33].\nTASCHEREAU J. (dissenting).\u2014I am not disposed in this case to interfere with the unanimous judgments of the Divisional Court and of the Court of Appeal.\nThe case is not free from doubt, but the appellants have failed to convince me that there is error in the conclusion arrived at in favour of the plaintiffs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I agree that the appeal should be allowed for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the judgment of the trial judge was right and that there should be judgment in this case for the defendant. It must be admitted for the purposes of this case that the provision of the Railway Act, section 256, relating to the sounding of the whistle and the ringing of the bell was not complied with, and that all persons rightfully upon the railway track as well as upon the highway crossing next to the coming train are entitled to the advantage of this provision, and the sole question to be determined in this case is whether or not the deceased Mackenzie at the time he was killed was lawfully walking upon the railway track. In other words whether he was a trespasser or a licensee or invitee of the defendant company. I have not been able to find in the record sufficient evidence to justify the findings that he was lawfully there. In the first place the Railway Act, section 273, makes it a criminal offence for any one, not having special right, to walk upon the railway track. And in the second place the area of the track is completely surrounded and guarded on each side by a fence and where the highways cross by cattle guards, so that not only no carriage can go upon or near the platform at Lucan Crossing but no foot passenger can do so without leaping over the fence or walking on the rails themselves.\nNow the statute and these means of protection were a warning to all the world against trespassing or entering upon the roadbed. What evidence is there to shew that the deceased was on the railway track by the invitation of the company? The two highway crossings, as I understand the evidence, are one mile seventy-one and one-third rods apart. It was proved that farmers owning lands between these two crossings instead of going by the ordinary highway to the stations eastward and westward occasionally either went over the railway fences or through the gates at the farm crossings on to the railway lands along the track to the platform at the railway crossing. It was proved too that tickets were sold from various points to this crossing and that conductors were in the habit of receiving payment of fares to this point. The deceased was not one of these farmers, nor did he live in the vicinity of the crossing but at a station close to his own home more than three miles away. This I think is all the evidence tending to shew that he was rightfully where he was when he met his death.\nNow this does not strike me as evidence proving licence or invitation by the railway company. Whatever the custom may be in England, and however carefully railway companies there may guard their tracks from being trespassed upon, it is a matter of common knowledge that, notwithstanding the criminal provisions of the Railway Act, people in this country living near to a railway do almost uni- versally walk upon the railway track, if it suits their convenience, getting at it by such means as they can, not dreaming that they are there upon the invitation of the company, but conscious all the while that they are there at their own risk and peril. The mere fact that in this country railway companies do not have officials at all points upon their line to warn off trespassers, and are not at all times alert to bring criminal prosecutions against trespassers, is no evidence of assent on their part to the violation of the law. When they surround the railway track with all the safeguards and means of protection which the statute demands, they in my view have done all that they are required to do. Nor is it any evidence that people are invited to use the railway track because of the platform at Lucan Crossing. It is admitted and there is no question as to the limited purpose of that platform, namely, for the convenience of passengers getting on or off the train at that point to use either line which crosses there. Nor is the fact that conductors were in the habit of taking pay from persons boarding the train there any evidence of invitation. Conductors would have the right to presume that they came there lawfully by means of the railway crossing. Even assuming that the class of individuals who were in the habit of getting to the platform by jumping over the fences were there by invitation of the company and were not liable as trespassers, how could the deceased take advantage of a privilege which had never been extended to him, but was confined to a class to which he did not belong? No doubt, if the public generally are in the habit of crossing a railway track at any well known particular, specified spot for their own convenience in cases such as appear in Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Company v. Slattery[34], and that in the very face of the company\u2019s officials, that would be evidence of assent and a judgment based on it might be supported. But here in the present case there is no evidence that even the usage of the farmers which is proved in the evidence, was ever brought to the knowledge of any officer of the company having authority to give a right of passage or other privilege to any portion of the public. There was no agent of the company at Lucan Crossing; no one there empowered in any way to make contracts for the company. The conductors to whom the farmers paid the fares were not supposed to know how they came to Lucan Crossing, whether by train or otherwise, and even if they did they had no authority to bind the company. In the judgment, the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, in the Divisional Court[35], argues that inasmuch as the deceased rightfully got off the train at Lucan Crossing, and inasmuch as there was no public way from the crossing to any highway in the vicinity he had a right by necessity to walk upon the company\u2019s track in order to reach a highway. But although he doubtless had a right during the progress of his journey to alight upon the platform yet the contract between him and the company was to carry him on to Ailsa Craig, and before he started on his journey he knew that it was impossible for him to make connection that night.\nNow I am of opinion that the evidence does not support the allegation that he was an invitee of the company, and not being an invitee his representatives cannot claim the protection which the statute would otherwise have given him. In my view the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored, the whole with costs. KING J.\u2014I think the judgment in the court below free from error, and that this appeal should be dismissed.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John Bell.\nSolicitors for the respondents: McEvoy, Wilson & Pope.\n[1] 24 Ont.

The Sun Life Insurance Company (17 Can. S.C.R. 394) followed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, second division, affirming the judgment of Falconbridge J. in the High Court of Justice, which dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 action with costs.\nThe Provincial Provident Institution, the respondent, was incorporated in 1884 by a declaration under the Ontario Benevolent Societies Act, (R.S.O. 1877, c. 167,) and in 1886 was registered under section 38 of the Insurance Act of Canada, (R.S.C. c. 124,) to transact with its members the business of life insurance on the co-operative or assessment plan.\nOn the 21st June, 1894, Maria Jordan made a proposal in writing to the respondent for an insurance upon her own life to the amount of $2,000, and thereby agreed that the proposal should form part of the contract and to undergo a medical examination, and that the examination paper should also form a part of the contract.\nOn the next day the applicant paid her entrance fee to the local agent of the respondent and submitted herself to the respondent\u2019s local medical examiner, and completed her proposal for insurance by subscribing her name, (in the presence of the examiner,) to the answers to the questions contained in her application for membership, and also to the medical examination paper and to the agreements and warranties therein set forth.\nIn a memorandum prefixed to the medical examination paper the examining physician is directed to obtain \u201ca decisive answer to each question,\u201d and at the end of the medical examination paper the examining physician certifies as follows: \u201cI have carefully asked all the questions on the first page, and noted the applicant\u2019s replies.\u201d The declaration and warranty contained in the medical examination paper and application for membership, are in the words follow- ing: \u201cI hereby declare that I have given true answers to all questions put to me by the medical examiner, and that I am the person above described. And\u201d * * \u201cit is hereby covenanted, declared and agreed that all the agreements, covenants, statements and answers contained in my application and this medical examination for membership, shall together be the basis and form part of the contract between me and the Provincial Provident Institution, which statements and answers are hereby warranted to be complete and true, and any certificate which may be issued upon my application and this medical examination by said Institution shall be accepted upon the express condition that if any of the statements or answers herein are materially untrue, or if any violation of any covenant, condition or restriction of the said certificate shall occur, then the said certificate shall be null and void.\u201d\nThe proposal and medical examination papers so completed were forwarded to the respondent, and on the 28th June, 1894, the certificate or policy of the respondent for an insurance of $2,000 was issued to the applicant, setting forth that the respondent, \u201cin consideration of the representations, agreements and warranties made to and with said Institution in the application and medical examination herefor, both of which are part of this contract, and the payment of,\u201d etc. * * * \u201cdoth issue this certificate to Maria Jordan.\u201d * * * \u201cwith the following agreements\u201d: \u201cThat upon the death of said member while this certificate is in force, she and the beneficiaries herein named having conformed to all the conditions hereto and hereon endorsed, and also to the by-laws of the Institution from time to time in force,\u201d there should be payable, within ninety days after proofs of death, to the beneficiaries, $2,000. Upon this policy or certificate was printed verbatim the declaration and warranty contained in the applicant\u2019s proposal for the policy and in the medical examination paper.\nThe second of the conditions indorsed on the policy was in the words following: \u201c2. The member having subscribed the application and medical examination papers furnished by the Institution, each of which is a part of the contract between him and the Institution, the withholding or non-communication of information or any fraudulent or misleading statements of a fact material to the contract in the application or medical examination shall render this certificate null and void.\u2019\u2019\nOn the 12th July, 1894, within two weeks after the policy issued the applicant in pursuance of the advice of a physician whom she had consulted professionally on the 1st, 4th and 11th days of June, 1894, underwent an operation for cancer of the uterus which while it could not cure her disease was advised by the surgeon in the hope of ameliorating her condition. The application and examination paper made no mention of the disease and it appeared that the insured made her answers in good faith and without any knowledge that she was affected with the disease.\nIn March, 1895, the respondent became aware for the first time of the misrepresentations made in the proposal for insurance and in her answers to the questions in the medical examination paper, and on the 14th of that month, gave written notice to the applicant that the policy was cancelled on account of untruthful representations, and returned the total amount paid by her to the respondent but she, through her solicitors, refused to consider the policy at an end.\nOn the 18th of April, 1895, the applicant died, the cause of her death being cancer of the uterus, and on the 10th of October, 1895, proofs of death were presented to the respondent on behalf the beneficiaries, who on the 14th January, 1896, brought action against the respondent to recover on the policy.\nAt the trial, before Falconbridge J., and a jury, certain questions were submitted to the jury, and by their answers to such questions the jury found that the applicant\u2019s answers to thirteen of the questions submitted to her in the proposal for insurance were untrue, that these thirteen questions and answers were all material to the contract, but that the applicant did not wilfully or fraudulently give the false answers or conceal any fact known to her which she should reasonably have considered material for the defendant to have been made aware of, and that she had no intention to mislead or prevent the defendant from knowing her condition if she failed to mention her visits to physicians for medical advice prior to her application.\nUpon these findings judgment was rendered dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs. On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario this judgment was affirmed by the unanimous decision of the second division of that court from which the present appeal was taken by the plaintiffs.\nReeve Q.C. and Day for the appellants. If the statements alleged to have been made by the deceased in her examination upon effecting the insurance form part of the contract and are warranties, then the appellants cannot succeed; if, however, these statements are not warranties, and have been made in good faith, and there is absence of all fraud, then they are entitled to succeed. The medical examination cannot be construed as and does not form part of the contract, nor are the statements therein warranties, by reason of the fact that the defendant has failed to comply with the statutory provisions in not having them set out or made to appear on the face or back of the policy, and in not having accurately and fully set out conditions and provisions relating thereto, and of which they form a part. R.S.C. ch. 124, secs. 27, 28; 52 Vict. ch. 32, (Ont.) secs. 4, 5; 55 Vict. ch. 39, (Ont.) sec. 33, s.s. 1, 2, 3; 58 Vict. ch. 34, (Ont.) sec. 5, s.s. 10[1]. The jury found that the applicant\u2019s answers to the following two questions were untrue:\n\u201c33. Have you had any serious illness or injury?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201c90. Have you ever had a miscarriage; if so, how often and how recently?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d\nThe illness referred to was a cold contracted after childbirth some twenty odd years before. It could not for a moment be suggested that the woman had any possible object in answering these questions untruthfully; the idea would be altogether foreign to her mind that an illness resulting from a cold contrected under the circumstances stated would in any way affect her application for insurance; the same may be said as regards her answers to the other question\u2014a miscarriage which had occurred many years before. It is evident that the answers given under such circumstances must have been the result of some misunderstanding, forgetfulness or mistake, or that some mistake occurred in recording the answers. Every reasonable protection should be afforded against the grave results of mistakes made in good faith, and of a strict construction of and compliance with any provisions which has that object in view.\nThe warranty, provisos and agreements contained in the contract are confined to material statements; the statements warranted are all statements and answers in the application and medical examination, and the proviso and agreement is, that if any of the statements or answers are materially untrue, then the certificate shall be null and void. The result of noncompliance with the legislative provision is that the statements and answers of the insured cannot be construed or relied on as warranties, nor is the contract of insurance liable to be defeated by merely proving their untruth, but the contract must be construed as freed from and unaffected by any stipulation, warranty or proviso modifying or impairing its effect. See 55 V. ch. 39, sec. 33, s.s. 1 (Ont.) The other printed conditions on the back of the policy in so far as they relate to the statements and answers of the insured, are open to the same objection that the Act has not been complied with by reason of their not being set out in full. They all are conditions of a like character and dealing with the same subject and consequently the contract must be either free from all conditions which deal with a like and common subject matter, or subject to all such conditions in their entirety. A contract cannot be construed in the light of and as subject to only a part of a number of conditions, all of which deal with and are applicable to the same subject matter, and subject to the whole of which it was intended the contract should be made. Village of London West v. London Guarantee and Accident Company[2]; Moore v. Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company[3]; The Life Association of Scotland v. Foster[4] per Lord Deas. See also Anderson v. Fitzgerald[5]; Thomson v. Weems et al.[6] at pages 683 and 689; Wheelton v. Hardisty[7] at page 273; Gravel v. L\u2019Union St. Thomas[8]; Twycross v. Grant[9] at pages 530-531. This case is clearly distinguished from the case of Fitzrandolph v. The Mutual Relief Society of Nova Scotia[10]. Osler Q.C. and McMurchy for the respondent. The question of materiality is a question of fact for the jury; 55 Vic. c. 39, Ont., sec. 33, sub-sec. 3; Bunyon, Life Insurance (3 ed.) 46; Porter, Insurance, (2 ed.) 152; May, Insurance, (3 ed.) sec. 195. We make special reference to the words of Sir William Ritchie, C.J., in FitzRandolph v. The Mutual Relief Society of Nova Scotia[11] at page 336. Untrue statements, omissions or suppressions in the application and answers should avoid a policy. The application and policy must be construed together and together form the contract, and the truth of the representations and answers becomes a condition precedent to liability. See also Boyce v. The Ph\u0153nix Mutual Life Insurance Company[12] per Ritchie C.J. at page 728; Fowkes v. The Manchester and London Life Assurance Association[13]; Anderson v. Fitzgerald[14] at page 504; Dalglish v. Jarvie[15] at page 243; London Assurance v. Mansel[16]; Newcastle Fire Insurance Company v. Macmorran & Co.[17]; Weems et al. v. Standard Life Assurance Company[18].\nThe like result follows in favour of the respondent, whether we consider the findings of the jury as establishing that the applicant made false representations material to the contract, or that there was a breach of warranty. If there has been misrepresentation it will avoid the policy if a statement of a material fact contained in the declaration is untrue, even though not to the knowledge of the assured; Porter, Insurance, (2 ed.) page 140; Macdonald v. Law Union Fire and Life Insurance Company[19]; Bunyon, Life Insurance, p. 41; Cooke, Life Insurance, p. 35; Duckett v. Williams[20]. This rule is equally applicable to warranties and to material representations; Benham v. United Guarantie and Life Assurance Company[21]. The proper question is whether any particular circumstance was in fact material and not whether the party believed it to be so; London Guarantee Company v. Fearnley[22], at page 916; Hambrough v. Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York[23]. The company must be protected against untruthful representations whether or not these representations are untrue to the knowledge of the party effecting the insurance. The policy is vitiated if the representation made as preliminary to the contract was not in fact true. In this case the fact was, that on three occasions shortly prior to her proposal for insurance the applicant consulted a Dr. Nevitt, who made a uterine examination and informed her that there was \u201csome uterine trouble which it would be well to attend to\u201d; but the only information she gave the company was that another physician had attended her nineteen years previously in child-birth.\nAll insurance officers are entitled to the opportunity of consulting with the medical man who has been last in attendance on the assured, Morrison v. Muspratt et al.[24] And where the reference was made to a person who had been the ordinary adviser, but no mention was made of the person attending at the time of the insurance, the policy was vacated; Everett v. Desborough[25]; Huckmen v. Fernie[26]. See also Joyce, Insurance, sec. 2070, referring to Cazenove v. British Equitable Assurance Company[27]. Where there was a question in the application \u201cBy what physician were you last attended?\u201d the applicant was held to have been attended by a physician, within the meaning of that question, where it appeared that he had called upon a physician and submitted to an examination by him and had subsequently called upon the same physician and consulted him professionally, White v. Provident Savings Life Assurance Society[28].\nThe policy in question is expressed to be made \u201cin \u201cconsideration of the representations, agreements and \u201cwarranties made to and with said Institution in the \u201capplication and medical examination made herefor, \u201cboth of which are a part of this contract,\u201d thus incorporating the proposal as part of the contract. Venner v. Sun Life Insurance Company[29]. This is sufficient compliance with section 27 of the Insurance Act of Canada, inasmuch as the policy referred in express terms to the representations, agreements and warranties contained in the application. The question having arisen whether the provision of the Ontario statute (55 Vict. ch. 39) required anything more than such a distinct reference to the proposal, the Legislature by 58 Vict. c. 34, sec. 5, subsection 10, added a declaratory clause to subsection 1 of section 33 of that Act to the effect that nothing herein contained should exclude the proposal or application of the assured from being considered with the contract, and that the court should determine how far the insurer was induced to enter into the contract by any material misrepresentation contained in the application or proposal.\nBy rescinding the policy, during the lifetime of the applicant, immediately upon becoming aware of the untrue representations, and at the same time returning to the applicant the total amount of premium paid by her, the respondents placed themselves in a strong equitable position within the intent of Fenn v. Craig[30] We also refer to the decisions in Confederation Life Association v. Miller[31]; Mason v. Agricultural Assur. Assoc.[32]; Mahon v. Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company[33]; Gardner v. Lucas[34] at page 603.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014We have been unable to find any error in the judgment appealed from. We consider that the Ontario Insurance Act of 1892, section 33, subsection 1, was complied with in the present case, following, as we do, the decision in the case of Venner v. The Sun Life Insurance Company[35].\nAs to the objection, relied upon by the appellants, that the insurance company failed to comply with the requirements of subsection two of section thirty-three, just mentioned, we are of opinion that that section must be read with and qualified by the following subsection, which shows that it is for the jury to determine whether or not a misrepresentation made in an application for insurance is material. If they find such misrepresentation immaterial, these clauses save the policy although it would otherwise have been vitated. In other words, notwithstanding any convention between the parties to an insurance policy upon the effect of misrepresentation, only that species of misrepresentation will void the policy which may subsequently be judicially found to be material and would have affected the basis of the contract.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Reeve & Day.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McDougall & Robertson.\n[1] At page 196 of Statutes.\n[2] 26 O.R. 520.\n[3] 6 Can.

The special circumstances under which the controversy arose are as follows:\u2014\nThe defendant, an old lady, who resided with her son-in-law, J. F. Forgan, in Chicago, Ill., was owner of twenty-six lots of land in Halifax, N.S., of which ten were known as the \"swamp lots,\" the adjoining sixteen lots being high and dry. She placed the property in the hands of a real estate agent in Halifax to be sold and after some correspondence on the subject between the agent and Forgan, who usually attended to the defendant's business affairs for her, the agent telegraphed Forgan that he had been offered $1,000 for the lots mentioned in a letter referred to. Forgan understood that the lots referred to were the swamp lots only and upon informing the defendant that the offer was for these lots he obtained her consent to send a telegraph to the agent at Halifax directing him to accept the offer. The offer actually applied to the whole of the lots and on receipt of this telegram the agent made a contract with the proposed purchaser for the sale of the twenty-six lots at the price offered by accepting a deposit on account of the price and granting a receipt in writing therefor. This is the contract upon which the action was based.\nThe case was tried before Mr. Justice Henry without a jury and His Lordship found that the defendant's agent, Forgan, had no authority to bind her in respect of sixteen of the lots which are the subject matter in dispute; that there was not sufficient evidence that she held him out as her agent to bind her in respect to these lots; that the plaintiff had not shown that she delegated Forgan to send the telegram in answer to plaintiff's offer to purchase certain lots in Halifax, relied upon by him, so as to bind her in respect to the lots in question; that in communicating this offer to defendant, Forgan told her that the offer was for ten swamp lots only, and that he was authorized by her to sell these ten lots only, and therefore judgment was ordered to be entered for the defendant with costs. On appeal to the full court this judgment was reversed and it was ordered that judgment should be entered for the plaintiff against the defendant for damages to be assessed before the trial judge. The defendant now appeals against this decision of the full court.\nNewcombe Q. C. for the appellant. Whether or not Forgan had the requisite authority to bind defendant is a matter of fact upon which the finding of the trial judge should be upheld. Defendant never authorized Forgan to sell anything but the ten swamp lots and Forgan also understood that that was what he was selling; he erroneously supposed at the time that the sixteen lots on Acadia and Brussels Streets were the swamp lots which were to be sold. Plaintiff intended to buy twenty-six lots, worth not less than $3,000; he was on the spot and familiar with the ground; he saw all the correspondence and must have known from Forgan's letter referring to the offer of \"one thousand dollars for the swamp lots,\" and his subsequent enumeration of the lots as only eighteen in all, that Forgan was under a complete misapprehension as to what he was selling. The absurd inadequacy of the price to the value must have told him the same thing. The particularity with which plaintiff wrote twenty-six lots into the receipt which he took shews that he knew there had been a mistake, and that he snapped at it\u2014an exactly similar case to Webster v. Cecil[1], to which James L.J. refers in Tamplin v. James[2] at page 221. We also rely upon Garrard v. Frankel[3]. A contract entered into by mistake by one party cannot be enforced against him by the other if the latter is aware of the mistake and seeks to take advantage of it; Hamer v. Sharp[4]; Wilde v. Watson[5]; Prior v. Moore[6]. See also Leake on Contracts, pp 511, 512, and cases there cited, particularly Collen v. Wright[7]; Richardson v. Williamson[8]; Cherry and McDougall v. Colonial Bank of Aastralasia[9]. We contend that the memorandum in writing is insufficient under the statute of frauds; Williams v. Jordan[10]; Agnew, Statute of Frauds, p. 258.\nBorden Q.C. for the respondent. The statute of frauds cannot be relied upon by the appellant, as it has not been pleaded; Filby v. Hounsell[11], and cases there cited; Commins v. Scott[12], at page 16. The memorandum is sufficient. The land, the parties and the price are all distinctly expressed, and an agent for signing a memorandum of sale of lands may be appointed without writing; Agnew, Statute of Frauds, 287; Story, Agency, secs. 73, 126, 127, and note to Brown, Statute of Frauds (5th ed.), sec. 370; Beaufort v. Neeld[13] at pages 273-274 and 290; Commercial Bank of Canada v. Merritt[14], at pages 358, 363, 364.\nThe defendant authorized the telegrams which directed the acceptance of the offer of one thousand dollars for the twenty-six lots and all the business of the defendant with reference to these lots had been transacted by her for some seven years through Forgan, who was her son-in-law. All the correspondence was carried on by Forgan. In May, 1894, he gave directions as to the sale of two of these lots and the agreement was carried out by the defendant. When inquiries were made of Forgan as to the price which the defendant would accept for the remaining twenty-six lots he submitted the letter to her, read it to her, and obtained her authority to fix a price, and did fix a price for these lots. There could be no misapprehension in the mind of any reasonable person. Then on receipt of the telegrams offering $1,000 for the twenty-six lots mentioned in the letter of inquiry, the telegrams were communicated to the defendant and both replies by telegraph were sent after communication with her and by her authority. The law judges of an agreement exclusively from the mutual communications which have taken place and the defendant is bound, in the absence of fraud or warranty, by his acceptance of the proposal however clearly she may afterwards make it appear that she was laboring under a mistake. She cannot escape by merely showing that she understood the terms in a different sense from that which they bear in their grammatical construction and legal effect. If she did not take reasonable care to ascertain what she was doing she must bear the consequences. Kerr, Fraud and Mistake (2 ed.) 479; Leake on contracts (3 ed.) 265, 277; Scrivener et at. v.

The defendant, an old lady, who formerly lived at Halifax, Nova Scotia, has since 1887 been living at Chicago with her son-in-law, a Mr. Forgan, a cashier of a bank there. She was the owner of several small town lots within the limits of the city of Halifax or in the immediate vicinity. In some she was interested merely as executrix of her deceased husband's estate, and of others she was seized in her own right as her own property. In the month of May, 1894, her son-in-law communicated to her that a Mr. Naylor, a land agent in Halifax, had made to him an offer of two hundred and fifty dollars cash for two of those lots which had belonged to her husband and formed part of his estate in her hands as executrix. She authorized her son-in-law to accept this offer which he did by telegram to Mr. Naylor, and at the same time directed him to prepare a deed and to send it to Chicago for signature. Besides these two lots she had ten other similar lots which were situate on low swampy ground, and which were called and known as swamp lots. These lots also constituted part of her husband's estate, and she also herself owned sixteen other small lots situate near the swamp lots, but upon higher ground and of varying values. Upon the 7th. June, 1894, Mr. Naylor enclosed to Mr. Forgan a deed for execution by the defendant of the two lots above mentioned to a Mr. Miller, which the defendant executed, and when executed was forwarded by Mr. Forgan to a bank at Halifax, as an escrow until the two hundred and fifty dollars should be paid therefor. In a letter accompanying the deed so sent by Mr. Naylor, to Chicago for execution, he inquired of Mr. Forgan what he would take for the ten swamp lots, and the other sixteen. While depreciating the lots, he mentioned a sum which he said that he thought he could sell them for. While it is strange that Mr. Forgan should have misconceived the contents of this letter it cannot be doubted for a moment, I think, upon the evidence that he construed the letter and carried it in his mind as relating to the swamp lots only, and that he communicated it to the defendant as relating to these swamp lots only, which formed part of her husband's estate. Some correspondence then passed between Mr. Forgan and Mr. Naylor in relation to the lots of the nature of which the defendant knew nothing.\nUpon the 19th or 20th of June Mr. Forgan received a telegram from Mr. Naylor as follows:\nOrdered thousand dollars lots mentioned in my letter of the 7th instant\u2014wire.\nMr. Forgan labouring under the impression and belief, which although bon\u00e2 fide entertained by him was nevertheless erroneous, that the letter of the 7th of June related to the swamp lots only, informed the defendant of this offer as being an offer of $1,000 for the swamp lots and advised her to accept it and, both of them so understanding the offer, he replied to Mr. Naylor by telegram\naccept offer if better cannot be done\nto which Naylor replied that he did not care to take the responsibility of deciding, and Mr. Forgan having communicated this reply to the defendant she, who had never heard of any other offer than that as communicated to her by her son-in-law, namely $1,000 for the swamp lots, authorised him to accept that offer which he did thus by telegram to Mr. Naylor on the 21st June:\nAccept offer. We sail by Parisian from Montreal Saturday morning, in Quebec over Saturday night.\nMr. Naylor having received this telegram entered into the contract which is the subject of the present action in the words following: HALIFAX, 23rd June, 1894\nReceived one hundred dollars being deposit on purchase of 26 lots of the Murray lands, in Trider's field, for the sum of one thousand dollars, title guaranteed.\nJOHN NAYLOR,\nMR. THOS. K. JENKINS. Agent.\nThe defendant and her son-in-law went to England in June, 1894, shortly after Mr. Forgan's telegram to Naylor of the 21st of that month, and they did not return until October when the defendant having been called upon to execute a deed in fulfilment of Naylor's contract, Mr. Forgan discovered the mistake he had made and immediately entered into a correspondence with the plaintiff and Naylor acknowledging the mistake to be, as it in point of fact was, wholly his own and offering the plaintiff to make to him any reasonable compensation for the loss occasioned to him by his, Forgan's, mistake. The plaintiff, however, having declined to come to any arrangement which Mr. Forgan considered reasonable, and the defendant having wholly repudiated the contract as one which she had never authorised or contemplated authorising or had in fact ever heard of, the plaintiff has brought the present action in which he claims $1,500 as damages by him sustained by reason of his loss of the benefit which he expected to realize from his purchase of the lots for which he had offered $1,000, but which by his own evidence were well worth $2,700, and the sole question is\u2014whether or not the defendant is bound by the contract, the terms of which she had never heard of and which she never in point of fact authorized. The learned trial judge has found, as matter of fact, 1st: That the only offer communicated to the defendant was one of $1,000 for the swamp lots only, and that the only authority she ever gave to her son-in-law was to sell those swamp lots only, ten in number for $1,000; 2ndly: That in point of fact Mr. Forgan had no authority whatever from the defendant to bind her in respect of the sixteen lots which were the subject matter in difference; and 3rdly: That there is not sufficient ground for holding that she held him out as her agent to bind her in respect of the lots in question. That these findings of the learned trial judge are in precise accord with the evidence cannot, I think, admit of any doubt.\nAs to the third of the above findings there was no evidence whatever offered unless it was the evidence that the sale to Miller had been made through the plaintiff as Miller's agent, and that the defendant had accepted the offer in that case through her son-in-law by telegram from him to Naylor. Well, as a matter of fact, the defendant authorized her son-in-law to accept it in the precise terms in which it was communicated to her. Then certain passages of the defendant's evidence are relied upon as supporting a contention that the defendant's son-in-law had general authority from her as her agent sufficient to bind her by the contract entered into by Naylor through her son-in-law contrary to the express finding of the learned trial judge upon that point. The evidence so relied upon is to this effect\u2014the defendant said that her son-in-law was a very capable man, as cashier of a bank in Chicago he no doubt was; that she trusted in him in relation to her business; she was willing he should make any bargains he thought advisable but never gave him any authority to close a bargain without her sanction. There can be no doubt, I think, that all she meant to convey by this, and that she was so understood by the learned trial judge was\u2014that as her son-in-law she had the utmost trust and confidence in him that he would advise her judiciously, and that he took such an interest in her affairs that she would willingly let him if he was so pleased initiate bargains for her, well knowing that he could not, and from her confidence in him, that he never would attempt to, close any bargain so initiated without communicating its terms to her, and advising with her as to it, and obtaining her authority to close it. These private and confidential trusts and good understandings existing between such near relations are natural and highly commendable and to be encouraged and held sacred, and it would shake all such trusts and confidences to their foundation and instead of confidences breed dissensions in families if out of such trusts and confidences could be inferred authority conferred by the parent upon the son to bind the parent to the contract of which he or she had never approved nor had ever heard. Then again it was argued that as the defendant had not called upon her son-in-law to shew her the letters and telegrams which he received from Naylor, it should be assumed, notwithstanding the fact to the contrary proved and found by the learned trial judge, that the offer she authorised him to accept was the one in fact contained in the telegrams and letters and not the one which he had in point of fact communicated to her as being the offer. I fail to see any principle upon which such assumption could be made contrary to the actual fact as conclusively proved in evidence. The not asking to see those letters and telegrams is in perfect consistence with that trust and confidence which the defendant had in her son-in-law. In fine the judgment of the learned trial judge cannot, in my opinion, be reversed without subjecting the defendant, contrary to every principle of law, to a contract which in point of fact she had never contemplated, and the terms of which had never been communicated to her, and to make which she had never given to any person any authority whatever. SEDGEWICK J.\u2014The appellant, an old lady residing with her son-in-law, James B. Forgan, in Chicago, was the owner of twenty-six lots in the city of Halifax, sixteen in her own right and ten as executrix of her husband. The former were situated on Acadia and Brussels streets, and were upon good dry ground, while the other ten were to a greater or less extent situated in a swamp and were always known as the swamp lots. The land of which the lots are composed is an open field, and there are no streets laid out upon the ground. On the 7th of June, 1894, one John Naylor, a real estate agent in Halifax, wrote a letter to Mr. Forgan asking him what he would take for the whole twenty-six lots stating he thought he could sell the lots mentioned for about $1,300. On the 12th June, Forgan in reply stated that Mrs. Murray was very desirous of disposing of those lots, and proceeded as follows:\nIf you can sell them between now and September 1st for $1,300 or more, she will give you a commission of $100, and ten per cent on whatever you may get in excess of $1,300.\nIn writing this letter Forgan made a mistake, a most grievous mistake, as he himself says, in regard to the extent of the land referred to. He was under the impression that the letter of the 7th June, referred not to the whole of the twenty-six lots but only to what was known as the swamp lots. His evidence is conclusive upon that point. The trial judge so found, and it was stated at the argument that he was labouring under the misapprehension when he wrote the letter of the twelfth. There is no question that all the lots were worth much more than $1,300. Jenkins himself states that he expected within three months from the purchase to make a profit out of the transaction of $2,000 to $2,500, thereby admitting the land to be worth over $3,000, although in his sworn evidence he values it at $2,700, and Mrs. Murray valued it at the same figure. After the receipt of Forgan's letter, Naylor began negotiating for the plaintiff for the price of the twenty-six lots, and on the 19th of June telegraphed to Forgan as follows;\nOffered thousand dollars lots mentioned my letter 7th inst. Wire.\nOn the following day, 20th of June, he answered:\nAccept offer if better cannot be done.\nOn the same day Naylor replied:\nDo not care take responsibility, decide.\nAnd he replied:\nAccept offer.\nOn the 23rd of June Naylor made a contract for the sale of the lots with Jenkins, the contract being in these terms:\nHALIFAX, 23rd June, 1894.\nReceived $100 being deposit on purchase of twenty-six lots of the Murray lands in Trider's field, for the sum of $1,000, title guaranteed.\nJOHN NAYLOR,\nMr. THOMAS JENKINS. Agent.\nand received from him the $100 therein mentioned. The deed having been sent to Mr. Forgan for execution by the defendant he for the first time became aware of the misapprehension as to the quantity of land sold, and the deed so tendered was consequently not executed. This action was thereupon brought to recover damages for the breach of the alleged contract At the trial, the trial judge, Mr. Justice Henry, made the following findings:\nThat James B. Forgan had no authority from defendant to bind her in respect of the sixteen lots which are the subject matter of dispute in this action:\nThat there is not sufficient ground for holding that she held him out as her agent to bind her in respect to these lots:\nThat it has not been shown that she delegated him to send the answer to plaintiff's offer relied upon by plaintiff so as to bind her in respect to the lots in question:\nAs to this I find that in communicating plaintiff's offer to defendant, Forgan told her that the offer was for the ten lots spoken of as the swamp lots, and that he was authorized by her to sell these ten lots only:\nand judgment was entered for the defendants in pursuance of such findings. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia this judgment was reversed and it was referred back to the trial judge in order that the plaintiff's damages might be assessed. I am of opinion that the judgment of the trial judge should be restored, his finding being, to my mind, in perfect accord with the evidence. It is, as already stated, manifest that Forgan, in conducting the correspondence which he did, was labouring under a fundamental mistake in regard to the subject matter of the proposed contract. He never intended to offer for sale any more than the swamp lots, nor had he any authority from Mrs. Murray saving in respect to the swamp lots, and if he exceeded his authority through ignorance or negligence clearly the defendant is not to be allowed to suffer.\nThe judgment appealed from apparently proceeds upon the hypothesis that the present case is the same as if Forgan had owned the land and on his behalf had authorised Naylor to make a contract with the plaintiff\". It might not be proper to say that even upon this hypothesis whether there being a unilateral but fundamental mistake on his part he would be held bound, but I fail to see upon what principle the defendant is bound. Forgan was the old lady's agent to do only what he was instructed to do, viz.: to offer for sale the swamp lots. He knew that was the extent of his authority and if through ignorance or negligence on his part he exceeded that authority, he not being an agent held out by Mrs. Murray as such, she cannot suffer for his acts. If she is to be held to this bargain it can only be by virtue of some principle of estoppel, but there is no evidence of that in this case. The leading case of Foster v. MacKinnon[22] following Thoroughgood\u2019s Case[23] contains a luminous exposition of the law upon this point.\nIt seems plain on principle, and on authority, that if a blind man, or a man who cannot read, or who for some reason (not implying negligence) forbears to read, has a written contract falsely read over to him, the leader misreading to such a degree that the written contract is of a nature altogether different from the contract pretended to be read from the paper which the blind or illiterate man afterwards signs; then, at least if there be no negligence, the signature so obtained is of no force. And it is invalid not merely on the ground of fraud, where fraud exists, but on the ground that the mind of the signer did not accompany the signature; in other words, that he never intended to sign, and therefore in contemplation of law never did sign, the contract to which his name is appended.\nIn that case the defendant indorsed a bill upon the understanding that it was a guarantee and not a bill, and upon the trial the learned Lord Chief Justice instructed the jury that if the signature was obtained upon the fraudulent representation that it was a guarantee, and if the defendant signed it without knowing that it was a bill and under the belief that it was a guarantee, and if he was in ignorance and there was no negligence in so signing the paper, the defendant was entitled to the verdict. The Court of Common Pleas in sustaining this statement of the law says:\nIn the case now under consideration, the defendant, according to the evidence, if believed, and the finding of the jury, never intended to indorse a bill of exchange at all, but intended to sign a contract of an entirely different nature. It was not his design, and if he were guilty of no negligence it was not even his fault, that the instrument he signed turned out to be a bill of exchange. It was as if he had written his name on a sheet of paper for the purpose of franking a letter, or in a lady's album, or on an order for admission to the Temple Church, or on the fly-leaf of a book, and there had already been, without his knowledge, a bill of exchange or a promissory note payable to order inscribed on the other side of the paper. To make the case clearer, suppose the bill or note on the other side of the paper in each of these cases to be written at a time subsequent to the signature, then the fraudulent' misapplication of that genuine signature to a different purpose would have been a counterfeit alteration of a writing with intent to defraud, and would therefore have amounted to a forgery. In that case the signer would not have been bound by his signature, for two reasons, first, that he never in fact signed the writing declared on, and secondly, that he never intended to sign any such contract.\nThis case was lately followed by Lord Russell of Killowen in the recent case of Lewis v. Clay[24]. The cases of Hickman v. Berens[25], and Wilding v. Sanderson[26], are cases in which courts have refused to enforce a compromise upon the simple ground that the parties were not ad idem, one of the counsel being under a misapprehension as to the subject matter of the agreement.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nKING and GIROUARD JJ. concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Hector McInnes.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Joseph A.

The collar was fixed to the shaft with a set-screw the head of which protruded, and the condition of the whole arrangements thus made for the workmen\u2019s convenience was well known to the plaintiff who had assisted in erecting the scaffold and platform. While at work on the platform the plaintiff was ordered to place a piece of timber in position near the shaft which was then in motion and while doing so his foot was caught and crushed by the set-screw in such a manner as to make the amputation of a part of the foot necessary and render him lame for life. The plaintiff brought his action for $4,000 and the defendant, amongst other defences, pleaded that the injuries were caused by the plaintiff's own fault and carelessness, and that they could not have occurred had he used ordinary prudence in avoiding the danger of which he was well aware. The evidence was taken at enqut\u00e9te and the written depositions filed of record, but the witnesses were not heard in presence of the trial judge who rendered a verdict for the plaintiff for $1,323 with costs and this decision was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench, on appeal, Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 dissenting. In rendering his judgment in the trial court Mr. Justice Gill considered \" that the defendant was at fault in not either covering the shaft temporarily with boards, or by not disconnecting the shaft so as to stop it, or by not altogether stopping the whole machinery whilst plaintiff and the other men were required to work over or near the said shaft.\"\nChase Casgrain Q. C. and R. G. Code for the appellant. The plaintiff had been employed by the company for some time, as a general handy man, which he had represented himself to be, but he was careless and imprudent in his work upon the scaffolding at the time of the accident. It was a temporary structure eleven feet above the floor, the shaft was visible to anybody working on the scaffolding, the plaintiff himself had changed the collar to the outside of the box the day before the accident, placed the set-screw in the position where it caught his foot, and the injuries were due solely to plaintiff's own fault. There is no proof of any careless or negligent act on the part of the company and employers are not insurers of either the lives or safety of their employees. See Mercier v. Morin ([1]); Walsh v. Whiteley ([2]); Sarault v. Viau ([3]); The Montreal Rolling Mills Co. v. Corcoran ([4]); The Globe Woollen Mills Company v. Poitras ([5]); Roberts v. Dorion ([6]); Currie v. Couture ([7]); Tooke v. Bergeron ([8]); Sourdat, \"Responsibilit\u00e9,\" no. 912; 34 Dalloz Rep. vo.\" Ouvrier,\" nos. 103, 104,108 and note 1 at foot of page 2106. It was impossible to stop the shaft revolving as it was used not only to drive all the machinery in the building but also to produce air currents necessary to prevent the loss of the hog products under treatment in the factory; an inconvenience and possible loss which could only be avoided by keeping the share constantly in motion. See Smith v. Baker & Sons ([9]); Poll v. Hewitt ([10]).\nGordon and Talbot for the respondent. It is not the practice of this court to disturb findings of fact, and it should not be done in such a case as this where the findings are concurrent in the courses below; Gingras v. Desilets ([11]); Levi v. Reed ([12]); Coseette v. Dunetal ([13]).\nEven if there had been imprudence on the part of the respondent, the applicants would not thereby be relieved from their responsibility for the accident which they might have prevented by covering the shaft and set-screw as required by the Factories Act. See also 20 Laurent, no. 488.\nTASCHEREAU J. (dissenting.) \u2014 The respondent's action is based on the ground that while employed as a workman in appellant's establishment, he, on July 31st 1896, was ordered to mount a scaffolding and put in place a piece of timber near a shaft which was then in motion, and that, while so doing, through appellant's negligence in not having the shaft properly covered, the respondent's foot was caught in the machinery and the little toe of his left foot torn off necessitating amputating of a part of the foot, and rendering him lame for life. The damages are set at $4,000.\nThe appellant pleaded a general denial, and an exception in which it was alleged that the respondent had been employed by the company for some time as a general handy man; that he was generally careless and imprudent in performing his duties; that the scaffolding on which he was working at the time of the accident was a temporary structure some eleven feet from the floor; that the shaft was visible to anybody working on the scaffolding, and that if respondent was injured it was due solely to his own imprudence, negligence and fault.\nIt appears by the evidence that the accident occurred under the following circumstances:\nCertain repairs having to be made in the appellant's slaughter house and pork packing establishment, at Hull, P.Q., it became necessary for that purpose to erect a temporary scaffolding eleven feet from the floor and about seven feet from the roof. That was done by the respondent himself, with one Moore and one St. Denis. Touching one end of the scaffolding, which was fourteen feet square, was the main-shaft, and on the main-shaft, a collar to keep it from sliding; the collar was fixed to the shaft by a set-screw the head of which protruded. While working with Moore on the scaffolding and lifting a piece of timber, the respondent pushed his foot too near the end of the shaft so that it was caught by the set-screw and badly crushed.\nThe witnesses were not heard in the presence of the judge who rendered the judgment of the Superior Court condemning appellants to pay respondent $1,323, which judgment was confirmed by the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 dissenting.\nI am of opinion that there is error in these judgments and that the appeal should be allowed. There is no evidence whatever that the negligence of the company, assuming negligence to be proved, caused the accident in question, and an affirmance of the condemnation against it would unquestionably be at variance with our own jurisprudence. Tooke v. Bergeron ([14]); Burland v. Lee ([15]); Canada Paint Company v. Trainor ([16]). The trial judge does not find that the accident was caused by the company's negligence, He simply finds two facts, 1st, the accident 2ndly the negligent act of the company, without connecting the one with the other in any way whatever. It seems to be taken for granted in the courts below that because there was an accident and because there was an act of negligence, it follows that the plaintiff has proved his case. Now that is not the law. He had further to prove clearly that the accident was due to the negligent act charged, and he has not done it. The evidence might be consistent with his theory but it is equally consistent, to say the least with the theory that the accident was due to his own carelessness and it is a rule that where the evidence is as consistent with one state of facts as with another it proves neither. The negligence of the appellant did not justify respondents carelessness and imprudence, and the evidence is all one way, to use the expression of one of the witnesses that \" there was no reason for a man meeting with an accident except through his own carelessness\u2019s The accident it is true would not have happened if this shaft at that spot had been covered, but it is as clear that it would not have happened if respondent had used ordinary care and prudence. In Tooke v. Bergeron ([17]), if the machinery there in question had been protected by a board the accident would not have happened; yet, the action was dismissed because the victim's own act was the direct cause of the accident. That is a precisely similar case. Contributory negligence by the defendant is unknown in law as a ground to support a claim of this nature, where the accident would not have happened but for the claimant's own want of ordinary prudence. Volenti non fit injuria is the rule under the civil law as it is under the English law. For instance, in France where by the collision of two wagons during the night one of the two drivers has been hurt he can not on the ground that the other did not leave him half of the roadway, according to the regulations, recover damages against him, if he himself did not carry the proper lights on his waggon ([18]). And, in Louisiana it is now well settled that if the party injured might have avoided the accident by a reasonable amount of prudence, he cannot recover damages. Mercier v. New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad Company ([19]); Schwartz v. Crescent City Railroad Company ([20]); Woods v Jones el al ([21]). Here, there was no danger whatever on the platform in question for a man of ordinary prudence. It was large, well built and well lighted and respondent better than any one else, knew of the common sense care required from any one working upon it, as he himself had placed the set-screw where it was when the accident happened.\nWe ruled in Tooke v. Bergeron ([22]) that where an employee sustains injuries in a factory through coming in contact with machinery, the employer, though he may be in default from not covering that machinery as required by the statute, is not liable in damages, unless it is shown that the accident by which the injuries were caused was directly due to his neglect. I feel bound by that ruling to hold here that appellant is not liable because not only it does not appear that the accident in question was directly due to their neglect, but it, on the contrary clearly appears that but for respondent's want of prudence and ordinary care, the accident would not have happened.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nGIROUARD J.\u2014The principles governing actions like the present one are very well known; they have been laid down by this court in several cases and more particularly in The Montreal Rolling Mills Company v. Corcoran ([23]); and Tooke v. Bergeron (1). The rule of law is therefore well established that no employer is responsible for his fault towards an employee, unless the latter proves that it is the immediate, necessary and direct cause of the injury he sustains. That rule is embodied in article 1053 of the Civil Code of Quebec; it is one of almost universal law among civilized nations, as well under the civil law as under the common law of England, a proposition which the authorities quoted in The Montreal Rolling Mills Company v. Corcoran ([24]) fully establish. It has, however, been recently assailed with great vigour by eminent jurists, and among others Labb\u00e9, Prosper Staer, Gibon, Hubert-Valleroux and B\u00e9chaux, as being unjust and unfair to the workingman who often finds it difficult and sometimes impossible to give a true account of the accident; but in no less than ten or twelve decisions, which have reached us since The Montreal Rolling Mills Company v. Corcoran (1) was decided the old rule has been reaffirmed most emphatically by the highest courts of France; Cass. 12 Dec. 1893 Pand. Fr. '94, 1,507; Cass. 6th Fev. 1894; ibid. '94, 1.519; Cass. 5 Avril, 1894, ibid. '95, 1,90; Orl\u00e9ns, 17 fev 1894, Douai, 21 fev 1894, ibid. '94, 2140 ;Paris 4 Avril et 27 juillet, 1894, ibid. '95, 2,209 ;Cass. 7 aout, 1895, ibid. '95, 1,485; Cass. 15 juillet, 1896, et 13 janv. 1897, ibid. '97, 1,513. These two last arr\u00e9ts have been accepted as having settled the French jurisprudence, and no hope of a remedy is entertained except by applying to the legislature. The whole situation is carefully summarized in the interesting annotations of Mr. Fernand Chesnay to the reports of the arr\u00e9ts ([25]). The learned jurist concludes at page 517:\nIl est constant que le patron ne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9clare responaable de I' accident dont a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime son ouvrier si celui-ci n'\u00e9tablit pas de la fa\u00e7on la plus certaine, en premier lieu, que son patron a commis une faute, une n\u00e9gligence, une imprudence une contravention aux lois et r\u00e9glements. et, en second lieu que c'est bien cette faute qui a occasionn\u00e9 I'accident, qu'il existe r\u00e9ellement entre la faute et I'accident un rapport de cause \u00e0 effet. Si ce dernier \u00e9l\u00e9ment de Ia responsibilit\u00e9 du patron fait d\u00e9faut, ou s'il existe un doute sur le point de savoir si I'accident doit \u00eatre attribu\u00e9 a la faute du patron aucune indemnit\u00e9 n'est due \u00e0 l'ouvrier. C'est ce qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9cide avec raison la Cour de Cassation dans les arr\u00eats du 15 juillet, 1896, et du 13 janvier, 1897, que nous annotons. Finally with regard to the \" contravention aux lois et reglements \" or the police regulations, it must be noticed, that the French laws, like the Factories Acts and other similar statutes in force in England, Scotland Ontario and other British colonies are Very different from the Quebec Act; they do not contain any such enactment as section thirty-seven or article 3053 of the Quebec Revised Statutes, which declares in express terms that its provisions are not intended to modify \" in any manner \" the civil responsibility of the employer towards his employee.\nNow, has the plaintiff proved that the defendant has been guilty of negligence which was certainly the cause of the accident? The evidence adduced by him is weak; it is urged by the appellant, and not without reason, that his own imprudence was the primary cause of it; and if we are called upon to reverse a decision rendered in favour of the appellant, we should probably decline to do so; but we are far from being satisfied that the judgment appealed from is clearly wrong; there is some evidence of neglect on the part of the employer, which two courts have considered as having caused the injury sustained, and in such a case the jurisprudence of this court is well settled that we would not disturb the finding of these two courts. The Superior Court and the Court of Appeal, almost unanimously, have found that the accident was due to the fault of the defendant\nIn not either covering the shaft temporarily with boards, or by not disconnecting it so as to stop it, or by not stopping altogether the whole machinery whilst plaintiff and the other men were required to work over and near the said shaft.\nWitness Blondin says that in some of the mills in Hull (where the accident happened), and he mentions those of Mr. Eddy, the shafts are generally covered, and he adds: Quand ils ne ne sont pas couverts, lea machines sont arret\u00e9es quand une personne passe dans une place dangereuse.\nThe position of the respondent was undoubtedly dangerous, but it is to be regretted that, with regard to the practice prevailing among mill-owners in Hull, the evidence is not more full and conclusive, although easily obtainable. The dangerous position of the shaft was, in the opinion of the official inspector, Guyon, the cause of the accident, and although it is only the evidence of an expert, it is entitled to a great deal of weight, especially as there is in fact no clear evidence of the direct and immediate cause of the accident.\nThere is also some evidence that the year previous, in 1895, Mr. Guyon had called the attention of the defendant to the unprotected and defective condition of the shaft, although this can only be inferred from his testimony his letter written at the time to the appellant and intended to be filed of record as exhibit \"Y\" to complete it, not being in the printed case before us, but it is proved that his recommendations, whatever they were, were only carried out in part, a fact he ascertained on a subsequent visit, made after the accident, in 1896.\nManufacturers should realize that it is in their interest to comply with the precautionary measures adapted by their neighbours in similar establishments or suggested by the recognized authority, although their default may only subject them to the penalties or imprisonment; in doing so, however, they may rest assured that they will save often troublesome and expensive litigation, sometimes irreparable injury and in some cases, unfortunately too frequent, valuable lives\nUpon the whole and all the circumstances of the case being duly weighed, we think, but not without some hesitation, that the judgment of the two courses below should be confirmed, and the appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Arthur McConnell.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

The defendant afterwards caused this statement to be printed in a newspaper, and on a separate \"dodger\" or fly-sheet, which was circulated in large numbers through the constituency, with a printed challenge to the defendant and others implicated to justify their innocence of the charges made by taking an action for damages in case they were not guilty, and offering at the same time to make a deposit to cover the costs of suit.

The conveyance, agreement and bill of sale of the chattels were all executed on the same day, the agreement, to which B. was not a party, containing a recital that the husband was owner of the said chattels but giving the creditor no security upon them. The chattels having subsequently been seized under execution against the husband it was claimed, on interpleader proceedings, that the bill of sale was in fraud of the creditor.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, that the recital in the agreement worked no estoppel as against B.; that as it appeared that the husband expressly refused to assign the chattels to his creditor there was nothing to prevent him from transferring them to his wife, and that the Court of Appeal rightly held the transaction an honest one and B. entitled to the goods and to indemnity against the mortgage.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Rose at the trial in favour of the defendants.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the above head-note and in the judgment of the court. Wallace Nesbitt and W.J. Clarke for the appellants.\nO\u2019Flynn for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Appeal in this case was entirely right.\nThe respondent, Louisa Boulton, was the owner in her own right of forty acres of land part of the north half of lot 14, in the 7th concession of Sydney. This is the common case of both parties.\nThis property was subject to a mortgage to the Messrs. Biggar. On the 25th of September, 1891, the respondent in compliance with the earnest entreaties of her husband George A. Boulton, conveyed the equity of redemption in this land to the appellant Paul Boulton, a brother of the respondent\u2019s husband, in order to carry out an agreement of the same date entered into between George A. Boulton and Paul Boulton which had for its principal object the settlement of a debt due from the former to the latter.\nIt is established by evidence of the most satisfactory kind that the respondent by way of valuable consideration for thus parting with her land stipulated with her husband that he was to transfer to her certain chattel property consisting principally of farm stock and other personal property then upon the farm, and also for indemnity against her personal liability on the mortgage held by the Biggars. It is also clear that George A. Boulton expressly refused when pressed to do so to assign this chattel property to his brother Paul as part of the arrangement for a settlement of the debt.\nIn pursuance of the agreement under which the respondent conveyed her equity of redemption, George A. Boulton made a bill of sale of the goods in question to the respondent on the same day as that on which the agreement with Paul was executed. The principal question in the cause was as to the bona fides of this assignment.\nThe goods in question having been afterwards seized by the sheriff and interpleader proceedings having been taken, it was asserted that the bill of sale to the respondent was in fraud of Paul. The agreement, although it recited that George was the owner of these goods, gave Paul no security upon them or rights in them and the respondent was not a party to the agreement.\nThis recital (as a majority of the Court of Appeal have held) manifestly worked no estoppel as regards the respondent and was in fact true. There was moreover nothing in the recital of this fact, and more especially in view of the refusal already mentioned of George to give his brother any security on the goods, to estop George himself from dealing with them in the way he did, namely, by assigning them to his wife as part of the consideration for the conveyance by her of the land to Paul; indeed he could not honestly have refused to carry out his agreement to do so.\nUnder this state of facts it would be impossible as it seems to me to hold that the bill of sale was fraudulent, and so to take away from the respondent the principal consideration she got for her land. I think the transaction an honest one and that it has been properly upheld by the Court of Appeal.\nThe only other question is as to the agreement to indemnify the respondent against personal liability under the covenant in the Biggar mortgage. This was, in addition to the chattels, part of the consideration which the respondent had stipulated for in the conveyance of her land. The Court of Appeal has held that she was entitled to this indemnity, and in respect of it the court has given her the usual vendor\u2019s lien on the land. This it seems was also right.\nBoth Mr. Justice Rose and the Court of Appeal have held that the mortgage executed by Paul in favour of Hiram Boulton and the conveyance of the equity of redemption to Alexander Boulton were fraudulent as against the respondent\u2019s claim to a lien for this indemnity.\nThe only other matter in question was the damages which the Court of Appeal has referred it to the master to assess.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.J. Clark.\nSolicitor for the respondents: F.E. O\u2019Flynn.\n"}

S. N. B. c. 72.\nSec. 1 of C. S. N. B. ch. 72, which provides that the property of a married woman shall vest in her as her separate property, free from the control of her husband and not liable for payment of his debts, does not, except in the case specially provided for, enlarge her power for disposing of such property or allow her to enter into contracts which at common law would be void. Moore v. Jackson (22 Can. S. C. R. 210) referred to. Lea v. Wallace et al., (33 N. B. Rep. 492) reversed. Appeal from the decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1], reversing the judgment of the Chief Justice in favour of the defendants.\nThe following statement of facts and questions at issue in the case are taken from the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Hanington in the court below:\nThe plaintiff claimed that, at the request of the female defendant, and on the credit of her separate property, he furnished her with lumber and other material, used in the reconstruction and repairing of a hotel, on her real estate, in Moncton, to the amount unpaid in all of about $698, A part of the amount, $89.90, is made up of materials furnished one Thorne, who was carrying on the work before it was taken in hand by the defendant personally. One Lounsbury was originally the contractor with the female defendant for the construction of the work, including materials. He, after a part performance of his contract, being unable to complete it, made an assignment and gave up the work. Thorne then went on with the job for some time, ordering the materials from the plaintiff, amounting to the sum of $89.90, and then abandoned it. After Thorne gave it up the female defendant continued the work herself, and it is for materials furnished her during such construction, (including Thorne's work), that the plaintiff claimed payment out of her separate estate. The female defendant disputed the fact of having ordered any of the goods for which the plaintiff sought to recover, contended that she was in no way liable for the goods Thorne got, and that the only goods she got, or authorized to be had at the plaintiffs, were paid for by her.\nThe cause came down for hearing before Mr. Justice Tuck, sitting in equity, who found that the female defendant was not liable for the amount of the goods furnished to Thorne; that the balance of goods, amounting to $598.81, were ordered by her and furnished by the plaintiff, on the credit of her separate property, but that the plaintiff was not entitled to a decree for the payment thereof out of such separate property, as her tenure of, or estate or property in, it under the Act then in force or otherwise, was not such as would raise any liability in law or equity against either her real or personal property, and ordered that the bill should be dismissed. The property against which the decree was sought is real estate which came to the female defendant partly by inheritance and partly by purchase. * * * * *\nThe principal question is: Was the learned judge, as the law then stood, in error in refusing to decree that the value of the goods, which he found had been furnished by the plaintiff to the female defendant, should be paid for out of her own property? Since the decree, the Provincial Legislature passed an Act whereby the property of a feme covert would be liable in a case like the present, and the question had to be determined, whether or not it was so liable before such enactment.\nPugsley Q.C. and Teed for the appellants. The property of the female defendant was not and is not settled to her separate use by any deed, will or settlement, but falls within the provisions of chapter 72 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, relating to the property of married women, and the effect of the statute is not to make the property of a married woman property held to her separate use within the meaning or principles of courts of equity, or to make it liable to the burdens which equity imposes upon such estates; Fitzpatrick v. Dryden[2]; Re Cleveland[3]; Lamb v. Cleveland[4]; Pourrier v. Raymond[5]; Taylor v. Meads[6]; Royal Canadian Bank v. Mitchell[7]; Chamberlain v. McDonald[8]: Mitchell v. Weir[9]; Wright v. Garden[10]; Kraemer v. Glass[11]; Moore v. Jackson[12].\nThe property of the wife, under chapter 72, is entirely the creation of the statute, and her power of disposition must be governed by the statute itself, and there is no analogy between the power of disposition of a woman under the statute and a woman having property to her separate use in equity, with power of anticipation. The judgment of Sir George Jessel, in the case of Howard v. The Bank of England[13], is not applicable to the Act now presented for construction; he was dealing with legislation in which the husband's rights were clearly taken away, and in which there were no limitations upon the wife's disposition. Even if the statute should be held to have created an estate to the separate use of the woman as fully as recognized in courts of equity, yet all property held to the separate use is not chargeable with the payment of debts,\u2014it must be with full power of an anticipation. If there be a restraint upon that, or a limitation to a particular mode of disposition, the property can be charged only in the manner pointed out by the limitation. London Chartered Bank of Australia v. Lempriere et al.[14]; Pike v. Fitzgibbon[15]. The provision in section one that, the real property shall not be conveyed, encumbered or disposed of while she lives with her husband, except by her being a party to the instrument duly acknowledged, &c., is a distinct and positive restraint or fetter upon the disposition of the real estate, at least in any mode other than that so pointed out; Mitchell v. Weir[16], per Strong V. C; Moore v. Jackson[17], at page 225, per Strong C J.\nThe appellant contends that if the land be conveyed under the decree now made, it will be \"disposed of\" in a manner contrary to the express term of the statute of which the evident scope was to protect the property of the wife whilst she lived with her husband.\nThe statute neither removed her disability during such period nor improved the liability for debts upon her estate. No jus disponendi is given to the woman by the first section of the Act.\nWe also rely upon the decisions in Chamberlain v. McDonald[18]; Mitchell v. Weir (1); Royal Canadian Bank v. Mitchell[19]; Pourrier v. Raymond[20]; Wright v. Garden[21].\nPowell Q.C. for the respondent. The respondent contends that the price of lumber and material obtained by the female defendant on the credit of property which accrued to her after marriage should be chargeable upon and paid out of such property which by the chapter seventy-two of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, vested in her and was owned by her as her separate estate, and is of the character of separate estate which in equity may be charged with the debts of a married woman. In construing the first section, the words \"the real and personal property belonging to a woman before or accruing after marriage, except such as may be received from her husband while married, shall vest in her and be owned by her as her separate estate,\" make all property. coming within the section separate property in equity, and attaches to it in equity all the incidents that attach to equitable separate property vested in and owned by her; In re Poole's Estate, Thompson v. Bennett[22], but gives to the married woman no separate legal rights either disponendi or of contract, or of action with reference thereto. See remarks by Strong C.J. in Moore v. Jackson[23], at page 218, and also Howard v. The Bank of England[24], per Jessel M.R. The contention that because the estate is separate estate created by statute it is a new creature of statute, and not as such possessed of the peculiar properties of separate estate in equity, is directly in variance with In re Poole's Estate. Thompson v. Bennett (1); Butler v. Cumpston[25], and Sanger v. Sanger[26].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be allowed.\nMr. Justice Hanington in a very full and able judgment has set forth the reasons for a similar conclusion, and as I entirely agree in his opinion I need not repeat at length the arguments brought forward by him in which I fully concur.\nIn the case of Moore v. Jackson (2) I had occasion to consider a question similar to this, on an appeal from the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario. The judgment in that case was not, it is true, an authority binding the learned judges of the court below in the present case, inasmuch as it arose under the statute law of another Province in some respects not identical with the enactment now in question, and I do not refer to it as a controlling authority. In my judgment in Moore v. Jackson[27] however, I examined the general rules of interpretation applicable to legislation such as that we have to apply here, and I therefore refer to it as embodying the reasons why I think the judgment now under appeal is not sustainable.\nThe first section of chapter 72 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick does, it is true, provide that the property of a married woman shall vest in her and be owned by her as her separate property, but while this indicates that her enjoyment of her property shall be free from the control of her husband, and that it shall not be liable to her husband's debts, it does not indicate that she shall have the power of binding it, encumbering and disposing of it as if she were an unmarried woman. So far from this being the case it contains an express provision that she can only convey it by a deed \"duly acknowledged as provided by the laws for regulating the acknowledgements of married women,\" thus conclusively shewing that her jus disponendi was not enlarged but remained as it was before the Act, requiring a conveyance duly acknowledged, to which her husband would be a necessary party. This certainly does not do away with the disability of a married woman to alienate her freehold lands or to enter into contracts which at common law would be absolutely void. Again, it is apparent that the legislature did not intend any such change in the law from the circumstances that the same section provides for her power of disposition as if she were a feme sole in the case of desertion by her husband, a power which is not conferred generally but is confined to that particular case.\nFurther, the provision at the end of the section that her separate property should be liable for her debts contracted before marriage and for judgments recovered against her husband for her torts whilst under coverture warrants the conclusion that the liability in contracts entered into during coverture was not intended to be imposed, and that her property was not liable to judgments and execution except in the cases specially provided for, an inference which is strengthened by the change in the law effected by the legislation of 1895 enacted during the pendency of this suit.\nAs the exhaustive judgment of Mr. Justice Hanington covers all the grounds referred to, and as from the recent changes in the law the question here raised is not likely to be of frequent occurrence, I do not feel called upon to do more than indicate what I consider conclusive grounds for not upholding the judgment under appeal.\nThe appeal must therefore be allowed with costs, and the decree of the learned Chief Justice dismissing the bill must be restored, with costs to the appellant in all the courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Teed Hewson & Hanington.\nSolicitor for the respondent: David I.

Judge Palmer having retired the hearing was proceeded with before Mr. Justice Hanington who gave effect to the previous direction and ordered the costs to be taxed as on a consolidated case. The full court affirmed this order and an appeal was then taken to this court.\nPugsley Q.C. for the appellants. There was no formal order for consolidation issued and Judge Palmer could not have directed it as separate pleas were made in the three suits.\nAn appeal will lie in these cases though they involve a question of costs only as the orders for taxation were made in error as to the facts and in violation of the rules of practice; Archbald v. Delisle[1]. In re Chennell, Jones v. Chennell[2].\nThe order was not made by Mr. Justice Hanington in the exercise of a judicial discretion and if it were an appeal would lie, as sec. 27 of The Supreme Court Act does not apply to decretal orders in equity. And see Daniels' Chancery Practice, 6 ed. pp. 1271 and 1274.\nW. Cassels Q.C., Stockton Q.C. and Tilley for the several respondents. The order for consolidation was properly granted on application of the plaintiffs. Martin v. Martin & Co.[3].\nThere is no appeal on a question of costs. The Managers Metropolitan Asylum District v. Hill[4]; McGugan v. Mc-Gugan[5],\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014We are all of opinion that these appeals should not be allowed.\nThey relate solely to an order of Mr. Justice Hanington asking that the costs of several actions should be taxed as if these actions had been consolidated by a formal order as they were intended to be as evidenced by the verbal direction of Mr. Justice Palmer then sitting as Judge in Equity and hearing the cases.\nIt is only in extreme cases where some fundamental principle of justice has been ignored, or where some gross error appears that this court will interfere with the discretion of provincial courts in awarding or withholding costs. This is not such a case. For my own part I think the order of Mr. Justice Hanington was properly made. There was no doubt that Mr. Justice Palmer when at an early stage he heard these cases directed that they should be consolidated and that direction was a matter of record.\nIf the appellants, they having the conduct of the several oases, did not choose to take out the order they have only themselves to blame, and Mr. Justice Hanington was perfectly right in putting in formal shape what was the expressed intention of his predecessor.\nThe learned counsel for the appellants, it seems to us, gave a wider scope to the order appealed from than we think it bears. The taxing authority will doubtless tax him not only for all the disbursements in the three cases but for all work necessarily done over and above what would have been done had there been only one suit.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: William Pugsley.\nSolicitor for the respondents, The St. John City Railway Company and others: Arthur I.

N. A. Act, s. 142\u2014Award of 1870, validity of\u2014Upper Canada Improvement fund\u2014School fund\u2014B. N. A. Act, s. 109\u2014Trust created by\u2014Effect of Confederation on trust.\nThe arbitrators appointed in 1870, under s. 142 of the B. N. A. Act, were authorized to \"divide\" and \"adjust\" the accounts in dispute between the Dominion of Canada and the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, respecting the former Province of Canada. In dealing with the Common School Fund established under 12 V. c. 20 (Can.), they directed the principal of the fund to be retained by the Dominion and the income therefrom paid to the provinces.\nHeld, that even if there was no ultimate \"division and adjustment,\" such as the statute required, yet the ascertainment of the amount was a necessary preliminary to such \"division and adjustment,\" and therefore intra vires of the arbitrators.\nHeld further, that there was a division of the beneficial interest in the fund and a fair adjustment of the rights of the provinces in it which was a proper exercise of the authority of the arbitrators under the statute.\nBy 12 V. c. 200, s. 3 (Can.), one million acres of the public lands of the Province of Canada were to be set apart to be sold and the proceeds applied to the creation of the \"Common School Fund\" provided for in sec. 1. The lands so set apart were all in the present Province of Ontario.\nHeld, that the trust in these lands created by the Act for the Common Schools of Canada did not cease to exist at Confederation, so that the unsold lands and proceeds of sales should revert to Ontario, but such trust continued in favour of the Common Schools of the new Provinces of Ontario and Quebec.\nIn the agreement of reference to the arbitrators appointed under Acts passed in 1891 to adjust the said accounts questions respecting the Upper Canada Improvement Fund were excluded, but the arbitrators had to determine and award upon the accounts as rendered by the Dominion to the two provinces up to January, 1889.\nHeld, that the arbitrators could pass upon the right of Ontario to deduct a proportion of the schools lands the amount of which was one of the items in the accounts so rendered.\nAppeal from an award of the arbitrators appointed to adjust the accounts between the Dominion of Canada and the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec respectively and between the said provinces.\nThe arbitrators were appointed under authority of statutes passed by the Dominion Parliament and legislatures of the said provinces in 1891, namely, 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 6 (D); 54 Vict. ch. 2 (Ont.); and 54 Vict. ch. 4 (Que.) These statutes were identical in terms that passed by the Dominion Parliament containing the following provisions:\u2014\n\"An Act respecting the settlement of accounts between the Dominion of Canada and the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and between the said provinces.\" \"Whereas certain accounts have arisen or may hereafter arise in the settlement of the accounts between the Dominion of Canada and the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, both jointly and severally, and between the two provinces, concerning which no agreement has hitherto been arrived at; and whereas it is advisable that all such questions of account should be referred to arbitration; Therefore Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:\"\n\"1. For the final and conclusive determination of such accounts, the Governor General in Council may unite with the Governments of the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec in the appointment of three arbitrators, to whom shall be referred such questions as the Governor General and the Lieutenant-Governors of the said provinces shall agree to submit.\"\n\"2. The arbitrators shall consist of three judges, one to be appointed by the Governor General in Council and one by each of the said Provincial Governments, and all three shall be approved of by each Government.\"\n\"3. The arbitrators shall not assume to decide any disputed constitutional question; but if any are raised they will note and report them with their award, but without delaying their proceedings.\"\n\"4.

In case of a vacancy by death or otherwise among the arbitrators, the same shall be filled in the same manner as the appointment was first made, any such appointment to be approved of by the other two Governments.\"\nThe Honourable John A. Boyd, Chancellor of Ontario; the Honourable Sir Louis Napoleon Casault, Chief Justice of the Superior Court of Quebec; and the Honourable George A. Burbidge, Judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada, were appointed arbitrators, in accordance with the provisions of the said statutes, and an agreement of submission was entered into on behalf of the three governments, which provided that the following, among other matters, should be submitted to them:\n\"1. All questions relating to or incident to the accounts between the Dominion and the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and to accounts between the two Provinces of Ontario and Quebec.\"\n\"2. The accounts are understood to include the following particulars:\"\n\"(a) The accounts as rendered by the Dominion to the provinces up to January, 1889.\"\n\"(b) In the unsettled accounts between the Dominion and the two provinces the rate of interest and the mode of computation of interest to be determined.\"\n\"(c) The accounts as rendered by the Dominion to the two provinces up to January, 1889, to be determined upon.\"\n* * * * * * * \"(A). The ascertainment and determination of the amount of the principal of the Common School Fund, the rate of interest which would be allowed on such fund and the method of computing such interest.\"\n\"(i) In the ascertainment of the amount of the principal of the said Common School Fund, the arbitrators are to take into consideration, not only the sum now held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada, but also the amount for which Ontario is liable, and also the value of the school lands which have not yet been sold.\"\nOn this submission the arbitrators made and published an award in respect to the Common School Fund and Lands which, after formal recitals proceeded as follows:\n\"Now therefore we, the said arbitrators, exercising our authority to make an award at this time respecting some of such questions and to reserve others for further consideration, do award, order and adjudge in and upon the premises as follows:\"\n\"1. That the sum held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada on the tenth day of April, 1893, as part of the principal of said Common School Fund, amounted to two million four hundred and fifty-seven thousand six hundred and eighty-eight dollars and sixty-two cents ($2,457,688.62), made up of the following sums, that is to say: 1st, the sum of one million five hundred and twenty thousand nine hundred and fifty-nine dollars and twenty-nine cents ($1,520,959.29), that at the Union of the Provinces came into the hands of the Government of Canada, and upon which interest has from time to time in the accounts referred to us been credited to the said Provinces; secondly, the sum of nine hundred and twenty-five thousand six hundred and twenty-five dollars and sixty-three cents ($925,625.63), for which, in 1889, the Government of Ontario accounted to the Government of the Dominion; and thirdly, the sum of eleven thousand one hundred and three dollars and seventy cents ($11,103.70), for which the Government of Ontario accounted to the Government of the Dominion in the following year (1890).\"\n\"From this finding Chief Justice Sir Louis Napoleon Casault dissents, he being of opinion that the sum then held by the Dominion Government as part of the principal of the said Common School Fund was greater than has been stated by an amount of one hundred and twenty-four thousand six hundred and eighty-five dollars and eighteen cents ($124,685.18), which sum in the said accounts has been deducted from the said fund and credited to the Upper Canada Improvement Fund.\"\n\"2. That the Province of Ontario is not liable out of the proceeds arising from the sale of the Crown Lands of the Province, other than the million acres of Common School Lands as set apart in aid of the Common Schools of the late Province of Canada, to contribute anything to the said Common School Fund.\"\n\"Mr. Chancellor Boyd dissents from so much of this finding as may imply that Ontario is under any liability in respect to the Common School Fund or lands.\"\n\"3. That, subject to certain deductions, the Province of Ontario is liable for the moneys received by the said province since the first day of July, 1867, or to be received from or on account of the Common School Lands set apart in aid of the Common Schools of the late Province of Canada.\"\n\"Mr. Chancellor Boyd dissents from this finding as to liability.\"\n\"4. That from the moneys received by the Province of Ontario since the first day of July, 1867, from or on account of the Common School Lands set apart in aid of the Common Schools of the late Province of Canada, the Province of Ontario is entitled to deduct and retain the following sums as provided by the award of the 3rd of September, 1870, that is to say\":\n\"First,\u2014In respect of all such moneys, six per centum on the amount thereof for the sale and management of such lands.\"\n\"Secondly,\u2014In respect of moneys arising from sales of such lands made between the fourteenth day of June, 1853, and the sixth day of March, 1861, twenty-five per centum of the balance remaining after the deduction of six per centum for the sale and management of such lands.\"\n\"Chief Justice Sir Louis Napoleon Casault dissents from so much of this finding as relates to the deduction in the cases mentioned of the twenty-five per centum on such balance.\"\n\"5. That in respect of the matters mentioned in the four preceding paragraphs, we the said arbitrators have proceeded upon our view of disputed questions of law.\"\n\"6. With reference to the Quebec Turnpike Trust debentures in which a part of the Common School Fund was invested, we do award, order and adjudge that there is in respect thereof no liability on the part of the Dominion to either of the provinces, or on the part of the Province of Quebec to the Province of Ontario, but that whatever sums may be realized from the principal moneys due on such debentures, or from the arrears of interest due thereon, on the first day of July, 1867, shall be added to and shall form part of the principal of the said Common School Fund, and that whatever sums may be realized for interest on such debentures that has accrued due since the first day of July, 1867. or which may hereafter accrue due shall be dealt with as income arising from such fund \" \"7. With respect to the claim made by the Province of Quebec, that the Dominion is liable for interest on moneys received by the Province of Ontario from the sales of Common School Lands and retained by that province, we do award, order and adjudge that the Dominion is not liable therefor.\"\n\"8. And with respect to other questions and matters relating to the Common School Lands and Fund, we, the said arbitrators, do not now make any award, but reserve the same for further consideration.\"\nEach of the said arbitrators published his reasons for the decision arrived at on the disputed questions of law dealt with in the said award, which reasons are as follows:\nBOYD C.\u2014\"1. No claim exists on the part of Quebec, to have more lands set apart for Common School purposes than were actually set apart by Old Canada. Upper and Lower Canada, now Ontario and Quebec, were the constituents of the joint Province of Canada, and are bound by what was done, or what was left undone in this regard prior to Confederation. That the claim is a 'new one' does not for that reason bar it, but it goes a long way to discredit it; nor do I perceive any intrinsic merit in the claim which would justify us in taking it into further consideration.\"\n\"2. So far as Quebec claims to impeach the action of the first arbitrators in their award of 1870 touching the Upper Canada Land Improvement Fund, and as to what they have directed to be placed to the credit of that fund, presently and prospectively, I cannot see my way to interfere for many reasons. For one thing, the very subject matter is withheld from our jurisdiction by the terms of the reference. (See paragraph 5 of Deed of Submission of 10th April, 1893);\" \"And, for another thing: Apart from the provisions of the first award of 1870, the Province of Quebec would have no locus standi to make any claim as to the Common School Fund out of which this Land Improvement Fund was segregated by the first arbitrators.\"\n\"3. The key to that award is the fact that all the fund was derived from land in Upper Canada, and that all the school lands were locally situate in Ontario and became or were retained as the property of Ontario on the dissolution of the Union. It was of grace to give any (much more a substantial) proportion of the future proceeds of those lands to Quebec, and the arbitrators could well modify the former proportion by withdrawing so much for the purposes of land improvement in the counties of the terrritory which furnish the lands. That was within the equity of the Act, Consolidated Statutes of Canada, Chapter 26, section 7, which provided for such a reserve being formed.\"\n\"4. But, again, if the first award is as to these lands, impeachable (as I think it is), consider the state of affairs when Old Canada ceased to exist: What became then of the Common School Fund? Now, it is not hypercritical to apply accurate rules of construction to the language used in the constituting Statute, 12th Victoria, Chapter 200, which was reserved for and obtained the Queen's Royal sanction. The Act recites that 'it is desirable to raise moneys from the public lands of this province (that is Canada) for the maintenance and support of Common Schools therein' (i.e., in the Province of Canada). The same thought is repeated in the body of the Act, section 4, 'for the support, etc., of Common Schools in this Province.' Consolidated Statutes of Canada, Chapter 26.\"\n\"What became of these schools when Canada ceased to exist as a joint Province and became a new political entity formed by the addition of other Provinces and established as the Dominion? There were then, in truth, no Common Schools in Canada. The existing schools became Common Schools in Ontario and Common Schools in Quebec, and not, therefore, the objects of the trust. The scheme of the Act and the scope of the trust was that public lands of Canada should support the Public Schools of Canada; but it does not therefore follow that the public lands of Ontario should help to support the Public Schools of Quebec, unless clear legislation to that effect is found. But none such can be found, for it is submitted that the general words of Section 109 of the Imperial Act 'subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof and to any interest other than that of the province in the same,' do not cover the case in hand. It is no answer to say that then there would be no trust remaining for the Common Schools of Ontario quoad the unsold lands\u2014 granted; but Ontario having all the lands could provide for her own schools.\"\n\"In this aspect the reason and the motive of the whole scheme of support for the Public Schools of Canada disappeared when the union of the provinces was dissolved and Ontario retained her lands out of which the fund had been created and was to be maintained. When there ceased to be any Common Schools of Old Canada there ceased to be any beneficiaries for the future annual payments out of this fund. The fund itself, as it then existed, would revert in equity to the province out of whose lands it was created, if there was no legislation to the contrary, and there is none. Compare, by contrast, sections 139 and 140 of the British North America Act, making careful provision for events in the provinces after Confederation, but nothing analogous to which is found as to the trusts relating to Common Schools.\" \"5. The point is therefore pressed that no trust exists as to this Old Common School Fund of Canada. The Award of 1870 itself, in clause IX, shows its invalidity, for it purports to deal with moneys received and to be received by Ontario 'on account of the Common School lands set apart in aid of the Common Schools of the late Province of Canada,' but the province had disappeared politically and really and so had the schools; what remained was the Dominion of Canada and the schools of Ontario and the schools of Quebec. The annihilation of the beneficiaries appears on the face of the Award, and, therefore, the futility of the supposed trust is also manifested; hence the Award is at variance with section 109 of The British North America Act, which gives the lands in Ontario and the moneys due thereon to that province subject to existing trusts only, but this is a non-existing trust, and so the lands and moneys due for the lands go absolutely to Ontario. So far as concerns the money collected out of the lands and held by Old Canada prior to Confederation but not invested, the Imperial statute is silent. The part investment, namely, the $58,000 represented by the Quebec Turnpike Trust, is included in the fourth schedule of assets as the property of Ontario and Quebec jointly. That being mentioned, and the uninvested fund being excluded from mention, throughout the Act favours rather than makes against the present argument.\"\n\"Now the moneys collected and held by the Dominion as part of the general account are also earmarked as parts of this Trust Fund intended for the benefit of the Common Schools of (United) Canada, but when these schools ceased to exist, as such, at the date of Confederation, the moneys should, on principles of equity and fair dealing, have reverted to Upper Canada (i.e., Ontario) from whom it was taken[1]. A gift to a charity which has expired is as much a lapse as a gift to an individual, and it cannot be applied cy-pres\u2014Re Rymer[2]. Where the society intended has merged in another society then the gift fails\u2014Mackeown v. Ardagh[3]. This is a case in which the sub-division of Canada and the alteration of the Common School organization consequent upon the change of Government destroy the identity of the original beneficiaries[4].\"\n\"6. This is not a case in which there can be or should be any application of the cy-pres doctrine for this one good reason, that the scheme was one wherein the property and the schools were subject to one common Legislature, but it would be a perversion of the bounty to apply the property jointly when all control of the Quebec schools has passed from (United) Canada and Ontario. When the scheme was framed and intended to be perpetual there was but one Government controlling all,\u2014fund, trustees and beneficiaries. But now the perpetuity has ended and there are three Governments; and matters of school legislation are no longer controlled by the general Government but are remitted, as matters of local concern, to local legislation. Surely these circumstances, leaving out of sight others which might be mentioned, are sufficiently distinctive from those existing when the fund was formed to displace any equitable claim of Quebec[5].\"\n\"The words of the Imperial Statute 'subject to existing trusts,' etc., yield a plain, intelligible meaning, and call for no latitude of construction to include anything beyond what is obvious. To ascertain what are the trusts we must fall back upon prior provincial legislation, and one cannot affirm that the Legislative body which enacted 12th Victoria and sanctioned its consolidation in Chapter 26, had any trusts in view other than those pertaining to the whole body of the Canadian Public Schools in (United) Canada and that in perpetuity. If there is meant to be a continuation of that trust for schools after the constitutional disappearance of Old Canada and the practical severance of that trust to and for the benefit of the new Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, one would expect to find proper provision therefor in suitable and explicit language.\"\n\"CASAULT C.J.\u2014The Provincial Statute 4 & 5 Vict. ch. 18, which by its sec. 23, was to come in force on the first of January, 1842, enacted, sec. 2:\"\n'That for the establishment, support and maintenance of Common Schools in each and every township and parish in this province, there shall be established a permanent fund which shall consist of all such moneys as may accrue from the selling or leasing of any lands which, by the legislature of this province, or other competent authority, may hereafter be granted and set apart for the establishment, maintenance and support of Common Schools in this province, and of such other monies as are hereinafter mentioned; and all such monies as shall arise from the sale of any such lands or estates, and certain other monies hereinafter mentioned, shall be invested in safe and profitable securities in this province, and the interest of all monies so invested, and the rents, issues and profits arising from such lands or estates as shall be leased or otherwise disposed of without alienation, shall be annually applied in the manner hereinafter provided, to the support and encouragement of Common Schools.'\n\"Section 3 of the same Act decreed that fifty thousand pounds should be granted annually, to be distributed amongst the several districts of the province, and that this sum should be composed and made of the revenue derived from the permanent fund to be created under the previous section, and such further sums from the unappropriated moneys which were then raised and levied or might thereafter be raised and levied by the legislature for the uses of the province as might be required to make the above mentioned sum, and that the said annual grant should be and be called 'The Common School Fund.'\n\"At the same session was passed the statute 4 & 5 Vict. ch. 100 for the disposition of public lands within the province, which was reserved as required by the Union Act (sec 42 of the Imperial statute 3 & 4 Vict. ch. 35), and received the royal assent which was duly signified. That statute gave to the Government of Canada the power to deal with the public lands, but it excluded free grants excepting to the extent of ten acres for schools, school houses, etc.\"\n\"The limit put by that statute to the extent of free grants for schools, etc., etc., did not preclude the appropriation of a larger area for the maintenance of schools generally. It only limited the number of acres which could be granted to each special school, as shown by its reproduction in 16 Vict. ch. 159, sec. 10, in the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, chap. 22, sec. 11, and in 28 Vict. ch. 2, sec. 14.\"\nBut this question has no interest because the setting apart of one million of acres the price of which when sold was to constitute the Common School Fund was done under the authority of a subsequent Act.\" \"It has been contended that 4 & 5 Vict. ch. 18, had never been repealed and is law to this day. This contention has also for the same reason no interest. But it is incorrect. This statute was repealed, 1st, implicitly by 12 Vict. ch. 200, which covered the same grounds, and 2nd, by the Consolidated Statues of Canada, (22 Vict. ch. 29, p. xxxv), which at sec. 5, stated that the several Acts or parts of Acts mentioned as repealed in Schedule A thereto annexed, and in which we find as repealed 4 & 5 Vict. ch. 18, shall stand and be repealed. The Act 7 Vict. ch. 9 need not be noticed except in so far as it directs the sum of fifty thousand pounds granted for the support of the Common Schools to be apportioned between the divisions of the former provinces of Upper and Lower Canada in proportion to the population of each as ascertained by the next anterior census.\"\n\"Then comes, in 1849, the statute 12 Vict. ch. 200, sanction of which was reserved and granted by Her Majesty in Council on the 9th of March, eighteen hundred and fifty (1850) and communicated to the legislative council and assembly on the twenty-seventh of May one thousand eight hundred and fifty (1850), and which was law until repealed by the Revised Statutes of Canada, where all its provisions have been embodied. It is copied in extenso in the Ontario case. It is enacted by its first section that all moneys that shall arise from the sale of any public lands of the province, shall be set apart for the purpose of creating a capital which shall be sufficient to produce a clear sum of one hundred thousand pounds per annum, which said capital and the income to be derived therefrom shall form a public fund to be called the Common School Fund; by section 2, that the capital of the said fund may be invested as therein mentioned and that the fund and the income thereof shall not be alienated but shall remain a perpetual fund for the support of Common Schools and the establishment of township and parish libraries; by section 4, that the grant of money out of the provincial revenue for common schools shall cease when the income from the school fund shall have realized fifty thousand pounds, with, however, a proviso that, if the income from the school fund fall short of that amount, the Receiver General shall complete that amount out of the consolidated revenue and repay these advances from the said income whenever it shall exceed the said sum; and by section 3, 'that the commissioner of crown lands under the direction of the Governor in Council, shall set apart and appropriate one million of acres of such public lands, in such part or parts of the province as he may deem expedient, and dispose thereof on such terms and eonditions as may by the Governor in Council be approved, and the money arising from the sale thereof shall be invested and applied towards creating the said Common School fund; provided always that before any appropriation of the moneys arising from the sale of such lands shall be made, all charges thereon, for the management and sale thereof, together with all Indian annuities charged upon and payable thereout, shall be first paid and satisfied.'\n\"An Order in Council of the 8th of October, eighteen hundred and fifty (1850), approved the report of the Commissioners of Crown Lands of the same date proposing the appropriation of one million acres of land for school purposes indicating and determining the lands so appropriated, to wit: in the counties of Huron, Gray, Bruce and Perth, and, as some of said lands not yet surveyed might contain swamps and lands of very inferior quality, suggesting that fifty-nine thousand six hundred and twenty-five acres in the township of Carrick be reserved until the quality of the unsurveyed part of one million acres be ascertained, and the department be authorized to make the exchanges, acre for acre, from the disposable Crown lands in the said township or elsewhere.\"\n\"An Order in Council of the seventh July, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-two, reduced the price of school lands in the counties of Bruce and Grey to ten shillings an acre, and decided that a measure be submitted to parliament to authorize the expenditure of a sum equal to two shillings and sixpence per acre of the purchase money on the improvement of roads and harbours within the said counties. That authorization was granted on the fourteenth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-three by the following section of the Act to amend the law for the sale and settlement of public lands (16 Vict. ch. 159.)\n'Sec. 14.\u2014It shall be lawful for the Governor in Council to reserve out of the proceeds of the school lands in any county, a sum not exceeding one-fourth of such proceeds, as a fund for public improvements within the county, to be expended under the direction of the Governor in Council, and also to reserve out of the proceeds of unappropriated crown lands in any county a sum not exceeding one-fifth as a fund for public improvements within the county, to be also expended under the direction of the Governor in Council: Provided always, that the particulars of all such sums, and the expenditure thereof shall be laid before parliament within the first ten days of each session: Provided always, that not exceeding six per cent on the amount collected, including surveys, shall be charged for the sale and management of lands forming the Common School Fund, arising out of the one million acres of land set apart in the Huron Tract.' \"On the third of July, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-four, an Order in Council fixed at ten shillings the upset price of the school lands in the counties of Huron, Perth, Bruce and Gray.\"\n\"An Order in Council of the twenty-seventh February, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-five, authorized the expenditure of thirty-five thousand five hundred and eighty-nine pounds from the improvement fund which the fourteenth section above transcribed of the Act 16 Vict. ch. 159, gave authority to establish. But it appears by an Order in Council of the seventh December, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-five (1855), that, notwithstanding the expenditure of twenty-five thousand pounds from the same, the improvement fund had not yet been set apart, and that the Crown Lands Department was directed to apprize the Inspector General of the amount at the credit of each county from the proceeds of sale of both Crown and School Lands, so that the proportions accruing to the improvement fund might be set apart by the Receiver General for that purpose.\"\n\"Such were the legislation and the Orders in Council under it relating to the Common School lands which I think important to notice at present, when the Consolidated Statutes of Canada took effect on the fifth December, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine. These last repeal 12 Vict. ch. 200; (ch. 29, sec. 5, and schedule A); but they incorporate at ch. 26 all the enactments of this last mentioned statute and of section 14 of 16 Vict. ch. 159, without in any way changing their sense so that it is useless to cite them again. It may be noted that the 14th section of 16 Vict. ch. 159, though forming part of that land Act, was omitted from ch. 22 of the Consolidated Statues of Canada, where the Land Act is reproduced; and that ch. 22 of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada was subsequently repealed by 23 Vict. ch. 2, which was still law at Confederation; and that, on the sixth March, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one an Order in Council rescinded that above mentioned of the seventh December, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-five.\"\n\"The Common School Fund was not dealt with by the Government of the province of Canada as the law directed; most of the lands set apart were sold and proceeds realized of the same, though kept as a separate fund which was credited with interest quarterly, (see Public Accounts of the Province of Canada, 1864 ii, p. 47; 1865 ii, p. 53; 1866 ii, p. 45; 1867 ii, p. 61) were not invested as directed by law, save $58,000 of the same which were exchanged for debentures of the Quebec Turnpike Trust, nor was the interest accruing applied towards the expenses of education, but the fund and the interest were left to accumulate, and the two hundred thousand dollars which the law required to be applied yearly for the maintenance of Common Schools was furnished out of the Consolidated Fund and exclusively charged to the same. So that, at the date of Confederation the funds in the hands of the Government amounted to $1,733,224.47, including the $58,000 debentures mentioned and $29,580 interest on the same, and it appears that $1,704,738 remained due upon the lands already sold, and 8,559 acres of land had not yet been disposed of. (See Langton's Report, Long Book, pp. 4 and 8).\"\n\"The British North America Act, 1867, (30 Vict. ch. 3), came in force on the first of July, 1867. By section 109 of the same all lands belonging to the Province of Canada and all sums then due and payable for such lands were given to the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, in which the same were situated or arose, subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof and to any interest other than that of the province in the same.\"\n\"It seems to be undeniable that the lands which had been set apart in execution of a special law directing it so that the proceeds of their sales should constitute a fund for the maintenance of Common Schools in the then two sections of the Province of Canada as well as the sums due or payable for the same were affected by a trust, and that Quebec, one of the sections, had in what remained unsold of these lands and in the unpaid balance of the price of those already sold, a special interest distinct from that of Ontario, where those lands were situate., We have already decided that the lands ceded by the Indians were affected with a trust for the payment of the annuities which were stipulated as the consideration of their cession, though the deeds of cession contained no stipulation to that effect, whilst the school lands were expressly set apart and dedicated to a special service required for the welfare and good government of the Province of Canada,\"\n\"The division of that province into two separate sections with distinct legislative powers could not without direct terms and did not revoke the dedication made for the common benefit of both; and far from so directing the British North America Act, as already mentioned, in giving the lands and the sums due for the same to the province in which they were situated, expressly stated that the lands and the unpaid balance of those sold did remain subject to the trust existing in respect of them and to any kind of interest other than that of the province to which they were assigned in the same.\"\n\"Was it possible to maintain in a more forcible way as against the unsold lands and what remained due of the price of those already sold, the existence of the trust with which they had been affected, and to reserve to the late Province of Lower Canada, made Quebec by that Act, the interest which it then had in both? To my mind, it was not. I deduce, from what precedes, that the Province of Quebec owes to the law and not to the award of eighteen hundred and seventy the right which it has to a share of the proceeds of the lands in Ontario whether sold or unsold, which have been set apart for the benefit of the common schools, and that its share was independent of that award. I will hereafter examine the effect the award had on the same.\"\nSuch was the opinion of the late Auditor Langton. At page 8 of his remarks in the long book headed 'Arbitration between Ontario and Quebec,' he expresses himself as follows: 'There are, however, many questions which are not represented by any items in the statement of affairs which will necessarily come before the Arbitrators. The most important of these in amount, are the amounts not yet realized from the common school lands. They are all situated in Ontario, and are handed over to that province, but subject to a trust, in which Quebec is interested to the extent of its share according to population, or in whatever other way the realized fund may be divided. The sums must necessarily be collected by Ontario, and it might either pay over annually to Quebec its share of the collections, less expenses; or, which would be much more convenient, the lands and arrears due might be valued, a deduction being made for costs of collection, and upon Quebec's share of the capital ascertained Ontario might pay five per cent interest. The best way of arranging this would be for Ontario to pay the Dominion so much more interest, and Quebec so much less. As to the valuation from a return made to me by the Crown Lands Department, the outstanding instalments amount to $1,7 [Illegible Text] 4,-738.00, and only 8,959 acres remained unsold, valued at two dollars an acre, or $17,918. As all the other instalments bear six per cent interest, the whole property can hardly be valued at less than $1,700,000, or, charging twenty per cent for costs of management and collection $1,460,000. Of this sum the share of Quebec would be, on its population in eighteen hundred and sixty, about $648,000, equal to an annual sum of $32,400.'\nAnd the treasurer of Ontario in his argument before the first arbitrators said (see Quebec case, p. 16; the whole speech is there cited as being in Vol. 220 of the miscellaneous pamphlets in the library at Ottawa): 'As to the outstanding moneys on lands sold, and the unsold lands, I think Ontario took them subject to the trust in respect of the same, and are therefore bound to collect the moneys, charging only the statutory allowance therefor, and when collected, to pay the money over to the Dominion, to be added to and held on the same trust as it holds the fund already in its hands.' And further on, speaking of the statute creating the Common School Fund, he said: 'By that Act the fund was created for the support of the Common Schools, as well in Lower Canada as in Upper Canada, and although the relations of the two sections of the late Province of Canada are now changed, yet in the Confederation Act it remains as it was before Confederation, and must be carried out in all its provisions; and therefore, Lower Canada must, in my opinion, according to law, have the same portion of the annual income from the capital of this fund as it would have had, had Confederation never taken place.'\n\"The several statutes authorizing this arbitration, namely, 54 & 55 Vict oh. 6, Canada; 54 Vict. ch. 2 (1891), Ontario, and 54 Vict. ch. 4 (1890), Quebec, at section 1 of each of them, limit the powers of the arbitrators and their inquiring into the accounts between Canada and the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec jointly and severally and between the two provinces to such questions as the three governments shall mutually agree to submit. The first agreement of submission which was approved and concurred in by the three governments, referred to the arbitrators the following questions which may have arisen from the controversy relating to the Common School Fund:\n'1. All questions relating or incident to the accounts between the Dominion and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec and to accounts between the two provinces of Ontario and Quebec, said accounts being understood to include, amongst other particulars, the following:'\n'(b) In the unsettled accounts between the Dominion and the two provinces, the rate of interest and the mode of computation of interest to be determined.'\n'(e) The arbitrators to apportion between Ontario and Quebec any amount found to be payable by the Dominion of Canada.'\n'(f) All other matters of account (1) between the Dominion and the two provinces; (2) between the Dominion and either of the two provinces, and (3) between the two provinces.'\n'(g) The rate of interest, if any, to be allowed in the accounts between the two provinces, and also whether such interest shall be compounded, and in what manner.'\n'(h) The ascertainment and determination of the amount of the principal of the Common School Fund, the rate of interest which should be allowed on such fund, and the method of computing such interest.' '(i) In the ascertainment of the amount of the principal of the said Common School Fund, the arbitrators are to take into consideration, not only the sum now held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada, but also the amount for which Ontario is liable, and also the value of the school lands which are not yet sold.'\n'5. It is further agreed by and between the parties hereto that the questions respecting the Upper Canada Building Fund, and the Upper Canada Improvement Fund are not at present to form any part of this reference, but this agreement is subject to the reservation by Ontario of any of the rights to maintain and recover its claims, if any, in respect of the said funds as it may be advised.'\n\"The last clause reserved to the parties the right to submit, upon mutual agreement, other questions or matters.\"\n\"It appears to me that; under clause (e) of this submission, being empowered to apportion between Ontario and Quebec the amount found to be payable to them by the Dominion, we could not only determine the amount due by Canada to the Common School Fund, but also apportion that amount between the provinces. But as this would divide only part of that fund, and as the statutes passed by the Parliament of Canada and by the legislatures of the two provinces, in eighteen hundred and ninety-four (1894) contemplate a division of the whole, and the counsel for Quebec did not insist upon a partition of anything but the annual interest, it may be that we should not go beyond establishing the total amount of the fund and dividing the income or interest derived therefrom.\"\n\"But it seems to me that, with the exception to our powers made by clause five (5) of the submission, we must determine the amount of the fund without any regard to the Upper Canada Improvement Fund and as if it did not exist, save by adding in the terms of the submission, that we do so under reservation to Ontario of its rights to maintain and recover its claim, if any, in respect to that fund. Both parties have argued that we have no right to pass on the question of that fund, true it is for different reasons, Ontario maintaining it has incontrovertibly been made hers by the first award, and Quebec that the award was in that respect, a nullity. It has been argued by Ontario that what was excluded by the reference was its claims for the addition to that fund of one-fifth of the proceeds of the Crown lands sold between June, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-three (date of the sanction of 16 Vict, ch. 159, which authorized the creation of that fund), and March, eighteen hundred and sixty-one, when the fund was abolished. But the reference permits no such distinction. It excludes in plain words the Improvement Fund, without exception. I do not see how we can take upon ourselves to say that that designation does not include the whole fund and to limit its meaning to a part of it only. To urge upon us that distinction or limitation it has been argued that Quebec never objected to that part of the award. But we find that the Treasurer of Ontario, on the ninth December, eighteen hundred and sixty-eight (1868), not satisfied with the statement of liabilities prepared by the Dominion,. transmitted to the Finance Minister at Ottawa one according to his views where he mentions the Improvement Fund at $5,180.04, as stated in the Dominion account, and puts down the Common School Fund at $1,733,224.47, without any deduction, and proposes that Canada should keep all investments on account of trust funds (Canada Sessional Papers, 1869, No. 46). In eighteen hundred and sixty-nine the same Treasurer sent another revised statement of debt where he charges $124,685.18 for the Improvement Fund, besides the $5,119.08, at which, after a small reduction therein specified, that Fund was entered in the Dominion statement of the debt. The statement so submitted by the Treasurer of Ontario was communicated to the Treasurer of Quebec, who, on the twenty-ninth of December, 1869, prepared himself a statement where he puts $5,119.08 as the only amount constituting the Improvement Fund. (Canada Sessional Papers, 1870, No. 11).\"\n\"That was a protest against the larger amount introduced by the Treasurer of Ontario in his statement. We find Quebec still protesting after the award.\"\n\"I do not think that the mention of the sum of $124,685.18 as part of the Improvement Fund in the joint case of Ontario and Quebec on the question of interest can be taken as an admission by the counsel for the latter province, that Ontario was entitled to that amount. As Mr. Girouard did put it, the only question then mooted was that of interest; and as the Improvement Fund was excluded by the reference, what was said or written about the Fund in the joint case prepared for the two provinces by the counsel for Ontario was immaterial and its exclusion not worth an objection by the counsel for Quebec to a case which, in all other particulars, met his views.\"\n\"But, moreover, No. 49, at pp. 65, 66 and 67 of the joint case on interest, was only a citation of part of the award, followed with a statement of the funds in the hands of the Dominion for the purpose of showing how the Government at Ottawa treated it and had come to the amount of the semi-annual interest there mentioned as paid to each province by that Government.\"\n\"I wish it to be understood that I express no opinion whatever on the merits or demerits of the pretensions of Ontario as to that Fund. What I say about the protest of Quebec is only to show that the exclusion of that fund from the matters submitted to our decision was not only to part of what Ontario claims to be the Improvement Fund but to the whole Fund.\"\n\"I now come to what, in the submission, is stated under letter (A), the ascertainment and determination of the amount of the Common School Fund.\"\n\"I think that Fund must be composed:\n1. Of the amount which is in the hands of the Dominion\n$1,733,224 47\nLess investment in Quebec Turnpike Trust Debentures\n$58,000 00\nAnd eight and a half year's interest credited, though not received\n29,580 00\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n87,580 00\nAnd subsequent payments by Ontario to the Dominion on account of that Fund, which were credits given Ontario for so much, and which must be debited to the Dominion from the date of the credit, 1889, December 1st..\nOf the credit, 1890, April 20th\n$1,645,644 47\n925,169 14\n11,103 70\n$2,581,907 31\n\"2. The debentures above mentioned and the interest due on the same.\"\n\"3. The amount received by Ontario on account of the price of school lands sold before and since the first day of July, 1867, less the two amounts above mentioned as credited by the Dominion on the first December, 1889, and the twentieth of April, 1890. In this must be included the amounts which will be established as erroneous entries and which are claimed by Quebec under No. 1 at p. 11 of its case, as $9,468.59.\"\n\"4. The outstanding balances due on sales of lands, which, in the reply of Quebec, are stated to have been on the thirty-first December, 1892, $485,801,65.\"\n\"5. The ascertained value of the lands unsold, if the parties agree to such valuation. If they do not agree, our award should state that the price of those lands when sold, less six per cent for management, shall form part of the Common School Fund and be accounted for by Ontario as such. I say less six per cent, though an Order-in-Council of the twenty-third June, eighteen hundred and sixty, authorized a charge of twenty per cent, because six is the amount fixed by 16 Vict, chapter 159 and by section 7, No. 2 of chapter 26 of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, and that an Order-in-Council could not change the law. The Treasurer of Ontario admitted in his speech above in part quoted, that the statutory allowance only could be charged.\"\n\"I do not think, either, that though the investment of part in debentures of the Quebec Turnpike Trust was not one authorized by the law, that the late Province of Canada can be made responsible for the same. The dealings of the province bound its two successors, the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and they have all along since recognized those debentures to be what they were considered by the late Province of Canada, that is as so much to be deducted from the amount received by the Province of Canada on account of the Common School Fund and as an absolutely valueless asset.\"\n\"Quebec cannot be made responsible for the same from the decision of the Privy Council in the case of Belleau et al v. The Queen[6], that the bearers of the debentures of the Quebec Turnpike Trust had no other recourse for their payment than against the trust.\"\n\"While on this subject, I may say that I entirely concur with the opinion expressed by my brother arbitrators at the argument, that the provinces have no recourse against the Dominion for the interest on said debentures which it appears could have been partly collected. Barring all other reasons, the two provinces having, by their dealings, concurred in the opinion that the debentures were valueless, could not afterwards, without notice to the contrary, and a request that the debentures themselves or the interest on the same should be collected, pretend that the Dominion was responsible for either.\"\n\"The claim which the counsel for Quebec qualified as a \"New Aspect\" is the addition to the Common School Fund of the amount from the sales of Crown lands by the Province of Ontario and Quebec since Confederation required to form, with the net proceeds of the school lands and the net proceeds of the public lands sold from the twenty-seventh of May, 1850, to the first of July, 1867, a capital sufficient at six per cent to produce an annual revenue of $400,000. It is founded on section 2 of the Statute, 12 Vict. ch. 200, which is in the following terms: 'All moneys arising after the twenty-seventh of May, 1850, from the sale of any public lands of the province, shall remain, or be set apart as part of the capital of said school fund until the same is sufficient at the rate aforesaid (six per cent) to produce the said sum of $400,000.'\n\"The Government of the late Province of Canada never carried that law into effect. It did not credit the Common School Fund with the proceeds of any of the public lands, but it furnished every year the whole of the $200,000 which the school law required to be applied for the establishment and maintenance of Common Schools, not only without charging any part of it against the revenue of the school fund, as directed by law, but adding quarterly interest to the same. Quebec could not, and does not complain of what was done in that respect by the late province, but it wants us to award that the Common School Fund must be credited out of the price of public lands sold by Ontario and Quebec since the first of July, 1867, with the amount required to make, with the price of the school lands sold, the value of those unsold and the price of the public lands sold from the twenty-seventh of May, 1850, to the first of July, 1867, after deducting a percentage for administration, a sum of $6,666,666.66.\"\n\"Ontario contends that the sale of lands in 12 Vict. ch. 200, comprises the lease of lands for cutting wood. I do not think so. The license to cut wood, though renewable, were made for one year only, and conveyed no proprietary rights in the soil. They were, as they expressed it, but a permit to cut timber (12 Vict. ch. 30, sec. 1, and Consolidated Statutes of Canada, ch. 23, sec. 2,) which when cut, was the property of the licensee. His license even contained a condition that lots thereafter licensed to settlers would be excepted from the limits in which he was authorized to cut. The amounts received from the licensees to cut timber being excluded, the price of the public lands sold from the twenty-seventh of May, 1850, to the first of July, 1867, together with the price of the school lands sold and the value of those unsold, did not, after deduction of percentage for administration, amount to $6,666,666.66,\"\n\"But Quebec has never urged what is now, and for the first time presented by its counsel as a \"New Aspect.\" It has always limited its claim to the part of the Common School Fund in the hands of the Dominion to the balances due on the first of July, 1867, by the purchasers of Common School lands, and to the proceeds of those lands sold since and the value of those unsold. This is admitted by its counsel, and the fact that they lay that part of its claim as a \"New Aspect\" is of itself a substantial acknowledgement that the province which they represent adopted the dealings of the Government of the late province in relation to the proceeds of the Crown lauds, and consented that they should continue to be dealt with as previous to Confederation. This is made the more apparent from the fact that Quebec during the twenty-five years which have elapsed since it became a distinct province has not kept a separate account of the proceeds of its Crown lands but has continued to merge them in its Consolidated Fund, and to deal with them as part of the same. Section 2 of 12 Vict. ch. 200, affected the lands of the whole Province of Canada, and, if the lands which section 109 of the Imperial Act made the property of Ontario could still be subject to the completion of the $6,666,666.66, amount required to complete the Common School Fund, those which by the same Act were made that of Quebec, were also subject to it. And the agreement, clause 3 (i), should have joined Quebec to Ontario when it stated that in the ascertainment of the amount of the principal of the Common School Fund, the arbitrators were to take into consideration not only the sum held by Canada but also the amount for which Ontario is liable and the value of the school lands not yet sold. The exclusion of Quebec shows plainly that the liability of Ontario was intentionally limited to the price of the school lands, as otherwise Quebec would have been liable for the price of its lands sold since the first of July, 1867, required, with those sold by Ontario after that date, to make up the above mentioned capital of the said Common School Fund. I take it, therefore, that the submission clearly excludes from our consideration what Quebec has presented as a \"New Aspect.\"\n\"The counsel for Quebec have not urged before us the claim against the Dominion for interest on collections not remitted by Ontario or moneys uncollected by that province. We have not to concern ourselves about it, save perhaps to adjudicate by the award that there is no liability in the Dominion on that score.\"\n\"As to the division of income, the assets in the fourth schedule of the Imperial Act were not the only ones which had to be divided between Ontario and Quebec. There were others as well as properties and credits of the late province which were common to the two sections of that province and which, alter the loss of its distinct existence, remained the joint property of its successors, Ontario and Quebec. Amongst others of that description were the Common School Fund, the credits of which formed part of that fund, and the lands which had been appropriated to the fund, and which the Act of Confederation had assigned to Ontario subject to the trust with which they were affected. That fund, as well as all other joint properties or assets which the Confederation Act did not assign to the Dominion or specially to either Ontario or Quebec, were to remain in the possession of the Dominion until they were either divided between, the two new provinces or regularly made over to one or the other.\"\n\"But though the possession of the fund remained with the Dominion until divided, the property of the same passed directly from the Province of Canada to its two successors, who hold it jointly. From the first of July, 1867, the Common School trust was the property of both Ontario and Quebec in the proportion of their respective populations, until a regular division should have changed that proportion.\" \"The Common School Fund had been created for a purely local service\u2014the maintenance of Common Schools. That service after Confederation devolved on the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, within whose jurisdiction it fell. The Dominion Government had no jurisdiction in the matter, could not continue it, or dispose of it. It was bound to hold it until divided between the two provinces and, until then, to give each province annually what on the first of July, 1867, apppeared to be the share of each province in the income produced by the fund. But the fund itself could not be left in abeyance, or its administration continued. It had to be divided and handed to the provinces in the proportions of their population at the preceding census, or perhaps in the proportion determined by the arbitrators. The law made this clear and it was so understood generally.\"\n\"In the statement of assets, which was prepared for the arbitrators, it is expressed as appearing that the part of the fund which had been allowed to accrue before Confederation should be divided as the grants were divided which should have been charged against it, viz.: according to population. In the principles upon which all transactions since the thirtieth of June, 1867, were to be introduced into the settlement of affairs of the late province, it is stated that 'the lands in each province were surrendered to them subject to existing trusts, and the Dominion is bound to see that the trusts are executed.' A very large sum, upwards of $1,700,000.00, remains outstanding on sales of Common School lands, situated in Ontario, but in which Quebec has a joint interest, and the apportionment of this asset must be left to the arbitrators. In the principles upon which the statement of affairs of June 30th, 1867, was to be revised in preparation for the arbitration between Ontario and Quebec, we also find, 'but as Ontario and Quebec have a joint interest in the Common School Fund, the investments for that fund and the accrued interest thereon must be handed over to Ontario and Quebec conjointly, to be dealt with by the arbitrators.'\n\"In the suggestions by Mr. Langton, Auditor General, speaking of the Common School Fund, he says: 'As the educational grants, which ought to have been charged against this fund so far as it would bear them, have always been distributed according to population, the fund ought to be similarly treated, and would give to Ontario $964,940.27, to Quebec $768,284.20, unless indeed the population, as it is presumed to have stood at the date of the Union, be assumed as the basis.'\n\"The treasurer of Ontario did not, in December, 1868, contemplate that the School Fund 'would remain as a trust in the hands of the Dominion.' Writing on the fifth of December, 1868, about the Trust Funds, which the then Minister of Finance proposed to keep on paying five per cent, and mentioning specially amongst others the Common School Fund, he wrote (Canada Sssional Papers, 1869): 'I do not think the Government of Ontario have any authority to deal with these funds as you propose. Its action would be ultra vires. If the people of Ontario should decide to have these funds invested it may be, and most likely would be, that they could invest them in good security at six per cent. Your Government owes these moneys. Instead of paying the principal you propose to pay five per cent in perpetuity. I am not prepared to say the people of Ontario will accept this proposition. As these funds are for public purposes, it may be that Ontario and Quebec may sweep them away altogether and merge them in the general revenues of the provinces, and provide, by annual grants or otherwise, for the object contemplated by the creation of these special funds. By doing so it would save much labour and many complications.'\n\"At a subsequent conference, to be found in the same papers, he renews his objection to leaving the Common School and other funds in the hands of the Dominion.\n\"It was to put an end to the joint ownership and joint liability of the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec that section 142 of the Imperial Act enacted: 'The division and adjustment of the debts, credits, liabilities, properties and assets of Upper Canada and Lower Canada shall be referred to the arbitrament of three arbitrators, one chosen by the Government of Ontario, one by the Government of Quebec, and one by the Government of Canada.'\n\"This section contains the extent and limit of the powers of the Arbitrators. They could adjust and divide; they could do nothing else without exceeding their authority. They could not decree that the joint property of the two provinces should forever remain undivided and be held conjointly by them in perpetuity. They could not create an everlasting trust and charge the Dominion with its execution. They could not, as they have done, assign a portion of the Common School Fund to one of the Provinces and direct that the rest should remain forever undivided and be transferred, or made over in trust to the Dominion which they charged with its execution. This was neither a division nor an adjustment of the joint property of the provinces. Adjust may have a larger meaning than divide; but it cannot be extended beyond regulating the accounts, putting them in order, making them accurate and conformable to the existing rights. In awarding that three-fourths of the Common School Fund should remain in trust in the hands of the Dominion to be by it invested and the proceeds paid by that Government in certain variable proportions to the provinces, the arbitrators were exceeding their authority, and what they did was ultra vires. This has struck one of the counsel for Canada, Mr. Ritchie, who, speaking on the interest question, remarked that the arbitrators had no such powers. Mr. Justice Burbidge seems to have been so impressed at the argument, and it is plain that they had not. The consequence of having so exceeded their authority was to make their award in relation to the part of the Common School Fund in the hands of the Dominion and the uncollected price and interest of the lands set apart for the maintenance of Common Schools whether sold or unsold, a nullity. Their award so far was ineffective and could be resisted when it came in force. These are the expressions of the Lord Chancellor about what is ultra vires in the argument before the Privy Council. Speaking of what the arbitrators were alleged to have done in excess of their authority, he expressed himself as follows: 'These gentlemen were executing a Parliamentary power. It is not as if it was a private arbitration under a private instrument. Either this was within their power or was not. If it was not within their Parliamentary power, it goes for nothing.' And further still, 'there is a certain thing to be done under a certain Act of Parliament by particular individuals named. If they do anything more than they are authorized to do, it cannot have any possible effect.'\n\"The Government of Canada, though it has paid half-yearly to the provinces the interest on the amount belonging to the School Fund which it had in its hands, cannot be said to have accepted the trust so thrown upon it; but, even supposing that it did, its acceptance could not have made valid what was void, nor made effectual against Quebec, which was one of the parties interested, an unauthorized and illegal award to which it had not consented, and the object of which was to keep it in a kind of tutelage so far as the School Fund was concerned.\"\n\"The judgment of the Privy Council in 1878 has often been alleged as confirming the award of 1870, and barring any objection to this award. But a reference to the case submitted by the provinces, to the question which that tribunal was called to answer, to the answers it has made and to the pamphlets containing the argument before it, will make it evident that the Privy Council did not pay attention to the objections to the award which were not specifically raised in the case; and confirmed the same upon the questions propounded in the said case without in any way considering the objections, which Mr. Benjamin had invoked against the paragraphs 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the award.\"\n\"The making and publication of their award was the exhaustion of the powers and authority of the arbitrators. They could not afterwards correct it, nor complete it by providing for what they had omitted. Appointed as we are to determine and award, amongst other things, all matters of accounts between the Dominion and the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and between these two provinces, we have to examine the statutes and the first award; and, if we find that any part of the award is null or void, we must proceed to the determination of said accounts as if that part of the award did not exist.\"\n\"The paragraphs already mentioned, namely, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the award of 1870, being void for excess of authority, they are inoperative, and the school trust is and has always remained, since the first of July, 1867, the joint property of the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and has ever since that date been held by them, absolutely as they then did. The income or interest which the fund produced had therefore to be divided between them in accordance with their respective rights at that date, that is, in proportion to their population, as ascertained by the then previous census, which was that of 1861.\"\n\"The division had to be complete and final, independent of any ulterior action. On that point I cannot do better than cite the opinion expressed by the late Mr. Gray, Dominion arbitrator: 'The powers of the arbitrators will close with their award, and that award must be so made that it can stand entirely per se, and not be dependent in any way upon ulterior action by either of the parties to the arbitration. It must give the asset, it must assign the burden\u2014clear and unequivocal, whatever it may be, the asset must become the undoubted property, and the debt the undoubted burden of the one province or the other, as the case may be.' (Quebec Sessional Papers, 1870, No, 11.)\"\n\"This is a correct definition of the duties of the arbitrators under sec. 142 of the Imperial Act. I cannot understand how the two of them, who must have drawn the award, came to do quite the reverse with the Common School Fund; and that, instead of dividing it, as the law directed, and giving to each of the two parties an undoubted property of its share, they decided that the fund be left in the hands of a third party forever, and the interest only be paid in variable portions to each of the two owners of the fund.\"\n\"Their award, so far as the Common School Trust was concerned, had no finality, which is an essential element to the validity of all arbitrators' award. Russell on Awards, 7ed. part II, ch. 5, sec. 4; Randall v. Randall,[7]; Ingram v. Milnes,[8]; Smith v. Wilson,[9]; Bhear v. Harradine,[10]; Williams v. Wilson et al.[11].\"\n\"Russel cites a decision in an annonymous case, which is to be found in Dyer, p. 242a. That decision seems to me to be especially applicable to the case before us. It is that of a reference respecting the right, title, interest and possession of a certain parcel of land, where the award, instead of awarding the property in the land, only gave a profit out of it. It is precisely what has been done with the Common School Trust by the award of 1870. That this award, so far, was not final, is rendered more than apparent by the legislation that the Dominion and the two provinces have been obliged to originate for the division of that trust. Canada, 57 Vict., ch. 3; Ontario, 57 Vict., ch. II; Quebec, 57 Vic., ch. 3.\"\n\"I am of opinion that, if the arbitrators had not exceeded their powers and jurisdiction as I think they have, their award on the Common School Trust would be defective and void for this last reason, want of finality; and that we should award as I have already mentioned, that the income or interest produced by the School Fund should be divided irrespective of what the award of 1870 pretends to have ordered, and according to the population of Ontario and Quebec in 1861.\"\n\"N B.\u2014By sec. 3 of the British North America Act, 1867, the Dominion of Canada was to come into existence on the day fixed by a proclamation of Her Majesty. That proclamation was issued on the 22nd May, 1867, and fixed the first day of July, 1867, as that on which the three Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, should be united and form the Domini of Canada. Paragraphs 7 and 9 of the award of 1870 profess to deal with the Common School Fund as held on the 30th June, 1867, by the Dominion of Canada. But the Dominion had then no existence, and did not hold the Common School Fund, which, at that date, was still held by the Province of Canada.\"\n\"There is a very wide difference between annulling the first award and finding that it is on its face null for being ultra vires\u2014as I think it is for dealing with the School Trust otherwise than directed by law, which empowered the arbitrators to divide and adjust and not to maintain it in division forever and to create a trust in relation to the same. If so doing was ultra vires, the award is, in the words of Lord Cairns, already quoted in my memoranda, ineffective and without any possible effect, goes for nothing and can be resisted, and we must treat it as such not for extraneous matter but for matters appearing on the face of it,\"\n\"I admit that we must, in that case, consider the Common School Trust as it was at Confederation, that is a Trust Fund for the benefit of the Common Schools of Canada, in which the two sections of that province named in the statute were then interested to the proportion of their population at that time. The law especially mentions the two divisions Upper and Lower Canada (sec 5, C. S. C. c, 26) as the divisions of the provinces to which the income of the Fund must be apportioned, and therefore the schools for the maintenance of which the trust was created were the schools of Upper and Lower Canada. The B. N. A. Act, 1867, changed nothing in that law and in the right of the two sections, or rather of Upper and Lower Canada whose names it has changed to those of Ontario and Quebec.\"\n\"The trust was absolutely for local or provincial purposes and therefore ceased to be under the disposal of the Governor-General, whose duties, so far as provincial matters were concerned, devolved on the Lieutenant-Governor of each province.\"\n\"But it had first to be divided as a common fund and if it has not yet been legally divided, it is still in common; and, called to establish its amount, we must do so taking it as it was on the first of July, 1867.\"\n\"The lands had, under the law, been set apart for the maintenance of Common Schools in the two sections of the province; such was their destination. It mattered not where they were situated, they were affected by the object for which they had been so set apart, and which was a trust existing in respect of them; and the successor of Lower Canada, Quebec, was one of the two beneficiaries who had an interest in the same (sec. 109). Section 129 did for the laws in force in Canada before Confederation what secs. 139 and 140 did for the proclamations. C. S. C., oh. 26 remained in force and applied to Ontario and Quebec as it had applied, before the first July, '67, to Canada and its two divisions, Upper and Lower Canada.\"\n\"The Legislature of the Province of Canada had made the trust perpetual; but it could have altered the law and ordered its division between Upper and Lower Canada. It could even have put an end to the trust and declared its extinction. The division of Canada into the two provinces by making it the distinct and separate property of Ontario and Quebec, did not affect its perpetuity, which remained an obligation on each province so long as it did not legislate otherwise. But as it was theirs, the arbitrators had no authority to award that it should remain in the hands of a third party forever.\"\n\"If the first arbitrators had exercised the powers which the law had vested in them, that is divide and adjust the trust, they could have assigned to Ontario a much larger share than to Quebec; but as they have assumed an authority which had not been conferred on them, the whole of their award on that Trust Fund is null and thereby without possible effect.\"\n\"I have already expressed that the fact that part of the trust consisted in lands in Ontario, which were made the property of that province subject to the trust, offered no obstacle to the division, as what was to be divided was the proceeds of the lands and all that was required for an effectual division was to award that Ontario should account to Quebec for a determined proportion of the price when realized.\"\n\"It seems to me that the cases of legacies to bodies which had ceased to exist at the death of the testator have no analogy to the case before us. Legacies take effect at the death of the testator, and as if made on that date. If the name legatee had previously lost its existence, there is nobody to receive the gift which returns to the general representative of the estate. But if the body to which the legacy was made had still its existence at the death of the testator, it received the gift, and its separation afterwards into two distinct bodies does not revoke the gift or deprive each of its share of the same, especially when each of the two continue the work which the legacy was expressly made to help.\"\n\"The statute created the trust for the maintenance of Common Schools in Canada, but directed that its income should be divided between Upper and Lower Canada, nominally, (C. S. C. c. 26, s. 3,) for the support of Common Schools in each, which is equivalent to the trust being made for both. It had been carried into effect for a number of years previous to the two sections of the province being divided, and their names, and nothing but their names changed. Even in case of a legacy the mere change before the death of the testator of the name of the legatee would certainly not deprive it of the gift.\"\n\"If in establishing the amount of the school fund in the hands of the Dominion we deduct the $124,000, which, in the accounts submitted to our review, are deducted therefrom for improvement fund, we decide thereby that Ontario is entitled to that much for the improvement fund, and we therefore pass upon a matter which is specially excluded from our jurisdiction by the reference.\"\n\"If the arbitrators had divided, as they were directed to do, the Common School Trust Fund, however unjust the partition would have been, they would have acted within the scope of their jurisdiction, and their award, so far, would have on its face been legal; but called upon to adjust and divide that trust, they have chosen to award as to most of it what they had no authority to do, and in that, have exceeded their jurisdiction and made their award a nullity not only as to the part of it which is ultra vires, but as to the whole of that trust fund, as well as the amount of one hundred and twenty-four thousand dollars as the rest. The nullity of an award as to one point affects and nullifies the whole decision as to the other questions or subjects connected therewith, as admitted by the Lord Chancellor in the argument before the Privy Council.\"\n\"The Common School Trust was one complete asset. The other assets could be separated from it, and therefore, the award as to the others was not affected by the illegality of the same as to the school trust. But no part of the school fund or trust could be separated from the others. It was to be adjusted upon or divided in its entirety as one. It is upon that ground that I find null the deduction of $124,000, as well as the other deduction for improvement fund, and the whole of their award so far as it extends to the subject of the Common School trust.\"\nBURBIDGE J.\u2014His Lordship cited the matters referred and the statutes appointing the arbitrators and proceeded as follows:\n\"Now, it is to be observed that the arbitrators are given authority, among other things, to determine all questions relating to or incident to the accounts as rendered by the Dominion to the provinces up to January, 1889 (Par. 2) (a) and (c), and to ascertain the amount of the principal of the Common School Fund, taking into consideration the sum then held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada (Par. 3) (h) and (i); but subject to this limitation, that the questions respecting the Upper Canada Improvement Fund are not to form any part of the reference.\"\n\"Turning now to the accounts rendered by the Dominion to the provinces up to January, 1889, the first mention I find of the Common School Fund is at page eight, Schedule A of Exhibit V, or No. 56, where it is stated at the sum of $1,733,224.47, which it is conceded on all sides was at the date of the Union the amount of the fund, including therein the sum of $58,000 invested in the Quebec Turnpike Trust Debentures, and also a sum of $29,580, arrears of interest on such debentures, which at the time were considered to be valueless. Then we find the fund mentioned again in Schedule A of the same Exhibit at p. 43, where, in the Ontario and Quebec subsidy account, the provinces are credited with interest on the Common School Fund, the first credit being of an amount of $41,141.11 for a half year's interest due January 1st, 1868; that is, one half year's interest at five per centum upon a sum of $1,645,614.47, the balance of the fund mentioned after deducting the amount of the Quebec Turnpike Trust Debentures, and accrued interest. Some of the other credits of the half year's interest on the fund, as given in this account, are stated at amounts in excess of that mentioned, but the reason therefor and the error have been explained, and not being material to the question now before us need not be further referred to.\"\n\"In Schedule C. of the same Exhibit, page 102, the Common School Fund is stated in the account in the following manner:\n'Common School Fund\n$1,733,224.47\nLess Investments: Quebec Turnpike Trust\n$58,000.00\nArrears of Interest on Turnpike Trust\n29,580.00\n87,580.00\n$1,645,644.47'\n\"At page 121 of the same schedule, in a statement of the Province of Ontario account, the province is credited with the Upper Canada Improvement Fund, amounting to $124,685.18. This sum of $124,685.18 is an amount which, by the award of the third September, 1870, was deducted from the Common School Fund as held by the Dominion at the date of the Union. In the same statement of account, at page 123, in the Province of Ontario account, the province is credited on the thirty-first day of December, 1867, with its share according to population, of one half year's interest on the Common School Fund, stated to be $1,520,959.21 (it should be twenty-nine, not twenty-one cents), and at page 139 the Province of Quebec is credited with its share of the interest, the amount of the fund being stated at the same sum or figure. Like entries respecting the Common School Fund, the Upper Canada Improvement Fund, and the amount of the former fund on which the Dominion credited the provinces with interest will be found in other exhibits. These statements present this difficulty, that in one place we find the amount of the Common School Fund stated at $1,645,644.47, without any deduction for the Upper Canada Improvement Fund, while in two other places the fund is stated at $1,520,959.21, the balance of $124,658.18 being credited to Ontario as part of the Upper Canada Improvement Fund. Now, but for the limitation as to the matters referred, contained in the fifth paragraph of the Agreement of Submission, the arbitrators would without doubt have authority to correct this discrepancy in the statements of the accounts, according to their view of what the rights of the parties to the reference are. The parties have, however, agreed that the questions respecting the Upper Canada Improvement Fund are not at present to form part of the reference, subject to the reservation by Ontario of any of its rights to maintain and recover its claims, if any, in respect of the said fund. The reservation was, it is admitted, made at the instance of Quebec. In the proposals set out in the Order-in-Council of the twelfth of December, 1890, mentioned in the Agreement of Submission, it was stated that the outstanding question as to the Upper Canada Land Improvement Fund was not to form part of the reference unless the Quebec Government thereafter consented to include the same. There were at the time two questions relating to this fund. One had to do with the deduction from the Common School Fund of the sum of $124,658.18 made by the award of September, 1870, and the further deduction of twenty-five per cent which the Province of Ontario was thereby authorized to make from any moneys collected after June thirtieth, 1867, on School Lands sold between the fourteenth of June, 1853, and the sixth of March, 1861; and the other was a claim made by Ontario that the Upper Canada Improvement Fund should be increased by a further sum of $101,771.68, representing one-fifth of the receipts from Crown lands sold between the dates mentioned. The first question had been dealt with by the arbitrators appointed under the 142nd section of The British North America Act, 1867, and the other had never been passed upon, and was, I think, the \"outstanding claim\" that it was intended to exclude Quebec had nothing to lose but everything to gain by bringing again into debate the question that had in the earlier arbitration been determined against it. The credit to Ontario of the sum of $124,658.18 on account of the Upper Canada Improvement Fund was one of the items of the accounts which in express terms were referred to the arbitrators \"to be determined upon.\" Then we have seen that the arbitrators are empowered to ascertain and determine the amount of the principal the Common School Fund and in doing so to take into consideration not only the sum then held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada, but also the amount for which Ontario is liable. But how is that to be done without either including or excluding the deduction for the Upper Canada Land Improvement Fund? Either there is such a fund, consisting so far as the moneys are in the hands of the Dominion of Canada of a sum of $124,658.18, or there is not; and either the Province of Ontario is liable for the total of the sums collected from school lands, less six per cent for management, without any deduction for the Upper Canada Improvement Fund, or it is not; and when we determine that liability, we must, from the necessity of the case, either make or not make the deductions. So, for myself, I should, if it had been necessary, have been prepared to hold, and so far as it may be necessary I am prepared to hold, that incidentally we have jurisdiction to deal with the Upper Canada Land Improvement Fund so far as that fund depends upon collections arising from the sale of school lands. However, for Ontario and Quebec both, it is contended that the arbitrators have no such jurisdiction, it being in substance argued for Ontario that the result is that the arbitrators must take the \"sum\" mentioned in clause (i) of the third paragraph of the Agreement of Submission, as then \"held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada,\" to consist in the first place of the amount of $1,520,959.29 mentioned in the accounts, leaving the balance of the $1,645,64447 to be credited as it is in the accounts to the Province of Ontario as part of the Upper Canada Land Improvement Fund; while for Quebec it is contended that the whole of the sum of $1,645,644.47 should be credited to the Common School Fund. Now, if we adopt the latter view, we must strike out of the statement of accounts submitted to us the amount of $124,685.18 that has been credited to Ontario, and add that sum to the $1,520,959.29 at which in that part of the accounts in which the statement has any effect upon the results the amount of the Common School Fund has been stated. That clearly is to deal with and pass upon the subject of the Upper Canada Improvement Fund. I do not forget that the learned Chief Justice of Quebec suggests that we could state the amount of the Common School Fund at the larger sum with an intimation that we had not determined whether or not any deductions should be made on account of the Upper Canada Improvement Fund. But that, it seems to me, is to refuse to exercise our authority. That is, not to ascertain and determine what the amount of the Common School Fund is, but to decline to determine such amount. And even if some such an expedient were open to us with reference to the $124,685.18, I do not see how it could avail us when we come to determine the amount for which Ontario is 'liable' On the other hand, if we adopt the contention put forward on behalf of the Province of Ontario, it will not be necessary to make any changes in the items now in question in the accounts submitted, or to do or say anything with respect to the Upper Canada Improvement Fund, except to leave it in the statement of accounts where we find it. Wherever in the accounts submitted the Common School Fund is stated at $1,645,644.47, it is so stated as one of the items of a balance sheet, and to show at what the Commou School Fund stood as a liability at the union of the Provinces of Canada, and the result is all the same, whether it is so stated at the sum mentioned or whether it is divided into two parts, and one given as the amount then due to the Common School Fund, and the other as an amount owing to the Upper Canada Improvement Fund. I am of opinion, therefore, that in determining the amount of the Common School Fund, we must start out with the sum of $1,520,959.29 which we find that the Dominion held for the two provinces, and on which we find them credited with interest in the accounts submitted to us.\"\n\"Before leaving this part of the case, I wish, however, to add that whatever view may be entertained as to our authority to deal with the matter, I think the deductions from the Common School Fund made by the award of September, 1870, and those thereby authorized to be made on account of the Upper Canada Land Improvement Fund, were under all the circumstances of the case, just and proper deductions. The Common School Fund has had the benefit accruing to it from the sales of the land being made on the understanding that one-fourth of the proceeds would be set apart to make roads through such lands and other improvements for the settlers, and it was only common fairness and honesty to give effect to that understanding. I agree with the learned Chief Justice of Quebec that the question as to whether or not in making and authorizing such deductions, the arbitrators exceeded their powers, is not concluded by the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in respect to such award. Their Lordships, in answering in the affirmative the question as to whether the award was valid or not, were careful to confine their answer to the 'objections made to the award in the special case;' and it is clear from the notes of the argument that the question as to whether or not the arbitrators had exceeded their powers in dealing as they did with the Common School Fund, was not thought to be one of the objections made to the award in the special case. But I cannot, for myself, see wherein, in making such deductions, the arbitrators exceeded their powers. It may be that in so far as the award may be taken to place the fund in the hands of the Dominion for all time, the arbitrators exceeded their powers, but that would not avoid the award in respect of matters within their powers if the view of their status and position suggested by the Lord Chancellor in 1878 should prevail. During the argument of the special case stated on the award and matters incident thereto, he gave expression to the view that the arbitrators were persons executing a \"Parliamentary power;\" that they were called arbitrators in the statute because they must have some description; that it was not the same as a private arbitration under a private instrument; and that if what they did was not within their parliamentary power, it went for nothing, but if it was within such power, there was no objection to it.\" \"On the 11th January, 1889, by an arrangement between the Province of Ontario and the Dominion of Canada, the province was debited with, and the Common School Fund credited with, an amount of $925,625.63, that Ontario admitted to have in its hands as arising from collections made in respect of sales of: School Lands, and on the 19th of April, 1890, Ontario was in like manner debited with, and the Common School Fund credited with, a further sum of $11,103.70 These two sums are, in determining 'the sum held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada' on the 31st day of December, 1892, to be added to the sum of $1,520,959.29 before referred to, making the total sum so held at that date $2,457,688.62.\"\n\"The next question to be determined is, 'the amount for which Ontario is liable' to the Common School Fund. We are not at present asked to state the amount in figures. That would not be possible with the materials before us, but we have to decide some questions preliminary to a final determination of the amount.\n\"And first I agree with my colleagues whose opinions I have had the great advantage of reading, that Ontario is not liable out of the proceeds arising from the sale of Crown lands, other than the million acres set apart for that purpose, to contribute anything to the Common School Fund. I also agree that out of the moneys collected or received by Ontario on account of the Common School Lands set apart in aid of the Common Schools of the late Province of Canada, the province is entitled to retain six per centum for the sale and management of such lands. I am also of opinion that out of the proceeds of the said lands sold between the 14th day of June, 1853, and the 6th day of March, 1861, received by the Province of Ontario, the province is entitled, after deducting the expenses of management as aforesaid, to take and retain one-fourth of the balance of such proceeds for the Upper Canada Improvement Fund. The Province of 'Ontario is liable,' it seems to me, in respect of moneys received from the sales of school lands made between the dates mentioned for the amount collected, less six per cent for management, and less twenty-five per cent of the balance; and in respect of moneys received from the sales of other school lands the province is liable for the amount collected less six per cent for management. Where sales of school lands made between June 14th, 1853, and March 6th, 1861, have been cancelled and the lands resold, Ontario is, I think, liable for the amount received, less only the six per cent for management. Of the moneys collected by Ontario for school lands sold, Quebec alleges that sums amounting in the aggregate to $9,468.59 have not been credited to the Common School Fund, and Ontario claims that certain refunds chargeable against the fund have also been omitted. I agree, of course, that in respect of these or any other errors or omissions the accounts rendered by Ontario of moneys received on account of the Common School Fund are open to correction.\"\n\"Then, with respect to the sum invested in the Quebec Turnpike Trust debentures and the interest due thereon, I agree with my learned colleagues that there is in respect of such debentures no liability on the part of the Dominion to either of the provinces, or on the part of Quebec to Ontario. Whatever sums may be realized from the principal moneys due on such debentures, or from the arrears of interest due at the date of Union should be added to the principal of the Common School Fund, and whatever sums may be realized from arrears of interest that have accrued due since the Union should be apportioned between Ontario and Quebec in the same proportion as the interest on the fund is apportioned.\"\n\"What I have said covers, I think, all the questions now to be dealt with in respect to the Common School Fund, except the claim put forward in the Quebec statement of the case, that the Dominion is liable to Quebec for interest on the moneys that Ontario should have paid into the fund from time to time. The question is of no practical importance and has not been pressed and should be dismissed. Whatever sum Ontario is found to owe to the fund as principal money, should, I suppose, be debited to Ontario in the Ontario account as of the 31st of December, 1892, unless some other date should be agreed upon, and with respect to any interest on such fund, that Ontario may at that date be found liable for, Quebec's share thereof should be debited to Ontario in the Ontario account and credited to Quebec in the Quebec account.\"\nThe Province of Ontario gave notice of appeal from said award as follows:\n\"Take notice that the Province of Ontario, under the provisons of the statutes above mentioned, hereby appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada from the award of the arbitrators herein, bearing date the 6th day of February, 1896, in so far as the same implies or declares any liability by Ontario in respect of the Common School Lands or Fund.\"\n\"And further take notice that Ontario will, on the hearing of such appeal, limit its contention and except as to so much of paragraphs 2 and 3 of the said award as determines the liability of Ontario.\"\n\"First, as to paragraph 2 of the said award, which states 'That the Province of Ontario is not liable out of the proceeds arising from the sale of the Crown lands of the Province other than the million acres of Common School Lands set apart in aid of the Common Schools of the late Province of Canada to contribute anything to the said Common School Fund.'\n\"Ontario appeals against so much of the finding in the said paragraph 2 as implies that Ontario is under any liability in respect to the Common School Fund or Lands.\"\n\"Second, as to paragraph 3 of the said award, which states 'That subject to certain deductions the Province of Ontario is liable for the moneys received by the said province since the first day of July, 1867, or to be received from or on account of the Common School Lands set apart in aid of the Common Schools of the late Province of Canada.'\n\"Ontario appeals against the finding in the said paragraph 3 of liability of Ontario as thereby decided.\"\n\"And Ontario asks that the Supreme Court of Canada declare that Ontario is not liable in respect of the matters set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the said award, whereby Ontario is declared liable, and that there is and has been no liability on the part of Ontario in respect of lands in Ontario known as the Common School Lands, or in respect of moneys received or to be received by Ontario from or on account of Common School Lands.\"\nAnd Ontario further asks that the said award be varied accordingly, or otherwise amended as the said Honourable Court may deem necessary and proper.\"\nThe Province of Quebec also appealed; the notice of appeal being the following:\n\"Take notice that the Province of Quebec, under the provisions of the statutes above mentioned, hereby appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada from the award of the arbitrators herein, bearing date the 6th day of February, 1896, made in respect to the Common School matter, in so far as such award permits or allows any deduction from the amount of the principal of said Common School Fund for the Upper Canada Land Improvement, or Upper Canada Improvement Fund.\"\n\"And in this respect the Province of Quebec will contend that under the provisions of paragraph 1 of the award, the principal of the Fund should be augmented by the sum of $124,685.18, and that under paragraph 4 of the said award, the amount of twenty-five per centum referred to in the paragraph mentioned secondly, should not be deducted.\"\n\"And the Province of Quebec will ask that the said award be varied accordingly, and amended so as to not permit of any deductions from the principal of the said Common School Fund, for any sums for the said Upper Canada Land Improvement Fund, or Upper Canada Improvement Fund.\"\nThe following counsel appealed on the hearing of the appeal:\nW. D. Hogg Q. C. for the Dominion of Canada.\nHon. Edward Blake Q.C., \u00c6milius Irving Q.C. and J. M. Clark for the Province of Ontario.\nN. W. Trenholme Q.C, F. L. B\u00ebique Q.C. and Hon. J. S. Hall Q.C for the Province of Quebec.\nOn behalf of the Province of Quebec a motion was made to quash the appeal of Ontario from the said award on the ground that it was limited to the question of that province being under any liability at all in respect of the Common School Fund and Lands, a question which, it was alleged, was not raised nor argued before the arbitrators, but came up for the first time on this appeal. The court reserved judgment on the motion, and directed the hearing to proceed on the merits.\nCounsel for Ontario were first heard.\nBlake Q. C.\u2014The first part of my task is to show to your Lordships what was the origin and nature of the Common School Fund, and what was the situation at the time of the passing of the British North America Act, in order that one may discern what effect that statute produces upon the situation, so existing.\nThe first statute respecting the fund was 4 & 5 Vict. ch. 18, passed on 18th Sept., 1841, an Act to make further provision for the establishment and maintenance of Common Schools throughout the provinces.\nIt is provided by the second section, that for the establishment, support, maintenance of Common Schools in each and every township and parish in this province there shall be established a permanent fund which shall consist of such moneys as may accrue from the selling or leasing of all lands which the legislature or other competent authority may hereafter grant and set apart for the maintenance and support of Common Schools in this province.\nThen it provides that \"all such moneys as shall arise from the sale of any such lands or assets, and certain other moneys hereinafter mentioned shall be invested in safe and profitable securities in this province, and the interest of all moneys so invested, and the rents, issues and profits arising from such lands or estates as shall be leased or otherwise disposed of without alienation, shall be annually applied in the manner hereinafter provided to the support and encouragement of Common Schools.\"\nNow, I call attention at the start to that which runs through the whole of these series of statutes. That is, that it was a provision by the legislature of one single province, the province of united Canada, to provide for the establishment and maintenance of a system of Common Schools in the province, and that anything that was being done in the way of a creation of a fund, whether of capital or of income, was for the purpose of dealing with the Common and Public Schools set up by, controlled by, and capable of being moulded by the legislature of that province.\nSec. 3 provides: That for the establishment, support and maintenance of Common Schools in this province there shall be granted to Her Majesty annually, during the continuance of this Act, the sum of fifty thousand pounds currency, to be distributed among the several districts in the manner hereinafter provided, and such sum shall be composed and made up of the annual income and revenue derived as aforesaid, from the said permanent fund and of such further sum as may be required to complete the same out of any unappropriated moneys which are now raised and levied, or which may hereatter be raised and levied by the authority of the legislature, to and for the public uses of this province, and the said annual grant shall be and be called the Common School Fund.\"\nI call attention to the fact that, from the start and throughout, the provision with reference to this fund was one which, as I shall have to show presently, was not observed, viz., that the annual proceeds of the fund, interest and profits of the fund which it was designed to raise by the sale or rental of lands, were to be applied towards the payment of a sum of \u00a350,000; that at least the grant was to be made up to \u00a350,000 out of the consolidated fund.\nThen the fourth section provides that \"it shall be lawful for the Governor of this province, by letters patent, under the great seal thereof, to appoint from time to time one fit and proper person to be superintendent of education in this province, and such superintendent shall hold his office during pleasure and shall receive such yearly salary not exceeding the sum of seven hundred and fifty pounds currency as the Governor may appoint; and the duties of the said superintendent shall be:\u2014\n\"1st. To apportion in each and every year, on or before the third Monday in May in such year, the money annually granted by the legislature as aforesaid among the several municipal districts in the ratio of the number of children over five and under sixteen years of age that shall appear by the then last census of the province to be resident within such district respectively.\"\n\"2nd. To furnish the Receiver General of the province for his rule and guidance, with a certified statement or list of the apportionment of the money granted by the legislature under the provisions of this Act, as aforesaid, among the several districts.\n\"3rd. To certify the apportionment of the public money as aforesaid to the treasurer of each and every of the said districts, respectively, who shall lay the same before the district council to the end that each district council may direct, and they are hereby authorized and required to direct, such a sum to be raised and levied for the purposes of this Act, and within their respective districts, over and above all rates laid for other purposes, as shall be equal in amount to the money so apportioned from the provincial treasury.\"\nThe next Act is 7 Vict. ch. 9, and it recites once again:\n\"Whereas it is expedient to make further provision for the establishment and maintenance of Common Schools throughout this province, be it therefore enacted * * * that the sum of fifty thousand pounds annually, now granted by law for the maintenance and support of Common Schools in this province, shall, from year to year, be apportioned by order of the Governor of this province in council between the divisions of this province formerly constituting the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada in proportion to the relative numbers of the population of the same respectively, as such numbers shall, from time to time, be ascertained by the census next before taken in each of the said divisions respectively.\"\nThat was a difference in detail, but not in principle. The principle of division before had been the number of children between 5 and 16 in each municipal district; the principle of division now is according to the number of the whole population as ascertained by the census.\nAnd then there is the temporary provision because there had been no effectual census in Lower Canada, that until an effectual census was made in Lower Canada there should be a fixed division of the fund. Of course I need not say that that is immaterial, because censuses were taken, and the permanent provision came into operation shortly afterwards.\nThen, on the 30th May, 1849, the Legislature determined to increase the amount, and they said it was desirable that the annual sum of \u00a3100,000 should be raised from the public lands for the maintenance and support of Common Schools, \"and that so much of the first moneys to be raised by the sale of such lands as shall be sufficient to create a capital which shall produce the said annual sum of one hundred thousand pounds at the rate of six per cent per annum, should be set apart for that purpose; be it therefore enacted * * * that all moneys that shall arise from the sale of any of the public lands of the province, shall be set apart for the purpose of creating a capital which shall be sufficient to produce a clear sum of one hundred thousand pounds per annum, which said capital and the income to be derived therefrom shall form a public fund to be called the Common School Fund.\"\nThen they provided by the second section, \"that the capital of the said fund shall from time to time be invested in the debentures of any public company or companies in the province, which may have been incorporated by an Act of the Legislature, for the construction of works of a public nature, and which said company or companies shall have subscribed their whole capital stock, paid up one-half of such stock and completed one-half of such work or works, or in the public debentures of this province, for the purpose of creating such annual income.\"\nAnd then I call your Lordships' attention to this provision:\u2014Which said fund and the income thereof shall not be alienated for any other purpose whatever, but shall be and remain a perpetual fund for the support of Common Schools, and the establishment of township and parish libraries,\"\nThen they provided \"that the Commissioner of Crown Lands under the direction of the Governor in Council, shall set apart and appropriate one million of acres of such public lands, in such part or parts of the province as he may deem expedient, and dispose thereof on such terms and conditions as may by the Governor in Council be approved, and the money arising from the sale thereof shall be invested and applied towards creating the said Common School Fund; Provided always, that before any appropriation of the moneys arising from the sale of such lands shall be made, all charges thereon for the management or sale thereof, together with all Indian annuities charged upon and payable thereout, shall be first paid and satisfied.\"\nThen:\u2014\"That so soon as a net annual income of fifty thousand pounds shall be realised from the said school fund, the public grant of money paid out of the provincial revenue for Common Schools, shall forever cease to be made a charge on such revenue; Provided always, nevertheless, that in the meantime the interest arising from the said school fund so to be created as aforesaid shall be annually paid over to the Receiver General, and applied towards the payment of the yearly grant of fifty thousand pounds now appropriated for the support of the Common Schools;\" Provided further, that after the said annual sum of fifty thousand pounds shall have been taken off the Consolidated Revenue, if the income arising from the said school fund shall from any cause whatever fall short of the annual sum of fifty thousand pounds, then it shall and may be lawful for the Receiver General of the province, to pay out of the said Consolidated Revenue such sum or sums of money as may from time to time be required to make up such deficiency, the same to be repaid so soon as the said income of the said school fund shall exceed the said sum of fifty thousand pounds.\"\nAnd then 16 Vict. ch. 159, sec. 14, provides: \u2014\"It shall be lawful for the Governor in Council to reserve out of the proceeds of the school lands in any county a sum not exceeding one-fourth of such proceeds as a fund for public improvements within the county, to be expended under the direction of the Governor in Council, and also to reserve out of the proceeds of unappropriated Crown Lands in any county a sum not exceeding one-fifth as a fund for public improvements within the county, to be also expended under the direction of the Governor in Council.\"\nThen ch. 26 the Consolidated Statutes is the next, and I think the last of these antecedent statutes which is to be referred to. (Here follows the recital and first five sections of the Act.) And then there is a repetition of the provision as to what was to happen; so soon as a net annual income of two hundred thousand dollars, from the lands has been reached, and a happy state of the case which has not arisen.\nAnd then the Governor in Council may reserve out of the proceeds of the School Lands in any county, a sum not exceeding one-fourth of such proceeds, and out of the proceeds of unappropriated Crown Lands in any county a sum not exceeding one-fifth thereof, such sum to be funds for public improvements within the county and to be expended under the direction of the Governor in Council.\nThat is the condition of things under the statutes at the time of the passing of the British North America Act. And, to the result of that condition of things, as far as the statutes go, I am not for the moment dealing with what was actually done with the moneys, and how the fund which was said to exist at the passage of Confederation was created; but, under the statute I submit the result is there was a legislative provision for the Common Schools of the old province, which schools, under the control of the legislature of the whole province, were public schools, and which provision was necessarily subject to legislative action at any session of Parliament.\nThat being the state of the case, I now bring up the question to what the actual condition of the assets which are the subject of this contention was on the 30th June. They are to be divided into two great separate subjects. The first is the so-called Common School Fund, a sum certain which is treated as if it had been a sum of money actually in the hands of the old Province of Canada representing the sum which ought to have been collected and invested and put to interest under the statute. The second is of an entirely different character. It is the sum which represented the purchase money uncollected but due by private purchasers of the million acres of lands which had been almost entirely within nine or ten thousand acres sold, and which purchase moneys were partly paid and partly unpaid. The considerations which are applicable to these two subjects differ, but before I reach the question of how far they differ, I want to present to your Lordships what their state was at the moment. In order to do that, I have nothing more to say at the moment on the second head of that part which consisted of uncollected purchase moneys of lands, and of a few thousand acres of unsold lands.\nSomething, however, I have to say with reference to the part which constituted what has been ordinarily called the Common School Fund. With the exception of one small investment, which had better probably not have been made, an investment of certain debentures of the Quebec Turnpike Trust, no investments whatever were made of the principal moneys which were collected out of the million acres; they were not invested in the debentures of the province; they were not invested in the debentures of corporations as authorized by the Act. The Quebec Turnpike Trust was a small sum. I may have to mention it for another purpose, but it has been settled, and we are fighting about it no longer.\nBut, something more was done, or something else; the duty was to have applied the interest from these sales of lands yearly towards the $200,000 a year, and it was only to supplement the deficiency after that application that the consolidated revenues of the provinces were to be or could be called upon. Instead of adopting that course, what was done was to pay yearly out of the consolidated funds the whole $200,000, and to leave in consolidated fund the whole of the revenues, principal and interest. The book account was kept, and oddly enough no account was taken of the circumstance that that book account which included the interest as well as the principal, could not truly represent a liability of the province towards this fund, so to speak, while it included that interest, or to the extent to which it included that interest, because that interest was applicable towards the payment of the $200,000 a year, and when say $50,000 of interest came in in any one year and went into consolidated fund, and when $200,000 was paid out of consolidated fund under the provisions of the statute $150,000 only really came out of consolidated, the other $50,000 was really under the statute paid out of the proceeds of the lands. Not- withstanding that, this book account, the aggregate of which makes the $1,700,000 odd, remains, which, apart from the question of the Land Improvement Fund, constitutes the fund at the time of Confederation. This book account embraces all these payments of interest, although year after year they really were used pursuant to the statute, being paid into and out of consolidated fund in the payment of $200,000 a year, as far as they went.\nThe next point is to emphasize before your Lordships this fact, that when Confederation came there was not a shilling in actual hand in specie put in the bank, representing this fund. It was a simple book account like other book accounts, representing not the asset in any shape or form, but only a supposed liability to itself.\nThere is thus no asset of the Province of Ontario or the old Province of Canada in this regard whatever, excepting the Quebec Turnpike Trust, and I call your Lordship's attention to the fact.\u2014The 113th section of the British North America Act prescribed:\u2014\n\"The assets enumerated in the fourth schedule to this Act belonging at the Union to the Province of Canada shall be the property of Ontario and Quebec conjointly \"\nThe fourth schedule being looked at includes the Quebec Turnpike Trust. It was an asset. It was transferred; but, what was called the Common School Fund was not an asset. If it was anything it was a liability. Whether it was a liability or not is the question which is to be considered, but it was certainly not an asset, and there was nothing to transfer whatever in that connection.\nThen as to the purchase moneys uncollected, or land sold. This stands for the principal part upon a wholly different footing. It depends upon another clause of the British North America Act, and it is not affected by the increase of Debt Act, or such irrevocable changes as to those to which I have referred. And, in order to ascertain what the position of things was, as constituted by the British North America Act, any difference in contrast to the funds or the lands, one has to turn of course to section 109 which does not merely by implication, but by express language include the sums due upon the lands.\nSo that it is clear beyond dispute that these lands and these purchase moneys for sold lands within the Province of Ontario belong to the Province of Ontario, unless it can be established that there is a trust in respect to them, or an interest of other provinces in respect of them, and the title of the Province of Ontario still subsists, notwithstanding that, except to the extent of the trust or interest. They are Ontario's, subject to whatever other interest there may be. Then we come to consider that question which the arbitrators had before them in the Indian annuities case, upon which they came to a conclusion which was reversed by this court, whose reversal was sustained by the judicial committee, upon the question of trust or interest.\nPerhaps it may shorten things if, before I proceed to consider what the facts were as to that I would look and see what light is to be drawn as to the meaning of this trust or interest from the decisions to which I have referred.\nI refer to the case of the Indian annuities[12], and to the judgment of his Lordship the Chief Justice, at page 503 and following pages. His Lordship proceeds to analyse the documents in question in order to ascertain whether there was under them any charge or lien under the surrender of the lands, and he says \"there is, therefore, no ground for saying that there was any express charge, lien or trust. Then, if there is any charge it can only be on the principle of the equitable lien of an ordinary vendor of real property, and from analogy to the rules of courts of equity applicable to such liens. I think this argument entirely inadmissible.\"\nThen the judgment proceeds to give the reasons for that, pointing out that the Indians had the highest security, and then discusses the argument upon the Privy Council decision in the St Catherines Milling Company v. The Queen[13], and holds that that does not apply as was contended.\nWe have there light upon the proper consideration to be applied to the question whether there is a trust or interest.\nSo again in the judgment of Mr. Justice Sedgewick, at page 537 and following pages. The Privy Council judgments are to be found in the Appeal Cases for '97. Counsel referred to pages 210, 211 and 213\nThe ground taken by the Chancellor is: (The learned counsel quoted from the Chancellor's judgment at pp. 617-621 ante.)\nThen following out the general line to be traced in the reasoning which I have just read, my first argument is that it is an entire misconception of this whole case to speak of there being in the time of the old Province of Canada, any trust in this matter, or any interest other than that of the province in respect of these lands.\nI say there was none whatever in respect of the fund, in respect of the lands, in respect of the purchase money; there was no trust, there was no interest. But, I say secondly, if you are to assume a trust or interest, that trust or interest was such in its nature as was by Confederation, by that radical change of conditions which took place in the very subject matter, not merely destroyed, but rendered impossible of any replacement, for after that day there never could be a common school of the old Province of Canada. Such a thing was impossible and rendered impossible by the Act.\nNow, my lords, I proceed to do what in the course of the arguments on these appeals I may often have to do, to argue upon the hypothesis that I fail in the argument which I have just been addressing to you. I proceed to invite your Lordships to consider, because it is very material, if there was a trust or interest: What was that trust or interest? And, I will state to your Lordships why it becomes material, because we have a major and a minor controversy. The major controversy is as to whether there is any trust or interest, in which case we contend at any rate with reference to the land, and subject to the considerations to which your Lordships has adverted, as to the fund, it is Ontario's. Then, there is nothing to divide. But, they contend that not merely is there a trust or interest, but that the division of that trust or interest has not been effectual, and that the true division of that trust or interest ought to be something different. They contend that the division ought to be according to the population at the late province of Canada as it stood in the year 1861, being the last census before 1867.\nNow, their whole case rests upon the proposition that there was a trust or interest, and I am now in a very few words about to present to your Lordships what seems to me to be the unavoidable conclusion as to what the trust or interest was, if there was one at all. Because, it seems to me that that renders it impossible to go outside the propriety upon that theory of the case of the award of 1870. I have not yet got to that award, but I refer to it as indicating the pursuance of a course which, if the arbitrators had this matter within their power, was the only course which they could equitably and justly have taken.\nI ask then: What was the trust or what was the interest? In order that there may be a trust or interest, one must assume of course a cestui que trust at any rate, and the power to create a trustee. One must assume an interest in some other than the proprietor of the land. How was this trust or this interest created? It was created, admittedly, only by the statute. What in respect of the question of apportionment of the fund\u2014whether the apportionment of the principal, when authority exists in anybody to apportion the principal\u2014or in the apportionment of the income which alone was contemplated by the trust, was the provision? The provision which with singular inconsistency Quebec sometimes asks you to speak of as a sacred and perpetual trust to be rigidly observed through all the variations of time and changes, political and otherwise. And, what was it? It was a provision that the money should be divided between the two territorial divisions of the one Province of Canada, yearly in proportion to the population as ascertained by the last preceding census. The fund itself to remain forever. The yearly fruits of the fund to be divided in this way forever. That is the provision. I need not read again the clauses of the Act. I do not suppose it will be disputed that that is in truth the provision.\nNow, I want to know whether, if there be a trust or there be an interest, that trust or interest can be anything other, anything greater, anything less, than the statute which created it disclosed. I have shown I think that there is nothing, but, if there be something it is that which the statute shadows forth, and the statute shadows forth a perpetual fund, divisible year by year between the two territorial sections of the old Province of Canada in proportion to the population of each of those sections as ascertained by the last preceding census.\nNow then I pass from the condition of things as it stood upon their hypothesis at the period of Confederation to the effect of the award of 1870.\nAnd I may be permitted to make a preliminary observation with reference to that award, which is that I, for my part, am not disposed for a moment to suggest any difference of opinion from the judgment of the Chief Justice of this court in the Indian Claims Case, as I understand that judgment with reference to the general view that ought to be taken upon the subject of this award. I go to the main question with reference to intra or ultra vires with reference to this matter.\nThe theory, as I have stated, on which Quebec must rely, on which it does rely, is that there was a trust. If so, the trust must be executed, and I do not think it is pretended that in any other instance, and if not in any other, why in this, the arbitrators had power to declare or decide a trust at all. The lands are the lands of Ontario under the Act, subject to whatever may be the trust, or interest of other persons. The arbitrators were not to determine what those trusts or interests were, or how they were to be administered at all. That was left for the law, or for convention, or for statutory arrangements between the parties; but it was not left for these arbitrators.\nThe Province of Quebec has claimed that the right of that province depends in respect of the Common School Fund, not upon this award at all, but upon prior statutes, and upon the British North America Act alone. This is important in view of the situation in which we now find ourselves on both sides.\nThe Province of Quebec has filed several documents which indicate what its present relation to this award is.\nAmongst them is first, the case before these arbitrators in which Quebec submits that whenever it can be shown upon any other objection, that is to say, any objection other than those made in the special case, the award is contrary to law, and that it is invalid, that it is the duty of the present arbitrators so to declare.\nOur contention is that there being in truth no trust, the award of 1870 could not and did not create one. We say that there was in this respect either a trust or not a trust. That the statute had prescribed that the lands were ours, subject to existing trusts or interests, and that those arbitrators could not either create or define trusts; but, that if the first award could create it, it could do it only according to the terms, which are not division, but perpetuity, and, as I have said, division of the income according to successive censuses. That is the thing which the first award has attempted to do. That was the only thing that could be done. But, as I have said, the function of those arbitrators was limited to division or adjustment, and the thing which was the only thing that could be done in this regard was a thing which they could not do. But, if contrary to all that, it should be held that the arbitrators had power to deal with the trust, and had power to make the appropriate declaration with reference to a trust, then I contend with the utmost confidence that if it is granted that they had the power, and if it is held that this was in point of fact, or that they had power to make it, a trust although it was not a trust then, that what they have done is literally to comply with the terms of the trust, that is to say just as literally as upon the theory of its continued existence it would be complied with. I say it cannot be complied with literally, but upon this hypothesis these objections have been overborne, and the arbitrators have adopted the cy-pr\u00e8s doctrine, and made that as near as could be, as they were bound to make it as near as could be and in respect of the capital, perpetual, and in respect of the income being divided, and in respect of the division of the income being in the varying proportions to be found by the censuses, they have just followed the terms of the award, and if they had power to deal with it at all, they had power to deal with it in this way.\nThen let us look at the award. Sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 are those which apply to this matter. Of these the 7th and 8th deal with the Land Improvement Fund, and I do not touch the other at this moment. First of all by the 7th, they take $124,000 out of the Common School Fund. And by the 8th, they deal not with the Common School Fund as it was, but the residue of the Common School Fund after that deduction, so that assigns to Ontario $124,000 out of the supposed assets of $1,700,000, and then they proceed to deal with the remainder of that fund. Their award is with regard to the remainder only as to its apportionment. Then, how do they deal with it? That it shall continue to be held by the Dominion of Canada, and the income realized therefrom, from the 30th day of June, 1867, and which shall be hereafter realized therefrom, shall be apportioned between and paid over to the respective provinces of Ontario and Quebec.\nThen I read sections 9 and 10 of the award.\nNow, as I have said, I should have pressed your Lordships very earnestly with reference to the question of the book accounts. The proposition that I have advanced as to the actuality of that, and as to the possibility of adding to the public debt of the province in the way in which it was done, that they had no power at all, but I argue that if they had a power, that there can be no doubt whatever that their disposition is final. If they had power to deal with it in this way, they have dealt with it finally, and there is no reversing it; I cannot contend against that at all.\nThen as to the other parts, 9 and 10, I argue as before, that the question whether Ontario lands were subject to any trust is one of law disposed of by the British North America Act, and that the arbitrators had no power either to annul or to create or to change any trust or interest, and that if some trust or some interest might have been within their power, a trust or interest of such a character that it was not capable of being dealt with by them within their power to divide or adjust, cannot in the nature of things be within their power.\nI should have thought it was only putting it ex majori cautel\u00e2, because I could not conceive nor think anybody would ever suppose it was contemplated to hand over to the province, beneficially, the lands which had been sold to somebody, and the purchase money paid, and all that remained was getting out the patents. They handed them over as they were, subject to the existing interests and rights of other people; and, it expresses that which I think would have been implied, and I do not think it expresses anything more.\nTherefore our suggestion is that this was beyond the power of the arbitrators, and therefore remained an open question. And, endeavouring as far as I can to combine the different links of the argument, which apply to one thing at the same point, our secondary suggestion is that if it be held that it was within the power of the arbitrators, that there is no dispute whatever that it was to be treated as an existing trust, and on the theory that it was an existing trust, they did as near as possible apportion.\nThen I come to a different allegation, which has to do with the state of things created by the award, which is, that the province of Ontario is bound because Mr. Treasurer Wood who represented the province at the time of the arbitration thought this was a trust and said so to the arbitrators.\nIt is well known that the public is about the worst served subject, and that it is in the public interest that the public, and high political organizations, should not be bound by defaults and negligences and admissions without authority of those who have charge of their business. I believe that is a sound view. It tells enormously against me in the argument I shall have to address to your Lordships in answer to my learned friend's appeal, but it is in my favour upon this argument, and having my choice of which attitude to take, I have the satisfaction of taking the attitude which I really believe is the sound one, except with reference to the increase of Debt Act; there you had other provinces who were not before the court, there you had a great settlement by statute\u2014short of that I do not see what this long array of letters, correspondence and Orders in Council have to do with the case. The case seems to me to present very clear and simple propositions, viz.: that if the thing be within the power of the arbitrators, it is not open here, if not within, it is open and you have to decide what has to be done. So that if Mr. Treasurer Wood expressed the opinion before the first arbitrators that this was a trust, and suggested to them the way they should deal with it, he would not be making any concession which could bind the province. He might have been right, or he might have been wrong in his law. If wrong I do not think the province was bound, and I do not think his concession conferred jurisdiction.\nThe facts, of course, were not in dispute at all. So, again, as to the mode of dealing by the arbitrators which he there suggested should be taken. That is as to the mode of making the trust perpetual and dividing the income, ordering the income to be divided instead of dividing and adjusting the whole fund. If that was beyond their power his concession did not bring it within, and that view is put very prominently by Chief Justice Casault, although I very much quarrel with the inference, it seems to me, His Lordship draws from that view.\nThen all is therefore open. Because there was no trust nor interest, because there was no power in the arbitrators to declare a trust, to do more than divide, and they have not divided and could not divide, and therefore they could do nothing.\nWell the next stage is the Privy Council judgment, which I think does not affect the decision on either point of view, and I just pass it by with that statement.\nNow, I want to make a general observation. Although, as I have said, I argue that it is not material what was the attitude during this long series of years of these two Crowns towards one another, I have to point out what appears to have been their general attitude, which is explanatory I think of a good deal which might otherwise be difficult of explanation. It is well known of course that the province of Quebec repudiated the binding force of the award altogether, and that after a considerable time it remained in a sort of impasse, Quebec said no, the award is bad, and an effort was made to obtain a case, and it failed, and things went on for a number of years as public things do before any arrangement could be made whereby any sort of decision could be arrived at upon the points upon which Quebec contended that the award was void. That state of things lasted for a good many years until shortly before the reference to the Privy Council. During that interval different suggestions were made by the authorities. There is one letter to which I wish to refer of the then Attorney General and the Prime Minister of the province of Ontario to the corresponding authority I believe of the province of Quebec dated 10th of June '73, in which he argued out the question at great length as to the proposition which Quebec insisted still was the true proposition, the true ratio decidendi, and made suggestions that for peace sake Ontario would be prepared to do so and so, and that it would be as beneficial or more beneficial to Quebec than their proposition. He failed to persuade his adversary, as I am afraid frequently happens. Then on the 12th September 1876, is a rather important letter of the Secretary of Ontario, showing the attitude of the province.\n\"Under the award several hundred thousand dollars are payable by Ontario to Quebec in respect of school lands in this province realized by this Government since Confederation, but, if the award is not acted upon there would be a question for discussion and consideration, whether Upper Canada should not retain the products of all its own school lands.\"\n\"These moneys, for these and other reasons, have been retained until either the award is accepted or a new settlement made; and I am to say that this Government is very desirous of avoiding further delay in the settlement of this and all other matters between the provinces.\"\nThen, not very long after that came the reference to the Privy Council, and the appearance of Quebec and of Ontario, and the decision against Quebec upon the points submitted in this special case.\nNow, I think that the fair result of the correspondence was that Ontario was willing to accept the award on the understanding which it entertained, and which it was justified in entertaining from the course of Quebec, that Quebec did not voluntarily accept, but for the decision of the Judicial Committee was ready to act upon the award, and that both parties for a long time occupied that sort of relative motion. Quebec fancying Ontario was ready to accept the views of the award without raising any question as to the Common School Fund, Ontario fancying that Quebec was ready to accept the view with reference to the Land Improvement Fund, not as to the $101,000 which was, as was contended, to come out of Crown lands, with which the arbitrators did not deal in terms, although we contend they did impliedly. That is an outstanding question which you have not before you, and which was really the reserved question in this award which we contend. 1 say that was the general attitude with the exception of that $101,000, being 20 per cent on the sales of the Crown lands, as to which the arbitrators had not in terms dealt, as to which Quebec declined to accede to any method of disposing of the question, and as to which it is not to be disposed of under this.\nThen we come to this reference, and to the action under this reference\u2014I am reserving the minute discussion of what the terms of the reference are for a moment, because I deal with the general conduct\u2014 then it turns out in that course that the province of Quebec wants to bind Ontario to the award as to the Common School Fund, in so far as it is an acknowledgement of liability, to hold itself free to contend that the award is void as to the Common School Fund altogether and that the division prescribed by the award should be replaced by a division more favourable to the province of Quebec, to tie Ontario by the hands and say you shall not say a word against the award about the Common School Fund, but we say that it is all open and free for us to contend that it is a bad award, and that in truth we ought to get a great deal more for it. That is the condition of affairs into which the situation had grown before the arbitrators made the award which is now under appeal.\nAs I have said to your Lordships in my answer to the motion to quash, the conclusive answer to the suggestion that this was not directly disputed before the arbitrators, the point in respect of which we now appeal, is in their certificate. If the pleadings, so to speak, the statement of the case, was defective, if there was acquiescence or admission, it was perfectly competent to the arbitrators to have called the parties before them and to have said, we consider that such and such things are open for argument, and ought to be argued. What has been done is that the arbitrators have discussed these questions as to whether there is any liability, and as to what the extent of that liability is under that award. We ask it should be found that it is nothing. But, they contend there must be something found, and if something, we are driven to find this particular amount. We say that the question is absolutely open, because you are to ascertain what the amount of the liability is.\nThen upon the reference therefore, and upon the action taken before the arbitrators, and so on, I hold first of all that this is within the reference, and secondly the certificate of the arbitrators that they proceeded upon a disputed question of law is final and conclusive upon the point that my learned friend suggests, viz., that it is being raised for the first time before your Lordships.\nHe says that this disputed question of law, which the arbitrators have certified was raised before them, is being raised here now for the first time before a court of original jurisdiction.\nI cannot conceive that these learned and eminent judges, sitting in as near an absolutely judicial capacity as men can sit, would have entered at great length which they did, particularly Judge Casault, into a point that had not been discussed before them, and points which were not relevant, and which they did not think relevant to the issue, and yet I see them all discussed fully, but my learned friend said, he had no opportunity of saying a word about it, we are going perhaps to look at the notes of the argument, and are going to say that this is not raised, and that is not raised and the other is not raised. Those were all matters for the arbitrators, and the certificate settles all that.\nI open the question from this point of view, and suggest a certificate as showing it is a disputed question of law, and that we are entitled to have that so certified disputed question of law decided; that the language of the reference wholly serves to remit the question. It does not decide the principle upon which the question should be decided. It does not impose an obligation to find a liability if there was no liability. It leaves everything open. There was a question of how much if anything, if nothing the arbitrators should find nothing. The whole suggestion is one alien to the position which I have ventured to propound, that these political corporations, to be bound by fine suggestions of pleading, delay, estoppel, neglect of counsel and so on, and therefore that the whole thing is at large, and upon this disputed question of law, viz.: whether the province of Canada is under any liability in respect of the Common School Fund, and the Common School Fund Lands, we hold that under the British North America Act, and ask your Lordships to hold, it was under no such liability, that there was no trust or interest, that first the arbitrators had no authority to decide it, that it therefore remains according to the common case of both parties, because my learned friend says, and Judge Casault says, that this award in respect of the Common School Fund is void, it remains untouched, and now to be decided, and being to be decided must be decided in accordance with the arguments which are suggested in favour of the view that there was no trust or interest, and therefore that the lands and funds of Ontario belong to Ontario.\nTrenholme, Q.C., for the respondent, the province of Quebec: From the point of view of Quebec, the learned counsel who has opened the appeal for Ontario has introduced into the matter a great many questions which Quebec thinks have no relation whatever to the present appeal. The learned counsel has dwelt very largely upon pretentions put forward by Quebec before the arbitrators. Of all these pretensions none are in question in this appeal.\nThe solitary question here is this, whether Ontario has a right upon this appeal to have it declared that there has been, and that there is, no liability on her part in respect of these so-called school lands, and of this school fund. That is the question in this appeal. The pretentions that Quebec puts forward in her case before the arbitrators, no matter what those pretentions are, have all been abandoned except the one; but, no matter what they are, can they give jurisdiction to this court to determine that question in favour of Ontario? Do they give jurisdiction in any degree to this court? Surely the appeal of Ontario if it stands at all, must stand upon its own merits. It must stand upon the ground that Ontario has a right to come before this court now and ask this court to determine that there was no liability whatever on its part in respect of these school lands and in respect of this school fund. That is the whole question in this appeal. There is nothing beyond it, except matter being invoked for the purposes of illustration, for the purpose of showing that there was an estoppel, or what was in issue between the parties.\nI have already argued that the statute authorizing this arbitration, and the deed of submission, recognize liability on the part of Quebec, and that the plain common sense interpretation of that deed of submission is that there is a liability, and that the arbitrators are simply to ascertain the amount of that liability. The arbitrators are told, that in the ascertainment of that they are to take into account, not only the fund in the hands of the Dominion but the amount for which Ontario is liable. That admits that Ontario is accountable for something, no matter how small it is; if the liability exists, there is the admission of that liability; and, then if we go further we see that they are to take into account the value of the school lands. Why, that would be an absurd provision to put into a deed of submission if there were no school lands.\nThere is no question in this submission as to whether Ontario is under any liability or not; that question is originated here for the first time.\nWith regard to whether Ontario can raise this question before the courts, we maintain in the first place that it is not in the deed of reference, we maintain as we did this morning in arguing the motion that it was not in dispute between the parties, and we maintain also that the arbitrators have really not declared upon this subject at all. All they have done in their award is to recite the enunciation of what had been agreed upon in the deed of submission. They go no further in declaring or establishing the liability of Ontario than what is stated in the deed of submission itself. They simply lay down rules for ascertaining the amount of that fund, and without any declaration or any intention of declaring, that there was liability on the part of Ontario.\nWe say that Ontario is estopped from bringing up this question in this appeal in the way stated by the admission of liability in the deed of reference, and also by the admission in her answer.\nNow, if your Lordships will turn to the case, your Lordships will see the attitude that Ontario has taken with regard to this question of liability, and that there is no denial on the part of Ontario that there is a liability in respect to the million acres of school land. The denial is simply with regard to the Crown lands, the new aspect as it has been balled here, the claim of Quebec to have a large sum appropriated on account of the sales of other Crown lands. In all these places we find that Ontario, as in her answer, never raised this question as a part of her answer, as a part of her defence. She has never raised this question that there was no liability on her part from one end of the answer to the other. There is not a clause that could have been struck out before the arbitrators on the ground that it was not included in the reference or for any other reason, because there is no such allegation in the answer. Ontario does say that Quebec has only a right, if any, to this fund under the award.\nHas Ontario a right in this appeal to go into that matter? Must not her appeal here stand upon its own merits? For instance, suppose Quebec were to discontinue her appeal altogether, would Ontario have any right to come here and maintain an appeal? What Quebec pretends and all that Quebec pretends in her present appeal is this: that in her appeal, that if it be the case, as there seemed to be some authority in the dicta of the learned members of the Privy Council\u2014 if it be the case that the part of the award by which the Improvement Fund is deducted or claimed to be deducted from the School Fund can be separated from the rest of the award, and it is ultra vires, it may be disregarded, and that that item representing the Improvement Fund may be considered as still forming a part of the School Fund, but what I maintain is that the pretentions of Quebec have nothing to do with this appeal. This appeal has to stand upon its own merits and Ontario must come here and must show that she is appealing against something that the arbitrators had jurisdiction in; that this matter was before the arbitrators; and cannot come here and raise it for the first time, as in a court of original jurisdiction.\nThe award then of 1870 is invoked by Ontario. She asks to have this set aside. So long as the award stands it seems to me that it is a complete estoppel to Ontario; and especially, as it has not, as I said, been assailed by the proceedings before the arbitrators. She has taken no steps whatever to have this award set aside. Now for the first time she seeks to ignore this award.\nWe claim that Ontario is estopped, and we think there is estoppel as between provinces which are litigants. We maintain that she is estopped by the whole past course, thirty years conduct, in relation to these matters, not only by the opinions and admissions of Mr. Wood, who appeared before the arbitrators of 1870. Mr. Wood's opinion is there. The Hon. Mr. Mowat, Premier of the province of Ontario, gives his opinion, which is also there. Your Lordships will see that Mr. Wood says distinctly that Quebec has an interest in this fund and in these lands. That was the opinion of Ontario's representative at least at the time of the award, and the lines laid down by Mr. Wood at that time were actually followed, substantially, in the award made by the arbitrators of 1870.\nThen in a letter which the learned counsel has quoted to the court, of the Premier of Ontario, Mr. Mowat, to the Premier of Quebec, the court will see that Mr. Mowat says also in the most distinct manner that the fund, including the school fund which belonged to the two provinces before Confederation, belongs to them still. Your Lordships will see the very words used by the Premier of Ontario are these:\u2014\n\"The various funds from time to time set apart by the Parliament of old Canada, for either section, belong to that section still.\" That was an admission of liability, but we say Ontario was right in her interpretation of that transaction. She was right in her interpretation then, and she is not right now. Her whole course for thirty years is conformable to that opinion and opposed to the position that she is now taking before this court.\nNot merely have we the expression of opinion of individuals, servants of the Government of Ontario, but we have got the same acknowledgements in the statutes of Ontario.\nThe first statute is the statute of 35 Victoria, in 1872 (Ontario):\u2014\n\"An Act relative to arrears due upon Common School land sold previously to 1st July, 1867.\"\nYour Lordships will see that this is an act to reduce the price of these lands.\nParagraph 2 of the statute says:\u2014(Reads section.)\nThen the next statute is still more important for this reason, that it not only acknowledges the right of the Province of Quebec, but it recognizes the right of the Province of Quebec under the statute, not in virtue of the award of 1870, but it recognizes that Quebec had a right to share in this fund under Consolidated Statutes of Canada, chapter 26. That is 46 Vict. ch. 3.\nThen still later. Look at the next statute, 57 Vict. ch. 11 of Ontario in 1894. Here is a statute passed by Ontario since this deed of submission was signed by the parties in 1893; actually, pending the proceedings before the present arbitrators, Ontario passes a statute, which contains in its preamble the same recognition. And then it goes on to make provision for a settlement of this matter, and in all these statutes we have the most formal admissions by this province, even while this arbitration is going on, that the fund exists, and that it exists under the consolidated statutes of Lower Canada, and that Quebec is entitled to a share of this fund.\nWe claim that that is an estoppel of the province by admission, and conduct, and that Ontario cannot come now and take the reverse position, especially as these statutes are in strict conformity with the position taken before the arbitrators.\nAs I say, these statutes are in strict conformity with her whole conduct for thirty years. Ontario collected large sums of this money. She paid over in January, 1889, no less than $925,000 of these uncollected balances on these lands to the Dominion Government, and paid other sums since. She paid large sums of interest to Quebec, $250,000. The provinces have dealt upon the basis that Quebec had an interest, as these statutes state, in this fund. During all these years it has never been questioned before by Ontario until we arrived at the present appeal.\nYour Lordships will see that payments have been made between the provinces, based upon this common assumption that the fund exists and that Quebec is entitled to a share in this fund, and did get a share. She was recognised, and was paid a share. That has been the basis upon which the province and the Dominion have acted during all these thirty years.\nNow apart from the question of estoppel, we come to what may be called more strictly the merits of the case, that is, whether the argument which Ontario now presents, suppose it is open to Ontario to present that argument in this court, which we maintain it is not\u2014but suppose it were, are the arguments that Ontario adduces to maintain her position that there is no fund, no liability, well founded? Quebec maintains that they are not well founded.\nThe present argument, as I understand it, of Ontario, is that no trust existed or exists; that no fund exists and that no school lands exist; that there are no beneficiaries, no cestui que trust, and, that therefore the trust fails, comes to an end. That is the argument of Ontario on what may be called strictly the merits of the case.\nI propose to call the attention of the court to a few statutory provisions bearing upon the matter.\nFirst, take this section 109 of the British North America Act itself. That section provides that the lands in each province shall fall to the province, with the unpaid balances on them, subject to any trust or interest other than the province in them at the time.\nThat very clause, it seems to me, means and implies that wherever there are existing trusts at the time, these trusts are not destroyed, but continued. That clause is not calculated to end or destroy existing trusts, but to perpetuate them. The meaning of that clause is that they are to be continued, because the existing trusts are to be respected.\nThat is conformable to the other provisions of the B. N. A. Act. For instance, section 129, in the most comprehensive terms, continues all laws and all authorities in force at the time of Confederation, to the fullest extent. There was nothing lost. All the existing institutions of the country, that were based upon law, were continued. They were not destroyed by Confederation.\nThe same was the case with regard to the executive powers under the constitution. These executive powers were placed in different hands, but there was no loss of executive power. All that existed before Confederation continue to exist after Confederation, only in different hands, according to the jurisdiction of the legislature. Section 12 of the British North America Act, and particularly section 135, is specific upon this point. There was no loss, either of legislative power, or executive power by the British North America Act, and there was no destruction of the institutions of the country, or no failure of ability to carry out, or provision to carry out the laws of the country by the executive, because it is all covered by those provisions of the British North America Act, and other provisions which I might refer to.\nAt the time of Confederation there was in force in respect of these Common Schools in Quebec and in Ontario, the Common School Act creating the system of schools in Quebec, 7 Vict. ch 27, embodied in the 15th chapter of the C. S. L. C. That Act was in full force. The schools created under that Act were in full force at the time of Confederation. The schools existed there at the time of Confederation, and by the law which set aside this million acres of land, that is the law and the Order in Council\u2014observe there is a marked distinction between this million acres of school lands and the fund that was claimed out of the Crown Lands\u2014there were no Crown Lands set aside. The statute was passed, but as regards the Crown Lands, was not acted upon, but as regards these school lands was acted upon. The Order in Council was made. The lands were described and defined, definitely established and were set aside for this school fund. That makes a marked distinction. They were appropriated definitely for this School Fund, set aside, which was not the case with regard to the Crown Lands.\nNow we come to chapter 15 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada. This is the chapter under which the schools of Lower Canada were existing at the time of Confederation. It is the law under which those schools still exist.\nNow, what did this statute do? This statute was the work of both the provinces. It was the same legislature that had passed the other Acts that passed this ch. 15 of C. S. L. C. This statute, constantly, throughout its whole length, refers to the Common School Fund. The statute is tied up, so to speak, with it, and the system of the schools provided for there, are intimately dependent upon this school fund, as I shall presently point out. It recognises that a part of that fund belongs to Lower Canada. It says so. It agrees with the Consolidated Statutes of Canada in dealing with Lower Canada as an entity, and as entitled to a part of this fund.\nFor instance, in sec. 99, ch. 15, we have language like this, speaking of what should be done with the balance of this fund\n\"The balance remaining unexpended or unclaimed out of the portion of the Common School Fund, belonging to Lower Canada.\"\nNow, there was some Common School Fund that belonged to Lower Canada. And it speaks in another place of the\u2014\"Permanent and additional Common School Fund,\" the provincial grant being the permanent fund created under the statute, setting aside these million acres of land, and the Order in Council.\nNow, I want to call your Lordships' attention to a few other provisions of this ch. 15, which is an important chapter.\nWhy should we say that no portion of this was vested in Lower Canada schools, if the statute, which was the work of the two provinces united, says that a part of that fund belonged to Lower Canada and to the schools of Lower Canada?\nSection 27 establishes, following 7 Vict., this system of schools in Lower Canada under commissioners and trustees. Sections 53 and 54 declare that these commissioners and trustees shall be corporate bodies.\nSection 99, which I have just cited, states that a portion of the fund belongs to Lower Canada. Sections 14 and 95 deal with the establishment of Normal and Model schools and appropriate a certain portion of the fund for their support.\nThen section 64 provides for the case of donations and gifts for the endowment of these schools by private individuals. That was not an exclusively public system. It was a system in which individuals were encouraged to make gifts and endowments. Section 64 provides for that, and so does section 60, subsection 2, and also section 115 recognizes that some of the schools that were being conducted under this statute were not public property, and as a matter of fact all through Lower Canada, where schools existed prior to the establishment of these public schools, they often existed by the joint efforts of neighbours, and when this system was established these schools handed over their school property as a contribution, dependent upon this very statute, dependent upon this provision that had been made by the Parliament of Canada for the support of the public schools of the country.\nMore than that. Poor scholars and poor school districts were to be assisted out of this fund Poor scholars were to be educated without any charge, and there was local assessment, corresponding to the portion of each municipality, in this fund, and poor scholars had to be educated free in these schools. It was imposed upon them as a condition.\nYour Lordships will see how distinctly these schools of Lower Canada are recognized as having rights in this fund. This fund is spoken of as belonging to them. See sec. 88.\nThe Lower Canada Common School Fund means this fund. A portion of this fund belonged to Lower Canada. Not the portion raised by local assessment, but the portion of the fund belonging to Lower Canada of this Common School Fund Sec. 88 says:\u2014\"And the superintendent shall deposit the said sums in such bank as the Governor in Council may direct, and shall apportion the same according to law among the municipalities, and shall pay to the school commissioners and trustees of dissentient schools the respective shares belonging to the municipalities.\" That is to the several municipalities. They formed corporations. Every one of these were corporations just as much as the University of Toronto. There were more of them, but they were existing corporations, declared perpetual. They could incur obligations, and could sue and be sued. They were legal entities, and these were the beneficiaries of this fund. Why, if there was one set of institutions more than another that Confederation was careful about preserving, it was the right of these schools\u2014the schools of the country. Schools of the minority were represented by trustees who were corporate bodies, and all their rights it surely was the intention of the Act of Confederation to preserve.\nNow this appropriation of a million acres of Crown lands was in the nature of a compact between the two provinces. Here was the old Government of Canada setting aside this by mutual consent of both provinces; it was in the nature of a compact between these provinces, and the beneficiaries were the schools of Lower Canada, and the schools of Upper Canada.\nThere was an. understanding between the two divisions of old Canada and there is authority for saying such an understanding as that is valid, to support trusts in equity at least; but here we have, I say, a complete system of schools established by the same authority that appropriated these million acres of land, and throughout this Act Lower Canada is spoken of as owning a portion of this fund, as entitled to a portion of this fund, and the municipalities are the school bodies of Lower Canada, are declared to have rights in this fund, and to be entitled to this fund, and they were perfect legal entities that could be sued and sue.\nThese million acres of land were held by the Crown, and the beneficial interest in them was in the old Province of Canada containing both Upper and Lower Canada, and the million acres of Crown Lands were appropriated as a school fund for the support of the schools in each division of the old province, that is, in Upper Canada and in Lower Canada. They were not the lands of the Province of Ontario. They were the lands of the Crown and if the Crown appropriated this million acres of land on these occasions from Upper Canada, they might have appropriated lands in Lower Canada for some other objects, and they did actually pass statutes to that effect. For instance, one of the first statutes promoting the construction of the Intercolonial Railway provided for setting aside a large amount of land in the province of Quebec in support of that scheme. And there was nothing extraordinary in the Crown setting aside this million acres of land for the support of the schools in the two sections of the province\u2014nothing that gives any claim to Ontario now, either in equity or in law, in that. They were Crown lands, they were not Ontario lands, nor Quebec lands. They were Crown lands belonging to the whole province, and were set aside for the benefit of the two provinces or the schools in the two provinces, which were the real beneficiaries in the matter. And the terms used to appropriate this million acres of land to the benefit of these schools are exactly the same as were used in appropriating Indian Reserves. For instance, in the very statute of Lower Canada preceding this C. S. L. C. ch. 14, sec. 12, we have a provision made for appropriating lands to the Indians, Indian Reserves, and the language is exactly the same as in the case of this statute. There was authority given to appropriate and set apart lands by Order in Council, for the Indians. Now such reservations were made under the old Province of Canada. The Indians had an interest in those lands at the time of Confederation. In the Ontario lands case the Privy Council laid it down distinctly that there was no necessary connection between control over those lands and an interest in those lands.\nNow, the ground I take is this: The language being the same, these lands in each case being set apart and appropriated, the result upon these lands should be the same. Now, in the case of the Indians, it is undoubted that that created a reservation belonging to the Indians. It was an appropriation of those lands to the Indians. The Indians acquired an interest in them, and if the question for this court was whether such Indians had a vested right or interest in those lands which had to be respected under section 109 I imagine the decision of the court would be very different from what it was in the case of the Indian annuities where the obligation of the Crown was a personal obligation, where it was held there was no lien whatever on the lands; but here the lands are set aside and appropriated to the Indians, and they give an estate to the Indians, an estate that this court would respect, and so, if the lands are set apart and appropriated as a school fund, it gives to the beneficiary of that school fund an estate and an interest. That was the condition of affairs at the time of Confederation. Now, did a change of legislative control over the Indians, and over these Indian lands\u2014did it in the least degree affect the rights or interests of any parties to this land? Not in the least. The old Province of Canada had the legislative control over these Indian lands and over these Indians, and that legislative control passed out of the hands of the old Province of Canada to the Dominion. And the Privy Council held that this change in no way affects the right or interest of any party. The Indian rights remain. In other words, the Dominion took over the Indians and the Indian lands and the Indian fund, everything belonging to the Indians. They took it all over into their hands just as in this case. Quebec and Ontario took over the schools and took over the property of the schools, with all the attendant rights belonging to these schools, just in the same way, and we might just as well argue that because the old Province of Canada has lost its control over these Indian lands and these Indian funds, there is some change of interest; there is no change of interest. The legislative control is no measure and no limit to the rights of the parties under our Act of Confederation. The idea was to perpetuate all rights and all obligations, and when the two provinces took over the schools they took over all belonging to these schools, they assumed the burden of these schools, and they assumed it as heirs of the old Province of Canada, and with all the rights, all the obligations, except the one of the annual grant from year to year, but all permanent existing trusts passed, they were transmissable obligations and rights, and they passed to the new provinces as successors in that department of the old Province of Canada. Therefore I think that the effect given to this Indian Act is applicable to our case.\nNow another point is this. It is argued there is a difference between the Indians and the schools. As I show to the court the schools were capable of having rights just as much as the Indians. This action of the old Province of Canada in setting apart and appropriating this million acres of land, was done in favour of two distinct and separate systems of schools. There was one distinct and separate system existing in Upper Canada and there was another existing in Lower Canada under totally different statutes. Now it was in favour of these schools respectively that this appropriation was made of this million acres of land. It was not schools of the Province of Canada in any other sense than it was in favour of the system of schools existing in Lower Canada and in favour of the system of schools existing in Upper Canada, which were distinct and different from schools under different Acts.\nCh. 26 of the Consolidated Statutes says:\u2014\n\"The said sum of $200,000 annually shall from year to year be apportioned by order of the Governor of this province in council between Upper and Lower Canada, in proportion to the relative numbers, &c.\"\nNow there was a portion of that fund affected in favour of Lower Canada; if it was not defined it was capable of being easily defined. Lower Canada's share was assigned to her and permanently assigned to her by this statute.\nNow, a division is made of it permanently, I claim, by this statute, and also by the subsequent statute, the School Act of Lower Canada, C. S. L. C. ch. 15. That apportionment is recognized. In section 99 of that School Act of Lower Canada we have the language used by the same legislature that a portion of this fund does belong to Lower Canada. They use the words, 'belonging to Lower Canada.\" Therefore there was a definite portion assigned to Lower Canada, and there was a definite portion vested in Lower Canada as a distinct division of the old Province of Canada, and that language is used, I say, by the same legislature throughout this School Act of Lower Canada; not only is it declared to belong to Lower Canada, but the statute, 15 Vict., goes further; it creates all the machinery, and all the provisions necessary to carry that apportionment onward down to the ultimate beneficiaries, the schools of every school district in Lower Canada, and these school districts are declared to be entitled to a certain share of this fund, provided they comply with the conditions on which it is granted. They have to raise a corresponding amount by local assessment. The schools were instituted and all the machinery was provided. I call your Lordship's attention to the machinery that was provided.\nSection 24 of the School Act says \"it shall be the duty of the Superintendent of Education\u2014now that Superintendent of Education is styled in the previous section 'The Superintendent for Lower Canada,' showing a keeping of the distinct system\u2014to receive from the Receiver General all sums of money appropriated for Common School purposes, and to distribute the same among the school commissioners and trustees of the respective municipalities according to law.\" And in proportion to the population of the same as ascertained by the then last census. Then section 88 says something more.\nNow, not only does the same legislature say a portion of this belongs to Lower Canada, but that it belongs to the school municipalities\u2014to the municipalities they represent.\nSection 94 carries out the same idea.\nI will have to call your Lordships' attention to this, that these were not exclusively supported by public funds. Sec. 94 provides that the money shall be divided among the several school districts in the municipalities in proportion to the number of children between seven and fourteen.\nNow we have got the complete machinery for carrying this fund on and vesting it for the benefit of every school district, and it is vested in the school commissioners and school trustees of these schools by the Act and by the same legislature. Now, the language of the statute is that the schools are entitled to this. For instance in section 90 we have language like this:\u2014\n\"To entitle any school to its allowance out of the general or local school fund, it shall be requisite and sufficient,\" to do the following things.\nNow, then, the school was entitled to a share of this fund, if it complied with the requirements. It had a legal right and a legal status to enforce its right to this fund if it complied with the requirements. Sections 9.6 and 97 carry out the same idea.\nNow, there are reasons for which the Superintendent of Education may refuse, and without which he could not refuse. He was bound to pay it over to these schools. And therefore we have the complete machinery, and we have the language used throughout here that the municipalities owned this fund, and that if they comply with certain conditions they are entitled to have their share of that school fund.\nNow we come to the next point: What was this fund? I propose to direct attention to that point: What was the nature of this fund?\nThe same statute, ch. 26, sec. 5, embodying what had gone before, says this:\n\"And the said fund and the income thereof shall not be alienated for any other purpose whatever, but shall remain a perpetual fund for the support of Common Schools and the establishment of township and parish libraries.\"\nNow, there is a distinct and clear declaration that this fund is inalienable. Section 3, subsection 2. That is as clear a declaration that this fund is inalienable and permanent, the public faith pledged to that, as clear as anything can be, in favour of any person having an interest in that being permanent. Now, what I say is that every person having an interest in the public faith being kept in that declaration, can ask that that be carried out under the circumstances, especially when the Government did undertake to carry it out. They may not have carried it out in the strict letter of the law, but they did in the spirit as Mr. Wood says. This fund was always behind the annual grant, and this fund was allowed to accumulate in that way. The law did not say that the Dominion Government were absolutely obliged to invest this in other securities than their own; they might invest in their own debentures under the statute. Instead of that they invested it in their own indebtedness. It was their own debt anyway. If they chose to ignore a minor part like that, they had a perfect right to do it, to treat it as a debt due by them. It would be a debt due by them if it had been invested in the debentures of the debt. Behind it stood this permanent fund, this million acres of land, and the proceeds of what had been sold of these million acres of land. That was the nature of the fund. It was a permanent endowment for the Common Schools in the Province of Quebec as regard the portions assigned to the Province of Quebec, and for the schools in the Province of Ontario as regards the portions affected by Ontario\u2014I mean Lower Canada and Upper Canada.\nNow let us see what it was an endowment for. It was not the sole support of the schools of Lower Canada.\nThe School Act, C. S. L C. ch. 15, says it is:\u2014 \"An Act respecting provincial aid for superior education\u2014and Normal and Model Schools.\"\nIt is a permanent endowment in aid of the Common Schools. It is not the sole course of support of these schools, nor anything like it, because there were local taxes and private contributions to these local schools that made the Government grant a minor portion of the support of these schools necessarily. Why, the schools were nearly all built by local assessment and local taxation by different localities, places building their own schools, it was all done by local effort, and not by this public fund. This public fund is only in aid of the Common Schools. It was a public endowment in aid of the schools mentioned in the Act. It was simply a perpetual inalienable endowment in aid of the system of schools mentioned in the statute.\nLet us see now what these schools were\u2014these beneficiaries that are said to have been extinguished at Confederation.\nNow, in sec. 27 of the School Act, C. S. L. C, ch. 15, we have got the provision under which these schools were established, and your Lordships will see that we have got the divisions between schools of the majority and the schools of the minority; the schools of the majority are the schools managed by the Commissioners, the minority those managed by Trustees.\nNow what were these Commissioners and trustees? I call your Lordships' attention to section 53 of the same statute. There were a set of School Commissioners in each municipality, they were elected, I may say, by the people of the locality, the municipality, under the statute. They were not appointed by the Government except to fill vacancies, and they continue so to this day with some amendments.\nThis sec. 53 constitutes them corporate bodies.\nThen the next section declares that they shall not become extinguished by failure to appoint trustees. The corporate body shall not become extinguished. They are made perpetual.\nNow as regards trustees, they too were made a corporate body and given the same powers as the Commissioners. I refer to section 57, subsection 3. Now, both these were corporate bodies, created by the State, but elected, managed by local electors, residents in the school districts and proprietors, and they were made perpetual corporations, and they were not purely public, so that the State could wipe them out when they liked, and take the school property and treat the whole thing as if it belonged to the public, and as if no one else had right to these schools. They were not of that character, and the statute does not show to us that they were of that character. For instance, there were local assessments raised. Now, my argument is, if there was nothing but the local assessments, each school district could assess itself for the erection and maintenance of its schools.\nNow, surely where a locality had assessed itself heavily and built a fine school house at the local expense, it cannot be pretended that no faith of the public was pledged not to destroy or nullify that property. That created an interest distinct from the State. There were local rights and local interests, and it was by local contributions, either by way of special assessments or voluntary contributions, because the statute provides for voluntary contributions to erect these schools and support this system, instead of local assessments, and I say this created an interest that took them out from being mere agencies. These school-houses, erected in that way, we could not treat as belonging to the State and ignore these local rights and interests. To this day they belong to these local school corporations. I say that created an interest that took them out of the category of beneficiaries that disappeared with the change of the old governments. It would be an act of vandalism to step in and treat the whole thing as if it was public property that could be swept away without affecting any interests that ought to be protected. I call your Lordships' attention to section 64 of the statute. I am speaking always of the statute, C. S. L. C., ch. 15:\u2014\n\"It shall be the duty of the school commissioners or trustees in each municipality:\u2014\n\"1. To take possession of lands and school houses, acquired, given to, or erected by the school trustees or commissioners, and to which the province may have contributed by virtue of any former Act or by the royal institution.\" And so on.\nThe province may have contributed. Here it is recognized that there are school houses to which the province is only a contributor, coming under this system, and under the management of these school trustees. Surely there were private interests there that ought to be respected. Then further:\u2014\n\"To acquire and hold for the corporation, by any title whatsoever, all real or personal property, moneys or income for the purposes of education, until the power hereby given be taken away or modified by law, and to apply the same according to the instructions of the donors.\"\nNow, there is an express provision for dealing with gifts\u2014private endowments.\nThen section 60, subsection 2, provides that the secretary-treasurer shall give security, not only for the funds he receives from the school, the local assessments, but from these contributions or donations paid into his hands for the support of the schools.\nNow, we do not know to what extent it has gone, as I have said we had no power to go into this question, but the statute makes ample provision for these schools being anything but mere public schools. There are private interests here that ought to be respected, and that take these out of the category of being mere agencies of the State\u2014local assessments and private contributions.\nI think the legitimate consequence of the ground taken by Ontario, is that all these school properties have been confiscated practically to the Crown; because the title of the schools to this grant, it seems to me, stood upon the law quite as much as the title to these school properties.\nOn this question of what creates an interest that the State must respect, I might perhaps be permitted to call your Lordships' attention to Cooley on Constitutional Limitations (6 ed.), at pages 253 and following, and page 328 and following.\nIn the United States, of course, we understand perfectly that the individal states have not the same unlimited power of legislation that our provincial legislatures have\u2014the same omnipotent power, so to speak, within their own sphere. There is a limitation on their powers. They cannot impair the existing obligations or contracts, but the argument I think might be used, that where in the United States a State could not change the position without violating the provisions of the Constitution, that there is an interest there that ought to be respected; that there is an interest there that under system ought to be respected, an interest in respect to supporting a trust, and I think the court will see from Cooley and the authorities cited by Cooley that unquestionably these schools are in that position where they could not be treated as mere agencies of the Crown or of the Government.\nAnother point is this. Not only have the Dominion, Ontario and Quebec, and all the provinces in fact recognised this fund and acted upon it, but I maintain that the Imperial Parliament itself has recognised that this fund belongs to the two provinces, and I maintain that they have done that in assigning the Turnpike Trust debentures to Ontario and Quebec as their joint property. That was a part of this fund. It stood on no better ground than any other portion of that fund.\nThe Imperial Parliament has recognised the joint title of Ontario and Quebec in that fund. The reason why the rest of the fund was not charged was its anomalous position. It is explained I think in the basis which the parties laid down for the dividing of the assets. This is from the principles upon which the statement of affairs of June 30th, 1867, is to be revised in preparation for the arbitration between Ontario and Quebec.\nNow this feature of it was accepted, was acted upon by the arbitrators, and I point out to the court was accepted and in fact has become chose jug\u00e9e against Ontario:\n\"The investments for trust funds are to be deducted from the capital of the funds which are invested in them, and the unpaid interest, which has been allowed to the funds and charged against the Quebec Turnpike Trust and the City of Hamilton on these investments, are to be similarly deducted from the corresponding income funds, the investments themselves, with the coupons being handed over to the provinces interested in the funds, but as Ontario and Quebec have a joint interest in the Common School Fund, the investments for that fund and the accrued interest thereon must be handed over to Ontario and Quebec conjointly, to be dealt with by the arbitrators \"\nNow all parties have acted upon that, the two provinces, the Dominion, and all provinces in fact. It was the basis as it were, of the legislation which took place regarding the public debt. Who will say that this statement of affairs did not influence that legislation, and that it would probably have been different had it been known that Ontario was going to receive the whole of this large fund that she is now claiming? Who will say that that did not influence the Dominion legislation in the settlements of affairs between the provinces? Therefore, I maintain that by the Imperial statute itself the interest of Lower Canada in this fund is recognised and that it has been accepted by Ontario.\nNow, Upper Canada received funds that it seems to me on its own principle it had no right to receive; like the Upper Canada Grammer School Fund. There are a large number of funds for the municipalities of the province, at the time, that stood just on the same principle. Many of them were not invested at all. Most of them were not, and yet the existence of these funds has been recognised; they have been paid over, even payments to the municipalities since Confederation. Why should Upper Canada pay over any portion of this Improvement Fund to the municipalities if the municipalities became extinct?\nNow there is another point upon which I wish to speak. The court will see the position that Ontario took with regard to the award of 1870 in answer to the claim of Quebec.\n\"Ontario denies that Quebec can re-open the award of the 3rd September 1870 in this arbitration in respect of the Common School Fund.\"\n\"Ontario considers that the award was not just to Ontario, nor in accordance with the spirit or intention of the British North America Act in giving Quebec any share of the Common School lands, or the proceeds of Common School lands, which are wholly situate in Upper Canada, that Quebec was no more entitled to a share of these lands than of other Crown lands in Upper Canada, but Ontario accepted the award as a whole, and the Privy Council decided that the award was a valid award and Ontario objects to the same being opened for the purpose of enabling Quebec to have some points reconsidered of which Quebec may suppose there is a chance of the arbitrators taking a view more favourable to Quebec than that taken by the first arbitrators.''\nNow, Ontario objects to open this award, and I think she had good reasons for considering the award binding on her at least, because before the arbitration of 1870 your Lordships will see that Ontario took distinctly in her written answer before the arbitrators the position that these lands belonged to her, the very position that she is seeking to take in this appeal. Now that was answered by Quebec and that issue was before the arbitrators in 1870, and the arbitrators made an award against the pretentions of Ontario. That award of the arbitrators was never appealed against by Ontario.\nNow, if the arbitrators were within their jurisdiction there, and it was not clearly ultra vires, that is binding, and we claim it is binding on Ontario because she has accepted it in the most formal manner by statutes, and every other way. Surely it is chose jug\u00e9e against Ontario. She never appealed against that feature of the award and never appealed against it at all. It is true that Mr. Wood when he came before the arbitrators with his oral arguments, that he did not take that position, but whether that award was given against Ontario upon contestation or upon confession it does not make any matter, it is equally a judgment binding upon Ontario, and she does well to say she accepted the award because it is an award she cannot help but accept.\nNow I may say to the court that Quebec will not believe, is not prepared to think, that your Lordships will reach the stage that you will feel it necessary to determine upon the merits of the case itself, as if it were free for Ontario to raise this question of the extinction of the beneficiaries. I believe your Lordships on consideration will see that this question is excluded on every ground; excluded by the very terms of the reference; excluded by the fact that it was not placed before the arbitrators; excluded by the fact that the arbitrators have not passed upon it; excluded by the fact that Ontario is estopped in the most complete way; I believe your Lordships will say that you will not find it necessary to pass a decision on the merits of the case, which merits we have not been able to discuss here as I have stated, for the want of proper evidence and information.\nI do not think your Lordships will say that there is any jurisdiction given to this court, if the arbitrators had not jurisdiction; if it was not a subject that was within their jurisdiction, that the arbitrators could not give jurisdiction to this court by their finding.\nMr. Justice Gwynne asked me yesterday whether the subject of liability of Ontario had probably been discussed by the arbitrators. I have no doubt it was, because Mr. Chancellor Boyd discussed it, and Mr. Justice Casault discussed it, and Mr. Justice Burbidge says that he has the benefit of reading the opinions of both of these arbitrators.\nNow if your Lordships will refer to Mr. Justice Burbidge's remarks at pages 652, etc., etc., ante, I think your Lordships will see conclusively that this question has never been discussed by Mr. Justice Burbidge, and that it is not part of the ground of his award. He professes to have dealt with all the questions which the arbitrators considered they had to deal with, and there is not a word in all his remarks in which he discusses this question, whether there is any liability on the part of Ontario or not. He speaks of a liability in this way, and that way, but nowhere does he speak of liability in the sense in which it is brought up by this appeal, the question of whether there is no liability whatever, and he is citing these clauses of the deed of submission, it seems to me, to show why he considered those clauses excluded that question, and he did not deal with the question in his opinion, and his opinion is the opinion of the arbitrators in this case, because without him the award could not have been given in the case.\nOne other point, and I will not trouble your Lordships longer in this case.\nI want to call your Lordships' attention again to the statute of Ontario of 1894, 57 Vict. ch. 11. This is a statute to which the Crown is a party, binding upon Ontario, and passed in 1894. Your Lordships will remember that the Deed of Submission was passed in 1893. These arbitrations were going on in 1894.\nNow, what are the points stated in this statute?\n\"Whereas this province is interested with the Province of Quebec in a fund commonly called 'The Common School Fund,' existing under the provisions of Chapter 26 of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada.\"\nThey admit it exists under this statute.\n\"And whereas this fund originally consisted of one million acres of public lands situated in the Huron tract in the Province of Ontario.\"\nThat was the fund.\n\"And whereas at the time of Confederation a large portion of the said lands had been sold and partly realized by the late Province of Canada, for the purposes of the said fund, and the proceeds thereof passed to and are still in the possession of the Dominion of Canada, to the credit of the said Provinces; and whereas since Confederation this Province has sold some of the remaining portion of the said lands, and collected amounts, both on account of the price of such sales, and on account of the balances remaining unpaid of sales made prior to Confederation; \"\n\"Therefore Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:\"\n1. \"The Lieutenant Governor in this Province in Council is hereby authorized to agree with the Government of the Province of Quebec, upon an amount to be paid by this Province for the acquisition by it of the uncollected balance of the price of the lands mentioned in the preamble of the Act, and for the payment by this Province of what may be considered the value of the lands remaining unsold.\"\n2. \"It shall be lawful for the Lieutenant Governor in Council to enter into an agreement with the Government of the Dominion of Canada and that of the Province of Quebec respectively, for the purpose of effecting a final division and distribution between the said provinces and final payment of principal of the said Common School Fund, and to enter into such an agreement with the Dominion of Canada and the Province of Quebec as may be necessary for the division, distribution and payment of the said principal, and for granting and giving to all parties concerned such receipts and discharges, and signing such deeds as may be necessary in the premises.\"\nDid Ontario at that time understand that this question of whether there was any liability for this school fund existed or not? Could Ontario have believed that in the Deed of Submission she had submitted the question whether she was liable for these very things which she acknowledges her liability in this statute, and for which it provides? Could she have believed it? Could the province of Quebec have believed it? Is it possible in the face of this statute, and the corresponding statute on the part of Quebec, that the Province of Ontario could have believed or intended any such thing, in the face of such a statute at this? I maintain your Lordships will never reach the stage of being called upon to decide this question on the merits; that the appeal does not lie, under all the circumstances of this case.\nHall Q.C. follows:\nI propose to be very brief in dealing with this question. But what I would like to do is to put before the court, if I can, at the various stages, the circumstances of how this fund has been dealt with by the parties, in order to show the action of the parties, and how far the parties are estopped now, or how far it may be included in the deed of submission.\nIn the reasons offered by Mr. Chancellor Boyd, he attached apparently a great deal of importance to what might have been the wording of the constitution of these schools and the inference that from the wording of the statute that these are called Common Schools of the province of Canada.\nNow, a mere examination of the preambles and the titles of 4 & 5 Vict. ch. 18, 7 Vict. ch. 9 and ch. 26 of Consolidated Statutes of Canada, shows that those schools are schools in this Province. Not schools belonging to the Province of Canada. And, this statute, C. S. C., ch. 26, recites in section 1, that the land was set apart for Common School purposes. There is nothing in the language, and if you refer back to the preambles of the others, to the statutes to which it refers, there is nothing to show that these were Common Schools which might be said to be exclusively the property of Canada, but they were Common Schools throughout the province, and it was a Common School fund for a Common School purposes, and it designated throughout the provinces, although it might have made a more limited designation than that as regards territory.\nGoing on then to the second point in connection with section 1, and which the province of Quebec has always maintained, it is this, that by 12 Vict., ch. 200, and by the Order in Council, and by this chapter 26, these million acres of land were adequately appropriated, taken out of the Crown's domain, and set apart and belonged to the Common Schools throughout the province of Canada. We say they no longer remain Crown lands, and the description and the designation given throughout by the late Province of Canada to these lands calls them school lands, and we not only say that by that section or chapter 26 that they had been appropriated and set apart, but your Lordships will see that that section provides that the Commissioners of Crown lands, under the authority of the Governor in Council, administers them and collects the proceeds, and pays these proceeds into the Common School fund for these Common Schools. There was an absolute appropriation, instead of a million dollars in cash, and if we were discussing it on the basis of a million dollars in cash, there would not be any difficulty at all. Instead of that the Province of Canada gave one million acres of land out of the Crown domain into the hands of the Commissioner of Crown Lands as a sort of administrator or trustee, and he was to sell these lands and put every dollar of the cash into the Common School fund for the benefit of the Common Schools of the province.\nIt must be borne in mind that under two distinct statutes there had been created the Common Schools for Upper Canada and the Common Schools for Lower Canada. My learned friend who preceeded me has given you the consolidation of the legislation as regards Lower Canada in Chapter 15 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada.\nNow, there was the corresponding or almost corresponding legislation to be found at chapter 64 the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, providing for the Common Schools and their management and the disposition of this fund and of the remainder, the creation of corporations, but under these Common Schools, who had power to sue and be sued for Upper Canada, with a superintendent of education for Upper Canada, with a local board of education for Upper Canada, and with provision made that the superintendent of education of Upper Canada drew from the Receiver General the portion of the grant of this Common School Fund.\nNow these two statutes,, C. S. U. C, ch. 64, and C. S. L. C., ch. 15, were in force on the 1st of July, 1867, and continued in force for years afterwards, and as regards the Province of Quebec\u2014I cannot speak so definitely for the Province of Ontario\u2014they are in force yet, but they have gone into the revision of 1888.\nNow, there was the constitution then of the fund, and the constitution of this corporation, and these Common Schools, as of date of Confederation, 1st July, 1867, and at that time there was the $1,645,000 in cash, and while it is quite true that the late Province of Canada did not invest that money in the public securities, they used it for their own purposes, for all we know, but it remained there, not what my learned friend who opened for Ontario said, a mere book account, and a mere nonentity, that could not be touched. Every dollar of that $1,645,000 represented cash or the interest that should be added to it, and was a solid, substantial fund at Confederation.\nNow, after Confederation came the arrangements that were made for the arbitration under section 142 of the British North America Act. And the object of the few remarks I wish to make on this point is to show that before the arbitrators of 1870, the question of this Common School lands was referred to them for division and adjustment by all the parties.\nNow if your Lordships can take up the principles as enunciated in what we call part 3 of this long book, page 9, which is headed: 'Principles upon which the statement of affairs of June 30th are to be made up in preparation for the arbitration between Ontario and Quebec.\"\nNow at page 9, one of these principles sets out this: \"The lands in each province were surrendered to them, subject to existing trusts, and the Dominion is bound to see that the trusts are executed. A very large sum, upwards of $1,700,000 remains outstanding on sales of Common School Lands, situated in Ontario, but in which Quebec has a joint interest, and the apportionment of this asset must be left to the arbitrators.\"\nNow, in so far as any concurrence could possibly have been given to that, Mr. Wood who was then the treasurer, and acting on behalf of the executive of Ontario, expressly in his letter consented to that. When some difficulties arose between the parties, Ontario, Quebec and the Dominion, with reference to what statement should be presented before the arbitrators in connection with the debt of Canada, a conference took place at Montreal. Now, we submit that the parties are bound by this conference and in that conference there were representatives of Quebec and of the Dominion and of Ontario. Your Lordships will see that the treasurers of Ontario and Quebec agreed to the fairness of these principles, and in connection with these principles the Dominion passed an Order in Council and a statement of the debt of the late Province of Canada was made up and submitted to the arbitrators in 1870. Now, as my learned friend Mr. Trenholme stated, when the parties in 1870 were before the arbitrators submitting this question of the School Lands, Ontario in its written and printed statement before the arbitrators, which we say must be taken as an Act of Ontario, following up the conferences that took place leading to this arbitration, raised the question that there was no trust in connection with these lands, and that she was entitled to them all. Well, good, bad or indifferent Mr. Wood orally said \"I think Ontario is liable. I think,\" he said, \"that 1 should do violence to the statutes, if I could have taken them away from the Common Schools which still existed.\" I think he was right. Ontario submitted that question to these arbitrators in 1870 and the arbitrators decided against that It was a question of law the arbitrators had a right to decide. Ontario has never appealed from that. From 1870 down to the present argument, or rather perhaps I should say down to the rendering of the judgment of Mr. Justice Boyd, there has never been directly or indirectly any suggestion or act of Ontario but that this award of 1870 was valid, and that they had to carry it out.\nWe come now say to the year 1878 when the Privy Council rendered their award, and your Lordships will see from the quotations I have given in the factum of the joint case before the Privy Council, the counsel for Ontario, the Attorney General for the time being, contended that the award was perfectly good.\nNow, we say, not having appealed from the award of 1870, having stated before the arbitrators in 1870 the question which they are stating now, they are chose jug\u00e9e as to the question of liability, and the arbitration is absolutely at an end and Ontario is without a right to go any further. And I would go so far as to say, if there was error on the part of the arbitrators at that time in the disposition of that Common School fund, that as regards Ontario, by her minister, by her legislature, by every act that it was possible to conceive of having been done, she has acquiesced in the award, and made it a good award.\nYour Lordships will see that from 1879 to 1887 Ontario paid direct to the province of Quebec $250,000 in various sums as interest on Quebec's share of collections on the Common School lands made by Ontario and which Ontario had kept in her pocket up to that time.\nCan there be any more direct admission? Could we ask for any other circumstances that would operate as an estoppel, as great as that? Taking $250,000 out of the public funds of the province passed through their public accounts, and passed through their estimates, passed under the review of the legislature, not one isolated act, but going over six different years; recognising Quebec's interest in the Common School fund after Confederation, recognising Ontario's obligation to pay interest on that, and Ontario actually paying the interest to Quebec; that is, to 1889.\nNow, that brings us down to 1890, and it, practically speaking, terminates the recital of acts by means of payments of money.\nYour Lordships will see from the correspondence, if you went into that, after the confirmation of the award in 1878, the Treasurers of Ontario and Quebec and the Finance Minister got together and they commenced this legislation. What for? To divide the principal and the income of this fund. All parties admit that they were bound by the award of 1870 as regards this being a trust, as being a fund, and an asset\u2014first of all an asset belonging to Ontario and Quebec, and as being a fund which rightly or wrongly had been declared by the arbitrators of 1870 to go on in perpetuity, and the correspondence shows that all parties, both Ontario and Quebec, felt bound by it. They met together in 1883, and there is a statute by Ontario, and a statute by Quebec, to arrive at a settlement and a division of this fund, to permit Ontario to buy or to pay Quebec a certain sum of money for the outstanding balance for the lands unsold.\nThen we come to 1890 as a matter of legislation, when these various acts of payment of moneys by Ontario took place. The last item was $11,000. In 1890 they introduced the legislation under which this present arbitration took place. At that time Quebec had repealed the Act of 1883 by substituting an arbitration Act as it is called, and it was found that as regards the division of the fund Quebec was without authority.\nIn 1891 Quebec, the Dominion and Ontario, each one of them passed Acts recognizing again everything that had gone before, recognising as clearly as can be recognised by words, as Mr. Trenholme has put it, that the principal of the fund ought to be divided, that the parties hands were tied by the award of 1870 which said it must go on forever, and they adopted legislation to do it.\nNow, that is concurrent legislation. It is not legislation of a private individual. It is legislation we may say of the Crown, Quebec, Ontario and the Dominion.\nNow then we come down purely to the question of the deed of submission of 1893o I do not think that any construction can be put upon it further than that the parties who signed that and the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council of the province of Quebec who approved of it, believed and could only believe that what he was agreeing to submit was the amount of a fund that every one had recognised and admitted. The deed is signed and the parties go before the arbitrators. Quebec makes this claim which is printed in the joint case. That says, that we are entitled in the making up of this amount of this principal of the Common School fund\u2014we are entitled that you should take as cash on hand what the Dominion have got; we say Ontario must render up an account of these remissions she has made; if any remissions have been made for improper causes we wish to investigate it.\nThe parties there clearly recognised there was a fund, composed of the amount at Confederation, of the value of the proceeds of sales of land since of the value of lands remaining unsold, but of course as against these general amounts there might be some legal deductions in connection with the existence of the fund, but there never was a suspicion that there was no fund. And, I say that the language cannot possibly convey that, but that the language conveys that there was a fund composed of the amount on hand at Confederation, of the cash received by the Dominion since, of the cash in the hands of Ontario, of the value of the lands remaining unsold, and it was that amount that the arbitrators were going to divide, and it was that claim that Quebec formulated there before the arbitrators. We did formulate a claim with reference to the division of the fund and income about which I will speak in one moment.\nNow, what was the answer of Ontario to that? I challenge my learned friends to show in their answer that they filed to that claim, and which is what we argued before the arbitrators, which must be taken to be the line or the action of the parties\u2014not one word\u2014not only not one word that there is no liability since Confederation, but line after line that Quebec cannot re-open its award, this award of 1870 must stand. Quebec's rights are bound by that award of 1870. That is what we argued on behalf of Quebec. That was the contest before the arbitrators. To sum up in a few words, the contention of Quebec is that as regards that Common School Fund, all parties have accepted the award of 1870, less the contention that Quebec will make in this counter appeal; in all other respects the award of 1870 has been followed in every particular; not only in the clause regarding the Common School Fund, but the other, and as regards the Common School Fund all these acts have been done by the legislature, by the officers, by the executive council, by the premiers of Ontario and Quebec, and it brings us then down to this question:\u2014Is it possible that Quebec, with all these views or acceptations on the part of Ontario before it, with the circumstances of the award of 1870, ever thought by the deed of submission it was putting in doubt again or putting before the arbitrators the question whether there was a trust? The circumstance of it never being mentioned before the arbitrators in the answer of Ontario, seems to Quebec to be absolutely conclusive that this court would not for a moment allow Quebec, or allow any litigant to be taken by surprise in a matter so serious as this, not only without any opportunity of making evidence on a point that might be obscure, but being called upon to make evidence and to support its claim before the arbitrators, Ontario claiming that the award of 1870 was good.\nWe contend that the motion to quash the appeal should be granted, and certainly that on the merits there is no foundation for the present appeal, and it is not included in the deed of submission.\nBlake Q. C. in reply. The question whether the award is extra or intra vires is a question which certainly was brought by the Province of Quebec on discussion before these arbitrators, and not merely was it brought up, but it is still in that portion of this whole matter which remains at present unargued, insisted upon. It is also insisted upon with reference to one or two points upon the matter which is now before your Lordships. The question whether Ontario under these circumstances is to be prevented from affirming on its part that some class of contention with reference to the award which Quebec proposed to affirm and insist upon on its part, is the question which is laid before your Lordships at the opening. That is the ground upon which I put the case.\nAs one of your Lordships has observed, it would be monstrous to suppose that if in point of fact this award is bad in respect to its dealing with this fund, bad as ultra vires, the Province of Quebec should be permitted to insist upon that for the purpose of inducing a different adjudication upon the subject from that which the award of 1870 prescribed, and the Province of Ontario should not be permitted to affirm that same proposition with all its results and limitations on its side. That is really the contention which my learned friends bring forward.\nNow I repeat with conviction the view that the attitude of Quebec upon the points which are set up in its case, are being prosecuted in the appeal, are points which touch in the different aspects in which I stated them in my opening, the question of the extra or the intra vires of the award of 1870 with reference to this matter, and I re-affirm as a proposition indisputably that it is utterly impossible for Quebec to maintain those positions without Ontario being absolutely free for its part to say\u2014well, if the award is null and void it is so for us as well as for you; you cannot affirm that we are bound by it and that you are not; you cannot affirm that these things which were extra vires of the arbitrators as you say, and which affect the whole of this portion of the award, still leave it binding to the extent to which it touches us. The whole question is open. If the award in this respect, on points not separable, is ultra vires, it is ultra vires as a whole with relation to the subject matter of the Common School Fund out of which was carved the Land Improvement Fund.\nNow, my learned friends say, and say with justice, that there was a general action of both the parties to this discussion for a very considerable time based upon the theory of the validity of the award.\nI maintain that the conclusion is that it might be fairly stated that the parties thought, in their action, that Ontario was seeking for the carrying out of the award of 1870 in all its particulars, and that in the transactions which it entered into later on, such as my learned friend has alluded to, the transactions namely with reference to the payment of money to the Dominion, with reference to the payment of money to Quebec, with reference to the Land Improvement fund itself, as we will show in full detail when we come to deal with that, it was upon the idea that Quebec, which had up to the time of the Privy Council decision litigated the validity of the award, after that time was not disputing the validity of the award upon these subjects.\nI say, speaking for the Province of Ontario, that in my opinion a fair and reasonable view, taking the whole of the correspondence, legislation and everything, would have been to say both parties understood when the submission was made that the award of 1870 with reference to both the Land Improvement Fund and the Common School Fund which the Land Improvement Fund was carved out of, was to stand, and that was what was being done, but I cannot understand how the province of Quebec can set up for itself the right to dispute those fundamental bases, as far as it is concerned, and to say that we are bound Is this ratio of division to bind Ontario when it does not bind Quebec? Is it to be intra vires as far as Ontario is concerned, and extra vires as far as Quebec is concerned?\nThe position seems to me impossible to state without the very statement being its actual refutation. You cannot make it good and bad at the same moment. You cannot make it good for one of the parties and bad for the other. It is said Ontario did not appeal. Certainly it did not appeal. Ontario did not say the award was extra vires. Its silence on that subject does not debar its right to say that it is extra vires. Certainly silence does, not bind and make the award good for one and bad for the other. It cannot be that Ontario shall be bound by the award, although it is extra vires and beyond the powers of the arbitrators a nullity as far as the province of Quebec is concerned.\nNow, allegations have been made by the learned counsel who opened for the respondents that there was a disadvantage because they had not some evidence, but I did not hear any very tangible statement of any evidence that was missing, or any suggestion, On the contrary, the learned counsel asked your Lordships to infer from the statement in the statute that there existed those corporations and those private schools and those donations, which were suggested by the statute. I agree that that is a fair inference. It is a fair inference that those subject matters to which the consolidated statutes of Lower Canada alluded did exist, and for the purpose of this case they are fairly to be taken to exist, and there is really no foundation for the suggestion that the whole question was not before the arbitrators and is not before the court. The statutes of the Province of Ontario are analogous to the statutes of the Province of Quebec. What binds one binds the other. If this statute for the Province of Ontario dealt with the case in such a manner as to be formal admissions which bind, of course they were not admissions made to the other side. They were in part in connection with the propositions for settlement, which propositions turned out to be abortive, and the reason for their being abortive can be discerned very plainly, for the moment it was made to appear that the Province of Quebec was claiming that the division of the fund should not be on the basis of the principle of the award of 1870, that moment it was obvious that no settlement could be reached at all, and that to refer the question at large from the award of 1870 to arbitrators would be an absurd thing. The province of Quebec contends now that the division ought to be made on the basis, not of the award, because it is extra vires as far as Quebec is concerned, though intra vires as far as Ontario is concerned\u2014but on the basis of the census of 1861. While that contention is made there can be no settlement or agreement. The law, and those things to which the parties have by themselves bound themselves, is the only way of adjustment.\nNow the learned counsel suggested, I do not know whom, as the cestuis que trusts, sometimes it was the municipality, sometimes it was the schools, sometimes it was the territorial locality of Upper Canada in the one case and Lower Canada in the other, that were beneficiaries.\nMy argument will gain no force from reiteration. I only remind your Lordships that the suggestion which I have made was that all these were agencies of the state. The learned counsel alleged indeed that there were persons who had created private schools in the localities before this aid had been given, and that they actually surrendered these valuable properties to the public corporation on the faith of the annual grant and acquired interest. Well, I dare say there were. I have already said I agree that one must infer from the existence of the statute that theremay have been such private schools, and I hope one may exercise a little degree of common sense and one's knowledge of human affairs in such a matter as that, and one knows that those schools that were established in the early history of this country by public spirited individuals privately, before the legislature of the country or the means of the country were adequate to discharge the public duty, were schools established at a sacrifice, and were run at a loss year after year in order that the children of the people of the country might be educated, and there was no question of private right or interest in the way we speak of private property, and that what happened was an enormous relief from the unjust burden that was imposed upon the individual by the general school system which made the ratepayers of the locality and the general revenues of the whole community contribute share and share alike towards the education and instruction of the children of the country.\nSo that to suggest that the existence in early days of schools maintained at this sacrifice, and school houses built at this sacrifice, is a suggestion of private property, which was handed to the State, upon some theory that the beneficiaries still remained vested with some right or interest which entitled them to assert a special right of their own, seems to me to be out of the question.\nThen the learned counsel brought in the Indian. We all know that an Act of Parliament may, by proper phrases, make a conveyance. Lands may be granted by an Act of Parliament, and if land is granted and appropriated for A. B., that this creates a trust for A. B., or passes the land to A. B. according to the language of the Act. The question is whether what was being defined to be created, what the legislature had in view was the assistance of the agencies of the State. Public or Government Schools, in each of these two territorial divisions of the one province were agencies of the State created under the legislation of the State, not controlled by private individuals, except also as creatures of the State who derived their authority from being the elected representatives of the people under the authority of the State itself also.\nThe learned counsel suggested that the fund was inalienable and remained a perpetual fund. I noted as the first admission that was made that really the fund if it did exist at all, must exist according to the tenor of the statute. That has been my argument to your Lordships. I will just re-state it. If this fund survived the British North America Act, it survived in its entirety, and in accordance with the terms of the statute.\nIn reference to the position taken by Ontario before the arbitrators, as far as it appears by their case, I desire to cite two lines:\n\"Apart from the said award Quebec has no right whatever to participate in the proceeds of the public lands of Ontario or of the said Common School Lands received by Ontario subsequent to 1867.\" I read that to show your Lordships that Ontario then took up the position distinctly that any right that Quebec had was under the award, and if the award is repudiated then of course she has a right to argue that there is no right under any other contingency,\nThen in the factum of Quebec before this court is this:\n\"It is submitted that it is shown throughout the history given in this factum that Quebec's rights are under the original statute which have never been altered.\" It is submitted in the same factum:\n\"That the deductions allowed by the first arbitrators in the award of 1870 should also be set aside as being ultra vires.\" So that the position of Quebec was that the award was ultra vires, while they contend that as far as Ontario is concerned it is to be treated as intra vires.\nAs to the discussion before and by the arbitrators, and to the arguments of the learned counsel who opened the appeal with reference to Mr. Justice Burbidge's remark, I do not think I am called upon to enter into an inquiry as to whether Justice Burbidge's certificate, that the court was unanimous that this was a disputed question of law, is correct or not, still less to enter into a minute examination of his own judgment in order to find whether it did or did not contain elements from which it is to be assumed that the certificate was wrong, and that this was not a disputed question of law. I maintain my learned friend is battling against a certificate of that kind, and that the certificate settles that question.\nAnd then my learned friend Mr. Hall pointed out that the award was chose jug\u00e9e and even if there was error on the part of the arbitrators Ontario had made it a good award. I agree, in so far as it would require a proceeding to set it aside, as I have said often and often, but I say that nothing Ontario has done or said or Ontario has admitted or omitted would make it a good award if it was waste paper from the beginning.\nThen amongst these things are suggested a payment of a quarter of a million of interest in several different years. Your Lordships will find that that was claimed upon the basis of the award, and therefore the very things which are now being suggested are things which cease to be of any force or effect the instant it is suggested that Quebec is entitled to repudiate the award of 1870 upon the basis upon which all these payments were made, because the collection of interest has all been upon the theory of the award itself Then Quebec alleges that she is now entitled to insist that all that is wrong, all those principles are wrong, but that Ontario is bound. By what I wonder? By the award which Quebec says is bad? By that principle of division which is there stated? No, but by some other principle of division to be ascertained by those arbitrators. We must give equal weight to like transactions of both parties, or no weight at all to these transactions, and in giving equal weight what Quebec is now insisting upon as binding Ontario binds herself also.\nNow, my learned friend has rightly said that the provinces found themselves tied by the provisions of the award of 1870 which I have strongly contended, if the arbitrators had a jurisdiction to deal with this matter\u2014though they had a wide jurisdiction they might have dealt with it probably in any other way\u2014was the most natural and reasonable and proper way of doing it, namely, carrying out the statutes. They felt themselves tied by it, and wanted to get relief, and therefore they passed certain statutes. They passed certain statutes to get relief from what? From the principle upon which the arbitrators of 1870 had acted? Not at all. But in order to get relief from the consequence of the fund being perpetual, to get hold of the money, and the question of the division of the money was to be in the apprehension of Ontario and in the apprehension of all reasonable men I should think consequential upon the principle which had been defined as the constitution of the fund itself by the award of 1870. The appeal of the Province of Quebec was then proceeded with.\nB\u00e9\u00efque Q.C. opens:\u2014I feel that your Lordships are possessed of most of the facts, and there will remain only to me to call the attention of your Lordships to a very few as bearing on this appeal.\n\"Your Lordships will find that the notice of appeal of the Province of Quebec states that Quebec appeals in so far as such award permits or allows any deduction from the amount of the principal of said Common School Fund for the Upper Canada Land Improvement Fund, or Upper Canada Improvement Fund.\"\n\"And in this respect the province of Quebec will contend that, under the provisions of paragraph 1, the principal of the fund should be augmented by the sum of $124,685.18, and that under paragraph 4 of the said award the amount of 25 per cent referred to in the paragraph mentioned secondly should not be deducted.\"\nNow, on referring to the deed of submission your Lordships will find that the only portions of it bearing on the present appeal, are the following:\nPar. 3. \"It is further agreed that the following matter shall be referred to the said arbitrators for their determination and award in accordance with the provisions of the said statutes, namely:\"\n(h) \"The ascertainment and determination of the amount of the principal of the Common School Fund, the rate of interest which would be allowed on such fund, and the method of computing such interest.\"\n(i) \"In the ascertainment of the amount of the principal of the said Common School Fund, the arbitrators are to take into consideration, not only the sum not held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada, but also the amount for which Ontario is liable, and also the value of the school lands which have not yet been sold.\"\nThen 5: \"It is further agreed by and between the parties hereto that the questions respecting the Upper Canada Building Fund, and the Upper Canada Improvement Fund, are not at present to form any part of this reference; but this agreement is subject to the reservation by Ontario of any of its rights to maintain and recover its claim, if any, in respect of the said fund, as it may be advised.\"\nI need not say that it was open to either province to consent or not to a deed of submission, to consent or not to an organization of a board of arbitrators, and that the board of arbitrators, or the award must stand or fall on the deed of submission itself, because the parties have decided and had to decide on the questions they would submit to the arbitrators, and what questions would not be submitted.\nI think it is incumbent upon me at the outset to show your Lordships what is covered by these words: \"The questions respecting the Upper Canada Building Fund,\" at the date of the submission, and I say I am prepared and am going to show that at the time of the signing of the deed of submission, as appears from the record, the questions that were in dispute between the two provinces, Quebec and Ontario, were the accounts in connection with $124,000.00 and the question which covered the 25 per cent of the proceeds of lands sold from June 1853 to the 6th March, 1861, and collected previous to the time of Confederation. And second, as to whether Ontario would be entitled to retain for the Improvement Fund the 25 per cent of any future collections from these sales made between the two dates, but collected subsequent to Confederation.\nAnd, in this connection I desire to draw your Lordships' attention to the following portions of the record. I might go a deal further back, but I think it is sufficient to commence with 1889. I refer to a letter addressed by Mr. Shehyn, the Treasurer of Quebec, to Mr. Courtney, Deputy Minister of Finance, dated 4th July, 1889.\n\"The views of Mr. Robertson were evidently accepted as correct by the Privy Council, as the improvement fund remained in the statement confirmed by them at the sum of $5,119.08 as originally prepared by the auditor of the late province of Canada.\"\n\"The arbitrators appointed by Ontario and the Dominion\u2014the arbitrator of the province of Quebec, having resigned\u2014awarded the Upper Canada Improvement Fund to the province of Ontario, and, with reference to the disposition of it the Government of this province has nothing whatever to do.\"\n\"If it is proposed in submitting this question to the Supreme Court of Canada to re-open the question raised by Ontario respecting the fund and disposed of by the then Privy Council of the Dominion, the Government of this province protests against the Government of the Dominion sanctioning the submission of such a case to any court.\"\n\"The claim of the municipalities for one-fourth of the amount of the sales of school lands and one-fifth of the amount of the sales of Crown Lands made between the 14th June, 1853, and the 6th March, 1861, was twice decided against by the Government of the late province of Canada, first when the fund was supposed to have been abolished by Mr. Vankoughnet's Land Act of 1860, and secondly, when it was actually abolished by Order in Council. The late Mr. Langton, auditor of the late province of Canada, in his report at the time of Confederation on the subject, says:\n'In 1860 an Act was passed, which was intended to repeal the clauses which establish the Improvement Fund, and from the date of that Act all further apportionment of the receipts towards the Improvement. Fund was stopped.'\n'It was afterwards discovered that the repealing Act had quoted the old Land Act repealed by its title in the Consolidated Statutes, while in that compilation the clauses establishing the Improvement Fund had been inserted in another Act which remained in force. An Order in Council was then passed in March, 1861, abolishing the Fund, and at the same time a fresh distribution was ordered by the proportion of the receipts from the date when the former distribution had been stopped to that of the Order in Council finally abolishing the fund. In both cases the Governments of the day were guided by the date at which the payments on the land were received, and not by the date on which the sales were made.'\n\"A statement and recommendation submitted on the 17th September, 1863, to the Executive Council by the then Commissioner of Crown lands sets forth that:\u2014\n'The said fund has been regularly paid (with the exception of some few balances that remain to certain municipalities) down to the end of 1859, at which date the then Commissioner of Crown lands considered it expedient to stop further payments to the fund. With this view he omitted on the amended Land Act of 1860 the clause authorizing the creation of the fund, but in March, 1861, it was ascertained that the authority for the fund existed at the date of the Amended Land Act in the School Act, and not in the Land Act, as had been supposed. On the 6th March, 1861, an Order in Council was passed recinding that of the 26th July 1856.)'\n\"It appears to the undersigned that the Improvement Fund continued to accrue legally, and may be fairly claimed by the various municipalities of Canada West, down to the above date of 6th March, 1861, and he therefore respectfully recommends that the distribution thereof be made to them accordingly. Signed, William McDougall, Commisssioner.'\nAnd then Mr. Shehyn continues:\u2014\n\"The arbitrators appointed by the Ontario and the Dominion\u2014the arbitrator of the province of Quebec having retired\u2014treated the Common School Fund as an asset that they had power to divide and apportion in such manner as seemed to them right. They transferred to the province of Ontario as belonging to the Upper Canada Improvement Fund the amount of the sales of the Common School lauds made between the 14th June, 1853, and the 6th March, 1861, including $124,685.18, stated to have been received on account of these sales between the 6th of March, 1861, and the 30th June, 1867. The Province of Quebec has always contended that the transfer of any portion of this asset to Ontario, excepting the amount to which Ontario was entitled in proportion to population, was unwarranted and unfair.\"\n\"It should be borne in mind that the arbitrators had no power whatever to change in any way the statement of the debts and assets of the late Province of Canada as sanctioned by the Honourable the Privy Council after the conferenee held on the subject between the Dominion and the two provinces.\"\n\"Therefore in the award that they made while they unfairly, as Quebec contends, gave to Ontario a portion of the Common School Fund under the plea of transferring it to the Upper Canada Improvement Fund, they really had no power to increase the indebtedness of the late province of Canada to the Upper Canada Improvement Fund, a fact which their silence on the subject of the claim of Ontario respecting the one-fifth of the Crown lands sold as above mentioned, show that they themselves recognise.\" \"The government of this province therefore declined to join in any way in the proposed litigation or to make any changes or suggestions respecting the proposed case which has been submitted.\"\nIt is perfectly plain from this, that wrongly or rightly, the Province of Quebec by this letter, puts forth its contention that they were not bound by the award of 1870 in that respect, and that there was no occasion to make any deduction, that the Improvement Fund did not exist, and that there was no occasion to credit to the Improvement Fund either the $124,000, or 24 per cent of any future collections.\nThen I refer to Ontario's Order-in-Council of the 25th April, 1888, and Mr. Mercier's draft report to the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec of 24th October, 1888,\nIt seems to me that these documents show, and clearly show, that at that time, therefore, previous to the signing of the submission, that question was disputed between the Province of Quebec and the Province of Ontario. On the one hand Ontario seems not to be satisfied with the finality of the award of 1870 as to that question, and was demanding that the question be included in a new submission to be made to a new board of arbitrators. On the other hand Quebec was contending that Quebec was not bound by the award of 1870, and was refusing to submit that question to a board of arbitrators.\nI must say that when these negotiations took place they were not in connection with the board of arbitrators that were appointed in 1890, they were in connection with another board of arbitrators, or in other words, that the negotiations fell through, but when the negotiations were revived in 1892, and when the submission was signed, it seems to me that there was clearly before the parties the fact that there was in dispute that question between them, and therefore I say that when the deed of submission excludes all questions having reference to the Upper Canada Land Improvement Fund, that the question in connection with the $124,000 as well as the 25 per cent of the future collection formed part of and included in these questions respecting the Upper Canada Land Improvement Fund which were excluded from the reference, and therefore that the arbitrators had no power to take it into consideration.\nThen your Lordships have no doubt noticed that by the deed of submission the arbitrators are instructed to take into consideration, amongst other things, the sum now held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada as forming part of the School Fund. They were instructed not to inquire what the Improvement Funds were, but to ascertain the amount of principal of the Common School Fund, and when doing that to take into consideration, not only the sum now held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada, but also the amount for which Ontario is liable and the value of the lands, and so forth. Therefore it was incumbent upon them to ascertain, as their first operation, what was the Common School Fund which had been transmitted by the old Province of Canada to the Dominion at the time of Confederation, and to ascertain, as a second operation, what amount had been collected since and what remained to be collected. And, as a third operation, to make such deductions as they were allowed to make under the submission. That is, the submissions provided that they were not deductions in virtue of this Improvement Fund which had been taken away from their consideration; Ontario reserving by the submission their right to their claim if they were entitled to make any such claim under that head.\nNow, I say that if your Lordships will refer to the public accounts of the Province, as well of the Province of Canada as of the Dominion proper, you will find that at the date of submission the amounts that stood in the books of the Dominion as belonging to the Common School Fund was $1,733,000, less the amount invested in the Quebec Turnpike Trust, $50,000, plus some $30,000 of interest, and reducing therefore the amount at the credit of the Common School Fund in the books of the Dominion to the sum of $1,644,000, but no deduction at all of the $124,000. In this connection I will have to refer your Lordships to the following portions of the accounts.\nI take first Exhibit 56 accounts of the late Province of Canada and the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec. These accounts are under the heading of schedule from 1st July, '67, to 30th June, 1882. Second, Province of Ontario accounts for the same period. Third, Province of Quebec account for the same period.\nSchedule B of this exhibit contains accounts prepared by Mr. Langton. I will have to call your Lordships' attention to the fact that these accounts that were prepared by Mr. Langton and in which my learned friend may be able to find\u2014not a deduction of the $124,000 as made from the Common School Fund, but a credit of the amount of the Upper Canada Land Improvement Fund, to that amount of $124,000, were prepared at the special request of the Treasurers of Ontario and Quebec for a special purpose, and that they were not the regular accounts of the Dominion.\nI refer your Lordships, as far as this account Exhibit 56 is concerned, to Schedule A, page 8 where under date June, 1868, the Common School Fund is entered as $1,733,244.47, and the Upper Canada Land Improvement Fund at $5,100 odd.\nThen we have on page 10 of that same exhibit, where the entry as to the Upper Canada Land Improvement Fund is $5,119.08. In the other account there is no trace at all to be found of any deduction, and I would refer your Lordships to pages 10 and 11 in Roman figures of the paging to the memorandum respecting the unsettled accounts of the late Province of Canada, giving the history and so on. And, in this at page 10 will be found a memorandum without prejudice in which the treasurers of the two provinces propose the preparation of a statement of the various accouuts between them.\nThis is to explain how this Appendix B. happens to be found in these accounts, and how it came to be prepared in that special way. They were irregular accounts, prepared for a special purpose, at the special request and without prejudice, of the treasurers of both provinces, and Mr. Justice Burbidge seems to have lost sight of that, because he seems to have gone on these accounts.\nThe ground I take is that this special account did not form part of the accounts of the Dominion, did not form part of the accounts of the late Province of Canada which were continued by the Dominion, and that in this account proper no deduction whatever is to be found, and that they were the only accounts to which the arbitrators should have or were entitled to look.\nAgain, in Schedule C, of the same exhibit 56, your Lordships will find that $1,733,244.47 as being the amount of the Common School Fund in the hands of the Dominion, and the $5,119.08 as being the capital of the Improvement Fund in the hands of the Dominion. And it is only in the Province of Ontario account, with which surely Quebec can have nothing to do whatever, that the Canada Improvement Fund is credited with the $124,685.15.\nNext is an account of the late Province of Canada, and the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, with the Dominion from the 1st July, 1867, to the 30th June, 1885. The first one to which I refer is extended only to 1882. This is a continuation of the previous one to 1885, and your Lordships will find in that one again, in schedule A there is no reference at all; it is the mere continuation of the previous account, and there is no reference at all to the Common School Fund, but in schedule B on page 10 of the same exhibit 18, your Lordships will find that the Common School Fund stands at the sum of $1,733,244.47.\nThe same appears in other accounts in that exhibit. Now, I might be allowed to refer as a last reference on this subject to the Canada public accounts. Surely this is what should have guided the arbitrators. Here are the public accounts for the year 1892, therefore the public accounts as they stood at the time of the signing of this submission, in which your Lordships will find that the trust fund is stated, Common School Fund, at the sum of $2,582,373.80, and which is made up of the $1,645,644. These figures are not given, but I am giving them for the purpose of showing that the $2,582,373 was the amount of the fund without any deduction for Improvement Fund.\nI do not ask, nor do I expect, your Lordships will go into calculations, but this part of my argument is merely intended, and it seems to me an important part of the argument on this appeal, to show that the arbitrators were instructed to take into consideration the amount of the Common School Fund as it existed. Mr. Justice Burbidge seems to have gone on this principle, to say, well, we find it deducted in the account, we find $121,000 deducted in the account, and therefore we had not to make the deduction. It was already made. I propose to meet that argument later on, but now it seems to me that it is a much stronger ground if I can show that Mr. Justice Burbidge, as a matter of fact, is mistaken, and that he has not referred, in basing his statement, to the proper books.\nThere is no question at all that the arbitrators have dealt with this question of the Improvement Fund, as your Lordships will see by referring to the first paragraph and paragraph 4 of their award.\nIn arriving at these figures, they have made or taken into consideration the deduction of $124,000, and it is the reason of the dissent of Chief Justice Cassault, who says he is of opinion that the sum then held by the Dominion Government as part of the principal of the said Common School Fund was greater than has been stated by the amount of $124,680, and so on.\nI have referred to the correspondence and to the Orders in Council of the Government of Ontario for the purpose of showing that it was well understood that it was a question in dispute between the two Governments as to whether the award of 1870 was binding or not, was or was not intra vires, and it was always desired by the Government of Ontario to bring that question before the new arbitrators, and that Quebec was not consenting to it, and if I have succeeded in showing that it was one of the questions in dispute between the two provinces at the time, it seems to me that I may logically say, that all questions having been excluded, that this question must equally be included in the wording of the exclusion as well as the one of the $101,000; and, in connection with this question there was the same reason for Ontario in making the reservation as there was for the other amount, because Ontario did not want to be exposed to have these new arbitrators passing upon the Common School Fund without taking the Improvement Fund into consideration, and as a result of their decision to be open to this contention that they were not entitled to the deduction that had been ordered to be made by the first arbitrators.\nI was asked by your Lordships as to whether our position is altered by this judgment, and I think the best test to see whether our position is altered by this award of 1896, and in other words as to whether the present award has passed upon this question of the Canada Improvement Fund or not, is to suppose this: \u2014Suppose that Quebec to-morrow would appeal, would obtain by grace or otherwise, an appeal to the Privy Council from the award of 1870, without appealing from the last award, the award of 1896, would they not be told when they came to argue before the Privy Council that their appeal was insufficient because the question was settled not only by the award of 1870, but it was also settled by the award of 1896? Well, it is what I object to, and it is the only objection\u2014the main point of the appeal of Quebec is, we never consented, and were willing to stand by our position as to the award of 1870; whether we were bound or not by that award we were willing to stand by that award, to stand by our position such as it was made' but we never were willing or a consenting party to submit to another board of arbitrators to pass upon that question of the Improvement Fund, and we say, you have passed upon that fund, you have exceeded your powers, and we object to the award, we appeal from the award only in so far as we have done so. Of course if I do not succeed in showing to your Lordships that in the deed of submission it was stated that all questions having reference to the Upper Canada Land Improvement Fund were excluded\u2014if I do not succeed in convincing your Lordships that this comprised the question of $124,000, the balance of the 25 per cent collections out of the collections to be made, of course I must fail, but I cannot see a reason upon which that part of the judgment of Mr. Justice Burbidge may be maintained, especially when I show that the Government of Ontario was trying to obtain the consent of Quebec to submit that question again. Why? Becanse Quebec has repeatedly expressed its opinion that the award of 1870 would not avail, that it was on its face ultra vires, so far as that portion of the award was concerned. Now, Quebec was not willing. Quebec was taking that position; in the face of that decision they made a submission, and they say all questions, not only one question; if there was only $101,000 that was excluded, why not refer to that one question? I submit that under the words \"the questions,\" the whole of the questions which were in dispute between the parties at the time are covered.\nMy contention is to this effect, that the affirming of a previous award or a previous judgment involves dealing with the question. What we expected, what I claim that we were entitled to, was not to have the arbitrators to ignore, to decide against the award of 1870, but to establish, to find out or ascertain what was the Common School Fund in the hands of the Dominion and leaving it, reserving all rights under the award of 1870, or under any other judgment or any other rights in the terms of their reservation as appearing in the reference, but that we have never consented to be submitted to another judgment on the part of this board of arbitration, any more affirming the judgment of 1870, than disapproving of it.\nAs suggested to me by my learned friend Mr. Hall, the Ontario factum admits that the Land Improvement Fund is entirely excluded; and, I do not think that in the factum as it was filed before the arbitrators that it was limited to the $101,000. There was the admission that it was excluded, and no such interpretation as has been put on this by Mr. Justice Burbidge was put by Ontario, and I refer your lordships to page 12 of the Ontario factum where it is stated:\n\"That Ontario reiterates the objection to the jurisdiction of such arbitrators to deal with the Upper Canada Improvement Fund taken in Ontario's answer, whereby it appears that it was expressly agreed between the different parties that the questions with reference to the Upper Canada Building Fund and the Upper Canada Improvement Fund are not at present to form part of this reference.\"\nI call your Lordships' attention to the fact that the fund is not created by the statute, but section 7 gives power to the Governor-in-Council to create a fund.\nLet us assume for illustration that 16 Victoria instead of giving authority to create the Improvement Fund, had created the Improvement Fund, that the statute itself had created the Improvement Fund, and let us assume again that a few years after the passing of 16 Victoria, that is to say in 1868 or 1869, but before the rendering of the award of 1870, the Act of 16 Victoria had been entirely repealed, and that the arbitrators of 1870, losing sight of the fact that 16 Victoria which had created the Improvement Fund had been repealed, had proceeded as they have proceeded, deducting from the Common School Fund the sum of $124,000.00 or the 25 per cent; would it not be plainly a nullity on the face of the award? They were instructed what to do, to divide the common property between the provinces; and if they went under an erroneous assumption that the statute was in existence, which was repealed, their action would have been altogether null for want of jurisdiction, altogether ultra vires. That is the only extent to which we are arguing. We have no intention to attack the award so far as it deals with the Common School Fund, but we say that if there was no Common School Fund that was ever created, or that ever existed, that that part of the award, if it can be separated from the rest, and we claim it can be, must fall to the ground.\nNow what are the facts that we have before us here? I have assumed a state of things that does not exist, a statute creating the fund, and the repealing of the statute, but have we not virtually the same thing? We have the fact that the statute only authorized the creating of the fund, but that the Order in Council was never passed to create it, that the arbitrators have assumed that it was created, and on that assumption that they have set aside a fund that had no existence. And, this Order-in-Council, even if it had the effect of creating the fund, never intended to create the fund from the date of the 6th June, 1853, but from the 7th December, 1855, and therefore there is no question whatever, if this Order may be read as creating the fund, that there was no Improvement Fund until the 7th December, 1855, and the award has gone on the assumption that the fund existed and was not set aside, that the 25 per cent was set aside from the date of the 14th June, 1853.\nNow I say the same principle applies; that the fact that even if the Improvement Fund was created that the moment it was repealed in 1861, that the repeal was a complete repeal. It was supposed to have never existed from the date of the repeal. If there was a fund, and if it was as is admitted repealed, the repeal was not conditional, was not partial; it was an entire repeal; it was intended to be so, and it was treated as. such by the Government of the Province of Canada up to the time of Confederation. The question was passed upon by the executive on two or three different occasions, and it was treated as such, and the reason assigned by Mr. William MacDougall as Commissioner of Crown lands, was that there was a Colonial fund which was intended to take its place.\nThe position we take does not go any further than that. We did not assail the award of 1870 quoad the Common School Fund. The parties have accepted the award. We assail it merely if it was to be held that this question was not excluded from the reference which I claim is the case, and that therefore, either as the appellant or the respondent, the Province of Ontario has no right to call upon this court to go into that question at all on the present appeal. But, if it is not excluded from the reference, our action is free before this court, and was free before the arbitrators, and we were entitled to call upon the attention of the arbitrators\u2014who were appointed specially for the purpose of establishing and ascertaining what was the amount of the Common School Fund\u2014to establish that Common School Fund, irrespective of any such erroneous deductions for a thing that had no existence whatever.\nNow, a word only to make my position clear.. As I understood, from the outset, the first question was as to whether by the deed of reference it was intended to exclude the question\u2014the question not only of the 20 per cent of the Crown lands, but also the 25 per cent of the school lands for the Improvement Fund. That is the first question. Whether it was intended by the parties.\nI directed your Lordships' attention at the outset to the fact that it was a question in dispute; it was a question in dispute between the provinces when the submission was signed; that in 1870 or 1873. Quebec went before the Privy Council attempting through Mr. Benjamin to have the very contention that I have raised, taken into consideration; the Privy Council said \"the reference does not allow us to inquire into that question, and we will not pass upon that question.\" So that there is no doubt at all that at that time it was known to the two provinces that Quebec was disputing the effect of the award of 1870 quoad the setting aside of the 25 per cent out of the proceeds of the Crown lands.\nNow, I have called your Lordships' attention to another, important fact, that as late as 1889, in the correspondence exchanged between the representatives of the two provinces, the question was stated as one of the questions and was recognized as one of the questions that were in dispute between the provinces.\nNow, I have something stronger than that. I have the opinion of Mr. Chancellor Boyd in this case, in this award, and I have something stronger still the undoubted admission of the Province of Ontario before this court in their factum that it was intended by the parties to exclude this question from the reference. And, to make that clearer, I have only to call your Lordships' attention again to our notice of appeal. Our notice of appeal is not raising at all the question of the $101,000, that is the question of the 20 per cent in connection with the Crown lands. It is raising only this question of Improvement Fund.\nWell, what is the answer of Ontario in their factum as to that? In the face of this question raised, and it is limited, Ontario reiterates the objection to the jurisdiction of the said arbitrators to deal with the Upper Canada Improvement Fund taken in the Ontario answer whereby it appears that it was expressly agreed between the parties that the questions respecting the Upper Canada Building Fund and the Upper Canada Improvement Fund are not at present to form part of this reference.\nIf there was an exclusion, I say that the exclusion affects both parties, that it is for both parties and that both parties were prevented from arguing that question before the arbitrators, and that it was not within the province of the arbitrators to enter upon that question or to consider it in any shape or form.\nNow, it has been stated by Mr. Justice Burbidge, and, may be, the same difficulty apparently has passed in the minds of some of your Lordships, that it was a difficult operation, that from the fact that they were obliged, that they were instructed to ascertain what was the Common School Fund, that the arbitrators, as of necessity, had to inquire into that question. Well, let us see as to that. It will not be contended that it will not have been open to the parties to agree upon a reference to this effect, that the arbitrators were not to pass directly or indirectly on the question as to whether the $124,000 were to be deducted from the Common School Fund as stated in the first award. Suppose that the reference had read in that way, surely it would have been open to the parties to make a submission in those terms. There could have been no question it seems to me that if the reference or the submission had read in those terms, that the duties of the arbitrators would have been this. They were called upon to ascertain what was the amount of the principal of the Common School Fund at the time of submission as held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada. Well, they would have proceeded to ascertain what was the sum transmitted or handed over by the Province of Canada on the 1st July, 1867, to the Dominion of Canada. They would have proceeded as a second operation to find what was the amount collected since, and they would have had to stop there and to report that this was the amount of the principal school fund, subject to whatever deduction might have to be made by virtue of the award of 1870 or otherwise, and that is the whole of our contention. We say we are willing to stand, to take our position as our position was before we consented to this last deed of submission, but we do not want our position to be aggravated. If we have to face the first judgment, we do not want to be called upon to have to face the second judgment. The subject matter was excluded from the reference, and we will call upon you, the arbitrators, not to pass upon it, to reserve all the rights of Ontario, either by reason of the award of 1870 or otherwise, all the rights as they may be, but not to go and state and render a judgment\u2014a new judgment which if not assailed, might be binding on us. And, to show to what expedient the arbitrators had to go to proceed in the way they have proceeded, to try in appearance not to pass upon the question, I will have to refer your Lordships to the first paragraph of their award.\nOn referring to the award of 1870 your Lordships will find that in clause 7 the arbitrators reported thus: \"That from the Common School Fund as held on the 30th day of June, 1867, by the Dominion of Canada amounting to $1,733,224.47\" there is to be deducted so much. The first arbitrators have held, as was the case, that the amount of the Common School Fund as reported as transmitted from the Province of Canada to the Dominion was $1,737,000.00. Now, if your Lordships refer to the award in question here you will see how it agrees\u2014the first paragraph of the award:\n\"That the sum held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada on the 10th day of April, 1893, as part of the principal of said Common School Fund amounted to $2,447,688.62 made up of the following sums, that is to say, 1st, the sum of $1,520,959.29 that by the union of the provinces came into the hands of the Government of Canada.\" In one case we have it $1,733,000.00, and in the other we have it as of the same date at $1,520,000.00. That is the expedient to which they had to go to appear not to touch the subject matter.\nI have stated that Mr. Chancellor Boyd has expressed his opinion to the effect that the subject matter was excluded, and I have only to call your Lordships' attention to his opening remarks.\n\"So far as Quebec claims to impeach the action of the first arbitrators in their award of 1870, touching the Upper Canada Land Improvement Fund, and as to what they have directed to be placed to the credit of that fund, presently and prospectively, I cannot see my way to interfere for many reasons. For one thing the very subject matter is withheld from our jurisdiction by the terms of the reference.\"\nIf the subject matter is withheld from their jurisdiction surely they are not to pass upon it by way of affirming it, because it is passing upon it. They are not to take it into consideration at all.\nTrenholme Q.C. follows: There appears to have been two views on this subject of the Improvement Fund, as to whether it was excluded or not. Mr. Chancellor Boyd and Chief Justice Casault evidently appeared to think it was excluded altogether from the reference by the terms of the deed of submission. On the other hand Mr. Justice Burbidge appears to be of opinion that it is not this particular Improvement Fund arising out of the school lands; that another item of that fund is excluded, and that the arbitrators have the power to take up this matter and deal with it if necessary incidentally to the main object of the arbitration, namely, the ascertainment of the amount of the debt.\nNow, my learned friend's argument has proceeded, on the view that this fund is excluded, but the appeal of the Province of Quebec, it seems to me, is quite susceptible of being sustained upon either view. The appeal of the province of Quebec is that this Improvement Fund, in arriving at the amount of the School Fund, should be treated as a nullity in either case; whether it has been excluded by the deed of reference or whether it is not, the arbitrators in discharge of their duty in ascertaining the amount of this fund should treat it as a nullity.\nNow, the authorities or citations that will be made in support of either of these views,\u2014that is whether it is excluded or not from the record\u2014are, I think, somewhat numerous. There is a good deal to support each of these views. There is a good deal to support the view of Mr. Justice Burbidge that the Improvement Fund that was excluded\u2014the questions respecting the Improvement Fund\u2014were the questions respecting the $101,000 and the Building Fund. There is no doubt about that. And it cannot be stated that Quebec has been perfectly consistent throughout in saying that this $124,000, which is the item in question now\u2014in maintaining that that is an open question, that that was not settled by the award, because there is an Act of the Province of Quebec passed in 1883, 46 Victoria, of record here\u2014in which there is distinct recognition it seems to me by way of recital at least of the right of Ontario to this deduction of 25 per cent. That Act, however, was repealed in 1888, before this submission came up. It was not in force at the time the deed of submission was entered into between the parties. It had been set aside.\nAnd then there is correspondence between the Honourable Mr. Mercier and Sir Oliver Mowat, premiers, in which we cannot pretend it is not apparent, that Mr. Mercier was disposed to accept the $124,000 and that he looked upon \"questions in dispute\" as the $101,000.00 and the building fund also. Now, we do not pretend that the position of Quebec has been perfectly consistent throughout upon this question, but as the learned counsel for Ontario said in his opening remarks, these were simply abortive attempts at settlement that were not carried out, were not acted upon, and I think if we want to arrive at what the parties really must be supposed to have considered in dispute, we must see what their language was at or as near as possible to the time they entered into the deed of submission, and while that deed of submission was being acted upon between them.\nNow, if we take that, another matter may arise, and the parties may take a totally different view upon the subject. I may say as regards Quebec there was this, if any excuse is required for inconsistency in this matter, that there were changes of administration, changes of public men who were dealing with this. It is quite evident on the face of this record, that these public men had not a full grasp of the whole subject in connection with this, in many cases being new to their positions. Ontario had a decided advantage in the unity of administration and direction of this matter, and was consistent throughout in acknowledging the fund as we said, but Quebec had public men at that time who did not understand this and hence this would account for the inconsistency; but whatever inconsistency there was, I say it arose from attempts at settlement that were abortive. But the language of the parties used at or nearest before they entered into this deed of submission, and which they were acting on this deed of submission\u2014that language I think is most properly invoked in order to show what the real intentions of the parties were.\nNow, from that point of view, the court will see that the position taken by Quebec in the letter of Mr. Shehyn, in 1889, is the position of opposition to this $124,000. I maintain that the Province of Quebec takes the position that this $124,000 should not be allowed. I maintain that that was in dispute\u2014all that $124,000, and that was almost immediately before the submission was entered into.\nThen, we come to the deed of submission, and I suppose as a rule all that the parties have been negotiating about before is generally supposed to be summed up in that deed of submission, just as whatever private parties may agree to in a private contract is summed up in the terms of the contract, and if we take that deed of submission on its face it seems to me it excludes these questions. There is no exception there made, and Chancellor Boyd and Mr Justice Casault say \"it seems to me to exclude these questions.\"\nIf we go back to immediately after Confederation when the movement was set on foot to adjust the liabilities and assets between the provinces, we find that statements are made out by the Dominion executive exhibiting all the different items of liabilities and assets, and made out for the purpose of placing the case before the arbitrators. We find that conferences took place between all the governments; that extensive correspondence took place, and in these first statements and in the statements that the Dominion put before the arbitrators, simply a balance of some $5,000 odd put down as constituting the balance due to this Improvement Fund, and the $124,000 does not appear at all; and Mr. Wood, in his own statement, in his own letter first takes exactly the same position on behalf of the province of Ontario. Subsequently Mr. Wood puts forward this claim in his written claim before the arbitrators; when Quebec was not there he urged this claim, and it was allowed by the arbitrators, but here we have the position of Quebec and we have the Treasurer of Quebec protesting against this item, and we have him protesting constantly and the award in 1878, after a long series of protests, was carried to the Privy Council upon a statement of [the case under which it appears that Quebec understood she had a perfect right to raise this question, under the general question as to whether the award was valid or not. That appears to have been the opinion of the counsel then employed on the part of Quebec to prepare the case, I suppose; at any rate he appears to have tried to urge that view before the Privy Council, and Quebec did bring up this very question. She tried to urge this and other questions before the Privy Council, but it appears their Lordships took the view that they could not decide the merits of the case.\nIf that is the case, then we say that the arbitrators should not have dealt with it as they have dealt with it in this award; they should not have put the sanction of their own approval upon that deduction and Quebec should not be prejudiced by having the sanction of the present arbitrators put upon that; and should not be put in a worse position than before in respect of that award. And it was quite competent under the statute which gives your Lordships jurisdiction here which gives your Lordships the right to substitute the decision, as you did in the Indian annuities case\u2014the decision of this court for that of the arbitrators who have decided\u2014and to put the judgments or the matter in such a position that Quebec will not be prejudiced by what the present arbitrators have done or said in respect of this deductions in respect of this Improvement Fund, in their present award.\nNow, I wish to say this, that whatever view is taken of this matter, unless this Improvement Fund is a nullity, and unless we can invoke that in the present case consistently with the maintenance of the award of 1870 as a whole, I do not think Quebec can succeed in her appeal. The main object of the arbitration was to ascertain the amount of this fund. Now, did not that larger object naturally include every minor detail that was necessary to arrive at that conclusion? We might argue that that is the case, and if they came to an item that had been deducted from this fund, and that this item was a nullity, would not the present arbitrators in arriving at that fund have a right to say we find this nullity to exist as regards this item. There is a great difference between whether it is absolutely null and void, or whether it is a mere voidable thing, just as it is in the case of contracts. A contract may be an absolute nullity. No court would give a judgment on something that has no existence; but a court might well refuse to set aside a transaction that was simply voidable, which might have been set aside for grounds, but if this fund had absolutely no existence, if it was a nullity in point of law, then we say that the arbitrators had a right to say so, whichever view is taken, and had a right to ignore that item as an item to be carved out of the fund.\nNow, the learned counsel who spoke for Ontario, spoke of the indecency of Quebec putting forward a claim to attack this award while denying that Ontario could also do the same. I think it is easy to shew that Quebec is not open to such a remark as that, and if it was necessary to make any such remark upon the litigation of this case, that it could be made with much better effect with reference to the appeal of Ontario in this case, where she has sought, without any warning to Quebec, to raise such a question as she has raised in her appeal; but, I want to shew now that the position of Quebec is not open to any such remark. I want to show that the position of Quebec has been bond fide throughout this matter, and I begin here: When this matter came before the Privy Council on the award of 1870, consistent with all she had done before, and protesting against the award in this respect, it was raised there, and the Lord Chancellor in the Privy Council gave expression to remarks, laid down as it were rules.\nIt is the principle enunciated by the Lord Chancellor that we maintain Quebec has acted upon. I will call your Lordships' attention to one or two passages in that connection to show the idea under which Quebec has been proceeding in this matter. The idea that Quebec has had of her right to question this Improvement Fund as a mere nullity, and the authority which she cites, existed in the remarks of the Lord Chancellor in that appeal case. Here is what the Lord Chancellor says. \"If it was not within their parliamentary powers, it goes for nothing.\" Now that would apply to the Improvement Fund as much as to any other item.\nThen again he says: \"If they do anything more than they are authorized to do, it cannot have any possible effect.\"\nThen if it cannot possibly have any effect, when the question came up of ascertaining the amount of this School Fund, could we not say, the arbitrators here did something which was an absolute nullity, they acted as if there was a fund that existed that had no existence; can we not say that too, consistently with what the Lord Chancellor says in another place, when it is sought to enforce that part which is a nullity, that the Province of Quebec could resist it?\nThe two points that we submit are these. We say in the first place, taking the view that it is excluded, the view taken by Mr. Chancellor Boyd, and in the Ontario factum, and Chief Justice Casault\u2014we say then that the present arbitrators have dealt with the matter, and have put us in a worse position by their award, and that we should be protected against that. If the other view is taken, that it is not excluded, and that the arbitrators had, as Mr. Justice Burbidge says, incidentally a right to go into this question, then we say that the award is bad in allowing the deduction of $124,000 and in allowing Ontario to make the deduction from the sums which she collected for sales between those dates.\nHogg Q.C. for the Dominion:\u2014The Dominion is not, as your Lordships have mentioned once or twice, really interested in the contention existing as between the several provinces but the Dominion is interested in maintaining the award of 1870 in its integrity. The present award, the Dominion submits, should also be sustained. The Dominion is satisfied with that award, because it carries out and was intended to carry out what was arrived at under the award of 1870.\nNow, just a word or two with reference to the award of 1870. I submit, first of all, that no question can arise, in this appeal as to any isolated amount in that award, that is, that it cannot be attacked in any way for the purpose of shewing that an amount should not have been awarded. The award of 1870 was made under the 142nd section of the British North America Act. What the arbitrators had to do under that statute was to adjust and divide the assets, credits and liabilities. What they did do, so far as this particular fund is concerned, that is the Common School Fund, was, I submit, to adjust that fund, to ascertain it, and to adjust as between the provinces amounts which they thought under that statute should be placed in one fund or another. That is, they ascertained that there was $1,733,000 of the Common School Fund, and they, amongst other things, said, we will place to the credit of another fund $124,000, thereby it may be said either dividing a liability, or adjusting an asset. These so far as the Common Schools were concerned, were assets. So far as the Province of Canada was concerned at that time it was a debt or liability; so that they must have either considered under the 142nd section that they were adjusting an asset or dividing a liability, but whatever may have been the reasons that actuated the arbitrators of 1870, there is do doubt about this, that they were the statutory arbitrators, they were the final and supreme forum for the purpose of making this award. There is nothing in the 142nd section which gives any right of appeal or any right to question\u2014that is as a matter of law\u2014what they can do. In other words, the award which lis made under the 142nd section becomes as much a matter of law as the 142nd section itself. It is binding, and therefore cannot be interfered with or questioned or criticized afterwards.\nThe short history of it is this:\u2014In 1870 the arbitrators were appointed to divide the assets and adjust the liabilities and credits. They did to a certain extent. There were a large number of items particularly these referred to in schedule 4 of the British North America Act which were not dealt with, and what was intended by the submission of 1893 was to take up, and to take up upon the same principles and rules that guided the arbitrators of 1870, and finish, the business which had been left unfinished by them. So much is that the case, that in all the matters that have come before this board of arbitrators, those principles and rules which govern the ascertainment of the account are being constantly referred to, and have been made the rule of guidance both of counsel in arguing the cases and by the arbitrators who sat to decide upon these questions. These were the rules and principles that are in the long book, that were submitted to a council of all the representatives of the different Governments of the time, that were decided upon as the rules and principles to govern in the ascertainment of the account in 1870, and they are the rules and principles that are governing to-day this arbitration.\nThat is another reason why I submit that what was intended by this submission to arbitration was to carry out what was left undone, being thoroughly understood, agreed, as I say, by acts, statutes, Orders in Council and correspondence in every way that it was possible to conceive an award being adopted, and to continue the settlement of those accounts and to complete it under the statute of 1891.\nIt seems to me that what was said in the Indian Case is just as applicable and may be applied to this case just as strongly as it was to that, and probably more so, because all the acts of the parties, the provinces accepting the interest from time to time, dealing with the Dominion upon the basis of the award, the Dominion paying it over, publishing their accounts from year to year, their public accounts containing these items, the acceptance of these amounts by the provinces, is the strongest possible evidence of the interpretation which the provinces themselves must have put upon that award, and therefore it should not be disturbed, and I repeat the words of his Lordship the Chief Justice in which he says the award of 1870 must be conclusive upon all the parties to it, it has stood for 25 years, unimpeached except upon the points referred to the Judicial Committee, and to re-open it and disturb one of these provisions upon which other dispositions may have depended, would not only be most unfair, but would be a proceeding without legal warrant, statutory or otherwise. There is no doubt that award cannot be impeached. There is no court of appeal. There is no method of impeaching that award, and I submit that the award should be maintained.\nBlake Q.C. for the respondent Province of Ontario:\u2014I must begin by saying in answer to an observation that was made by the learned counsel, that I have no intention of criticising the conduct of counsel at present concerned or heretofore concerned in this case. I suggested that it would be an indecent result that Quebec should be able to insist upon, on the one hand holding this award as the award of 1870 a nullity as far as it was concerned, and at the same time shut up the province of Ontario and say that it was bound by it. The learned counsel, before and now, have acted upon their instructions and are not exposed to any criticism, but I must repeat my observation with reference to that result.\nAs far as I can judge it is rather recoiled from now, and there is a greater degree of tenderness with reference to the award of 1870 in the latter part of this discussion than might have been expected from the language used on former occasions.\nNow, your Lordships will observe that upon this appeal my argument is entirely from a different standpoint in one respect than the argument before, because this appeal becomes material only upon the theory that my appeal fails. If my appeal succeeds, there is no fund out of which the Land Improvement Fund can be formed, and it is immaterial what happens to it. It is only then upon the theory that my appeal fails that it becomes material to consider this question.\nUpon that theory I must assume that there was a Common School Fund, or that there must be held, for the award of 1870, to have been a Common School Fund, which was an asset to be divided and apportioned, and if so there was a jurisdiction. If there was a jurisdiction, as Chief Justice Casault himself observed in the long and able judgment which he delivered, it was entirely within the power of these arbitrators to have divided the asset in any way which they pleased between the provinces. It might have proceeded upon a mistaken assumption that facts existed that did not exist, that Orders in Council had one interpretation or the other, or statutes had created the fund instead of only authorizing the creation, but it was within their power to determine that one dollar or a million, should go to the one province or the other; so that learned judge points out with clearness, that he is only able to sustain his objection to this particular action upon the ground that it is excluded from the reference, or upon the ground that the action of the arbitrators themselves was ultra vires because they had only power to divide, but as to their power to apportion in any proportion which they deemed just, however unjust it might be upon any assumption which they made, however unjustifiable there is no difficulty.\nWell, if so, what was the result? Let us get at the state of facts which was created, which was created by the award of 1870, that there was carved out of the Common School Fund, the sums mentioned in the award of 1870. It was taken out, Mark the language of the award of 1870. The arbitrators began by carving out of the Common School Fund what they say really does not belong to it, the $124,000, and they deal with the residue only.\nNow, that is what is done. Was it right? I believe it was right if they had any power to act at all. As I said before, it was the nearest and the most accurate perpetuation of the fund which they assumed to exist which the wit of man can devise. Right or wrong was it done? It was done. Done conclusively and produced a new state of things. That it produced that new state of things depended upon the validity of the award as a whole, and whether the award as a whole was a valid instrument in view of the objections taken by Quebec, remained uncertain until the period of the decision of the Privy Council. That decision, although it partakes of the characteristics which have been referred to, having regard to the fact that there was no tribunal in the world before which the question could be raised, of course did practically and substantially end the matter, and was assumed to end the matter to the extent to which it went, of course that is to say dealing with the objections taken by Quebec in the special case.\nMy learned friend Mr. B\u00e9\u00efque flung a pebble at the award, but he expressly said I am not going to attack the award. Since then there has been, with the usual inconsistencies that characterise the parties in this case\u2014there has been a little more mud flung at the award, but, after all doesn't it come down to this, that it is impossible to contend that there was other than an error in judgment? My learned friend says they wrongly construed the statutes and the Order-in-Council, and he says they assumed things to exist which did not exist, and they came to a wrong judgment. That is not a question of extra vires or intra vires; that is an appeal from the judgment of the arbitrators on a matter within their jurisdiction.\nThen mark the other limitations my learned friends make. There is nothing they are more anxious about than that the award should stand in those main elements. Nothing, we will say, they say, which shall attack the award, if it is going to impugn the action as to the Common School Fund. Therefore it is only, if your Lordships hold that this particular of the dealing of the Common School Fund is separable from the rest, that we attack it at all. They earnestly implore your Lordship to note that they do not attack it, if your Lordships should conclude that you could not separate that from the rest. It is only a sort of conditional attack, because they feel the delicate and difficult ground on which they stand if once they open the award.\nNow, is it possible to seriously contend\u2014have my learned friends, with all the temerity of argument which in other respects they displayed ventured seriously to contend\u2014that this item is separable from the distribution by the parties of the Common School Fund? Grant to me this, that the arbitrators were of the opinion which they have expressed by their award, that it was a just and proper thing to carve out $124,000 and 25 per cent from the subsequent collections\u2014is it possible to aver with a straight face before a court that that conception and view of theirs, acted upon by them, is not a part of their dealing with the Common School Fund, and that you can divide and eliminate that portion of their dealings and disposition of the $124,000 and the 25 per cent of the other collections. How? They have not disposed of it. Is an award good which leaves part of the subject undisposed of? Is that portion of it in which you destroy the award, as a portion of the whole subject, to be set aside and the remainder to stand. I cannot divine a case in which there is a greater intimacy of action between the part they attack and the part they desire to maintain. I find it difficult to comprehend how any man can seriously argue that the one can stand and the other fall as a nullity, and if it does what is to happen? As I have said, it is undisposed of. They have not divided that. They have not dealt with it. Are you going to deal with it? We know that the failure to dispose of the subject matter referred is a fatal defect in an award. So that the very attack which my learned friends make, this sort of conditional and hypothetical attack which they make upon the award of 1870, makes that attack its failure. They cannot attack in that way. They must attack with a whole heart and with more fairness. They must strike with the knowledge of the consequence of their attack, and that is the ground which I took in my opening on the other appeal, and which I repeat now, that the Province of Quebec cannot attack this award without the whole of the subject of the Common School Fund being open, and we being free as well, if they are free.\nNow, one word before I proceed to deal with the other matters which are relevant to this question. One word upon two isolated points. Your Lordships adverted to, and my learned friend Mr. Hogg adverted to, the attitude of the Dominion. And irrespective of the long course of dealing which was pursued by the Dominion, I called my learned friend's attention, and I called your Lordships' attention to a specific act with reference to this particular matter.\nI refer to an Order in Council of October 15th, 1891, in whieh an allotment to Ontario was recommended in payment of principal owing to that province, which principal was included in this $124,000, so that you have a specific Act of the most cogent kind by the Dominion upon this theory, and while of course the representations of Mr. Mowat do not bind the Province of Quebec\u2014I do not set them up as binding it\u2014they are accepted by the Dominion, they represent the state of facts, and it was present to the minds of the Dominion Government, and upon which the Dominion Government acted at that time.\nI am going to deal with the course and conduct of Quebec in reference to the $124,000 by itself. I was about dealing with the isolated question, the question of the Dominion, and in the same sense and connection, and although I am affecting the part of Quebec, and affecting it expressly, I also refer to exhibit 56 A and exhibit 18 and exhibit X, each of which are accounts by the Dominion commencing in 1884, a triennial extension, in each of which the account of the Province of Ontario is credited with $124,000 in making the account. My learned friend proposes to neutralise the importance of those accounts by saying that the first of them proceeded upon a request from the treasurers of both provinces that the account should be prepared in this form, which request was headed without prejudice. And he says that those accounts are of no consequence because the treasurer of his own province asked that they should be prepared in that form. I should have said, that if there was a circumstance which gave them cogency and importance, it was that circumstance; but, so it is that they were prepared and continued, and they are in the official papers of the Dominion showing the Province of Ontario credited with $124,000.\nNow then, another isolated point before I proceed with the main subject. Here is a very important paper. It is an extract from the account called Z, prepared by the Dominion accountant by direction of the board of arbitrators in August, 1893. This was a general account of affairs, and what is given? The subsidy' statement gives: To Ontario, increased deduction one year's interest; one half year's interest; half year's subsidy. Then come Trust Funds for Ontario; Common School Fund from 1st July, 1867, to 11th January, 1889, $1,520,595.29. Add on 11th January, 1889, $925,625.63. Add on 19th April, 1890, $11,103.70. Total $2,457,688.62.\nIt thus gives, not the apportioning of the capital as a divisible sum which was impossible to divide belonging to Ontario, but it gives the whole of that Common School Fund as they understood it, and then it proceeds to deal with that alone which they could deal with the interest upon the Ontario side, the proportion of interest payable semi annually to Ontario calculated according to the award and population after the decennial census from 1st July, 1867, to 31st December, 1870, $21,169.14. From 1st January, 1871, to 31st December, 1880, $21,914.35. From 1st January, 1881, to 31st December, 1890, $22,280.04.\nAnd on the accretion of $925,625.63, 11th January, 1889, to 31st December, 1890, $13,559.19, and so on. And the total to 31st December, 1892, $36,057.10.\nThen it gives the Upper Canada Grammar School Fund, the Upper Canada Land Improvement Fund, capital $124,685.18, interest $3,117.13, giving a total of interest of $47,746.14.\nNow, by the direction of the arbitrators, at this early stage, this statement is prepared for the guidance of the board according to those principles which they laid down, principles which deduct from the Common School Fund, the Land Improvement Fund, which makes a total of capital of the Common School Fund to be dealt with in the aggregate of 1867, less the $124,000, adding to that the two payments made by Ontario in the interval, which range according to the decennial censuses for each period, the interest payable to Ontario on that account, and which proceeds to give to Ontario the $124,000 of the Land Improvement Fund. And then for Quebec Common School Fund, the principal is the same as for Ontario, and the amounts payable for interest are $16,000, and then according to the decennial censuses diminishing instead of increasing, because the proportion of the increment or population were different, and they find their total for Quebec.\nNow, then, I hold that from the period of the award of 1870 which settled this matter, the effect was that the amount held by the Dominion Government for the Common School Fund was the $1,520,000. I hold that it had been conclusively adjudged upon the theory\u2014that I am bound to assume\u2014that it was a trust fund, it had been conclusively settled and adjudged at $1,520,000.\nNow, I ask what the language of the reference is. The language of the reference is to ascertain what the amount now held by the Dominion Government on account of the Common School Fund is. And, if I have shown to your Lordships that the amount by the Dominion Government on the 30th June, 1867, or 31st July, when it existed, was $1,520,000, that is the first item in the accounts. What my learned friends want to do is to say that the arbitrators should find that the amount now held is composed of $1,733,000 plus the subsequent payments by Ontario. I say that the amount at that time held by the Dominion Government was the amount which the award had found was the true Common School Fund amount and that they did not hold the Upper Canada Land Improvement Fund as part of the Common School Fund at all, they held it as Upper Canada Land Improvement Fund for Ontario as they acknowledged by this Order in Council, to which I have referred, and by these accounts which were prepared by the treasurer. Therefore I say the reference is impossible of execution upon any other theory. Now, my learned friend Mr. B\u00e9\u00efque rather boldly stated that he would establish by the record, by the Acts and correspondence, that this was a matter in dispute, and that circumstance he deemed of vital importance to his case.\nI undertake to prove from the documents that the course of Quebec has not been inconsistent since the period of award of 1870, or inconsistent at all. I admit, with my learned friends, that during the period of the arbitration of 1870, while Quebec was present, it contested the Land Improvement Fund, I admit with my learned friends that after that period and up to the period of the reference to the Privy Council, and its decision, it contested the Land Improvement Fund, but I aver that from the day on which that decision was reached up to the time at which this question was started in this arbitration., I find nothing at all to justify that aspersion, if it is to be called one, upon the Province of Quebec, which has been cast upon it by its counsel who sought to excuse it by changes of administration, and ignorance of political administrators. They have never contested, they accepted as just, the award of 1870 upon the Land Improvement Fund, they have always since the decision of the Privy Council admitted that there was an end of the question, that it had been forced upon them by circumstances over which they had no control. Admitted it in terms and admitted it by their action.\nNow, I have to trouble your Lordships by running, as rapidly as I can, through the relevant correspondence. I shall not extract from the mass of this correspondence, three letters in the middle each of them susceptible, as I shall demonstrate to your Lordships, of an entirely different, and properly to be given an entirely different, interpretation from that which has been given to them by my learned friends. I shall bring your Lordships to them in their proper sequence. I shall give you the whole correspondence for or against, and I rely with confidence upon bringing your Lordships irresistibly to the conclusion that the attitude of Quebec has been one and continuous in favour of the view that however much she might dislike it, she was bound by the award of 1870 to the extent to which that award proceeded, and the attitude, I agree, of stern resistance to any concession of any kind which might enable Ontario to gain any means of pressing her claim to the $101,000 to the Crown lands part of the Improvement Fund; there is the attitude. Unwilling assent to the fact that she is bound to the Common School portion of the fund.\nNow on the 25th March, 1879, Harris, assistant treasurer of Ontario, writes on the Premier of Quebec, Mr. Joly, saying that he sends a statement showing Quebec's share of the Common School Fund as requested in his communication addressed to the Attorney General, and what is material in that is the enclosure.\n\"Memorandum.\u2014Quebec's share of Common School Fund:\nCollections on account of land sold between the 14th June, 1853, and 6th March, 1861.\n$673,834 42\nLess 5 per cent cost of management\n$ 40,430 06\nOne fourth for Land Improvement Fund\n165,958 60\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n$ 206,388 66\n$467,445 76 Collection on account of land sold since 6th March, 1861\n$ 262,675 39\nLess 6 per cent cost of management\n15,760 52\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n$246,914 87\n$714,360 68\nQuebec entitled to interest as provided by award and statute, on\n$302,652 68\nMark the distinction. Cut into two pieces. The portion of the lands sold during the continuance of the fund as found by the award of 1870, deduction made for the awarded share, the portion since without any such deduction, except the 6 per cent for the cost of management.\nThat was replied to on 31st March, 1879, accepting in terms the principle upon which the amount had been stated, and asking for further details in order to ascertain what interest was due to the Province of Quebec in respect of the moneys, which according to that principle were received by the Province of Ontario on joint account.\nOn 28th November, 1882, Mr. Wurtele, the Provincial Treasurer, wrote to the Treasurer of Ontario for payment.\nAnd that was answered. On January 26th, 1883, Wurtele wrote to Wood, Provincial Treasurer, another request for money. Sessional Papers, Ontario, 1884, No. 43, page 2.\nNow, your Lordships have referred to the Act of 1873. I want to show you its genesis. I read the letter. The provincial treasurer of Quebec introduced a bill, and he asks the Province of Ontario to consider it and say whether they think it is right, and he is willing to take into consideration any reasonable amendment, and that is the Act assented to on the 30th March, 1873. That is the genesis of it. That is the spirit in. which it was conceived, and the terms of it.\nNow, what is the answer. It is found in the preamble to the Act, 46 Vict. ch. 22 (Que.) (Reads first recital.)\nI have here the interpretation of the legislation of Quebec of the original right, I have a recital that that was true, that that was the state of the case, not unwillingly in this instance, but because it was correct, they state that as the true state of the facts.\n(The learned counsel then read the other recitals in the preamble and the first five sections of the statute.)\nThe Act of the Province of Ontario passed in this connection was a short one. They had none of these matters to settle, but they did pass an Act, 46 Vict. ch. 3, reciting a proposal to try and settle the shares and giving authority to the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council to enter into an agreement.\nThere followed some time after that a conference to which my learned friend Mr. B\u00e9\u00efque has referred and which is reported to his Government by the Treasurer of the Province of Quebec, and Order-inCouncil approving of that report. That conference indicates the memorandum without prejudice to which my learned friend Mr. B\u00e9\u00efque referred, sets it out, under which the accounts were requested to be prepared by the Dominion arbitrator, and the Government of Quebec approved of the course taken in making that arrangement. And this was the genesis of these three triennial statements, roughly speaking, which I have referred to.\nThen on the 27th April, is a letter from the assistant treasurer of Quebec on behalf of the treasurer to the treasurer of Ontario. Ontario Sess. Papers, 1884, No. 43, page 3. Once again consecutive, no matter how many administrations change, or how much or how little they know of the affairs of the province, you still have the same recognition of this state of things continuing.\nThen the answer given and the enclosure are to be found in Ontario Sess, Papers 1884, No. 43, page 4, shewing the amounts collected on account of Common School Lands for each year between the 1st July, 1867, and 31st December, 1882, shewing the amounts received on account of Land Improvement Fund (i.e. land sold between 14th June, 1853, and 6th March, 1861), and amounts collected on lands sold before 14th June, 1853, and since 6th March, 1861.\nNext is the transmission by the Assistant Treasurer of Quebec on the 15th October, 1883, to be found in Ontario Sess. Papers, 1885, No. 45, page 3 of the memrandum asked by the Treasurer. That is the memorandum without prejudice which required a statement of the amount coming to each province under the award, for Library and Common School, and Crown Land Improvement Fund. A letter from the Deputy Minister of Finance of Canada to the Treasurer of Ontario on May 8th, 1884, shews that the Dominion then was recognising the fact, and acting upon it.\nI next refer to the memorandum for executive council of interview with Minister of Finance, Ottawa, on October 21st, 1884, as to the settlement of the accounts between the Dominion of Canada and the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec.\nAt this conference Treasurer Robertson, of Quebec, gave a lot of extracts from his contention and pretention before the award of 1870 directed to the fight that he was then making, but the fight then was limited to that about which a fight alone might be made, viz., the $101,000. In the Ontario Sess. Papers, 1886, No. 37, page 3, is a letter dated February 26th, 1885, from the Treasurer of Quebec to the Treasurer of Ontario.\nOn March 16th, 1886, the Treasurer of Quebec wrote to Treasurer of Ontario. Ontario Sess. Papers, 1887, No. 60, page 3.\nIt is ad nauseam. It is repeated over and over again.\nAll the correspondence shows the same thing. The inquiry for these particulars, useful only in order to make the deduction from the gross necessary to ascertain the net share of Quebec.\nThen Machin again, 5th April, 1886, protests strongly \"against the withholding of the amount of interest due on its share of the proceeds of the sales of Common School land, collected and retained by the Government of Ontario, and trusts that the Government of Ontario will reconsider its conclusion that it is advisable that no further payments on account of this fund be made until a settlement is arrived at between the Provinces and the Dominion, as such a determination would be a distinct violation of the conditions of the 9th section of the award, the acceptance of which was forced upon this Province by Ontario.\"\nBut they say they expected it, and they complain that Ontario is not paying the interest as they conceive according to it, and they say that the delays are not their fault. Of course everybody always throws the delay upon the other party.\nNow we come to a letter of 18th March, 1887, from Treasurer Shehyn to Treasurer Ross in which he asks for a detailed statement of collections on Common School Lands.\nIt does not look very much like disputing at that time.\nAgain the Assistant Treasurer writes on the 19th January, 1888. Ontario Sess. Papers, 1888, No. 49, page 8, On 3rd February, 1888, the statement asked for was furnished.\nThen Prime Minister Mercier comes upon the scene. On April 14th, 1888, he writes to Mr. Mowat:\u2014\n\"My dear Mr. Mowat,\u2014I send you a copy of our statutes of 1883 in which at page 79, chapter 22, you will find an Act to provide for the final settlement of the Common School Fund.\"\nHe refers to the Act of 1883, and they make much of the repeal. I will show your Lordships the circumstances of th\u00e9 repeal. Now he says:\u2014\n\"That law is still in force and has been passed by Mr. Wurtele as the result of an agreement with you at the time.\"\n\"Of course I understand the insufficiency of that law now, but could you suggest me a way to amend it in order to meet the case?\"\nThere was then a desire to close up the whole matter by a division of the fund, and that the law. was inadequate, because the law kept the fund perpetual, although the proportions were to be ascertained.\n\"You know that an amendment of an opponent's law is still better for that opponent than any wise new law.\"\n\"I suppose you are now quite ready to send me your case in this matter of the School Fund in order that we might agree to submit one at our session in May.\"\nYour Lordships will observe that there is the suggestion on the part of Mr. Mercier to his friend the Prime Minister of Ontario that the statute was all wrong, that it had made admissions, that he wanted to raise new subjects of controversy. It is a friendly letter, wanting to know what suggestions the Prime Minister of Ontario could make in order that this further idea of getting hold of all by the provinces might be carried out, and he wants to amend it. He does not want to repeal it. He would like to amend it, so as to amplify it a little, and make it all right.\nThen Mr. Mowat, 25th April, 1888, on the same page, says:\n\"I send you our proposed Order in Council re appointment of arbitrators. Please return it to me with any changes which you would suggest, in order that the orders of the two Governments may be expressed in the same terms.\"\nThe proposed Order-in-Council provided for appointment of three arbitrators to settle questions between the two Provinces arising from the award of 1870.\n\"The questions which have arisen between the Governments of Ontario and Quebec are as follows:\"\n\"Relating to the claim made by Ontario that on the 30th June, 1867, the Upper Canada Improvement Fund, which, by the 5th paragraph of the award, was declared to be the property of and to belong to the Province of Ontario for the purposes for which that fund was established and composed of the sum of $124,685.18 as proceeds of the Common School lands and of the sum of $101,771.68 as proceeds of the Crown lands in respect of sales made between the 14th June, 1853, and the 6th March, 1861, and that this latter sum should be credited to Ontario by the Dominion Government together with interest thereon from 1st July, 1867, and the total added to the debt of the late Province of Canada.\"\nThere was the contention. My learned friends say that Mr. Mowat was acknowledging that there was in dispute the question of the $124,0.00, and your Lordships see perfectly well the question was whether there should be added to that the $101,000, which sum, not like the $124,000, would have to be added to the debt of the old Province of Canada. And the result of adding to the debt would have been that Quebec would have had to bear its share. That was the objection of Quebec. That is the first question, and that first question, instead of being such as my learned friend contends, is a question naturally and reasonably raising the point still undisposed of by the award, the point as to the $101,000, and leaving the other where it was.\nThen there is a second question about interest which I need not read, and a third question about interest upon part of the Upper Canada Building Fund, and that is one of the questions afterwards omitted.\nNow, we are beginning to get at the genesis of the changes. You find two questions out of three. One, interest on building fund, one, the $101,000 and interest, and the third, interest allowed on Common School Fund; whether Ontario is liable, which of course had to be referred.\nThen Mr. Mercier writes on October 24th, 1888, hoping that Mr. Mowat would be able to come to Ottawa to discuss the arbitration the next day, and ends:\n\"Under all these circumstances and with the view chiefly to agree on matters to be submitted to the Common School Fund arbitration, I hope you will come.\"\n\"I have prepared a draft for an Order-in-Council which is a little different with yours.\"\n\"Our two Treasurers have met the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Justice, and seem to be satisfied with the interview.\"\nAnd then his draft is this, and it is important.\nIt recites that three arbitrators were appointed to effect the division and readjustment of the debts, credits, liabilities, properties and assets of Upper Canada and Lower Canada, to wit:\n\"That the Government of the Dominion of Canada and the Government of the Province of Ontario acquiesce in the said decision or award of the arbitrators.\"\n\"That the said award divided the assets and liabilities of Upper and Lower Canada to the 30th day of June, 1867, leaving still to be divided between the provinces of Ontario and Quebec such sums as remained to be collected by the Government of Ontario from and after the said last mentioned date, the 30th of June, 1867, on account of the Common School Fund, upon the price of sale of the lands set apart for the said fund and sold before or since the said last mentioned date or which might be sold thereafter.\"\n\"Since the 30th June, 1867, the Government of Ontario has collected various sums of money being the proceeds of the sale of the said land, and which under the provisions of the said award should have been paid into the hands of the Dominion Government and the revenue whereof divided between Ontario and Quebec.\"\n\"That there still remain due divers other sums of money on the sale of the land set apart for the said fund.\"\n\"That there are certain lands set apart for the Common School Fund which still remain in the possession of the Government of Ontario, and which have not been sold.\"\n\"That the Government of the Province of Ontario consents to purchase and the Government of the Province of Quebec consents to sell at such price as may be determined by award of arbitrators the share of the Province of Quebec in the lands set apart for the Common School Fund which have not yet been sold as well as its share in the amounts which remain to be collected on the price of sale of the lands set apart for the said fund sold since the establishment of the fund. That by the Act passed at the last session of the legislature of Quebec entitled, an Act to provide for the settlement of certain questions in dispute between the Provinces of Quebec and Ontario by the means of arbitration, it is enacted that for the final and conclusive determination of certain questions still pending between the Province of Quebec and the Province of Ontario, the Lieutenant Governor in Council may unite with the Government of Ontario in the appointment of these arbitrators to whom shall be referred such of these questions which the Governments of both provinces shall mutually agree to submit.\"\n\"1. What is the capital amount collected by the Government of Ontario since the 30th June, 1867, on the sale of lands set apart for the Common School Fund, and which is the share belonging to the Province of Quebec on such amount?\"\n\"2. Does the Province of Ontario owe any interest on the balance of the moneys which it has collected on the sale of lands set apart for the Common School Fund after deducting 6 per cent on moneys collected by it, for the sale and management of the lands set apart for the Common School Fund, and also one-fourth of the balance of the proceeds of the said lands sold between the 14th day of June, 1853, and the 6th day of March, 1861, for the Upper Canada Improvement Fund?\"\nAnd my learned friend actually has cited this Orderin-Council as proving that the question was in dispute.\n\"3 If Ontario owes any interest, from what date and at what rate should the same be calculated? Should such interest be simple or compound? Should it be added to the capital yearly or half-yearly?\" \"4. What is the extent and what is the value of the land set apart for the Common School Fund and still unsold?\"\n\"5. What should be the share of the Province of Quebec in the value of such lands?\"\n\"6. What is the amount and what is the value of the sums of money remaining unpaid on the price or sale of the lands set apart for the Common School Fund?\"\nWell, of course all this was abortive, but I am bringing your Lordships straight along through the whole negotiations to find one consecutive, continuous course of recognition of this by the Province of Quebec.\nThen, on December 6th. Mr. Mercier writes to the Hon. Mr. Mowat:\n\"I have your letter of the 30th ultimo, to which I could not answer sooner for reasons that I need not explain here. The first remark of your letter is in these words: 'Your letter of the. 22nd instant makes no reference to my letter of the 7th with regard to the arbitrations embracing all questions in difference, and not merely those relating to the school lands. I also spoke in that letter of the technical difficulty of taking the other questions before the court without the consent of both parties, though there must be some way of doing so.' \"\nIn my letter of 22nd November last I said:\n'Of course I understand that if we do not insist on the arbitration on these two points, your and Mr. Ross's other objections are not insisted upon, and our draft of Order in Council will be accepted, these two items being struck off.' \"\nThe letter of Mr. Mowat's, to which this letter of Mr. Mercier's is a reply, is dated 7th November, 1888. It says: \"I understand the principal questions\u2014besides those relating to the school lands\u2014to be as follows:\n\"The Land Improvement Fund, that is the right of claim of certain of our municipalities in respect of Crown lands sold between the 14th June, 1853, and the 6th March, 1861.\n\"Whether interest on the $600,000 payable to Upper Canada under the Seignorial Acts should be 5 per cent or 6 per cent.\n\"Possibly there may be some other minor matters between the two provinces which may not be agreed to in settling the accounts.\"\n\"I have already mentioned to you that Mr. Treasurer Ross is strongly of opinion that the arbitration should embrace all the questions or none. One, though not the only reason for this, is that any sums found to be owing by your province should be set off against what may be payable to you by this province in respect of these school lands. Before the Treasurer had mentioned his view to me I thought we might go on with the arbitration which you desired, and have the other matters disposed of by the courts, but on looking into this matter I have not found any authority for a province being sued without its own consent. The Ontario Legislature passed an Act, now R. S. O., 1887, ch. 42, consenting that the Supreme Court of Canada and the Exchequer Court should have jurisdiction amongst other things in controversies between this and the other province, but I believe no such Act was passed in Quebec.\"\n\"You suggested in our interview that the old award decided against Ontario the question of the Land Improvement Fund, but this Government and the municipalities concerned have always taken a different view, and after an arbitration had been verbally agreed to at our interview here, the treasurer communicated to these municipalties and the public that such an arbitration would include this question, and the municipalities have since employed counsel of their own to see to their interests before the arbitrators, as, whatever comes to the province under this head belongs to these municipalities and is to be paid over to them.\"\nThen as I have said, we have the reply in which Mr. Mercier says:\n\"I understand your treasurer wants to strike off the items 4, 5, 6 and 7 and if he insists we must consent, although I may repeat here my remarks made in my letter of the 22nd November last. * * *\n\"I must, I suppose, understand that Mr. Ross persists in his objection, and that the only way to settle the difficulty on these two items is a meeting of our two treasurers. The only objection now to arbitration is therefore your desire not to limit the questions submitted to the School Lands Fund, but to include in it:\"\n\"The Land Improvement Fund\u2014that is the right or claim of certain of our municipalities in respect of Crown Lands sold between the 14th June, 1853, and the 6th March, 1861.\"\n\"2. Whether interest on the $600,000 payable to Upper Canada under the Seignorial Act should be 5 per cent or 6 per cent.\"\n\"3. Some other minor matters between the two provinces which may not be agreed to in settling the accounts.\"\n\"I put these three questions in the terms you do it in your letter of the 7th November, 1889. You agreed with me that according to the declarations officially made in our house by the treasurer and myself, we must limit as far as Quebec is concerned the arbitration to the first five questions mentioned in our draft of Order in Council, and you suggest to settle this difficulty by submitting the other questions before the court, and as we have no laws similar to yours, to allow our province to be sued in cases as the one mentioned by you, to have such law passed at the next session.\"\n\"I am very sorry indeed to have to inform you that this is not practicable for the following reasons:\u2014\"\n\"1. The arbitration between Ontario and Quebec took place by virtue of section 142 of the British North America Act.\"\n\"2. We understand in Quebec that the award has been very unjust to us, but being unfortunately bound by it, we cannot consent to re-open any question outside of the School Lands Fund, being afraid that our interests might still be endangered.\"\n\"3. The only questions that may be arbitrated now, we understand, are those mentioned in our draft of Order in Council as deriving from the disposition of section 9 of the award, which having left this question open, makes a necessity of a new arbitration on that point.\"\nHe wants to make the consequential arrangements, which from the necessity of the case the arbitrators of 1870 could not settle, because they had to do with undetermined amounts, assets of collections which were not yet got in. And, your Lordships will see he does not want to go outside of that.\u2014\n\"4. All the other questions pending between the two provinces have been settled, although against us, we believe by said award, the first section of which divides the amount by which the debt of the late Province of Canada exceeded on the 30th day of June, 1867, $62,500,000 and the 15th section of which states:\u2014\n'That the several sums awarded to be paid and the several matters and things awarded and directed to be done by or with regard to the parties to this reference respectively as aforesaid shall respectively be paid, received, done, accepted and be taken as a final end and determination of the several matters aforesaid.'\nAnd he cites the French version as being still more clear.\nAnd then he goes on to deal with the Upper Canada Building Fund item of Mr. Mowat's proposed reference:\u2014\n\"5. We do not find any record of Ontario having ever claimed the one per cent additional on the $600,000 from May 5th, 1869, before the arbitrators' award was made. It is not included in the revised statement of debts admitted by Ontario on the 11th day of December, 1869, which contains the addition of the Upper Canada Improvement Fund, this last one being specially mentioned at page 17 of the arbitration pamphlet.\n\"6. As regards the last item we claim that it having been specially demanded before the arbitrators and they having thought proper not to grant it, it must be considered as having been legally refused.\"\n\"7. In your letter dated Toronto, 24th September, 1873, and addressed to the Hon. Mr. Ouimet, then Prime Minister of the Province of Quebec, you stated:\n'I have already intimated that we are prepared to recognize the interests of Quebec in the Common School Fund and in the school lands yet undisposed of, and I may now add that we are ready to purchase this interest at a fair price as part of a final settlement of all questions between the provinces.\"\n\"8. Your declaration made in the name of your Government was contained in a letter in which you claimed that the award was just, legal and equitable, and to render it complete you were ready to settle the Common School Fund; all the other difficulties between the two provinces were to be regarded as settled.\" \"Under all these circumstances we don't think we would be justified to consent to re-open any question outside of that Common School Fund, because,\n\"1, It would put in danger the interests of the province on matters that we considered settled; and\n\"2. It would give our opponents the chance of making a very strong argument against us.\"\n\"You close your letter of the 30th November last by the words, 'and I fear that the result must be that the whole subject of a settlement between us will have to stand over for further friendly negotiations. In that case Sir William Ritchie and Judge Senkler should be notified, as they will be making or perhaps may have made arrangements upon the assumption of the arbitration proceeding about the middle of next month.'\n\"I quite agree with you on these remarks, but I would be sorry indeed if your Government refused the arbitration on the first three questions mentioned on our draft of Order in Council; of course if you come to that decision we cannot help it and must submit to such refusal.\"\n\"In conclusion allow me to draw your attention to the very important fact that your Government has in its possession moneys that should have been placed long ago into the hands of the Federal Government for the common use of both provinces according to the award of 1870, and that you will see the injustice to continue this state of things, only because the Province of Quebec is not ready to re-open questions considered by its Government as having been settled by the award of 1870.\"\nNow, there is a very clear and plain statement of his attitude. Sir Oliver Mowat wanted to bring forward two subjects, the Upper Canada Building Fund and the Crown Lands Improvement Fund. He says of both of them, he considers them practically settled, either by inaction, or otherwise, by the award of 1870. He says \"we do not agree with the justice of the award of 1870, but it has settled everything, and we are forced to abide by it, and there is an end of it. We deal with these questions which grow out of that award, and which it is necessary to determine in order that that award may be implemented, and that is all with which we will deal, we re-open nothing further.\"\nIs it conceived as possible under these conditions, without any proposition or suggestion, that matters which were settled by the award in favour of Ontario should be opened by the Province of Quebec, that a document capable of another interpretation is to be interpreted as practically opening those questions and abandoning the position of the award?\nThen on 15th December, 1888, Mr. Mowat replying to Mr. Mercier savs:\n\"I observe that your objection is that submitting to arbitration the questions relating to this fund would be a re-opening of the questions already decided by the award, but this is not so. We do not propose to re-open any question that the award has decided, or that the arbitrators or courts may hold that the award has decided. Our proposition is to ascertain what the award gives. The award did not settle or state the amount of this fund or other funds awarded to the one province or the other. Section 5 of the award names the funds which are to go to this province and declares that the moneys thereby payable, including the several investments in respect of the same due on them, are to be the property of Ontario.\"\nThat is our proposition as to the terms of the award, because they are consequential.\nThen he proceeds to argue that the award did not settle the $101,000, and he proceeds to argue about the investment fund and to try to get Mr. Mercier to agree notwithstanding the joint definition of objects, that these things should become the subject of a reference. He says:\nIn the same way the award alloted to Ontario the Upper Canada Improvement Fund, whatever that should consist of. The award mentions no amount. Ontario claims that the $101,000 arising from Crown lands was and is a part of the fund as much as was the $124,000 on school lands, and was intended to be given and is given by the award to Ontario. We do not propose to open up the award or claim anything not provided by the award. We only suggest, as a difference of opinion between Quebec and Ontario exists as to the effect and interpretation of the award on certain points, that a friendly arbitration should take place as to what is the true interpretation of it.\"\n\"Then in regard to the unsold school lands and the amounts still uncollected in respect of school lands, the matter seems to my colleagues and myself a proper subject for negotiation rather than for arbitration, though if the arbitration were to settle all matters, this might be included.\"\nThen by a letter from Ross to Shehyn, January, 11th, 1889, Ontario Sess. Papers, 1889, No. 46, page 26, the Dominion is asked to transfer the sum of $925,625.63, the total collections to 31st December, 1888, to the said Common School Fund.\nThen Mr. Ross deals with Mr. Shehyn's applications for a remittance on the account of interest and he points out that Ontario has always considered that great injustice was done by the award in giving Quebec any claim on this amount, every acre of which was in Ontario. Ontario has good grounds for contending that interest should not run against the province until after the confirmation of the award by the Privy Council (26th March, 1878). Quebec disputed the award and carried an appeal to the Privy Council and until the final judgment of that tribunal was given Ontario had no authority to pay the collections into the Dominion or any authority to recognise Quebec as having any interest at all in this fund.\nThen by Order-in-Council of January, 15th, 1889, the Dominion Government is asked by Ontario to carry out the transfer of $925,625.63 to the credit of the Common School Fund.\nThe next letter is that of 24th January, 1889, from Mr. Shehyn to the Treasurer of Ontario expressing satisfaction with said transfer \"as Quebec will now receive its share of the interest on these collections every six months.\"\nIn the letter to which this is a reply the Treasurer of Ontario had stated that the award was unjust to Ontario in that it had given the entire land to the two provinces. And, Mr. Shehyn proceeds to answer that observation.\n\"The injustice that was done by the award in this matter was done to Quebec by giving to Ontario a certain portion of the proceeds of these lands in excess of the amount which by statute belonged to the Common School Fund for Ontario, under the plea that it belonged to the Upper Canada Improvement Fund. It would be useless however, for me to enter into this question in the present letter.\"\nSo that he repels the charge of injustice to Ontario by alleging injustice done and accomplished in Quebec. Land was given, or proceeds of land, which ought not to have been given.\nAnd then comes the letter, upon which my learned friend so strongly relied, of Mr. Shehyn and which requires a little analysis, because it is perfectly plain that the situation was consistent throughout. That is the letter of the 4th July, 1889, to Mr. Courtney, Deputy Minister of Finance.\nThe letter of Mr. Courtney was one in which he submitted to the Government of Quebec for their consideration, a case which had been proposed to be submitted to this court at the instance of the Government of Ontario by the Dominion Government, and that case had reference to the $101,000 of the Land Improvement Fund. I have the case before me which Mr. Shehyn was answering, the suggestion being made that Quebec should assent to the submission of the case.\nOf course it is important in reading a man's letter to know what he was writing about, what is the application made to which he was responding. My only purpose in referring to this case is to show your Lordships, it being a case submitted or proposed to be submitted at the instance of the Province of Ontario, that it had regard to that which the Province of Ontario had this long time been trying to get decided the question of the $101,000. It proceeds to state the facts, and it states that it \"was represented by the Province of Ontario before the arbitrators, that in dealing with the Common School Fund, and determining how it should be disposed of to comply with the Consolidated Statutes of Canada ch. 26, before any division of it could be made between Ontario and Quebec under section 5 of that Act, the proportion of it derived from sales between the 14th of June, 1853, and the 7th of March, 1861, and appropriated by the Act of 1853 to the Improvement Fund, should be added to such fund and so applied.\"\n\"The arbitrators acceded to this claim and directed (section 7 of the award) that from the Common School Fund as held on the 30th of June, 1867, by the Dominion of Canada, amounting to $1,733,224.47, the sum of $124,685.18 should be and the same was thereby taken and deducted and placed to the credit of the Upper Canada Improvement Fund, the said sum of $124,685.18 being one-fourth part of the moneys received by the late Province of Canada between the 6th of March, 1861, and the 1st July, 1867, on account of Common School Lands sold between the 14th of June, 1853, and the 6th of March, 1861.\"\n\"It is contended by the Province of Ontario on behalf of the municipalities that the principle adopted by the arbitrators must be applied to the proceeds of similar sales of Crown Lands, and the province, for the benefit of the municipalities concerned, claims the aggregate sum of $101,771.68 as the one-fifth of the proceeds of the same sales of Crown Lands, which had been withheld by the late Province of Canada in the same manner as they had withheld the proceeds of the school lands.\"\n\"They claim, therefore, that the Upper Canada Improvement Fund on the 30th of June, 1867, was composed of these two sums, $124,685.18 and $101,771.68, the proceeds of Common School and Crown lands respectively, and that this latter sum should be declared to have always been part of the fund, and should be credited to Ontario by the Dominion Government, with interest from the 1st of July, 1867, for distribution among the said municipalities according to their respective rights and interests therein; and that the total amount of principal and interest aforesaid should be added to the debt of the late Province of Canada; that the accounts between Canada and Ontario and between Ontario and Quebec under the B. N. A. Act are not settled and have remained open, and that this claim is one of the unsettled cases, and has been, with other questions, one of negotiation ever since Confederation.\" \"Ontario and Quebec being conjointly liable to the Dominion for the amount by which the debt of the late Province of Canada exceeds the sum fixed, and there being an excess over this sum, the effect of allowing this claim will be to increase pro tanto that excess, and thus to add to the liability of the Province of Quebec to the Dominion.\"\n\"That province objects to the allowance claimed and insists that the said claim was submitted to the arbitration, and has been, and must be deemed to have been, disposed of and concluded by the award.\"\n\"The question for the opinion of the court is whether such claim should be allowed by the Dominion or not.\"\n\"In addition to the documents in the case mentioned, there is also submitted an Appendix of Statutes and papers bearing upon the question.\"\nNow, I have shown what that case was, that the Province of Ontario having tried in every way to obtain some solution of the question of the $101,000, at last, at the instance of the ministers who were present, adopted this view, they appealed to the Dominion Government to state a case and the Dominion Government very properly, having got the case and having verified as they thought its accuracy as a just statement of facts, with all the important documents, sent it down to Mr. Shehyn, and Mr. Shehyn answered, and that is the answer which my learned friend says shows that $124,000 was in dispute, and I say the subject as to which he was replying was the $101,000. What did he say?:\n\"I beg to say that in the statement of the debt of the late Province of Canada as agreed to and sanctioned by the Honourable the Privy Council in 1870, the Upper Canada Improvement Fund is stated at an amount of $5,119.08; that previous to the sanctioning of this statement by the Privy Council, Ontario claimed that the Improvement Fund should be increased by $226,456.86, which amount should be added to the debt of the late Province of Canada; that on the 22nd January, 1870, the Honourable J. G. Robertson, then Treasurer of the Province of Quebec, protested against this pretention of Ontario, saying that the introducing of such pretentions, not alluded to in the conference at Montreal, would involve the re-opening of the whole question as respects the surplus debt.\"\n\"The views of Mr. Robertson were evidently accepted as correct by the Privy Council, as the Improvement Fund remained in the statement confirmed by them at the sum of $5,119.08 as originally prepared by the auditor of the late Province of Canada.\"\n\"The arbitrators appointed by Ontario and the Dominion\u2014the arbitrator of the Province of Quebec having resigned\u2014awarded the Upper Canada Improvement Fund to the Province of Ontario and with reference to the disposition of it the Government of this province has nothing whatever to do.\"\nThat is to say, they have nothing to do with whether it goes to the municipalities, or what is to be done.\n\"If it is proposed in submitting this question to the Supreme Court of Canada to re-open the question raised by Ontario respecting this fund and disposed of by the then Privy Council of the Dominion, the Government of this province protests against the Government of the Dominion sanctioning the submission of such a case to any court.\"\n\"The claim of the municipalities for one-fourth of the amount of the sales of school land and one-fifth of the amount of sales of Crown Lands made between the 14th June, 1853 and the 6th March, 1861, was twice decided against by the Government of the late Province of Canada.\" Then a considerable amount of statement is made of events which had taken place before Confederation borrowed from the proceedings before the arbitrators. And, the conclusion is this:\u2014\n\"It should be borne in mind that the arbitrators had no power whatever to change in any way the statement of the debts and assets of the late Province of Canada as sanctioned by the honourable the Privy Council after the conference held on the subject between the Dominion and the two provinces.\"\nWhich they do not do, as your Lordships know, by their dealing with the Common School Fund; they merely altered the distribution; they did not increase the debt.\nMr. B\u00e9\u00efque \u2014Will you read the preceding paragraph?\nMr. Blake;\u2014Certainly:\n\"The arbitrators appointed by Ontario and the Dominion\u2014the arbitrators of the Province of Quebec having retired\u2014treated the Common School Fund as an asset that they had power to divide and apportion in such manner as seemed to them right. They transferred to the Province of Ontario as belonging to Upper Canada Improvement Fund the amount of the sales of the Common School Land made between the 14th June, 1853 and the 6th March, 1861, including $124,685.18 stated to have been received on account of these sales between the 6th March, 1861, and the 30th June, 1867. The Province of Quebec has already contended that the transfer of any portion of this asset to Ontario, excepting the amount to which Ontario was entitled in proportion to population, was unwarranted and unfair.\"\n\"It should be borne in mind that the arbitrators had no power whatever to change in any way the statement of the debts and assets of the late Province of\n[Page795]\nCanada as sanctioned by the Honourable the Privy Council after the conference held on the subject between the Dominion and the two provinces.\"\n\"Therefore in the award that they made while they unfairly, as Quebec contends, gave to Ontario a portion of the Common School Fund under the plea of transferring it to the Upper Canada Improvement Fund, they really had no power to increase the indebtedness of the late Province of Canada to the Upper Canada Improvement Fund, a fact which their silence on the subject of the claim of Ontario respecting the one-fifth of the Crown lands sold as above mentioned, shows that they themselves recognised.\"\n\"The Government of this province therefore declines to join in any way in the proposed litigation or to make any changes or suggestions respecting the proposed case which was submitted.\"\nSo that the interpretation of the letter upon which my learned friend mainly relies is against him when you read it, and when you look at it, it is confined to the $101,000.\nNow, the next thing that happened is a most important document as bearing upon the present contention of Quebec. It is an Order-in-Council of the Dominion:\n\"On a report dated 5th December, 1890, from the Minister of Finance stating that an interview held at Toronto on the 28th November, 1890, between the Minister of Justice and the Deputy Minister of Finance on behalf of the Dominion Government, Mr. Francois Langelier and the Assistant Treasurer of Quebec on behalf of the Government of Quebec, and the Attorney General of Ontario and other members of the Executive Council of that province on behalf of the Government of Ontario, among the matters discussed was the unsettled condition of the accounts of the old Province of Canada, and all present agreed to recommend to their respective Governments the following proposals:\u2014\n1. All questions relating or incident to the accounts between the Dominion and the two Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and to accounts between the two Provinces of Ontario and Quebec to be referred to a board of arbitrators consisting of three of the judges to be chosen as hereinafter mentioned.\n2. The accounts are understood to include the following particulars:\u2014\"\n\"(e) The arbitrators to apportion the amount which should go to each of the provinces in the event of the principal of the Common School Fund being paid over to the two provinces.\"\n\"(h) The outstanding question as to the Upper Canada Land Improvement Fund not to form part of the reference unless the Quebec Government hereafter assent to include the same.\"\nNow, is there any doubt what was meant by that? Nobody can contend that what was meant by that was not in express terms this question as to the $101,000. My learned friend, I do not think, will venture to contend it, or if he alleges it, he will be utterly unable with all his skill and ability, to give a single argument which will lead to any other conclusion; it is indisputable that the outstanding question there mentioned in the Order in Council and the subject of agreement was the $101,000 only.\nThen the Acts under which the settlement should take place are passed. Those settlements leave the particular subject to be disposed of by agreement between the Governments, and then we come down to the agreement of submission under which this arbitration is held, and now I associate that Order-in-Council of the 12th December with this particular agreement of submission by its own language. That first agreement of submission provides:\n\"Whereas certain questions have arisen in relation to the settlement of the accounts between the Government of the Dominion of Canada, the Government of the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, both jointly and severally, and also as between the two provinces. * * * * * *\n\"Now, therefore, it is agreed by and between the said several Governments, parties hereto, that the following questions, as mentioned in the Order of the Governor General in Council, of the 12th day of December, 1890, be and they are hereby referred to the said arbitrators for their determination and award, in accordance with the said statutes, namely:\"\nSo that the very submission which we now have adverts to and enables me to ask your Lordships to look at that Order in Council as throwing light upon this question, if it be a question of doubt, and then you find, 5:\n\"It is further agreed by and between the parties hereto that the questions respecting the Upper Canada Building Fund and the Upper Canada Improvement Fund are not at at present to form any part of this reference; but this agreement is subject to the reservation by Ontario of any of its rights to maintain and recover its claims, if any, in respect of the said funds, as it may be advised.\"\nNow, who can doubt that this statement, tedious though it has been, has at any rate this advantage, that it has as I have said, demonstrated what the meaning of that is. You have found by the former correspondence that there was one question about the Land Improvement Fund, namely, as to the Crown Lands, you have also found that there was a question which had dropped out of sight by the time the Order-in-Council of the 12th December, 1870, was passed, but which had been in dispute, which Mr. Mercier had refused to allow to be included, namely, the question of the Upper Canada Building Fund. Upon further consideration they looked and they say that that question which Mr. Mercier insisted should not be included had not been put in, and they put in that question too, and to allege that that means all questions respecting the Land Improvement Fund is absolutely refuted by this statement. Even if it was, I say there was no question as to the Common School Fund. I have demonstrated to your Lordships that from the period of the decision in 1870 the Province of Quebec never raised the question; that every word, every act, every proceeding, every claim that it took was otherwise.\nI have therefore shown to your Lordships clearly and plainly, that upon this record to which my learned friend himself appealed, the three papers from which he read, it is indisputable, that the question relating to the Improvement Fund and to the Building Fund means the question as to the $101,000 as to the Improvement Fund, and that question as to interest as to the Building Fund.\nI say the major order to this arbitration was to find out what the amount of the Common School fund was. I say my learned friend's construction of this submission is a construction which renders it impossible that they should do that thing. It is quite easy to take out the Improvement fund because it has nothing to do with the Common School fund I admit, my Lords, that it does not pass the wit of man to devise words which would have abstracted this question from the jurisdiction of the arbitrators, but it would be the wit of the most foolish man in the world which would have tried to devise such words, and unless the words were so plain and clear that they could not be got over, your Lordships would not give such a limited and impotent conclusion to this affair as would be by that.\nI say that there is a sense in which it is excluded from the consideration of this arbitration; it is excluded because it was not in dispute; because it was a settled thing; It is excluded because as I have demonstrated to your Lordships if the award is to be taken as valid, if this thing cannot be separated, if it was within the jurisdiction of the arbitrators, the Common School Fund did not at the time which this submission was made, consist of $l,733,000.00, it consisted of $1,500,000.00 odd, it was excluded therefore from consideration because there was no intention that these arbitrators should pass upon it at all; it is excluded because the common concurrent sense of both the powers which were parties to this action, ever since the action of the Privy Council, thought that it was a settled question.\nPractically the claim of Ontario if it be a good one is lost, and the power to assert that claim does not exist, although to-day for the purposes of this argument your Lordships are told that what the arbitrators should do, and what your Lordships are asked to do, is to declare that the Common School Fund is such and such an amount subject to any claim that Ontario may have, and thus to leave undeclared what the Common School Fund is. I conjecture and I ask your Lordships to conjecture, as soon as that standing ground is reached, why of course it would be said, well we must act upon the Common School Fund as a whole, and leave you to whistle for the $124,000 and your $224,000. That would be the next stage in this proceeding, a stage which I am sure would be unwelcomed by all who value the reputation of the country. Therefore, I hold that it is possible and certainly just, that which has been the common mind of both parties with reference to the $224,000, should be recognised, and that that which is true, namely, that the Common School Fund did consist on the 30th June, 1867, as conclusively settled by the award of the $1,500,000 should also be recognized, and that this thing which is done by these arbitrators, that that also should be recognised.\nI may be allowed to say that nine and twenty years ago I asserted this claim in the Provincial Legislature for these settlers, and that the report of the select committee on the Land Improvement Fund gives your Lordships what the merits are.\nIt was a claim then prosecuted, since maintained, always acted upon by the Province of Ontario, not as a claim for a fund which that province was entitled to devote for general purposes, it was a claim asserted on behalf of those who went into these waste places of the earth and dwelt, upon a stipulation announced to them by the Crown Lands agents from whom they bought the property, that one-fourth and one-fifth of their prices, according as they were Crown or school lands, should be devoted to the primeval interests of a new country, the making of roads and bridges and different local improvements of the country. They said to the Government, this was to be done through you the central authority, but we had our individual rights in it; we bought our land at ten shillings an acre upon the agreement that fifty cents of that should be devoted to the things which were necessary to our clearing land and making an existence. As one of the learned judges has said\u2014as the Chancellor has well said\u2014the Common School Fund had the advantage of it. These lands could not have been sold; this fund could not have been realised.\nThey had the benefit of it in the sales that were made, and we have not claimed that it was not competent without a breach of good faith, for the Government to change its policy, and with reference to new sales to say we will no longer make that allowance; something might be said in favour of that view, but it has never been said\u2014what has been claimed and what is claimed, is that in the highest view of equity, honour and good faith, in the discharge of what would be a fundamental moral duty between man and man, aye, a question or matter of contract between man and man, it was impossible by an arbitrary act of the executive to destroy the vested rights and interests of the settlers, to suggest another use for that portion of his purchase money than the making of these public improvements, in which he was interested, as had been contracted for by him at the time they were sold. That was the claim made on behalf of the settlers. That was the claim which the arbitrators of 1870 thought was a just and reasonable claim. That was a claim which they recognised and insisted on, and I have no doubt, that at this day, after thirty years, it is not a claim which this court will reject.\nB\u00e9\u00efque Q.C in reply:\nI must say that I have expressed my full views in opening the case on the position that I took, and the few words that I will address to your Lordships will be confined to calling attention to one or two references given by my learned friend.\nLet me say at once that with the last consideration, as an equitable consideration, we think this court has nothing to do. It may be a consideration which goes to this effect, that the Governor in Council of the Province of Canada should have created the Improvement Fund, or it may go to the effect that the Governor in Council should not have abolished it. It seems to me it is a matter altogether foreign to the present appeal, and I will not dwell any further upon it. My learned friend has referred to the accounts which he calls the accounts between the Dominion and the Province of Ontario. I say that these accounts, I have stated why, I have given the reference as my authority, were speculative accounts; they were prepared in a speculative way for a certain purpose, and with these accounts we have nothing to do.\nI have called your Lordships' attention to the fact that in the public accounts of the Dominion of 1892 the Common School Fund stands intact without any deduction of the $124,000.\nAnother reference to which my learned friend has called your attention is that letter of Mr. Shehyn. I need not read the letter. I submit, that Mr. Shehyn took the ground that it was unwarranted, and that it was unjustified, and that he had not to go any further; that he was unwilling to go with the reference any further than it had gone.\nI do not claim, and I have never pretended, that Ontario ever intended to submit to the present arbitrators, the question as to whether the award of 1870 was valid or not. That is not my contention. But I say that the position of the parties was settled or not by that first award. It does not appear that either party was demanding from the present arbitration a new judgment on that question. If the question has been settled, as is contended, I do not see what is the interest of Ontario in provoking a new judgment upon a question, if Ontario had already won the judgment.\nNow, the only point to which I should call your Lordships' attention is to the wording of the reservation.\nIt has not escaped your Lordships' attention in the draft of submission referred to as prepared by the Dominion Government, that the word is \"the question,\" and I admit there that the question in that submission had reference merely, as my learned friend has stated, to the Crown Lands, not to the Common School Lands; there the word was \"question,\" but here we have the \"questions,\" and we have in the reservation \"in respect of the said funds,\" therefore, in respect of both the Common School Fund and of the Crown Lands and of the School Lands.\nNow, I have rested my contention on the wording that the questions respecting this, in a general way, were not intended to be submitted; and I have rested it on the contention that it had been disputed before the Privy Council, and I have rested it on the contention that it has been disputed, and I still claim that there is enough to justify my pretention in the letter of Mr. Shehyn, and I have not heard a word in reply to that, on the interpretation of Ontario in their own factum and on the opinion of the learned Chancellor Boyd.\nOne further word, as far as the other branch of the case is concerned. We have admitted all along that the question of this Improvement Fund was limited to this, as to whether it could be dealt with independently, as a separate part of the award. And my contention has been, and I repeat it that the question should be approached merely in this light:\u2014Suppose that the arbitrators of 1870 had awarded that sum or had deducted from the Common School Fund, which was acknowledged to be the property of the two provinces, $124,000 for a corporation that had no existence whatever, what would have taken place as a result of any award of that kind? Would that sum have been lost? Would it not have been open to the two provinces to go back behind this award and say the corporation is extinct, there is nobody to claim the amount, and therefore it must fall back into the fund as forming part of the fund from which it was taken. We take no other position than that.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal is from certain parts of the award of the arbitrators appointed under statutes of the Dominion of Canada and of the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec (Canada 54 & 55 Vict., ch. 6; Ontario 54 & 55 Vict., ch. 2; Quebec 54 Vict., ch. 4), respecting the settlement by arbitration of accounts between the Dominion of Canada and the Provinces, and between the two provinces.\nThe agreement of submission of the 10th of April, 1893, under which the arbitrators proceeded, contained amongst others the following references and provisions adopted by Order in Council of the Dominion and the Provinces:\n(3) It is further agreed that the following matters shall be referred to the said arbitrators for their determination and award in accordance with the provisions of the said statutes, namely:\n(h) The ascertainment and determination of the principal of the Common School Fund, the rate of interest which would be allowed on such fund and the method of computing such interest.\n(i) In the ascertainment of the amount of the principal of the said Common School Fund, the arbitrators are to take into consideration not only the sum now held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada, but also the amount for which Ontario is liable and also the value of the school lands which have not yet been sold.\n(5) It is further agreed by and between the parties hereto that the questions respecting the Upper Canada Building Fund and the Upper Canada Improvement Fund are not at present to form any part of this reference; but this agreement is subject to the reservation by Ontario of any of its rights to maintain and recover its claims, if any, in respect of the said funds as it may be advised.\nIn exercise of the power to make a partial award conferred by the statutes under which the arbitration took place, the arbitrators on the 6th of February, 1896, awarded as follows respecting the subjects of reference before mentioned: (1) That the sum held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada on the tenth day of April, 1893, as part of the principal of the said Common School Fund, amounted to two million four hundred and fifty-seven thousand six hundred and eighty-eight dollars and sixty-two cents ($2,457,688.62), made up of the following sums, that is to say: First the sum of one million five hundred and twenty thousand nine hundred and fifty-nine dollars and twenty-nine cents ($1,520,959.29) that at the union of the provinces came into the hands of the Government of Canada, and upon which interest has from time to time in the accounts referred to us been credited to the said provinces: Secondly, the sum of nine hundred and twenty-five thousand six hundred and twenty-five dollars and sixty-three cents ($925,625.63). for which, in 1889, the Government of Ontario accounted to the Government of the Dominion; and thirdly, the sum of eleven thousand one hundred and three dollars and seventy cents ($11,103.70) for which the Government of Ontario accounted to the Government of the Dominion in the following year (1890).\nFrom this finding Sir Louis Napoleon Casault dissents, he being of opinion that the sum then held by the Dominion Government as part of the principal of the said Common School Fund was greater than has been stated by an amount of one hundred and twenty-four thousand six hundred and eighty-five dollars and eighteen cents ($124,685.18), which sum in the said accounts has been deducted from the said fund and credited to the Upper Canada Improvement Fund.\n2. That the Province of Ontario is not liable out of the proceeds arising from the sale of the Crown Lands of the Province, other than the million acres of Common School Lands set apart in aid of the Common Schools of the late Province of Canada, to contribute anything to the said Common School Fund.\nMr. Chancellor Boyd dissents from so much of this finding as may imply that Ontario is under any liability in respect to the Common School Fund or lands.\n3. That subject to certain deductions, the Province of Ontario is liable for the moneys received by the said province since the first day of July, 1867, or to be received from or on account of the Common School Lands set apart in aid of the Common Schools of the late Proeince of Canada. Mr. Chancellor Boyd dissents from this finding as to liability.\n4. That from the moneys received from the Province of Ontario since the first day of July, 1867, from or on account of the Common School Lands set apart in aid of the Common Schools of the late Province of Canada, the Province of Ontario is entitled to deduct and retain the following sums as provided by the award of the 3rd of September, 1870, that is to say:\nFirst. In respect of all such moneys, six per centum on the amount thereof for the sale and management of such lands.\nSecondly. In respect of moneys arising from the sales of such lands made between the fourteenth day of June, 1853, and the sixth day of March, 1861, twenty-five per centum of the balance remaining after the deduction of six per centum for the sale and management of such lands.\nChief Justice Sir Louis Napoleon Casault dissents from so much of this finding as relates to the deduction in the cases mentioned of the twenty-five per centum on such balance.\n5. That in respect of the matters mentioned in the four preceding paragraphs we the said arbitrators have proceeded upon our view of disputed questions of law.\nFrom these findings the provinces have both appealed. The Province of Ontario as follows:\nFirst. As to paragraph 2 of the said award which states \"That the Province of Ontario is not liable out of the proceeds arising from the sale of the Crown Lands of the province other than the million acres of Common School Lands set apart in aid of the Common Schools of the late Province of Canada to contribute anything to the said Common School Fund.\"\nOntario appeals against so much of the finding in the said paragraph 2 as implies that Ontario is under any liability in respect to the Common School Fund or lands.\nSecond. As to paragraph 3 of the said award, which states \"That subject to certain deductions the Province of Ontario is liable for the moneys received by the said province since the first day of July, 1867, or to be received from or or on account of the Common School Lands set apart in aid of the Common Schools of the late Province of Canada\"\nOntario appeals against the finding in the said paragraph 3 of liability of Ontario as thereby decided. And Ontario asks that the Supreme Court of Canada declare that Ontario is not liable in respect of the matters set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the said award, whereby Ontario is declared liable and that there is and has been no liability on the part of Ontario in respect of lands in. Ontario known as the Common School Lands, or in respect of moneys received or to be received by Ontario from or on account of Common School Lands.\nThe Province of Quebec limits its appeal as follows, namely:\nIn so far as such award permits or allows any deduction from the amount of the principal of said Common School Fund for the Upper Canada Land Improvement or Upper Canada Improvement Fund.\nAnd in this respect the Province of Quebec will contend that under the provisions of paragraph 1 of the award, the principal of the fund should be augmented by the sum of one hundred and twenty-four thousand six hundred and eighty-five dollars and eighteen cents ($124,685.18), and that under paragraph four of the said award, the amount of twenty-five per centum referred to in the paragraph mentioned secondly, should not be deducted.\nAnd the Province of Quebec will ask that the said award be varied accordingly, and amended so as to not permit of any deductions from the principal of the said Common School Fund for any sums for the said Upper Canada Land Improvement Fund, or Upper Canada Improvement Fund.\nEach of the learned arbitrators has appended to the award an opinion embodying the reasons for the conclusion arrived at by him. Chancellor Boyd and Chief Justice Casault have respectively set forth the arguments which they consider to establish the correctness of their dissenting findings, and Mr. Justice Burbidge whose opinion prevailed has stated the reasons for his non-concurrence in either of the dissenting conclusions.\nThe Province of Quebec moved to quash the appeal upon the ground that this court had no jurisdiction to entertain it, but we are all of opinion that this objection entirely fails and that the jurisdiction conferred by the statutes upon this court has been properly invoked as regards all that portion of the award tained in the four first paragraphs in which the arbitrators have declared that they proceeded upon their view of disputed questions of law.\nI now proceed to give as concisely as possible a history of the legislation of the former Province of Canada which is material to be considered.\nBy the statute of Canada, 12 Vict. ch. 200, it was enacted\nThat all moneys which shall arise from the sale of any of the public lands of the province shall be set apart for the purpose of creating capital which shall\" be sufficient to produce a clear sum of \u00a3100,000 per annum which said capital and the income to be derived therefrom shall form a public fund to be called \"The Common School Fund.\"\nBy the second section after making provision for the investment of the fund thus formed, it is declared that the\nSaid fund and the income there of shall be and remain a perpetual fund for the support of Common Schools and the establishment of Township and Parish Libraries.\nBy the third section it was enacted:\nThat the Commissioner of Crown Lauds under the direction of the Governor-in-Council, shall set apart and appropriate one million of acres of such public lands, in such part or parts of the province as he may deem expedient, and dispose thereof on such terms and conditions as may by the Governor-in-Council be approved, and the money arising from the sale thereof shall be invested and applied towards creating the said Common School Fund; Provided always that before any appropriation of the moneys arising from the sale of such lands shall be made, all charges thereon for the management or sale thereof, together with all Indian annuities charged upon and payable thereout, shall be first paid and satisfied.\nThe fourth and remaining clause of the Act is as follows:\nSo soon as a net annual income of fifty thousand pounds shall be realized from the said School Fund, the public grant of money paid out of the Provincial Revenue for Common Schools, shall forever cease to be made a charge on such revenue; Provided always, nevertheless, that in the meantime the interest arising from the said School Fund so to be created as aforesaid, shall be annually paid over to the Receiver General and applied towards the payment of the yearly grant of fifty thousand pounds now appropriated for the support of the Common Schools; Provided further, that after the said annual sum of fifty thousand pounds shall have been taken off the Consolidated Revenue, if the income arising from the said School Fund shall from any cause whatever fall short of the annual sum of fifty thousand pounds, then it shall and may be lawful for the Receiver General of the Province to pay out of the said Consolidated Revenue such sum or sums of money as may from time to time be required to make up such deficiency, the same to be repaid as soon as the said income of the said School Fund shall exceed the said sum of fifty thousand pounds.\nUnder this Act an order-in-council dated the 5th November, 1850, was passed whereby one million acres of the public lands were set apart and appropriated for the purposes of the Common School Fund. These lands were all situated in that part of the Province of Canada now forming the Province of Ontario.\nThis Act was subsequently, upon the revision of the statute law of the Province of Canada in 1859, embodied in the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, chapter 26.\nAnother Statutory Fund which is of great importance in the consideration of this appeal is the Upper Canada Improvement Fund.\nThis Fund was created for the purpose of opening roads and making other improvements required to render the lands set apart to form the School Fund which were situated in a large tract of wild and unreclaimed land known as the \"Huron Tract,\" available for settlement or to meet the necessary requirements of the original settlers.\nIt was created by the fourteenth section of the Statute of Canada, 16 Vict. ch. 159, which received the royal assent (for which it had been reserved by the Governor) and became law on the 14th June, 1853. The fourteenth section is in these terms: It shall be lawful for the Governor-in-Council to reserve out of the proceeds of the School Lands in any county a sum not exceeding one fourth of such proceeds as a fund for public improvements within the county, to be expended under the direction of the Governor-in-Council, and also to reserve out of the proceeds of unappropriated Crown Lands in any county a sum not exceeding one-fifth as a fund for public improvements within the county to be also expended under the direction of the Governor-in-Council. Provided always, that the particulars of all such sums, and the expenditure thereof shall be laid before Parliament within the first ten days of each session. Provided always, that not exceeding six per cent on the amount collected, including surveys, shall be charged for the sale and management of lands forming the Common School Fund, arising out of the one million acres of land set apart in the Huron Tract.\nIt is to be observed that this section authorized for the purpose of an Improvement Fund not only a reservation of one-fourth of the proceeds of the school lands, but also a reservation of one-fifth of the proceeds of the unappropriated Crown Lands not set apart for school purposes. With these Crown Lands and the reservation out of them we are not directly concerned in this appeal, but as will be seen hereafter the reservation of the one fifth of Crown Lands sales becomes incidentally of much importance.\nThe 14th section of the Act of 1853 is in its terms permissive, and in order to the constitution of the Lands Improvement Fund an order of the Governor-in-Council was requisite. Such an Order-in-Council was accordingly passed on the 7th December, 1855. It is to be remarked of this Order-in-Council that it is informally and loosely worded, but it has always been recognized as having created the Lands Improvement Fund. Further, it has been treated as having had a retroactive effect carrying back the right to deduct the one-fourth from the proceeds of School Lands to the date of the statute itself (14th of June, 1853.) These observations are made merely to shew that the peculiar form of the Order-in-Council has not escaped attention, for no point has been made of this either upon the argument of the appeal or before the arbitrators. It seems to have been conceded on all hands that the Lands Improvement Fund so far as it was made up of contributions from School Lands consisted of one-fourth of the moneys produced by the sales of those lands in the interval between the fourteenth of June, 1853, and the sixth of March, 1861, when by an Order-in-Council of the latter date (6th March, 1861), the Order-in-Council of the 7th December, 1855, was absolutely rescinded.\nTherefore, in 1867, when the confederation of the Provinces took place and the Province of Canada was divided into the two new Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, there existed two funds, the School Fund and the Upper Canada Improvement Fund.\nThese funds therefore were subject to be dealt with by the arbitrators whose appointment was provided for by section 142 of the British North America Act, for it cannot be and never has been pretended that the 113th section of that Act was exhaustive or that the assets enumerated in the fourth schedule to the Act included all the assets belonging to Ontario and Quebec conjointly, which these arbitrators were empowered to deal with; nor can it be pretended that these funds, the Common School Fund and the Lands Improvement Fund, were included under any of the heads of \"stocks, cash, bankers' balances and securities\" which the 107th section of the Act transferred to the Dominion. It need scarcely be said that the Provinces other than Ontario or Quebec were not entitled to share in these funds arising from lands in the former Province of Canada, and devoted, the one to Common Schools in that Province, and the other to local improvements designed to facilitate the sale and settlement of the million acres in Upper Canada set apart for Common School purposes.\nThe funds must therefore necessarily have been assets belonging to Ontario and Quebec jointly.\nThe arbitrators appointed under section 142 there fore treated these funds as such joint assets and dealt with them accordingly.\nAs regards the Upper Canada Improvement Fund, the award of this statutory tribunal constituted by the 142nd section which was made on the third September, 1870, adjudged (by the 5th section) as follows:\nThe following special or trust funds and the monies thereby payable including the several investments in respect of the same, or any of them, shall be and the same are hereby declared to be the property of and belonging to the Province of Ontario for the purposes for which they were established, viz.:\n(6) Upper Canada Improvement Fund:\nThen in the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th sections of the same award, both the Common School Fund and the Upper Canada Improvement Fund are further dealt with in these terms:\nVII. From the Common School Fund as held on the thirtieth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven, by the Dominion of Canada, amounting to one million seven hundred and thirty-three thousand two hundred and twenty-four dollars and forty-seven cents (of which fifty-eight thousand dollars is invested in the bonds or debentures, of the Quebec Turnpike Trust, the said sum of fifty-eight thousand dollars, being an asset mentioned in the fourth schedule to the British North America Act, 1867, as the Quebec Turnpike Trust) the sum of one hundred and twenty-four thousand six hundred and eighty-five dollars and eighteen cents shall be, and the same is hereby taken and deducted and placed to the credit of the Upper Canada Improvement Fund, the said sum of one hundred and twenty-four thousand six hundred and eighty-five dollars and eighteen cents being one-fourth part of moneys received by the late Province of Canada, between the sixth day of March, one thousand eight hundred and sixty one, and the first day of July, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven, on account of Common School Lands; sold between the fourteenth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-three, and the said sixth day of March, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one.\nVIII. That the residue of the said Common School Fund, with the investments belonging thereto, as aforesaid, shall continue to be held by the Dominion of Canada, and the income realized therefrom, from the thirtieth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven, and which shall hereafter be realized therefrom, shall be apportioned between and paid over to the respective Provinces of Ontario and Quebec as directed by the fifth section, chapter twenty-six of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, with regard to the sum of two hundred thousand dollars in the said section mentioned.\nIX. That the moneys received by the said Province of Ontario since the thirtieth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven, or which shall hereafter be received by the said province from, or on account of, the Common School Lands set apart in aid of the Common Schools of the late Province of Canada, shall be paid to the Dominion of Canada to be invested as provided by section three of said chapter twenty-six of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, and the income derived therefrom shall be divided, apportioned and paid between and to the said Provinces of Ontario and Quebec respectively as provided in the said fifth section, chapter twenty-six of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, with regard to the sum of two hundred thousand dollars in the said section mentioned.\nX. That the Province of Ontario shall be entitled to retain out of such moneys six per cent for the sale and management of the said lands, and that one-fourth of the proceeds of the said lands, sold between the fourteenth clay of June, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-three, and the said sixth day of March, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, received since the thirtieth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven, or which may hereafter be received after deducting the expenses of such management as aforesaid shall be taken and retained by the said Province of Ontario for the Upper Canada Improvement Fund.\nIt is to be borne in mind that the office of the present arbitrators under the agreement of reference of the 10th of April, 1803, already set forth, is limited to the ascertainment of the principal of the Common School Fund and the arbitrators are directed to take into consideration not only the sum held by the Dominion at the date of the present reference, but also the amount for which Ontario is liable and also the value of the unsold School Lands. And it was by the same agreement provided that:\nThe questions respecting the Upper Canada Building Fund and the Upper Canada Improvement Fund were not then to form any part of the reference, but that the agreement was subject to the reservation by Ontario of any of its rights to maintain and recover its claims, if any, in respect of the said funds as it might be advised.\nThen proceeding to take up the objections now made to the award under appeal in the order in which they are to be found on the face of the award in the dissents there recorded, we find first the objection of Chief Justice Casault that the deduction of $124,685.18 from the amount of the Common School Fund credited by the award of 1870 to the Upper Canada Improvement Fund was wrong. The grounds of this objection may be included under two heads. First, it is said that it is beyond the scope of the authority of the present arbitrators to deal with the Upper Canada Improvement Fund. Secondly, that it was ultra vires of the arbitrators of 1870 to allot the last mentioned fund to the Province of Ontario and to deduct its amount from the Common School Fund.\nNo doubt there is to be found in the agreement of reference an exclusion in terms of questions respecting the Upper Canada Improvement Fund. We find, however, as is well demonstrated in the opinion of Mr. Justice Burbidge, that effect could not be given to the express terms of the submission which impose upon the arbitrators the duty of determining and awarding upon\n(a) & (c) The accounts as rendered by the Dominion to the two provinces up to January, 1889,\nif this exclusion was to apply to the $124,685.18, inasmuch as this was one of the items in the accounts which had been rendered by the Dominion. Further, the arbitrators were expressly required not only to ascertain and determine the amount of the Common School Fund, but also the amount for which Ontario is liable. Then how could these requirements of the submission be complied with if the arbitrators were not to pass upon the right of Ontario to deduct one fourth of the moneys derived from School Lands sold between 14th June, 1853, and 6th March, 1861? It appears therefore that, according to the construction put upon the reservation in question by the learned Chief Justice, the agreement of submission would upon its face contain clauses which were repugnant to each other.\nMr. Justice Burbidge has, I think, found a solution of this difficulty which we may well adopt. That portion of the learned judge's opinion in which he sets forth the argument on this head appears to me to be unanswerable. I refer particularly to the full and clear explanation of it which he has given. It may, however, be summarized by saying that the terms of the submission may be reconciled by the explanation that there were two questions respecting the Upper Canada Improvement Fund\u2014one which had been passed upon by the arbitrators of 1870, as to the right of Ontario to that fund as it existed, and to make further deduction from the sale of School Lands to be carried to the credit of the Improvement Fund to the amount of the one-fourth of the collection from sales made in the interval between the 14th June, 1853, and the 6th March, 1861, the other as to the right of Ontario to have credited to the fund the one-fifth of sales, not of School Lands, but of ordinary Crown Lands sold subsequent to the Act of the 14th June, 1853, up to the date of the rescission of the Order-in-Council establishing the fund. The first question had been adjudicated upon by the arbitrators of 1870, the latter question was wholly untouched. Apart from this it is extremely improbable that the Province of Ontario ever could have intended to have abandoned any rights which had been assured to it by the award which for the present purpose I assume to have been intra vires, a conclusion which I shall presently attempt to demonstrate when I come to the second head of the Chief Justice's argument.\nFurther, there is nothing in the statutes under which the present arbitration has been had warranting the inference of an intention to derogate from the Imperial Act, even if parliament and the two Provincial Legislatures could do away with rights so assured, and there would clearly have been such a derogation if the arbitrators of 1870 were within their powers in awarding the Improvement Fund to Ontario, for in that case the right of Ontario to that fund is to be considered to be established just as it would have been if the 142nd section of the British North America Act instead of delegating the apportionment and adjustment to arbitrators had embodied in terms the same distribution of these funds as that which was made by the award of 1870.\nThe learned Chief Justice, however, goes furthe than this, for he insists that the award of 1870 was ultra vires of the arbitrators.\nThe arbitration, or (as it is called in the statute itself) the \"arbitrament\" of 1870 was a statutory proceeding not subject to the general rules of law applicable to private arbitrations. The persons to whom the authority to exercise the power conferred by section 142 was given were designated as arbitrators merely by way of convenience in expression. No such objection as that of want of finality could apply to their decision. When the award of 1870 was before the Judicial Committee in 1878, on a reference from the Crown upon an application made through the Secretary of State, the Lord Chancellor says:\nThese gentlemen were executing a parliamentary power. It is not as if it was a private arbitration under a private instrument. Either this was within their power or it was not. If it was not within their parliamentary power it goes for nothing. ****** There is a certain thing to be done under a certain Act of Parliament by particular individuals named. If they do anything more than they are authorized to do it cannot have any possible effect.\nThe learned Chief Justice founds his opinion, that the award of 1870 was ultra vires as regards the deduction of the Upper Canada Improvement Fund upon the ground that the arbitrators did not pursue their statutory authority which according to the 142nd section was to \"divide\" and \"adjust,\" when they directed the principal of the Common School Fund to be retained in the hands of the Dominion who were to pay over the income only to the provinces and that this not being authorized the direction that Ontario should be entitled to the Lands Improvement Fund was ultra vires. Now in the first place it is to be remarked that the arbitrators under the present reference have not to make any disposition of the Common School Fund or to inquire if any proper disposition of it has already been made. Their functions are limited to the ascertainment of its amount. I have already shewn that both the Common School Fund and the Improvement Fund were assets of the old Province of Canada when that province ceased to exist upon Confederation; that they were not conclusively disposed of by the Act itself; and that consequently their disposition fell within the 142nd section which provided a parliamentary mode of dealing with such assets. For the present purpose it would seem to be sufficient to say that even if there was no ultimate \"division and adjustment\" such as the statute requires, yet so far as the ascertainment of the amounts of the two funds went, and the allotment of the whole of the Improvement Fund in the only way in which it could reasonably be disposed of, namely, to Ontario, the arbitrators of 1870 were clearly within their powers. Such an ascertainment was a necessary preliminary to any \"division and adjustment\" under the statute. Therefore without going further it seems to me that the whole argument of ultra vires fails.\nI do however go further, for it appears to me impossible to hold that the disposition they made of the fund was not covered by the direction \"to divide and adjust.\"\nThere existed in 1870 difficulties in the way of an absolute division of the Common School Fund which made a division of the capital at that time almost impossible. The lands had not all been sold. The amount of the fund depended on future collections of the purchase money derived from sales already made within the dates before given of the statute and the Order-in-Council. The arbitrators or commissioners then did not see their way to dividing the capital, the amount of which, however, so far as it was then realized they ascertained and fixed, and they directed the fund to be vested in the Crown in the right of the Dominion in trust for the Provinces to which the interest was to be paid. I cannot agree that this was not within their powers. It was a division of the beneficial interest in the fund, and a fair adjustment of the rights of the Provinces in this fund which by the statute creating it was declared to be a perpetual fund the capital of which was to remain intact in perpetuity and the income of which alone was given to the Province of Canada. The arbitrators may therefore well have considered, as they appear to have done, that the asset they were dealing with which belonged to the Provinces jointly was only the income which they apportioned placing the capital itself in medio in the hands of the Dominion, which might perhaps, but did not, object to be burthened with its management. This mode of proceeding certainly seems to have been consistent with the terms of the Act 12 Vict. ch. 200. If this is so the argument of ultra vires entirely fails.\nThe learned Chancellor based his dissent from the award on a totally different ground. In his opinion the fund realized from the sale of these lands, and the monies to arise from sales theretofore made, but in respect of which the purchase monies had not been paid, as well as the unsold lands remaining at the date of Confederation, all reverted on that event happening to the Province of Ontario.\nThis view proceeds upon the theory that the original trust of the one million acres of part of the domain of the Province of Canada was one for Common Schools of Canada which ceased to exist at Confederation; and the trust failing the unsold lands reverted under section 109 of the British North America Act as public lands, not subject to any trust, to the new province within whose limits they were situated. Further, that the monies constituting the Common School Fund also so re-vested in the same province as having been derived from lands locally situated in that division of the old province.\nI am unable to agree in this conclusion. I do not think that the trust necessarily failed on division of the old province by the British North America Act. I see no reason why the Common School Fund and the unsold lands should not have continued to be impressed with a trust in favour of the Common Schools of the new Provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Had it been supposed that any difficulty could have arisen on this head no doubt some provision would have been made for the case. But even supposing that the original beneficiaries ceased to exist, the funds and lands were still assets belonging to Ontario and Quebec. The lands were impressed with a trust in the loose general sense in which that word is used in section 109, and the money of which the fund consisted also was bound by a trust which prevented it from vesting in the Dominion as \"stock, cash, bankers' balances or securities for money\" under section 107. The word \"trust\" as used in section 109 is not to be interpreted literally and technically. This is apparent from the consideration that it relates to lands which were as regards the legal estate vested in the Crown which cannot strictly speaking be bound by a trust. It must therefore receive a secondary and more general interpretation which authorizes us in applying it to lands held and set apart for some special purpose. If this is so then both lands and funds were assets to be dealt with by the arbitrators under section 142. I have already given the reasons for the conclusion that the arbitrators of 1870 were not without jurisdiction in making the disposition of both the funds here in question\u2014the Common School Fund and the Upper Canada Improvement Fund\u2014as well as of the lands. I need not therefore repeat them. The arbitrators were sovereign judges of all questions of law and fact in all matters within the scope of the authority given them by the statute, and I think they have well exercised their powers in dividing the income as they have done. In other words it appears to me that their award was final. If they were within their powers the mode in which they have exercised them cannot now be questioned. No right of appeal from them is conferred on any court of judicature. The proceeding in the Privy Council of 1878 was not an appeal but a reference by the Crown sought by the Provinces and the Dominion principally to ascertain if the award had been properly executed by two out of the three arbitrators, and if one of the arbitrators was properly qualified to act.\nIt has remained unimpeached as regards the question now raised for nearly twenty-eight years, and during that time has been acted upon, and it could not now be set aside without deranging the whole scheme upon which it proceeded and thereby doing great injustice to one or other of the Provinces.\nThe arbitrators finding these assets which they had to deal with to be the joint property of the two new Provinces treated them impliedly as impressed with a trust which as the final judges of both law and fact it was within their power to do, and they executed this trust by directing the division of the income between the beneficiaries in accordance with the intention indicated in the Act of the Legislature which originated the fund. But even if they did not go so far as they might and ought to have done by dividing the capital itself, and apportioning the unsold lands, I am unable to see that their proceedings were wholly void or that their award can be impeached like a private award for want of finality.\nBut so far as the present reference is concerned all we are concerned with is the ascertainment of the amount of the fund and as regards this purpose it is immaterial whether the arbitrators properly executed their power to divide and adjust or not. The very object of this reference may be to establish a basis for further legislation, and I do not think that any object of this kind should be frustrated by holding that although there is in fact a Common School Fund the amount of which it is desirable to ascertain, yet as such a fund does not exist de jure, the arbitrators should decline to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon them.\nThe learned Chancellor, if there is such an existing fund as a Common School Fund, does not object in that case, in which the majority is against him, to the deduction from it of the amount of the Improvement Fund as it has been found in the award of 1870 and in the accounts rendered by the Dominion, but in this view of the case he agrees with Mr. Justice Burbidge.\nThe \"new aspect\" as it was termed before the arbitrators by which Quebec sought to have the fund augmented beyond the one million acres to an amount sufficient to produce an income of \u00a36100,000 per annum, is conclusively shown to be an erroneous view in the opinion of Chief Justice Casault, and it has not been raised in this appeal and is not before us. A question relating to an investment in some Quebec Turnpike Trust Debentures is also not before us, inasmuch as the arbitrators do not state that their finding in that respect proceeded on a disputed question of law.\nOn the whole we are all of opinion that the award so far as it is controverted by these appeals is correct and ought to be confirmed. The appeals of both the Provinces are therefore dismissed.\n[1] Lindsay Petroleum Co. v. Pardee, 22 Gr. 18; Cunnach v. Edwards [1895], 1 Ch. 489.\n[2] [1895] 1. Ch. 19.\n[3] Ir.

C.\nPersons dealing with dangerous material are obliged to take the utmost care to prevent injuries being caused through their use by adopting all known devices to that end and where there is evidence that there was a precaution which might have been taken by a company making use of electrical currents to prevent live wires causing accidents, and that this precaution was not adopted the company must be held responsible for damages.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which maintained the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe plaintiffs brought the action for damages for the death of their minor son alleged to have been caused through the negligence of the defendant.\nThe deceased was employed as a lineman by the company and at the time of the accident was at his work passing a dead wire along the ceiling of the cellar of the power house, in close proximity with a large number of wires which were charged with a strong electric current. There was some evidence to shew a possibility of imperfect insulation of these live wires, as the ends of the tie-wires, by which they were attached to porcelain insulating knobs, were left bare instead of being covered, as they might have been, with insulating tapes. Expert witnesses declared that it was not usual to cover the ends of tie-wires in this manner, but that if such precautions had been taken the possibility of accidents occurring through contact with live wires would have been decreased. The deceased was not seen to come in contact with the live wires, but was found dead on the floor where he had been working, with a wound upon his arm as from a burn and one of his shoes burnt and broken in the sole. The trial judge found that the injury might reason ably be attributed to an electric shock caused by imperfect insulation of the tie-wires and gave a verdict for the plaintiffs on the ground that there was a presumption of fault against the company which had not been rebutted by evidence and it had not been shewn that the accident was due to any imprudence or fault on the part of the deceased.\nThe company now appeals from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, on appeal, affirming the judgment in the trial court. J. B. Allan for the appellant. The application of art 1054 C. C. made in this case at the trial is not correct. It is not shewn affirmatively that deceased came to his death through any definite cause imputable to the want of skill, care or precaution of the company or of those for whom they are responsible. Art. 1054 C. C. is not intended to extend the theory of damages in case of negligence but only to restrict it.\nThis case is subject to the application of the principles laid down by The Montreal Rolling Mills Co. v. Corcoran ([1]); The Canada Paint Co. v. Trainor ([2]); The Dominion Cartridge Co. v. Cairns ([3])\nThe mere presumption that deceased died by an electric shock occasioned in a mysterious manner whilst in the company's employment, is not sufficient to condemn them without positive evidence of fault on their part. The circumstances here are just as consistent with negligence on the part of the deceased as on the part of the company. There is evidence to shew deceased had been warned as to possible danger and had considerable experience and knew what precautions to take while working in proximity to live wires. There is no proof that any tie-wires had cut through the insulation and become charged, nor that the deceased came in contact with their bare ends. On the contrary it is shewn that if he had retained his proper position at his work deceased should not have been at any time touching the tie-wires.\nBelcourt (Desmarais with him), for the respondents. There were evidently at least four acts of omission proved against the company, any of which would involve responsibility for negligence ;\u2014 1st. It was imprudent to allow electric currents to pass through the wires in close proximity to where deceased was obliged to work and especially when the work could have been done at another time when the currents were off;\n2ndly. The cellar floor was of earth which had been allowed to become saturated with water and dangerous when electric dynamos and currents were in close proximity;\n3rdly. Metal pipes were allowed to remain uncovered and scattered about the cellar floor; and\n4thly. The tie-wires while covered with insulation were left bare at the ends although it was possible to have covered these ends with insulating tapes and thus prevented the possibility of accidents through contact with them.\nIf not a case of res ipsa loquitur, this is at least an instance where there has been neglect to take obvious precautions to insure the safety of persons employed by the company to work among their dangerous cur rents and materials. The cases cited by the appellant are easily distinguishable from the present which involves more the principles laid down in The George Matthews Co. v. Bouchard ([4]) in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Girouard at page 589. There is also in this case the inevitable conclusion that the deceased suffered death on account of the negligent omission of the company to take reasonable and obvions precautions for insuring the safety of their servants while engaged in a dangerous employment.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (Oral).\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. There was evidence before the trial judge which he was called upon to appreciate and on which he appears to have based his findings. It would be contrary to principle and authority to interfere in such a case.\nIt has been shewn by the evidence of the company's superintendent that there was a precaution which might have been taken by the company to prevent live wires causing accidents but that this precaution was not adopted. This is therefore a case for the application of the principle now well established that persons dealing with dangerous things should be obliged to take the utmost care to prevent injuries being caused through their use by adopting all known devices to that end. This the appellant has omitted to do.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed as the findings in the trial court were supported by evidence and should not be disturbed.\nSedgewick and King JJ concurred.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I follow the decision in the case of The George Matthews Co. v. Bouchard ([5]), and there was some evidence that the tie-wires might have been protected upon which the trial court judge based his verdict. I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant; Campbell, Meredith, Allan & Hague.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Desmarais & Cordeau.\n[1] 26 Can.

The plaintiff sued on a policy of insurance against accidents in favour of her deceased husband Byron G. Taylor. One of the conditions in the insurance policy provided that:\n\"In the event of any accident within the meaning of this policy happening to the insured, written notice, containing full name and address of the insured, with full particulars of the accident, shall be given within thirty days of its occurrence to the manager for the United States, at Boston, Mass., or the agent of the corporation whose name is indorsed hereon.\"\nThe defendant pleaded, among other defences, that no notice was given as required by this condition. To this plea the plaintiff demurred, and her demurrer was sustained by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick which held that the giving of the notice was not a condition precedent to a right of action on the policy. From that judgment the appeal to this court was taken.\nOwen Ritchie for the appellant. The effect of the judgment of the court below is to expunge the clause which was made part of the contract by the policy, requiring notice as a condition precedent to any right of action. In fire policies made on \"terms and conditions \"providing for notice of loss, compliance with such terms are conditions precedent; Nixon v. The Queen Insurance Co.[1]; Bowes v. National Insurance Co.[2]; Gibson v. The North British and Mercantile Insurance Co.[3]; and the same principle applies to insurances against accidents; The Accident Insurance Co, of North America v. Young[4]; Cassel v. Lancashire and Yorkshire Accident Insurance Co.[5]; Patton v. Employers' Liability Assurance Corporation[6]. See also Porter on Insurance (2 ed.), p. 186; Trippe v. The Provident Fund Society[7]; Whyte v. The Western Assurance Co.[8]. The rule \"Verba chartarum fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem\" is a doubtful one and was held to be unreasonable by Jessel, M. R. in Taylor v. The Corporation of St. Helens[9].\nPugsley Q.C. and Blair for the respondent. This is a case falling within the application of the maxim \"Verba chartarum fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem\" and the principles decided in Stoneham v. The Ocean Ry. and Gen. Accident Insurance Co.[10]; see also Bowes v. The National Insurance Co.[11]. The company has failed to use language sufficiently express to make the giving of the notice a condition precedent and the policy must be construed most strongly against the party making it; Notman v. The Anchor Insurance Co.[12]; consequently reasonable notice, as actually given, was sufficient. We rely also upon the decisions in Anderson v. Fitzgerald[13]; Cassel v. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Accident Insurance Co.[14], and we refer to Bunyon on Life Assurance, p. 82. There is in this case a distinction to be drawn between \"conditions\" and \"collateral agreements.\"\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014By a policy for $5,000 on which the action was brought the defendants (now appellants) insured one Taylor, the respondent's husband, against bodily injuries \"subject and according to the agreements and conditions herein contained including those printed on the back of this policy.\" On the back of the policy, among the agreements and conditions under which this policy is issued and accepted,\" it is provided among other things that:\nIn the event of any accident within the meaning of this policy happening to the insured written notice containing full name and address of the insured, with full particulars of the accident, shall be given within thirty days of its occurrence to the manager for the United States at Boston, Mass., or the agent of the corporation whose name is indorsed hereon, and on demand such certificate by medical practitioners qualified by law, and other papers of proof of claim shall be furnished by the insured or his representatives, at his or their own cost, as this corporation may reasonably require.\nThe declaration sets out the policy including the indorsed conditions and avers generally the performance of conditions precedent. The plea demurred to traverses the performance of the above condition, and on the demurrer judgment was given for the plaintiff (the respondent.) The defendants now appeal from that judgment.\nThe point of law upon this appeal is therefore, whether the above provision is a condition precedent to any right of action upon this policy, or an independent and collateral covenant. I think that it is a condition precedent.\nThat provision cannot be read out of the contract. It forms part of it, and is a stipulation that must be given effect to. Now, to say that it is not a condition precedent is to leave it without any effect whatsoever. ! The intention of the parties, which is the guide in interpretation of contracts, must necessarily have been that this notice should be a condition precedent to any right of action upon the policy. Otherwise, the stipulation is vain, frivolous, means nothing. It was not necessary to say that it was to be a condition precedent It is so by its nature. It is not a condition at all if it is not a condition precedent. And we cannot so obliterate it from the contract. I would allow the appeal with costs. SEDGEWICK, KING and GIROUARD JJ. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014It is impossible, in my opinion, to read the policy of insurance against accidents in this case, as providing that unless written notice containing full name and address of the insured with full particulars of the accident shall be given within thirty days of the occurrence to the company's manager for the United States at Boston, or to the agent of the company whose name is indorsed on the policy, and unless such certificate by duly qualified medical practitioners as should be reasonably required by the company should be furnished on demand, and unless such other affirmative proof of the claim as the company should reasonably require should be furnished within thirteen months from the happening of the accident, no payment shall be made under the policy. Not being susceptible of such a construction the policy must be read as containing separate independent stipulations, one of which relates to furnishing notice of the accident within thirty days from its occurrence, compliance with which stipulation is not in express terms declared to constitute a condition precedent; and another having relation to the furnishing proof of claim, compliance with which is in express terms made a condition precedent. This stipulation is wholly independent of that as to notice of the occurrence of the accident, and is in these words:\nUnless affirmative proof of claim is furnished within thirteen months from the happening of the accident no payment shall be made hereunder.\nThat clause in express terms makes the furnishing proof of claim within the prescribed period a condition precedent. So compliance with the provision of the next clause is in like manner expressly made as condition precedent. It provides that;\u2014 No legal proceeding for recovery hereunder shall be brought within three months after receipt of proof at this office.\nSo that if proof should not be furnished until some time in the thirteenth month from the happening of the accident no action would lie until the expiration of the further period of three months. The case in short is undistinguishable from Stoneham v. Ocean Railway and General Accident Assurance Co.[15]; and the sole question is whether, although we are not bound in law by the decision in that case, it so recommends itself to our judgment that we ought to adopt it as a correct exposition of the law, or on the contrary that we must pronounce our judgment to be adverse to it and therefore must reject it as not being a correct exposition of the law upon the subject. If we are of opinion that it is a sound exposition of the law although not bound in law we are, in foro conscienti\u0153, bound to follow it. We must concur in the judgment wherein it says that the question whether compliance with the stipulation as to notice of the happening of the accident is a condition precedent is purely a question of construction, and that it is for the court to say looking at all the terms of the policy what the true meaning of the contract is\u2014or in other words what the true intention of the parties to the contract was to be gathered from the terms of the policy.\nNow in the clause of the policy as to giving notice of the occurrence of the accident there are no words used expressing the intention of the parties to be that compliance in this particular is a condition precedent to the right of the assured to recover anything under the policy, whereas in the clause relative to the furnishing proof of claim there are used words plainly expressing the intention of the parties to be that compliance with that clause is such a condition precedent. Now this difference in the mode of expression as to these two clauses reasonably points to a difference in intention as to their respective effect. But in addition to this it appears by clause E that the policy was intended to cover an accident occurring anywhere \"within the limits of the civilized world.\" In such a case it was very reasonable that thirteen months should be allowed for furnishing proof of claim., and it is reasonable to infer that this was the reason for allowing such a length of time, but the period limited for furnishing proof of claim applies equally to every case irrespective of all question as to the place where the accident occurred. No distinction is made in the policy in any manner affecting the time within which either notice of the occurrence of the accident, or proof of claim must be given having regard to the place where the accident should occur, namely whether in the remotest part of the civilized world or upon the very premises of the defendants. Now how can we with any reasonable regard to the intention of the parties to be gathered from the terms of the policy hold that if an accident should occur in some remote part of the civilized world notice of the occurrence of the accident must be given within thirty days of its occurrence, or in default, that all right of recovery is forfeited, while thirteen months are expressly given by the clause for furnishing proof of claim? This I confess appears to me to be so plainly inconsistent with a reasonable construction of the contract that for this reason coupled with those given in Stoneham v. Ocean Insurance Co.,[16] I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. It is said that the effect of this construction would be to eliminate the stipulation as to notice of the occurrence of the accident wholly from the contract, but this is by no means the case for if the company should sustain any damage by reason of a non-compliance with that stipulation they can recover compensation for such damage in an action instituted for the purpose. In the present action if in the courts of the Province of Ontario such compensation could be recovered upon a counter-claim, but if the defendants have received no damage by reason of such non-compliance it is not reasonable that they should recover anything, much less that the non-compliance should constitute a forfeiture of all claim under the contract when the defendants have not in express terms declared in the policy their intention to be that it should have such an effect; why should the defendants' vagueness in expressing their intention operate thus by implication and not by express terms as a forfeiture of the policy for their own benefit and to the prejudice of the assured.\nIn the present case it is quite possible that the notice may have been given on the 31st day from the occurrence of the accident, and that the defendants called for certain specific proof which was furnished by the plaintiff; the issues joined upon the pleas which the defendants pleaded but obtained leave to withdraw, may have shown this. We cannot tell, for the pleas withdrawn and the issues thereon are not before us, but however this may be I am of opinion that the parties have not by the terms of this policy plainly expressed their intention to be that non-compliance with the stipulation as to notice of the occurrence of the accident shall constitute a forfeiture of all right to recover anything under the policy, and that therefore the judgment of the court in New Brunswick upon the demurrer should be sustained and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H.

The contract was executed under the authority of 32 & 33 Vict. ch. 7, sec 6, and on November 25th, 1879, was assigned to W. who performed all the work sent to him up to December 5th, 1884, when, the term fixed by the contract having expired, he received a letter from the Queen's Printer as follows: \"I am directed by the Honourable the Secretary of State to inform you that, pending future arrangements, the binding work of the Government will be sent to you for execution under the same rates and conditions as under the contract which has just expired.\" W. performed the work for two years under authority of this letter and then brought an action for the profits he would have had on work given to other parties during the seven years.\nHeld, that the letter of the Queen's Printer did not constitute a contract binding on the Crown; that the statute authorising such contracts was not directory but limited the power of the Queen's Printer to make a contract except subject to its conditions; that the contractor was chargeable with notice of all statutory limitations upon the power of the Queen's Printer, and that he could not recover in respect of the work done after the original contract had expired.\nOn October 30th, 1886, an Order-in-Council was passed, which recited the execution and assignment of the original contract, the execution of the work by W. after it expired, and the recommendation of the Secretary of State that a formal contract should be entered into extending the original to December 1st, 1887, and then authorized the Secretary of State to enter into such formal contract with W. but subject to the condition that the Government should waive all claims for damages by reason of non-execution or imperfect execution of the work, and that W. should waive all claims to damages because of the execution of binding work by other parties up to the date of said execution. W. refused to accept the extension on such terms.\nHeld, that W. could not rely on the Order-in-Council as a ratification of the contract formed by the letter of the Queen's Printer; that the element of consensus enters as much into a ratification of a contract as into the contract itself; and that W. could not allege a ratification after expressly repudiating its terms and refusing to be bound by it.\nAfter an appeal from the final judgment of the Exchequer Court was lodged in the Supreme Court the Crown obtained leave to appeal from an order of reference to ascertain the amount of the suppliant's damages.\nHeld, that the Judge of the Exchequer Court had authority to allow the appeal and it was properly before the Supreme Court.\nAppeal from a decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] in favour of the suppliant.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the above head-note and in the judgment of the court.\nWhen the appeal was called for hearing a motion was made on behalf of the respondent to quash the appeal in so far as it related to the judgment of the Exchequer Court of 16th April, 1896, on the ground that it came too late and could not be entertained by the Supreme Court. It appeared that under a reference in that judgment the referee in his report found that respondent is entitled to be paid $38,829.03, being $23,553.58, damages for loss of profits between 1st December, 1879, and 1st December, 1884 (in respect to which finding no appeal was asserted by the Crown), and $15,275.45, damages for loss of profits between 1st December, 1884, and 9th November, 1886. The appellant and the respondent each appealed from the referee's report, and by a judgment of the Exchequer Court delivered on the 29th November, 1897, the report was confirmed and judgment entered in the respondent's favour for the total sum of $38,829.03 and costs.\nThe present appeal was instituted on the 22nd December, 1897, by the Crown, by notice filed pursuant to 50 & 51 Vict. ch. 16, sec. 53, and limited to that portion of the judgment of 29th November, 1897, as to damages between the 1st of December, 1884, and the 9th of November, 1886. On 10th of January, 1898, after this appeal had been inscribed for hearing the Attorney General for Canada applied to the Exchequer Court Judge to amend the judgment of 16th April, 1896, or to extend the time for appealing therefrom, and on 17th January, 1898, the Exchequer Court Judge made an order dismissing the application to amend, but extending, until the 1st February, 1898, the time for appealing from the judgment so far as it dealt with that part of the respondent's claim based upon breaches of contract between 1st December, 1884, and 9th November, 1886.\nHogg. Q.C. and Sinclair for the motion. This appeal ought to be governed by the decision in The Queen v. Clark[2], and the only question properly open is as to the accuracy of the referee's report respecting the amount of damages for the period between 1st December, 1884, and 9th November, 1886.\nAfter the appeal was in this court the Exchequer Court Judge was functus officio, and the order made by him on the 17th January, 1898, is null and should be disregarded. Lakin v. Nuttall[3]; Walmsley v. Griffiths[4]; Starrs v. Cosgrave Brewing and Malting Co.[5]; Mayhew v. Stone[6]; City of Toronto v. Toronto Street Railway Co.[7]; McGarvy v. Town of Strathroy[8]; Agricultural Insurance Co. v. Sargent[9]. The time for appealing cannot be extended under the provisions of the statute, 50 & 51 Vict. ch. 16, s. 51, unless the application for extension be made within thirty days from the date of judgment. Glengarry Election Case[10]; Re Oliver & Scott's Arbitration[11].\nHon. Charles Fitzpatrick Q.C. (Solicitor General of Canada), and Newcombe Q.C (Deputy of the Minister of Justice), contra.\nThe Court was of opinion that the order enlarging the time for appealing was within the competence of the Exchequer Court Judge and ordered the hearing to proceed upon the merits.\nNewcombe Q.C. for the appellant. The appeal is limited to that portion of the judgment which holds that the present respondent is entitled to recover damages for alleged breaches of a contract, which contract the respondent claims came into effect by reason of the Queen's Printer's letter of 5th December, 1884. No question arises as to payment for any work done. What he claims and has been adjudged entitled to, and what the Attorney General resists, is payment of the profit which the respondent would have earned had he been given work which, after the date of the Queen's Printer's letter, was given to others. The expired contract referred to in the letter was dated 22nd November, 1879, and covered a period of five years from 1st December of that year. It was made pursuant to 32 & 33 Vict. ch. 7, sec. 6.\nThe Queen's Printer's letter was not authorized by the Governor-in-Council, nor was any extension of the contract of 22nd November, 1879, or any further contract with the respondent. There was no public notice or advertisement for tenders for the purpose of the arrangement evidenced by the Queen's Printer's letter. The statutory requirements were not in any respect complied with. See Frend v. Dennett[12]; Young v. Mayor, etc., of Leamington, Spa.[13]; The Queen v. McLean[14] at pages 234-235. Yet the judgment gave $15,275.45 damages against the Crown for the period subsequent to 1st December, 1884, and must be wrong in so far as it finds the respondent entitled to these damages and that the portion of the claim relating to the period in question. Nothing was or is conceded as to the existence of any contract after 1st December, 1884. The Queen's Printer's letter merely expresses his intention as then existing. It does not bind the Government to anything. It was not intended either as a contract or the basis for a contract. It is uncertain and void as a contract. Beach on Contracts, sec. 80; Fell v. The Queen[15]. The future arrangements intended could not have been mutual arrangements, otherwise the contract could never be terminated except by agreement of both parties. The arrangements must, therefore, have been such as either party might make independently. It was open upon the terms of the letter for the Crown to arrange at any time that the respondent should not receive the whole or any part of the work, or for the respondent to arrange that he should not receive it. If that be the construction cadet qu\u0153stio, because the damages complained of are given in respect of work done otherwise than by the respondent under arrangements made by the Government after 5th December, 1884. See Henning v. The United States Insurance Co.[16]; The People v. Flagg[17] at page 591; Brady v. Mayor, etc., of New York[18] at page 316; Hague v. City of Philadelphia[19] at page 529; Henderson v. United States[20]. Persons who seek to obtain the obligation of the public must ascertain that the proposed act \"is within the scope of the authority which the law has conferred.\" Mechem's Public Offices and Officers, sec. 829. The Floyd Acceptances[21] at pages 679 and 680; Mayor, etc., of Baltimore v. Eschbach[22] at page 282. Contractors dealing with the Government are charged with notice of all \"statutory limitations placed upon the power of public officers especially where a statute expressly defines the powers.\" Thompson v. United States[23]. See also per Richards Q.J. in Wood v. The Queen[24] at pages 645 and 646.\nThere is no evidence of ratification or proof of any transaction on the part of the Government subsequent to the date of the Queen's Printer's letter which is preferable to the idea that the Government had entered into any engagement to send all the binding work to the respondent. The contract was void and incapable of ratification; Jacques Cartier Bank v. The Queen[25]; The Queen V. Waterous Engine Works Company[26]; The Queen v. Dunn[27]. See the observations of Lord Cairns in Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company v. Riche[28] at page 672, and per Parker C.J. in Despatch Line of Packets v. Bellamy Manufacturing Co.[29] at page 232; and also Beach on Contracts, sec. 1161.\nThe instrument was in the first place void and the Order-in-Council has none of the requisites of an estoppel. Everest & Strode on Estoppel, 4-10, 198, 200, 205, 219\/ There can be no estoppel in the face of an Act of Parliament. In re Stapleford Colliery Co., Barrows case[30], at page 441; Kerr v. Corporation of Preston[31], at page 468. The Crown is not bound by estoppel; per Holt C. J., at page 295 in Coke's case[32]; Chitty on Prerogatives p. 381; Humphrey v. The Queen[33]. The Governor-in-Council had no authority in October, 1886, at the date of the Order-in-Council to ratify any contract for Government binding, because the statute, 32 & 33 Vict. ch. 7, had then been repealed by the Act respecting the Department of Public Printing and Stationary, 49 Vict. ch 22, and the Government printing establishment instituted where all binding required for the service of the Government should be executed. See remarks of Field C. J. in McCracken v. City of San Francisco[34], at page 624; also Spence v. Wilmington Cotton Mills[35]; Eyre & Spottiswode v. The Queen[36]. We refer also to Churchward v. The Queen[37]; Aspdin v. Austin[38]; Dunn v. Sayles[39]; Great Northern Railway Co. v. Witham[40]: Burton v. Great Northern Railway Co.[41]; Thorne v. City of London,[42], and Bulmer v. The Queen[43].\nHogg Q.C. and Sinclair for the respondent. We contend that there was a contract between the Crown and the respondent between the 1st of December, 1884, and the 9th of November, 1886, under which he was entitled to do all the binding work of the Government, and in support of that view we rely on the reasons of the learned Exchequer Court Judge[44]. As to the Queen's Printer's Act, 32 & 33 Vict. ch. 7, secs. 7 & 8, the provisions there made are directory only with a view to secure system, uniformity and despatch in the conduct of public business. Rex v. Loxdale[45]; 23 Eng. & Am. Encl. 258; State of Wisconsin v. Lean[46]; Pearse v. Morrice[47]; Maxwell on Statutes, (3 ed.) pp. 528-529; Wilberforce, Statute Law, p. 207; Endlich on Statutes, p. 621, s. 437; Hardcastle on Statutes (2 ed.) pp. 261-2, 276; See also Caldow v. Pixell[48]; Liverpool Borough Bank v. Turner[49]; and Howard v. Bodington[50], at page 211.\nThis is one of those cases where the Crown is bound by the act of a subordinate officer in the discharge of his duty. The Queen v. St. John Water Commissioners[51].\nBut even assuming the provisions of the statute to be obligatory the obligation only extends to the passing of an Order-in-Council, and where a contract has been entered into but not prefaced by an Order-in-Council there is nothing in the statute to prevent such a contract being ratified and affirmed by an Order-in-Council passed subsequent to the date of the contract; particularly so is this the case when the Order-in-Council is passed ratifying the contract after the parties have acted under it for years, as in this case. Evans Prin. & Agent (2 ed.) p 87; The Queen v. Lavery[52]. Section 7 of the Act in question empowers the Governor-General-in-Council to authorize the making of contracts for printing and binding without compliance with the provisions of section 6 as to advertisement and tender. Moreover as the Queen's Printer's Act, 32 & 33 Vict. ch. 7, was repealed by 49 Vict. ch. 22, which came into force on the 2nd June, 1886, there was no statute in force on the 30th October, 1886, when the Order-in-Council was passed, which prevented the Governor General from ratifying and adopting the arrangement for the continuance of the contract then existing under the terms of the letter of 5th December, 1884, acted upon by the parties, and so ratified and adopted such contract conferred and imposed upon the respondent the same obligations and rights as he was subject and entitled to under the contract which had existed from the 1st December, 1879, to the 1st December, 1884, and which would entitle him to the damages found due him by the referee's report under the authority of the case of The Queen v. McLean[53]. The Order-in-Council was passed with a full knowledge of the facts, recognizing and adopting the extension, and stipulating for a waiver of claims which could only exist if the respondent was \"contractor,\" and the appellant is now precluded by it from asserting that there is no liability for breach of the contract between December 1st, 1884, and November 9th, 1886, under the letter of the 5th December, 1884, and as all parties so understood it. The condition of the parties and the surrounding circumstances must be considered. Baltimore and Ohio Rr. Co. v. Brydon[54]; Nash v. Towne[55]; Addison on Contracts (9 ed.) p. 44. The appellant, desiring to get the binding work done, took the initiative and so wrote the letter and led the respondent to believe that he would get all the work, and the words of the instrument must be construed most. strongly against the party using them. Ford v. Beech[56]; Garrison v. United. States[57]. The practical interpretation put upon the instrument by the parties is entitled to great if not controlling weight. Am. and Eng. Encly. p. 519.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014On the 22nd November, 1879, one Charles Henry Carriere entered into a contract with the Crown by which he undertook to execute all the binding of the Statutes of Canada, Imperial Statutes, Orders-in-Council, Treaties and other similar printed documents, and all the binding required to be done by the several Departments of the Government of Canada of all the several quantities of work and materials specified in the schedules annexed to the contract. The contract was made pursuant to 32 & 33 Vict. ch. 7, sec. 6, which is as follows:\nThe printing, binding and other like work to be done under the superintendence of the Queen's Printer shall, except as hereinafter mentioned, be done and furnished under contracts to be entered into under the authority of the Governor-in-Council, in such form and for such time as he shall appoint after such public notice or advertisement for tenders as he may deem advisable, and the lowest tenders received from parties of whose skill, resources and of the sufficiency of whose sureties for the due performance of the contract the Governor-in-Council shall be satisfied, shall be accepted.\nAll the conditions required by this enactment was duly complied with prior to the execution of the contract. On the 25th November, 1879, Mr. Carriere, with the assent of the Government, assigned his interest in the contract to the present suppliant, who thereupon proceeded to do the work and supply the materials referred to therein. On the 5th December, 1884, Mr, Brown Chamberlain, the Queen's Printer, wrote the suppliant as follows:\nI am directed by the Honourable the Secretary of State to inform you that pending future arrangements the binding work of the Government will be sent to you for execution under the same rates and conditions as under the contract which has just now expired. Subsequently to this letter the suppliant continued to perform the work for the Government upon request as he had previously done under the contract. For all of this work he has been paid; and the only claim now made is for profits which he would have earned had he been given work which after the date of the letter of the Queen's Printer was given to others. It is admitted by the suppliant that his claim rests solely upon the alleged contract contained in the letter of the Queen's Printer above set out. The first question to be considered is as to whether that letter admittedly acted upon for a time by the suppliant creates a contract binding upon the Crown.\nWe are all of opinion that the letter does not constitute such a contract. The letter was not authorized by the Governor-in-Council, nor did the Governor-in-Council authorize any extension of the contract on the 22nd November, 1879, nor any further contract with the suppliant. There was no public notice or advertisement for tenders for the work referred to in the letter of the Queen's Printer. In fact the statutory requirements were not in any respect complied with. In our view the statute is not directory, as contended by the suppliant, but limits the power of the Queen's Printer to make a contract except subject to its conditions. It is to be observed that the letter does not purport to be written on behalf of the Crown or of the Government; and in so far as the Queen's Printer purported to enter into a contract he not only exceeded his authority and violated, whether knowingly or not makes no difference, the provision of the enactment in question. But the suppliant must be held to have known that he so exceeded his authority, and to have proceeded with the work at his peril. We have not here to deal with an executed contract, with a claim for goods sold or for work done and materials supplied. in respect to which other principles may be applicable. It may possibly be that the Grown, like an individual, receiving the benefit of work or goods, may, notwithstanding the statute, be bound to recoup the person from whom the benefit has been received. So far as the present case is concerned the Crown has paid everything due for work done or materials furnished and the liability of the Crown for the profits claimed depends now solely upon the authority which the Queen's Printer had to bind the Crown in the manner claimed by the suppliant. It is perfectly clear that a contractor dealing with the Government is chargeable with notice of all statutory limitations placed upon the power of public officers. Where a statute expressly defines the power, it is notice to all the world. Nor had the Secretary of State, nor the Queen's Printer any statutory power to make the contract, and therefore any claim under it solely must necessarily fail. If, therefore, the suppliant can sustain his claim he must do so upon grounds other than those supplied by the letter of the Queen's Printer. He therefore has to contend that the contract was ratified and that ratification he claims was created by an Order-inCouncil of the 30th October, 1886. This Order-inCouncil is as follows:\nOn a report, dated 7th July, 1886, from the Secretary of State submitting that a contract was entered' into with Charles Henry Carriere, of the City of Ottawa, on the twenty-second day of November, 1879,. for the binding of the laws of Canada, and the binding required to be performed by the several Departments of the Government of Canada, for and during the term of five years reckoned and computed from the first day of December, 1879; that on the twenty-fifth day of November, 1879, the said contract was transferred by the said Charles Henry Carriere to Alexander S. Woodburn, and Her Majesty having: consented thereto, the said Alexander S. Woodburn, on the thirtieth day of September, 1880, and Francis Clemow, of the City of Ottawa, as his surety, covenanted with Her Majesty that the said Alexander S. Woodburn would perform, keep and abide by all and singular the covenants, agreements and conditions contained in the first above mentioned contract, in place and stead of the said Charles Henry Carriere.\nThat the said contract expired on the first day of December, 1884, but that since that time the work has been executed under an understanding between the Secretary of State and the said Alexander S. Woodburn that the said contract should be continued until other arrangements should be entered into by the Government for the execution of its printing and binding.\nThat it is urged by the said Alexander S. Woodburn, among other reasons for this extension, that in expectation of this extention he has at very considerable expense increased his plant and enlarged his business premises.\nThe minister further submits that it is expedient that the said understanding should be embodied in a formal contract, and that (pending arrangements to be made under the Act, chapter 22, of the last session of Parliament) the first above mentioned contract and the covenant by and with the said Alexander S. Woodburn should be extended until the first day of December, 1887, the day upon which the extended contract for printing will expire.\nThe minister therefore recommends that he be authorized to enter into an agreement with the said Alexander S. Woodburn for the continued execution of the said binding work up to and until the date last above mentioned, conditional that on the one hand the Government waive all claims to damages for non-execution or imperfect execution or delays in the execution of this contract by the said Alexander S. Woodburn during the continuance of the said contract and its extension to this date; and that the said Alexander S. Woodburn on his part waives and renounces all claim or pretended claim which he may have to damages because of the execution by others than himself under orders of the Departments of the Government of binding work coming within his contract up to and until the same date, and any claim he may have to the binding of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada now about to be printed, the binding of which should be given by tender.\nThe committee advise that the required authority be granted under the conditions above specified.\nOn being notified of this Order-in-Council the suppliant wrote to the Queen's Printer, on 16th November, 1886, a letter in which he said:\u2014\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing for my information a copy of an Order-in-Council passed on the 30th October 1886, stating the terms on which the Government would be willing to extend my contract for departmental binding until 1st December, 1887, I have now the honour to inform you that, having given the said Order-in-Council my most careful consideration, I am quite unable to accept an extension of the contract on the terms proposed. * * *\nThe suppliant now advances the proposition, and bases his right to recover upon the contention, that the Order-in-Council was a ratification of the original letter of the Queen's Printer and thereby validated his claim.\nWithout more than referring here to the point that the provisions respecting public advertisements were not complied with, we are clearly of opinion that there can be no ratification of a contract by one of the parties without the assent of the other party. The element of consensus enters as much into a ratification of a contract as into the contract itself; and it is out of the question for the suppliant to allege a ratification here when he expressly repudiated its terms and refused in any way to act upon or be bound by it. The Order-in-Council is nothing more than an unaccepted offer of settlement. It may doubtless be used by the suppliant as an admission of the facts therein stated as any other statement may be used as evidence, but these are the only benefits that the suppliant can claim from it. To say under the circumstance that it is a ratification of a letter which a Government officer had no authority to write, and was by statute in express terms forbidden to write except upon the compliance with precedent conditions, is opposed to fundamental and elementary principles of law.\nUpon the main question therefore the suppliant's case fails, and the appeal must be allowed.\nThe question was raised at the argument as to whether the case was properly before this court. We expressed the opinion at the argument and are all of opinion that the learned judge of the Exchequer Court had ample authority to make the order allowing the appeal to this court, and that the case was properly before us.\nThe appeal will be allowed with costs and the Crown will be entitled to all costs in the court below so far as this particular portion of the suppliant's claim is concerned.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.

He afterwards sold the equity of redemption to D. who covenanted to pay off the mortgage and indemnify C. against all costs and damages in connection therewith. This covenant of D. was assigned to the mortgagee. D. then sold the lands, subject to the mortgage, in three parcels, each of the purchasers assuming payment of his proportion of the mortgage debt, and he assigned the three respective covenants to the mortgagee who agreed not to make any claim for the said mortgage money against D. until he had exhausted his remedies against the said three purchasers and against the lands. The mortgagee having brought an action against C. on his covenant in the mortgage.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal (24 Ont. App. R. 492), that the mortgagee being the sole owner of the covenant of D. with the mortgagor assigned to him as collateral security, had so dealt with it as to divest himself of power to restore it to the mortgagor unimpaired, and the extent to which it was impaired could only be determined by exhaustion of the remedies provided for in the agreement between the mortgagee and D. The mortgagee, therefore, had no present right of action on the covenant in the mortgage. APPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Rose at the trial in favour of the defendant.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the above head-note and in the judgment of the court.\nAylesworth Q.C. for the appellant. The trial judge finds as a fact that when McCuaig assigned DuVernet\u2019s covenant to the plaintiff he was giving her a collateral security. If so she cannot enforce payment of the debt, unless prepared upon payment to restore the collateral security, and she has, by her subsequent agreement with DuVernet, put it out of her power to re\u2011convey this covenant unimpaired and in the same condition as when she acquired it, and defendant has thereby become absolutely discharged of all liability in respect of the original debt. Campbell v. Rothwell[2]; Allison v. McDonald[3]; Newton v. Chorlton,[4]; Mayhew v. Crickett[5]. The defendant contends that upon the conveyance of the mortgaged land to DuVernet \u201csubject to the mortgage,\u201d he became, as between himself and defendant, the principal debtor in respect of this mortgage debt, and defendant merely DuVernet\u2019s surety for payment of it. From the time notice of this change of relationship between the parties was acquired by the mortgagee she could no longer treat the original mortgagor as a principal debtor, but the obligation was imposed upon her to concede to him the right of a surety for DuVernet. Mathers v. Helliwell[6]; Blackley v. Kenney [No. 2][7]; Muttlebury v. Taylor[8]. After notice she was bound to do nothing to prejudice the interests of the surety. Rouse v. Bradford Banking Co.[9]; Oakeley v. Pasheller[10]; Overend, Gurney & Co. v. Oriental Financial Corporation[11]. We rely also upon Small v. Thompson[12] and Maloney v. Campbell[13].\nW.H. Irving for the respondent. The appellant continued liable upon his covenant as a full debtor and did not become a mere surety; even if he did become a surety, the dealings with DuVernet did not work his release. If the right transferred to respondent by the appellant became in her hands a security, it was a collateral security only. The original mortgaged estate in the hands of the respondent unimpaired was and remained always the mortgage security, and if that right constituted a security when placed in the respondent\u2019s hands, it was only to the extent to which the appellant shewed himself injured by the respondent\u2019s dealing with it that he would be entitled to relief. See Smith v. Pears[14] and cases there cited. Rouse v. Bradford Banking Co.[15] is distinguished from the present case on account of the higher class of obligation constituted by the appellant\u2019s covenant. The right against DuVernet was not, before its assignment to the respondent, the appellant\u2019s property in the full sense of the word; such a right has been held not to be the property of the mortgagor. Ball v. Tennant [16]. Even before the assignment any money payable by DuVernet under his obligation would have been payable to the respondent.\nIt is clear that the right assigned did not form part of the mortgaged estate, and for the reason given in Chambersburg Ins. Co. v. Smith[17] it would not seem to be a security at all. The fact that a creditor cannot return a collateral security to his debtor does not release the debtor, nor does it release a surety for that debtor. Colebrook, on Collateral Securities secs. 63, 87; Story, Equity Jurisprudence sec. 328; 1 Sutherland, Damages p. 382. The respondent can only be liable for actual loss and the onus is on the debtor to shew the extent of the injury. Wiltiams v. Price[18] at page 587, per Leach, V.C. Synod v. De Blacquiere[19]; Capel v. Butler[20]; Ex parte Mure[21]. There was no suretyship. Baynton v. Morgan[22]; Baylies, Sureties, p. 259; Trust and Loan Co. v. McKenzie[23] at page 170; Trusts Corporation of Ontario v. Hood[24] at pages 591-593. The alteration necessary to release a surety must be an alteration in the original contract. Wilson v. Land Security Co.[25] at page 157. We contend that DuVernet\u2019s obligation is only an obligation to indemnify McCuaig; Barham v. Earl of Thanet[26] at page 624; and that it is not a \u201ccovenant.\u201d See Credit Foncier Franco-Canadien v. Lawrie[27], and authorities there cited. Barber had implied authority to deal with the assigned right as fully as McCuaig himself could have done if he had retained it. Taylor v. Bank of New South Wales[28]; Carter v. White[29]; Polak v. Everett[30]. McCuaig having assigned away his right of indemnity cannot complain if time was given in respect of it by his assignee; DeColyar on Guarantees (3 ed.) pp. 423, 429, 430; and his right, if any is to prove and recover for any injury done him or loss suffered by him. O\u2019Gara v. Union Bank[31] and authorities there collected; Rainbow v. Juggins[32]. McCuaig must shew, in order to escape liability, that he is damnified to the extent of $4,400 by Barber\u2019s act, even after he has received back the assigned right in its present shape, and also the additional rights against DuVernet\u2019s purchasers procured by Barber; Brandt, Suretyship, (1 ed.) para. 373; Sutherland, Damages, (2 ed.) para. 229; Bradford v. Fox[33]; and Barber can not be responsible for more than the reinstating of the right against DuVernet, or the expense of doing this and any damage to McCuaig, consequent on his act; Strange v. Fooks[34]; Ryan v. McConnell[35]; Molsons Bank v. Heilig[36] and authorities there cited. These cases authorize reference as to damages, and if the provision in the judgment directing reference is not sufficient to fully protect McCuaig, the judgment of this court can direct any necessary variations under section sixty of \u201cThe Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\u201d\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGWYNNE J.\u2014By an indenture of mortgage bearing date the 18th day of March, 1889, the defendant mortgaged certain lands therein mentioned to the plaintiff in security for the payment to the plaintiff of the sum of three thousand two hundred and fifty-six dollars with interest thereon, and covenanted with the plaintiff to pay the said mortgage money thereby secured with interest in accordance with the proviso of said indenture of mortgage; afterwards the defendant sold the said lands and premises subject to the said indenture of mortgage and to the payment of the monies thereby secured to one DuVernet who thereby covenanted with the defendant his executors, administrators and assigns, that the said DuVernet would assume the said mortgage and pay the monies thereby secured and indemnify and save harmless the defendant from all loss, costs and damages in connection therewith. Afterwards the said defendant at the request of the plaintiff did by a deed under his hand and seal assign, transfer and set over to the plaintiff, her executors, administrators and assigns, the said covenant of the said DuVernet made to the defendant to pay off and satisfy the said indenture of mortgage and all the rights which the defendant had to compel the said DuVernet to pay off the said mortgage monies and interest, either under a sale or conveyance of the said lands or otherwise, and all benefit and advantages to be derived therefrom, together with full power and authority to enforce the said covenant or right against the said DuVernet. Afterwards the said DuVernet by deed of bargain and sale sold and transferred the same lands and premises subject to the said indenture of mortgage made by the defendant to the plaintiff in three several parcels as follows:\n1. One part to one Davidson subject to the payment by the said Davidson of the sum of $1,650.00 parcel of the principal sum of $3,256.00 secured by the said mortgage executed by the defendant to the plaintiff, which sum of $1,650.00 with interest thereon the said Davidson assumed and covenanted to pay with interest thereon.\n2. One other parcel to one Maddsford subject to the payment by the said Maddsford of the sum of $525, other parcel of the said principal sum of $3,256.00 secured by the defendant\u2019s mortgage to the plaintiff, which sum of $525 with the interest thereon the said Maddsford assumed and covenanted to pay with the interest thereon.\n3. Another parcel to one Bell subject to the payment by the said Bell of the sum of $1,081.00, other parcel of the said principal sum of $3,256.00 secured by the mortgage executed by the defendant to the plaintiff, which sum of $1,081, with the interest thereon the said Bell assumed and covenanted to pay. Afterwards the said DuVernet, at the request of the plaintiff, by an indenture duly made and executed by and between the said plaintiff and the said DuVernet, after reciting that it had been agreed between the said parties that the said DuVernet should assign to the plaintiff the said respective covenants made by the said Davidson, Maddsford and Bell respectively for payment of the said respective parcels of said mortgage money and interest, and that the plaintiff, her executors, administrators or assigns, should not nor should any of them make or cause to be made any claim for the said mortgage money or interest or any part thereof, or any claim relating thereto, against the said DuVernet, his heirs, executors or administrators or his or their real or personal property unless and until she should have exhausted her remedies against the persons aforesaid and against the said lands; and after reciting further that by assignment of even date the said DuVernet had assigned to the said plaintiff the said covenants of the said respective parties and all his the said DuVernet\u2019s rights thereunder it was witnessed that in consideration of the premises the said plaintiff did for herself, her heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, covenant and agree with the said DuVernet that she, the plaintiff, would not make or cause to be made any claim whatever upon the said mortgage or in relation thereto or against the said DuVernet, his heirs, executors or administrators or against his or their real or personal property unless and until she should have exhausted her remedies by all reasonable and proper proceedings against the said Davidson, Maddsford and Bell re- spectively their and each of their executors, administrators and assigns and against the said lands, and that she would make no claim against the said DuVernet for any costs of such proceedings.\nThe plaintiff has now sued the defendant upon the covenant in his mortgage and the defendant insists that the plaintiff by the above agreement with DuVernet, upon the faith of which she obtained from him an assignment of the covenants of Davidson and the others, has deprived herself of the right of asserting the present cause of action until she shall have exhausted all her remedies against the lands and under the covenants of Davidson and the other purchasers from DuVernet as provided in the agreement. Of this opinion was the learned trial judge, Mr. Justice Rose, who accordingly dismissed the action. This judgment, however, was reversed by the Court of Appeal which gave judgment for the plaintiff for the full amount of the money secured by defendant\u2019s mortgage and interest subject to a reference to the master as to what amount, if any, the defendant\u2019s remedy against DuVernet upon the latter\u2019s covenant with the plaintiff has been prejudiced by the agreement between the plaintiff and DuVernet, or rather it would seem by the plaintiff not pursuing her remedies under the provisions of that agreement.\nIt requires, I think, no reference to the master to see that as the plaintiff is assignee of DuVernet\u2019s covenant with the plaintiff she and the defendant are bound by that agreement which in effect provides that no remedy shall be sought under DuVernet\u2019s covenant with the plaintiff until all remedies against the lands themselves and under the covenants of the purchasers from DuVernet shall be exhausted. In effect, therefore, DuVernet\u2019s covenant to the defendant can be enforced solely for the recovery from DuVernet of so much as upon a sale of the lands themselves and the exhaust- ing of the remedies against the other covenantors with DuVernet, the amounts so realised shall be insufficient to pay the defendant\u2019s mortgage in full.\nThe plaintiff has therefore prejudiced the defendant\u2019s remedy against DuVernet to this extent that until the remedies pointed to in the deed between the plaintiff and DuVernet shall be exhausted it cannot be ascertained whether any amount, and if any, how much, can be recovered in an action upon DuVernet\u2019s covenant with the defendant whether such action be brought by the plaintiff as assignee of the defendant or by the defendant who never can bring such an action unless under an assignment from and as assignee of the plaintiff who is possessed of all interest in DuVernet\u2019s covenant with the defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s assigns are bound by her covenant with DuVernet not to make any claim against him on his covenant until all the remedies against the lands and against the covenantors with DuVernet are exhausted by due process of law, by which alone can be determined the amount, if any, to which DuVernet is liable under his covenant with the defendant of which the plaintiff is at present sole and absolute owner. The plaintiff has so dealt with the collateral security placed in her hands at her request by the defendant that she has by her agreement with DuVernet divested herself of all power to restore it to the defendant unimpaired, and the extent to which it has been impaired can only be determined by an exhaustion of the remedies as provided in the agreement between the plaintiff and DuVernet. We are of opinion therefore that the appeal must be allowed with costs and the judgment of Mr. Justice Rose restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Hubert H.

A poll was held the result being that 109 electors owning real estate of the aggregate values of $112,035 voted in favour of the by-law, while 62 qualified electors owning real estate valued at $75,120, voted against it and this total valuation against the by-law together with the total valuation of the lands of the electors who did not poll their votes amounted to $116920 and thus although a majority of the qualified electors approved the by-law yet they did not represent the majority in value of all the real estate shewn Upon the valuation roll of the municipality. In the Superior Court it was held by the learned trial judge that the by-law had not been approved as required by art. 4527 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec which provides that \"loans, whether by the issue of debentures or otherwise, are only made under a by-law of the council to that effect approved by a majority in number and in real value of the proprietors who are municipal electors,\" and the injunction was declared absolute with costs.\nThe present appeal was taken by the Corporation of the Town of Chicoutimi against the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench affirming the Superior Court judgment.\nGeoffrion Q.C. and Belleau Q.C. for the appellants. It is admitted that the majority in number and in value of the proprietors who voted, approved the by-law, but the contention is that the majority required is not of those who voted but of those who had the right to vote. We think that interpretation contrary to the usual meaning of the word \"majority\" as used in the statute and contrary to jurisprudence. See Am. & Eng. Encycl. (ed. 1888) vo. \"Elections,\" tit. xxiv, as to \"meaning of phrases;\" also Beach, Public Corporations, secs. 901 and 1055; Thompson on Corporations, (ed. 1895) sec. 725; Price v. La Ville de Chi-coutimi ([1]); arts. 4532 and 4536 R.S.Q.\nWhere the act depends upon the prior sanction of \"a majority of the qualified voters\" residing in the municipality, the presumption is that all who vote are legal voters, and that those who do not vote acquiesce in the result and that a majority of those actually voting is sufficient, though in point of fact it may not be a majority of all who would be entitled to vote. 1 Dillon, (4 ed.) p. 78 note, and p. 356, sec. 277; Walker v.

The Atlantic & North West Railway Co. v. The Town of St. Johns ([5]).\nIn any event this appeal is wholly unwarranted as there is evidence in the record that negotiations have taken place between the Town Council and the Company for which the bonus was intended that make the by-law now unnecessary and useless and leave nothing but a question of costs in dispute; the original matter in dispute has disappeared and the appeal should not be entertained; Moir v. Village of Huntingdon ([6]).\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (Oral.)\u2014We are all except my brother King, agreed that the interpretation placed by both courts below upon the statute is correct and consequently we do not require to hear counsel for the respondent.\nThe majority of the court are of opinion that the construction of article 4529 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec is very plain and that the courts below rightly interpreted that provision as meaning that the by-law required the approval of the majority in number and in value of the electors in the municipality who were proprietors of real estate as ascertained from the municipal rolls. The Company for which the bonus was intended have declined to carry out the arrangement which makes the by-law useless and leaves nothing but a question of costs in dispute.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, (appeal side) ([1]), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, and restoring the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal (1) which had dismissed the action with costs.\nThe circumstances under which the controversy arose and the questions at issue in the case are stated in the judgment reported.\nRielle and Madore for the appellant. The change in the risk from a dwelling-house to a hotel was the act of the owner who was insured, and the performance of the different acts mentioned in the conditions of the policy were likewise imposed upon the owner, so that the omission of these formalities is the fault of the owner or insured. The mortgage clause contained in the policy provides that the insurance, as to the mortgagee, shall not he invalidated by any act or neglect of the mortgagor or owner of the property insured, nor by the occupation of the premises for purposes more hazardous than are permitted by the policy. The policy states that the mortgagee interested in the policy is, and that the loss, if any, should be payable to, Mr. James McCready, Jr. Consequently, the reasons given by Mr. Justice Hall, cannot be urged against McCready, the mortgagee, nor against appellant, his assignee, who is subrogat\u00e9d in all his rights.\nThe \"Mortgage Clause\" binds the company towards the mortgagee and is a part of the policy and equity favours such a clause for the protection of the mortgagee who may be an absentee. See Stanton v. Home Fire Ins. Co. ([2]); Griswold (rev. ed.), Fire Underwriters Text Book, Nos. 733 to 744a. Here although the mortgagee was not bound to give the notice or. Furnish proof of the loss, he actually com-plied, as much as it was possible for him to do, with the conditions imposed upon the insured, by sending the company a statutory declaration of all the facts, mentioning in that notice and declaration that the insured had died.\nAppellant submits, that at the date of the fire McCready had still some insurable interest in the mort gage transferred. For when he says that at the time of the fire he had no more interest in that mort gage, it is clear, that what he means is that at that time he had transferred his rights. That transfer was made to appellant under all the usual legal warranties, Art. 1574 C.C. says: \"The sale of a debt or other right includes its accessories, such as securities, privileges and hypothecs\" and Art. 1508 C.C. adds \"the seller is obliged by law to warrant the buyer against eviction of the whole or any part of the thing sold.\" So that, not only was McCready bound to warranty for the amount of the sum transferred but also at the date of the fire bound to warranty for the accessories, amongst which was the policy in question. His interest in the mortgagee transferred remained the same on account of his responsibility towards appellant. This interest was an insurable one and remained practically the same after the transfer as before, on account of that warranty. McCready in discharge of this warranty made the assignment of his rights against respondent in virtue of the policy which was served upon respondent previous to the action, and even if there were informalities in respect to this signification that cannot render the transfer irregular. Compare The Montreal lns. Co. v. McGillivray ([3]). Art. 2576 C. C. does not apply to a mortgagee's claim but contemplates alienation of the thing insured. We also rely upon Black v. National Ins. Co. ([4]); V\u00e9zina v. The New York Life Ins. Co. ([5]); 2 May on Insurance ([6]) secs. 463,464; The National Ins. Co of Ireland v. Harris ([7]). As to notice within a reasonable time see Donahue v. Windsor Co. Mut. Fire Ins. Co. ([8]); Wiggins v. Queen Ins. Co. ([9]); Lafarge v. The London, Liverpool and Globe Ins. Co. ([10]).\nMartin for the respondent. No notice of loss was given to the company as required by the policy nor were proofs of loss furnished in conformity with the policy and the requirements of Art. 2478 of the Civil Code. McCready could not make the proof of loss under the conditions of the policy, and even if the insured was dead it would be his heirs who should comply with these conditions. See Whyte v. The Western Assurance Co. ([11]). In any case no proof was made within the required or any reasonable time. The condition required notice and proofs \"forthwith\" after loss. Art. 2575 C.C. Accident Insurance Company of North America v. Young ([12]); Trask v. State Fire and Marine Ins. Co. ([13]); Whitehurst v. North Carolina Mutual Ins. Co. ([14]); Edwards v. Lycoming Co. Mut. Ins. Co.([15]); Laforce v. Wiliiams City Fire Ins. Co. ([16]); Weed v. Hamburg-Bremen Fire ins. Co. ([17]) The company never was furnished with an account of loss or declaration verifying it, nor of value of premises at the time of fire; Lindsay v. Lancashire Fire Ins Co. (8); Banting v. Niagara District Mut. Fire Ass. Co. ([18]). These conditions precedent have not been complied with. We rely upon Art. 2478 C.C.; Accident Ins. Co. of North America v. Young ([19]); Logan v. Commercial Union Ass. Co. ([20]); Western Assurance Co. v. Doull ([21]); Scott v. Pho\u01fdix Ins. Co. ([22]); Racine v. Equitable Ins. Co. of London ([23]); Simpson v. Caledonian ins. Co, ([24]).\nBy a condition of the policy it was stipulated that no suit or action against the company for the recovery of any claim by virtue of said policy should be sustainable until after an award should have been obtained fixing the amount of such claim in the manner therein provided. No proceedings by way of arbitration were had and no offer was ever made on the part of plaintiff to abide by such proceedings. This reference to arbitration is a condition precedent to suit; Viney v. Norwich Union Fire Ins. Co. ([25]); Elliott v. Royal Exchange Assurance Co. ([26]); Braunstein v. Accidental Death Ins. Co. ([27]); Anchor Marine Ins. Co. v. Corbett ([28]); Viney v. Bignold ([29]); Corroll v. Girard Fire Ins. Co. ([30]); Gauche v. London & Lancashire Ins. Co. ([31]); Wolff v. Liverpool, London & Globe Ins. Co. ([32]).\nThe plaintiff derives his title solely from McCready, under the transfer of 17th April, 1894, and consequently McCready did not have any insurable interest in the property in question at the time of the fire. The insurance is void for transfer of interest to a third person unless made with the consent or private of the insurer. Arts. 2472, 2474, 2475, 2476, 2480, 2482 C.C.; Saddler' Company v. Babcock ([33]). Although the transferer may have retained an interest in the objects insured and have suffered a loss by their destruction, the assignee cannot recover if at the time of the loss-he has parted with his own insurable interest any more than if he had insured in his own name. The interest must exist both at the time the insurance is made or the policy is transferred, and at the time of the loss. If the plaintiff had relied upon the transfer of 24th Oct., 1893, and the indorsement on the policy dated 30th Oct. 1893 he would have considered himself the party insured at the time of the fire, but every proceeding adopted subsequent to the fire shows that he did not consider that he was entitled to the insurance, but that McCready was the person covered by the policy. The alleged proofs of loss were made out in McCready's name, and the subsequent transfer, in April, 1894, of McCready's rights to plaintiff all tend to show this.\nAs to the change in the occupation of the premises, the mortgage clause did not protect. McCready after he became aware of the change of hazard in the risk, and particularly after the interview had with the company's manager. This mortgage clause provided that the mortgagee should pay the increased rate in case of increase of hazard. From all this it must be held admitted that the policy was canceled with the consent and approval of all parties interested and no one ever paid the extra premium required to cover the premises as a hotel, or obtained from the company any policy covering the premises as a hotel; and having failed to do this, (particularly after being warned by the manager that the company would be off the risk) the company cannot be held liable in any manner whatsoever under the policy sued upon. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench allowing an appeal from the Court of Review and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe action is brought to recover the sum of two thousand five hundred dollars, the alleged amount of a loss by fire under a policy of insurance effected upon a building situate in the town of Longueuil, in the province of Quebec. The policy in question was issued by the respondents, an English company having its head office in Canada, at Toronto, but doing business through an agent at Montreal. This policy bears date 4th November, 1891, and thereby the respondents, in consideration of a premium of thirty-three dollars paid to them and the representations, covenants and warranties of the insured, did insure Bernard Maguire from the 13th October, 1891, to 13th October, 1894, against loss or damage by fire to the amount of $3,000, this amount being apportioned between a dwelling house which was insured for $2,500, and a barn, shed and stable in rear of the dwelling house which was insured for $500. The appellant does not seek to re cover in respect of the latter building, but confines his claim to the loss in respect of the dwelling house. The policy has indorsed upon it a clause in the words following:\nAt the request of the assured the loss, if any, under the policy is hereby made payable to James McCready, Jr., as his interest may appear subject to the conditions of the above mortgage clause.\n(Sgd.) JOHN WM. MOLSON,\nResident Agent.\nMontreal, 13th November, 1891.\nThe mortgage clause referred to contained several provisions, only one of which is material to the questions raised by the present appeal. That provision is as follows: It is hereby provided and agreed that this insurance as to the interest of the mortgagees only therein, shall not be invalidated by any neglect of the mortgagor or owner of the property insured, nor by the occupation of the premises for purposes more hazardous than are permitted by this policy.\nThe policy is also subject to certain conditions, twenty-three in number. These conditions are headed \"statutory conditions\" and are literally taken from the statutory conditions imposed upon Fire Insurance Companies by an Act of the Legislature of Ontario. They are followed by certain variations headed \"Variations in Conditions.\" The only conditions which are material to the questions before us are the 3rd, 4tn, 13th and 17th.\nThe third condition provides that any change material to the risk and within the control or knowledge of the assured shall avoid the policy as to the part affected thereby, unless the change is promptly notified in writing to the company or its local agent, and the company when so notified may return the premium for the unexpired period and cancel the policy, or may demand in writing an additional premium which the assured shall if he desires the continuance of the policy, forthwith pay to the company and if he neglects to make such payment forthwith after receiving such demand the policy shall no longer be in force.\nThe fourth condition is as follows:\nIf the property insured is assigned without a written permission indorsed thereon by an agent of the company duly authorized for such purpose, the policy shall thereby become void; but this condition does not apply to change of title by succession, or by the operation of the law, or by reason of death.\nThe 13th condition relates to proofs of loss and pro vides that:\nAny person entitled to make a claim under this policy is to observe the following directions. (a) He is forthwith after loss to give notice in writing to the company;\n(b) He is to deliver, as soon afterwards as practicable, as particular an account of the loss as the nature of the case permits;\n(c) He is also to furnish therewith a statutory declaration, declaring:\n(1) That the said account is true;\n(2) When and how the free originated so far as the declarant knows or believes;\n(3) That the free was not caused through his wilful act or neglect procurement, means or contrivance; and\n(4) The amount of other insurances;\n(5) All liens and incumbrances on the subject of insurance;\n(6) The place where the property insured, if moveable, was deposited at the time of the fire.\n(d) He is in support of his claims, if required and if practicable, to produce books of accounts, warehouse receipts and stock lists and furnish invoices and other vouchers; to furnish copies of the written portion of all policies; to separate as far as reasonably may be the damaged from the undamaged goods, and to exhibit for examination all the remains of the property which was covered by the policy;\n(e) He is to produce, if required, a certificate under the hand of a magistrate, notary public, commissioner for taking affidavits or municipal clerk, residing in the vicinity in which the fire happened and not concerned in the loss or related to the assured or sufferers stating that. he has examined the circumstances attending the fire loss or damage alleged; that he is acquainted with the character and circum stances of the assured or claimant and that he verily believes that the assured has by misfortune and without fraud or evil practice sustained loss and damage on the subject assured, to the amount certified.\n14. The above proofs of loss may be made by the agent of the assured, in case of the absence or inability of the assured himself to make the same, such absence or inability being satisfactorily accounted for.\nCondition 17 contains a stipulation that the loss shall not be payable until thirty days after completion of the proofs of loss.\nThe variations do not alter the terms of the conditions in any respect which requires to be now considered, save that an arbitration clause in the words following is added to condition 16:\nIt is furthermore hereby expressed, provided and mutually agreed. that no suit or action against this company, for the recovery of any claim by virtue of this policy, shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity until after an award shall have been obtained fixing the amount of such claim in the manner abode provided.\nAt the date of the policy the assured, Bernard Maguire, was the proprietor of the property insured, subject to two mortgages in favour of Hugh McCready, the tutor of the minor children of Robert McCready, dated respectively the 13th October, 1888, and the 13th of May, 1889. The amount of the hypothecary debt thus secured was $4,000.\nThis debt and the mortgages were on the 1st September, 1891 transferred to Robert McCready, who, by a notarial deed dated the 24th of October, 1893, transferred the same debts and mortgages to the appellant. The policy was never transferred to the appellant, but after the loss and on the 17th of April 1894, the appellant procured Robert McCready to execute in the appellant's favour a transfer of all his right, title and interest in the policy and whereby he subrogated the appellant in all his rights against the company under the terms of the policy and authorized the appellant to collect the amount due thereunder by reason of the loss.\nAt the date of the insurance the building insured was occupied by Bernard Maguire as a dwelling house in which he lived with his family. Subsequently it was used as a hotel or tavern, first by Maguire himself, who shortly before his death leased it to one Riendeau who occupied it as a tavern at the date of the loss.\nThe third condition does not appear to have been ever complied with. No proof of loss was ever made as required by this condition. On the 20th of December, 1893, the appellant made a statutory declaration stating the loss and other facts relating to the claim, no doubt with the intention of complying with the conditions requiring proof of loss, hut it is not proved that this declaration ever reached the hands of the respondents' officers or agents, nor is it easy to see how it could have served any useful purpose if there had been such proof, in view of the fact that at the date at which it was made, McCready had ceased to have any interest in the mortages which, as before stated, he had absolutely transferred to the appellant on the 24th of October preceding the loss.\nIt is not very clear whether, according to the true interpretation of the policy read in conjunction with the so called mortgage clause, it ought to be considered as an insurance of the proprietary interest of Maguire, McCready being a mere adjectus cause solutionss to whom the proceeds of any loss under the contract of insurance between Maguire and the company were to be paid, or whether the insurance was of McCreadys mortagee's interest, and the contact one directly between him and the company. In the former case McCready, if he had not assigned his interest before the loss, might have been entitled to sue. According to the rule of law established in England, a person not himself a party to a contact, but to whom money is made payable under a contract entered into by other persons cannot maintain an action to recover the money so made payable to him, and this rule prevails generally in the United States with the exception of the State of New York where the decisions have established a contrary rule. According to the modern law of France, however, the adjectus grati\u00e2 solutionis can maintain an action in his own name where the payment is intended for his benefit ([34]). Therefore, had McOready retained an interest in the mortages up to the time of the loss he might have maintained an action for the insurance money though it was payable to him under a contract of insurance between Maguire and the company to which contract he was himself no party and. this right of action he might have transferred to the appellant. The right to maintain an action in the character of a mere party to receive payment would, however, depend on a due performance of the condition of the policy by the as sured who, in the hypothesis now being considered, would be Bernard Maguire. On the other hand if the proper construction of the policy and what is called the mortgage clause, is, that there was a direct agreement between McCready as a mortgagee and the company, McCready could of course recover upon his own contract so long as he retained an insurable interest.\nI do not consider it necessary to determine this question of construction for the reason that it is plainly manifest that in neither alternative can the present action be maintained\nFirst, there could be no recovery in an action by the appellant or by McCready under a contract of insurance between Maguire and the respondent treating McCready as a party adjusted merely for the purpose of receiving payment, for the reason that in that case the policy must have been avoided by an unauthorized change in the use of the insured premises by converting the dwelling house into a tavern; (see Art. 2574 C C ); and for the further reason that there was no proof of loss such as the stipulations of the policy called for.\nIf on the other hand the insurance is to be deemed one of McCready\u2019s interest as mortgagee, then the undeniable fact that McCready had ceased to have any insurable interest after the 24th of October, 1893, when he transferred all his interest in the mortgages to the appellant, would by itself be a conclusive answer to the action; (see arts. 2475, 2483 and 2576 C.C., Quebec.) There is no pretence that the policy was ever transferred to the appellant; his only title to sue is therefore through the assignment from McCready to him of the 17th of April, 1894; but even if McCready had been entitled to recover for the loss this assignment would have been insufficient to confer on the appellant a title to maintain the action since in order to perfect the legal cession of a debt the law requires that it be duly signified to the debtor, and here there is no proof whatever of any such signification. (Art. 1571, C. C, Quebec.)\nA further fatal objection to the appellant's action is that there is no proof of the value of the property destroyed by the fire. The amount insured does not constitute any proof of this (art. 2575 C. C., Quebec), and the record contains no evidence what ever upon the point. A memorandum dated in October, 1894, and signed by one \"George Robert\" purporting to state the value of the destroyed property, but a memorandum which has never been proved has been irregularly introduced into the record before this court.\nFurther the arbitration clause added to the conditions by the variation to condition sixteen, provides that no action should be maintainable until after an award had been obtained pursuant to the terms of the conditions fixing the amount of the claim. The Court of Review considered this provision void as tending to oust the jurisdiction of the course of law and so contrary to public policy. I do not think this view can be maintained. The law of England provides that any agreement renouncing the jurisdiction of legally established courses of justice is null but never the less in the case of Scott v. Avery ([35]), the House of Lords determined that a clause of this nature and almost in the same words as that before us making an award a condition precedent, was perfectly valid and that no action was maintainable until after an award had been made. This decision which has been followed in many later cases, though of course not a binding authority on the courses of Quebec, proceeds upon a principle of law which is as applicable under French as under English law. This principle applies not merely to cases where the amount of damages is to be ascertained by an arbitrator, but also to cases where it is made a condition precedent that the question of liability should first he determined by arbitration. Trainor v. Ph\u0153nix Fire Ins. Co. ([36]); Kenworthy v. Queen Ins. Co. ([37]); Lantalum v. The Anchor Marine Ins. Co. ([38]); Dawson v. Fitzgerald ([39]). The appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014On 4th November, 1891, the company respondent issued a three years policy for $3,000 on certain buildings near Montreal in favour of one Maguire, the owner.\nOn November 13th following the company, with Maguire's assent, attached thereto the usual mortgage clause (Holt, Insurance, No. 192), in favour of one James McCready, who had a mortgage for $4,000 on the said buildings \"loss payable to James McCready as his interest may appear.\"\nOn the 24th of October, 1893, McCready assigned, with Maguire's assent, all his rights in that mortgage to appellant, who thereby became the mortgagee and Maguire's creditor.\nOn 1st December, 1898, Maguire's buildings were destroyed by fire.\nIn April, 1894, McCready assigned to appellant all claims he might have against the respondent, and signification of this assignment was duly made upon the respondent.\nThe appellant now claims from the respondent the amount of the said assurance less $500 value of outbuildings not destroyed.\nThe respondent meets this demand by: \u2014\nFirst. The general issue.\nSecondly. Non-compliance with the conditions of the policy as to notice of loss and proofs of loss, it being stipulated in the policy that in case of loss notice in writing should be forthwith given to the company by the assured and t that proofs of loss must be made by the assured although the loss was payable to a third party.\" and that no such notice in writing of the loss was given and that no proofs of loss were furnished by the assured or any one acting for him.\nThirdly. By a third plea the company averred that the parties had agreed by a clause in the policy (16th) to submit their differences to arbitration with the ex press condition that no suit or action against the company for the recovery of any claim under the policy should be sustainable until after an award should have been obtained fixing the amount of such claim.\nFourthly. By a fourth plea the company averred that by a condition indorsed upon the back of said policy, loss if any, under the policy was made payable to James McCready, of Montreal, mortgagee, as his interest would appear at the time of the loss as such mortgagee; that on the 1st of December, 1893, date of the fire said James McCready had no insurable interest as mortgagee or otherwise in the property covered by the policy, having on the 24th of October, 1893, assigned to appellant all the rights and interest as mortgagee of the property in question; that as said James McCready had no insurable interest in the property at the time of the fire, he had no claim to assign to appellant after the fire, and neither appellant nor James McCready have now any rights under the policy in question.\nFifthly. By a fifth plea the company averred that the premises were insured as a dwelling only and that subsequently to the issue of the policy the property was occupied as a hotel, and was so used at the time of the fire and that this was a change material to the risk within the control and knowledge of the assured and voided the policy.\nThe Superior Court maintained respondent's second plea, and dismissed appellant's action, on the ground that under article 2478 of the Civil Code, notice of the loss must be given by the assured in conformity with the special conditions of the policy, and that no such notice had been given by Maguire, nor by any person on his behalf.\nAppellant inscribed his case in review, where the judgment of the Superior Court was reversed and the company respondent condemned to pay to appellant the sum of $1,980 with interest from the 24th of April, 1894.\nRespondent then brought the case before the Court of Queen's Bench, where the judgment of the Court of Review was reversed and appellant\u2019s action dismissed, on the two grounds as given in the formal judgment, that appellant failed to prove, first, that he had a legal right of action under the policy, upon which his action was based; and secondly, that the party assured under said policy had not given the notice of loss in the manner, within the delay, and under the conditions stipulated in the said policy.\nIt seems to me doubtful, I may premise by saying, if the Ontario statutory conditions that are printed on the back of this policy, form part of the contract between the parties thereto. The policy does not in any way refer to them, the application is not in evidence, and by the Ontario statute, R.S.O., 1897, c. 203, sec. 168, these conditions, in express terms are made applicable exclusively to insurances in Ontario. Cameron v. Canada Fire and Marine ins. Co. ([40]). How could a Quebec Court have the power to declare any of the variations unreasonable as the Ontario Courts have under their statute?\nHowever, in my view of the case this is immaterial.\nThere is nothing in the respondent's plea as to arbitration, which I will dispose of first, assuming the other printed conditions to form part of the contract.\nCondition sixteen, as varied, relied upon by respondent clearly can have no application, as there is, in the Province of Quebec, no County Judge to appoint a third arbitrator in certain cases as provided thereby for Ontario policies. Under these circumstances, it is unnecessary to determine here whether or not an arbitration under a clause of this nature, clause compromissoire, is, in the Province of Quebec, a condition precedent to the right of action, a question upon which there has been much controversy. De Lalande, \"Assurance,\" Nos. 488, 439; Sirey, Table G\u00e9n. vo. \"Arbitrage,\" Nos. 47 et seq.; Bioche, \"Procedure,\" vo. \" Arbitrage,\" No. 147. In England, Scott v. Avery ([41]); Viney v. Bignold ([42]); and cases cited in Anchor Marine Ins. Co. v. Corbett ([43]). Upon this point I would be against respondent's contention.\nThen, as to the reason given by the Superior Court and by the Court of Queen's Bench that Maguire, the assured, failed to give notice of the fire as required by the policy, by art. 2478 of the Civil Code, it is evident that such a reason in this case must be due to an oversight. Whilst undoubtedly such a want of notice would be fatal to the assured Maguire, yet it could not be held to defeat appellant's claim, were it otherwise well founded, without reading out of the mortgage clause which forms the contract between the mortgagee and the company, the express provision that the insurance, as to the interest of the mortgagee, was not to be invalidated by any act or neglect of Maguire. And that cannot be done. Anderson v. Saugeen Mutual Fire Ins. Co. ([44]). Joyce on Insurance, secs. 3304, 3308. Under that provision, the mortgagee has no action where the assured would have none. In Kanady v. The Gore District Mutual Fire Ins. Co. ([45]), for instance, and Willey v. The Mutual Fire Ins. Co. of Stanstead and Sherbrooke ([46]); the companies would have been condemned if there had been in the policies a mortgage clause such as this one.\nA payment by the company to the mortgagee, under these circumstances, when the assured himself has forfeited all his rights under the policy, does not operate as a discharge of the mortgage. It simply substitutes the company to the mortgagee in the latter's rights. That is the remedy which the company gets in such a case. But, towards the mortgagee, they are liable. That part of the respondent's pleas seems to me unfounded.\nThe same as to the increase of the risk by turning the house into a hotel. By the mortgage clause it is expressly stipulated that this, as to the mortgage, was not to invalidate the policy. Such increase of risk, in express terms, puts upon the mortgagee the obligation to pay the additional rate on reasonable demand, but that is all it leaves the policy intact as to the mortgagee. Though the company here was notified by the mortgagee of this change in the premises as soon as he knew of it never made a regular demand for the additional rate, so as to put him en demeure, and never cancelled the policy, or took any action to that effect.\nI cannot see anything in the fact that, on the 9th November, 1891, the company's agent wrote to McCready that if the premises were to be occupied as a hotel the present policy would have to be cancelled. For it is after that letter on the 13th November that the mortgage clause was attached to the policy; and by its very terms, the policy was not to be cancelled or voided by an increase of hazard, the additional rate only being then payable by the mortgagee. That implied that the policy was to continue in full force. So that when the agent later on, upon being informed of the change in the occupation of the premises, told appellant that he would have to return the policy so that a new one could be issued, appellant had the right not to pay any attention to that requisition as he did.\nSo far, I would be with the appellant.\nHe cannot succeed, however. The loss as I have said, was made payable to McCready, \" as his interest may appear \" McCready, therefore, was to have no claim against the company if, at the time of the loss, it appeared that he had no more interest in the mort gage. He could not have recovered judgment, upon his contract with the company without alleging in his declaration, and proving at the trial, that he was still a mortgagee, and what was the amount due to him on the mortgage. His interest as mortgagee and his rights under the mortgage clause were correlative. The vitality of the latter depended on the existence of the former.\nNow at the time of the fire he had no interest what ever in the mortgage. He had previously sold it to appellant, without a clause of fournir garantir et faire valoir, and had become entirely disconnected from it. He then had no action against the company and if he had none the appellant cannot now have one.\nIt appears to be true, as contended for by the appellant, that to make a loss payable to the mortgagee, is not an assignment of the policy; May, on Insurance, (3 ed.) sec. 379; Joyce, on Insurance, secs. 2305, 2314; Anderson v. Saugeen Mutual Fire Ins. Co. ([47]); Fogg v. Middlesex Mutual Fire Ins. Co. ([48]); and that the assignee of the sum payable in case of loss need not have an insur able interest. I do not see anything to the contrary in arts. 2474,2475, 2482, 2483 and 2576 of the code, cited at bar. McPhillips v. London Mutual Fire Ins. Co. ([49]); Pouget, dict, des Assur. vol. ler v. \"Indemnit\u00e9,\" par. 2, p.368; v. \" Paiement,\" pages 570, 571, vol. 2; v. \" Trans port,\" page 949; Hue. Transpdecr. vol. ler, nos. 172, 174, 297. Pand, Fr. vol. 10 v. \"Assur. contre l'incendie,\" nos. 1294,1520. If McCready, for instance, had remained the mortgagee, but had assigned his right of action to appellant, appellant might have recovered judgment against the company, if the assignment had been duly served upon them in accordance with Art. 1571 of the code. Or if McCready had been a mere chirographary creditor of Maguire, an assignment to him, accepted by the insurer in the terms of the one in question \" as his interest may appear,\" might have given him a right of action, though he would have had no insurable interest upon his proving and only upon his proving, that he was still Maguire's creditor at the time of the loss. But here there is no question Of insurable or no insurable interest as pleaded that can affect the case. McCready was not the assured. Omnium Securities Co. v. Canada Fire and Mutual Ins. Co. ([50]). It is a simple question of contract. The company has covenanted to pay McCready in case of loss, but only if at the time of the loss he was still a mortgagee of the property insured by Maguire, up to the amount of his interest at the time, as such, mortgagee. Now, he had ceased to be such. He had absolutely assigned all his interest therein. Therefore, he had no action, and I repeat it, he could not afterwards assign to appellant a right that he did not himself have.\nThe maxim \"Nemo plus juris transferre potest quam ipse habet\" has here full application.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nGWYNEE J. This is an action brought by the plaintiff upon a policy of insurance against loss by fire issued by the above defendant to and in favour of one Bernard Maguire upon a dwelling house of his situate in the Province of Quebec. The policy was issued on the 4th November, 1891, and was declared to be in operation until the 13th October, 1894. The policy was in the form prescribed by a statute of the Province of Ontario as the form in which all policies against loss by fire should be framed as regards property situate within the Province of Ontario. But the company having issued outside of the Province of Ontario a policy the form and terms of which are made compulsory by statute as regards property situate in the Province of Ontario contains no less and must be construed as containing, the terms by which the parties to the policy have agreed to be bound.\nAmong the conditions subject to which the policy in the present case was issued, are the following: 3. Any change material to the risk and within the control or knowledge of the assured shall avoid the policy as to the part affected thereby unless the change is promptly notified to the company or to its local agent in writing, and the company when so notified may return the premium for the unexpired period and. cancel the policy, or may demand in writing an additional premium which the assured shall if he desires the continuance of the policy, forthwith pay to the company; and if he neglects to make such payment forthwith after receiving such demand the policy shall be no longer in force.\n12 Proof of loss must be made by the assured although the loss be payable to a third party.\n13. Any person entitled to make claim under this policy is to observe the following directions:\n(a) He is forthwith after loss to give notice in writing to the company;\n(b) He is to deliver as soon afterwards as practicable as particular an account of the loss as the nature of the case permits;\n(c) He is also to furnish a statutory declaration declaring;\n1. That the said account is just and true;\n2. When and how the fire originated as far as the declarant knows or believes;\n3. That the fire was not caused through his wilful act or neglect, procurement, means or contrivance, and\n4. The amount of other insurances.\n15. Any false statement, in the statutory declaration in relation to any of the above particulars shall vitiate the claim.\n16. If any difference arises as to the value of the property insured, of the property saved, or amount of the loss, such value and amount and the proportion thereof, if any, to be paid by the company shall, whether the right to recover on the policy be disputed or not, and independently of all other questions, be. submitted to the arbitration of some person to be chosen by both parties, or if they cannot agree upon one person, then to two persons, one to be chosen by the party insured and the other by the company, and a third to be appointed, by the persons so chosen, or on their failing to agree by the county judge of the county wherein the loss has happened, and such reference shall be subject to the provisions of the laws applicable to references in actions and the award shall if the company is other respects liable, be conclusive as to the amount of the loss and proportion to be paid by the company. Where the full amount of the claim is awarded the costs shall follow the event and in other cases all questions of costs shall be in the discretion of the arbitrators. It is furthermore hereby expressed, provided and mutually agreed that no suit or action against the company for the recovery of any claim by virtue of this policy shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity until after an award shall have been obtained fixing the amount of such claim in the manner above provided.\n17. The loss shall not be payable until thirty days after completion of the proofs of loss unless otherwise provided for by the contract of insurance.\n18. The company instead of making payment may repair, replace or rebuild within a reasonable time the property damaged or lost, giving notice of their intention within fifteen days after the receipt of the proofs herein required.\nThe policy was also made subject to a special clause called a \"mortgage clause\" which was attached to the policy and made part thereof, and is as follows:\nMortgage clause.\u2014It is hereby provided and agreed that this insurance as to the interest of mortgagees only therein shall not be invalidated by any act or neglect of the mortgagor or owner of the property insured, nor by the occupation of the premises for purposes more hazardous than are permitted by this policy. It is further provided and agreed that the mortgagees shall at once notify said company of non-occupation or vacancy for over thirty days, or of any change of ownership or increased hazard that shall come to their knowledge; and that every increase of hazard not permitted by the policy to the mortgagor or owner shall be paid for by the mortgagees on reasonable demand from the date such hazard existed according to the established scale of rates for the use of such increased hazard during the continuance of this insurance. It is also provided and agreed that whenever the company shall pay the mortgagees any sum for loss under this policy and shall claim that as to the mortgagor or owner no liability therefor existed, it shall at once be legally subrogated to all rights of the mortgages in all the securities held as collateral to the mortgage debt to the extent of such payment, or at its option the company may pay to the mortgagees the whole principal due or to become due on the mortgage with interest and shall thereupon receive a full assignment and transfer of the mortgage and all other securities held as collateral to the mortgage debt, but no such subrogation shall impair the rights of the mortgages to recover the full amount of their claim. It is also further provided and agreed that in the event of the said property being further insured with this or any other office on behalf of the owner or mortgagee the company, except such other insurance when made by the mortgagee or owner shall prove invalid, shall only be liable for a ratable proportion of any loss or damage sustained. At the request of the assured the loss, if any, under this policy is hereby made payable to James McCready, Jr., as his interest may appear subject to the conditions of the above \"mortgage clause.\"\nThis clause thus described as \"mortgage clause \" appears by Mr. Griswold's underwriters' text book to have been introduced into policies of insurance in the United States of America by the Mutual Insurance Company of Newyork, in the year 1860. In sections 733 et seq. he thus treats of the introduction of the clause in use in policies in the State of New York from which the clause in the policy now under consideration appears to have been framed:\nThis clause is a special stipulation operating only between the insurance company and savings banks and other money loaning institutions or individuals to which it may be conceded, usually accompanying a mortgagor's policy whose loss thereunder is made payable to such parties as mortgagees, and intended as a protection against any acts or omissions on the part of the insured, the mortgagor, by which the insurance might become invalidated as to such mortgagor in which event the policy would continue to cover the interest of such mortgagees, though the insured may have set fire to the premises or otherwise wilfully caused the loss. Thus as the mortgagor has no interest in the clause\u2014it not becoming operative \"until his legal interest in the insurance shall have entirely ceased it is difficult to conceive why it should as in present practice form one of the stipulations attached to his policy.\nAgain at sec. 744 he says:\nThese mortgage clauses are distinct waivers of the conservative stipulations of the policy; the property may be sold and resold or burned by the mortgagor during its currency but the liability of the underwriter still remains; and just why such special concessions should be made to money lending institutions to protect their inerests when they are the very last to make concessions to others is one of the mysteries of the business especially when the effect of such con cession is to bar the underwriter from the benefit of the saving conditions of his policy in cases of fraud or other voidable circumstances on the part of the mortgagor without any corresponding benefit in the way of extra premium or otherwise for such concession.\nAnd in another place, sec. 784, he says that the clause when first introduced was a source of such vexation and annoyance to the companies and to the courts as well until some of the more prominent offices refused to underwrite them.\nTo my mind it still remains an inexplicable mystery why the defendant should have attached this mortgage clause to the policy issued in the present case; its insertion appears to present a very difficult problem to be solved if it should be necessary to reconcile these apparently inconsistent conditions; however, in the present case it will not be necessary to attempt this task in view of the only right asserted by the plaintiff upon the record upon which alone his claim is based. That claim as presented in his statement of claim briefly is that one Bernard Maguire, being the owner of a lot of land situate in the town of Longueuil, in the province, with a dwelling house thereon, upon the 13th of October, 1888, executed a mortgage upon the said property in favour of the estate of one Robert McCready, then deceased, for securing payment to the said estate of the sum of three thousand dollars; that subsequently upon the 13th of October. 1889, the said Bernard Maguire executed another mortgage upon the same property in favour of the estate of the said deceased Robert McCready for securing payment to the said estate of the further sum of one thousand dollars.\nThat upon the 1st of September, 1891, the said estate of the said deceased Robert McCready did by deed of transfer duly executed before a notary public transfer to one James McCready all their (the said estate of said Robert McCready) right title and interest in the said mortgages amounting to the sum of four thou sand dollars.\nThat on the 4th November, 1891, the said Robert McCready insured the said dwelling house against loss by fire to the amount of two thousand five hun- dred dollars, with the defendant, who thereupon issued the policy under consideration (the material parts of which are above set forth.)\nThat on the 13th November, 1891, the defendant did at the request of the said Bernard Maguire make the loss under the said policy payable to the aforesaid James McCready, and he was fully vested with all the rights which might accrue in case a fire should happen to the property so insured.\nThat on the 1st of December, 1893, the premises so insured were destroyed by fire which resulted in a total loss, and that the ruins which remained are use less for any purpose what over, and the said fire made the said policy exigible in full; and\nThat the said James McCready did immediately notify the said company and did make a statutory declaration through his attorney and representative, and did request from the company the payment of the amount so due to him. That on the 11th of April 1894, at the City of New York, in the United States of America, the said James McCready for a good and valid consideration did assign transfer and make over to the present plaintiff all his right, title and interest in the said policy of insurance sued on in this case, and did subrogate the present plaintiff in all his rights under said policy.\nThat on the 21st April, 1894, signification of the transfer was made to the defendants, and\nThat by reason of the foregoing facts the plaintiff has a right to demand payment of the said sum (i.e. $2,500, amount of insurance on dwelling house) with interest.\nThe claim presented by this statement of claim is asserted to be vested in the plaintiff wholly by the assignment of the date of 17th of April, 1894, executed by James McCready whereby as is alleged he transferred to the plaintiff a right alleged to have been then vested in him the said James McCready, to recover the indemnity, if any, payable to the said insured Bernard Maguire under the terms of the policy. There is no claim whatever asserted in right of James McCready to recover in his own interest as mortgagee under the provisions of the mortgage clause. The statement of claim is framed as upon a policy whereby the indemnity, if any, payable to the insured Bernard Maguire was directed to be paid to James McCready without there being any clause such as that termed the mortgage clause inserted in or made applicable to the policy.\nTo the statement of claim so framed the defendant pleaded several pleas and thereby respectively pleaded the above 3rd, 12th, 13th, 16th and 17th conditions. As to the third condition they pleaded that the property insured was insured as a dwelling house and that subsequently to the issue of the said policy the said insured property was occupied as a hotel and was so used and occupied at the time of said fire, that such occupation of said premises as a hotel was more hazardous than that permitted by the said policy and no notice of such change of occupation or change of risk was ever given in writing to the said company defendant or its agents; that by means of such change of occupation of said premises the said policy became and was at the time of the said fire cancelled and not in force and the said defendant was by reason of such change of occupation relieved from all obligations under the said policy, and that the said James McCready was well aware of the said change in the occupation of said premises and failed to notify said company of such change, although the same came to his knowledge and was well known to him.\nAs to the twelfth condition and in breach thereof, the company pleaded, that the insured under the policy was Bernard Maguire, and that no proof of loss under said policy was ever made or given by said Bernard Maguire or his agents or representatives, and that the pretended proofs of loss (in the statement of claim alleged) to have been made by the plaintiff acting as agent of said James McCready, did not conform to the conditions of said policy and was and is irregular, illegal and insufficient.\nAS to the thirteenth condition and in breach thereof, it was pleaded, that no notice in writing was given said company defendant forthwith after said loss by the said assured or their agents or representatives, or by any person whomsoever, and that said condition was never complied with.\nAs to the sixteenth and seventeenth condition, and in breach thereof, it was pleaded that neither the plaintiff nor the said James McCready, nor the said Bernard Maguire ever complied with the said conditions in any manner. And it was further pleaded, that previously to the said fire on or about the 30th of October, 1893 the said James McCready sold and transferred to the plaintiff all his, the said James McCready's, right, title and interest in and to the mortgages then held by him upon said property and set forth at length in plaintiff's declaration, and that the said James McCready had not on the said 17th day of April, 1894, any rights or interest under the said policy to transfer to the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff did not thereby acquire any right or title to the amount of loss claimed under the said policy. To these pleas the plaintiff did not plead any matter whatever in reply, and so the case went down for trial solely as to the truth of the pleas, and their efficacy if proved to be true.\nNow it appeared in evidence that when the company agreed to attach the mortgage clause to Bernard Maguire's policy, James McCready, the mortgagee, was informed in writing by the agent of the defend ant that if ever the insured building should be used as a hotel the company must be notified, and that a wholly new policy must needs be obtained at an increased rate, for that the company cannot under write a policy on a hotel at the same rate as a dwelling house, nor for three years, as that issued upon Bernard Maguire's building used as a dwelling house was; and indeed the mortgage itself points out to the mortgagee, James McCready, the duty imposed upon him in the event of its coming to his knowledge that the insured building was used for a purpose more hazardous than was permitted by the policy; that occupation of the building as a hotel was a much more hazardous risk than occupation as a dwelling house, and that a much higher premium was required by the company to be paid also appears in evidence. It further appeared in undisputed evidence, in fact by the evidence of a son of Bernard Maguire, that Bernard Maguire himself in the year 1892 converted the insured building into a hotel and for the greater part of that year occupied it as such, and that by a notarial deed executed on the 27th of February, 1893, he demised the said insured building to be used as a hotel to one Alexander Riendeau, who in virtue of such demise occupied and used the building as a hotel until it was destroyed by fire. It also appeared that no notice in writing of such change of occupation of the insured building was ever given to the defendant or its agent by the said Bernard Maguire, nor by any agent or representative of his, as required by the third condition, nor by any person at any time until the latter end of the month of October, or beginning of the month of November, 1893, when the plaintiff, professing to act in the interest of the mortgagee, James McCready, having ascertained that the building which had been insured as a dwelling house was being used as a hotel, informed the said McCready that it was necessary that the defendant should be notified thereof, and thereupon the plaintiff and James McCready went together to the defendant's agent, (Mr. Molson), and informed him of the change so made in the occupation of the insured building. Until the plaintiff and James McCready so gave this information to the defendant's agent, it does not appear that the defendant had any information as to the change in the occupation of the insured building from a dwelling house into a hotel. The policy therefore, as regarded the interest of Bernard Maguire therein, had been avoided by force of the terms of the third condition long previously to the time when the notice above mentioned was given by the plaintiff and James McCready to the defendant's agent, and in fact in the lifetime of the said Bernard Maguire who, as appears in evidence, departed this life on the 17th of April, 1893.\nAgain, when the fire took place on the 30th November, 1893, the legal representatives of Bernard Maguire gave no notice thereof to the defendant and made no proof of loss as required by the conditions in that behalf in the policy. It is therefore conclusively established that no recovery in respect of the right or interest of Bernard Maguire or of his legal representatives could ever be maintained upon the policy set out in the plaintiffs statement of claim. There can be no recovery under the policy unless in the right and interest of James McCready as mortgagee, and under the provisions of the above mortgage clause.\nNow the fair conclusion upon the evidence as to what took place when the plaintiff, professing to act as the agent of James McCready, gave notice to the dffendant's agent in October or November, 1893, that the building insured as a dwelling house was being used as a hotel is I think this, that thereupon the defendants informed the plaintiff and McCready as he had informed McCready in writing when the mortgage clause was attached to the policy that it would be necessary that the old policy should be returned and an increased premium paid, and a new policy taken out, and the agent promised that upon a return of the old policy and the payment of the increased premium, the amount of which was then named he would issue a new policy but for no more than $2,000, and for one year only as the company could not underwrite a policy upon a hotel for any longer period; but that the old policy never was returned, and the increased premium never was paid or tendered and so no new policy had been issued.\nThen when the fire took place it appeases that the plaintiff, still professing to be acting as agent of the said mortgagee, James McCready, upon the 20th December, 1893, but not until then, gave notice to the defendant of the loss occasioned by fire on the 30th November, 1893, and made a declaration which plainly appears to have been intended to be by way of proof of loss on behalf of James McCready as still mortgagee and entitled to the benefit of the mortgagee clause; but whether James McCready if he was the now plaintiff and was still claiming as mortgagee could recover under the circumstances as above appearing in evidence under the provisions of the mortgage clause, it is not necessary for us to determine, for it is pleaded by the defendant and proved that upon the 24th day of October, 1893, James McCready by notarial deed assigned and transferred to the plaintiff all his right, title and interest in the mortgages in the statement of claim mentioned and neither at the time of the occurrence of the said fire, nor at the time of the notice given by the plaintiff and James McCready of the change in the occupation of the insured building from a dwelling house to a hotel, had he, the said James McCready, any estate, right, title or interest in the said mortgaged premises or any part thereof, and consequently, that nothing passed by the' execution of the document in the statement of claim mentioned to bear date the 17th April, 1894, upon which alone the cause of action in the statement of claim asserted is based. By the express provisions of the mortgage clause the said James McCready was only entitled to demand and receive any monies secured by the policy in his character of mortgagee, and to the extent only that his interest as such should appear. If therefore the monies secured by the mortgages had been paid with the exception of say $500, James McCready, had he continued to be mortgagee could have recovered no more than that amount, but having sold the mortgages and all interest in the mortgaged premises and so in the insured building two months before the happening of the fire, he could recover nothing.\nThe appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. were of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons stated in the judgment of His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.A.

Hesslein (Plaintiffs)\nRespondents\n1898: May 3; 1898: Nov. 21.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Henry Strong, C.J., and Taschereau, Gwynne, King and Girouard JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nVendor and purchaser\u2014Specific performance\u2014Laches\u2014Waiver.\nThe purchaser under contract for sale of land is not entitled to a decree for specific performance by the vendor unless he has been prompt in the performance of the obligations devolving upon him and always ready to carry out the contract on his part within a reasonable time even though time was not of its essence; nor when he has declared his inability to perform his share of the contract.\nThe purchaser waives any objection to the title of the vendor if he takes possession of the property and exercises acts of ownership by making repairs and improvements.\nAppeal from the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nIn April, 1894, an agreement was entered into between the plaintiffs and the defendant Wallace in the following terms:\n\"It is hereby agreed that Thomas J. Wallace shall and does hereby purchase, for the sum of two thousand five hundred dollars, and Alexander Hesslein, as executor of his late father, agrees to sell, and does hereby sell, to said Thomas J. Wallace, that property near the lunatic asylum, Dartmouth, formerly owned by Lewis P. Fairbanks, including the water lot in front, if also owned by Mr. Hesslein, for the sum of two thousand five hundred dollars, with five hundred dollars off. The sale to be completed and property conveyed on or before the expiration of three months, interest to be paid from 1st May till completion of sale and purchase by said Thomas J. Wallace. A good title to be given in fee simple, and the said two thousand dollars also to be paid, or partly paid, and mortgage for balance to the satisfaction of Mr. Hesslein.\"\nWallace went at once into possession of the property described in said agreement, and afterwards leased it to the other defendant. He failed, however, to pay the purchase money within the specified time, and in 1895 the plaintiffs, having previously requested him to carry out his contract or deliver back the property, notified him that the agreement was at an end and demanded immediate possession. This demand not being complied with they took an action for possession in which the defendants set up want of title in plaintiffs and also counter-claimed for specific performance and damages.\nOn the trial the plaintiffs had judgment for possession of the property with damages for mesne profits which was affirmed by the full court, from whose judgment this appeal was taken.\nWallace, appellant in person, and Sinclair for the appellant Kearney. The plaintiffs were not entitled to rescind the contract. Fry on Specific Performance, pp. 485, 1060; Stone v. Smith[2]; Freeth v. Burr[3]; The Mersey Steel and Iron Co. v. Naylor, Benzon & Co.[4]; and they had no title to the water lot or to the right of way. Notice was given that plaintiffs intended to claim the benefit of a condition making time of the essence of the contract. Crawford v. Toogood[5]. See also cases cited in Fry on Specific Performance (3 ed.), sec. 1094.\nBorden Q.C. for the respondents. The possession of plaintiffs alone is sufficient to establish their title. Cunard v. Irvine[6]; Smith v. McKenzie[7]; Freeman v. Allen[8]. The defendants were tenants at will to plaintiffs and cannot dispute their title. A purchaser let into possession under contract is tenant at will to vendor. Doe d. Hiatt v. Miller[9]; Doe d. Tomes v. Chamberlaine[10]; Cole on Ejectment, pp. 58, 449, 450; and such purchaser cannot dispute his vendor's title. Doe d. Milburn v. Edgar[11]; Doe d. Bord v. Burton[12]; Cole on Ejectment, p. 213, 215.\nAssuming however that plaintiffs were in default the purchaser is not entitled to possession unless he is in a position to enforce specific performance against the vendor. See Walsh v. Lonsdale[13]; Swain v. Ayres[14]; and from defendants' counter-claim, which claims specific performance, it will be seen that the defendant Wallace was not in a position to enforce specific performance. He is not entitled to such relief by reason of his delay and non-performance of the contract on his part. Fry on Specific Performance (3 ed.) secs. 922, 1100.\nWe also rely upon Young v. Halahan[15]; Harris v. Robinson[16], per C. J. at page 397; and Denison v. Fuller[17] as to waiver of defects of title by the taking of frivolous objections.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The action of the respondents for the recovery of the land was clearly maintainable so far as the legal title was concerned. The only question is: Were the appellants in a position to entitle them to the specific performance which they seek by their counter claim?\nI am decidedly of opinion that they were not entitled to any such relief. In order to entitle a party to a contract to the aid of a court in carrying it into specific execution he must show himself to have been prompt in the performance of such of the obligations of the contract as it fell to him to perform, and always ready to carry out the contract within a reasonable time, even though time might not have been of the essence of the agreement. It appears from the evidence that the appellants do not bring themselves within these conditions. No doubt it was incumbent on the vendors to have made out a good title; the contract is express on this head; but on the other hand it does not appear that the appellants ever called for the production of the title. It was well observed by the learned counsel for the respondents that in this country sales of lands are not in practice carried out in the formal way in which such contracts are completed in England. It is usual for the vendee to examine the title in the registry office and to rest satisfied with that, and in many cases to complete the purchase without professional assistance. I do not say that the vendor is not bound to make out a title, even in the case of an open contract, and of course he is bound to do so where, as in the present case, he has expressly undertaken to do so. The comparatively small value of real estate would make it out of the question to carry out sales of land here according to the elaborate and costly practice which prevails in England. Mr. Wallace, so far as appears from the evidence of the vendor and his solicitor, Mr. Ritchie, never asked for an abstract or raised any question as to the title except as to the sale under the foreclosure decree in the case of Murdoch v. Fairbanks.\nThe objection on this head seems to have been sufficiently answered by the statute referred to in the judgment of the full court delivered by the Chief Justice.\nTo the other objections, three in number namely: (1) that the vendor could not make a title to the water-lot; (2) that a strip of land had been expropriated or sold to the Crown for the railway; (3) that the wife of Mr. Fairbanks was entitled to dower, sufficient answers were given at the trial. First, it was show that Mr. Wallace when he entered into the agreement had full knowledge of the notorious fact that the railway had for years run across the land and therefore that the Crown must have acquired title to the strip so occupied either by purchase or expropriation. Next it appeared that Mr. Hesslein never owned the water-lot which had not been included in the mortgage by Fairbanks to Gray. Thirdly, Mrs. Fairbanks was not entitled to dower, her title to legal dower having been absolutely barred by the mortgage deed of her husband to Gray, and a right to equitable dower not having been conferred in Nova Scotia until the statute of 1884, and then only in cases where the husband died beneficially entitled to the land, and it having been shown here that the equity of redemption was sold at sheriff's sale and a conveyance to the purchaser executed by the sheriff in 1875.\nFurther, Mr. Fairbanks shows that there was generally a good title to the property under the statute of limitations, his father, uncle, himself, the vendors and their father, having been in successive uninterrupted possession since 1836.\nThe widow of the respondents' father, who was entitled under his will to an annuity charged upon the land, executed a deed releasing that charge. There was moreover a clear waiver of all objections to title by Mr. Wallace, who took possession of the property and exercised acts of ownership by making repairs and improvements to the amount of $285, according to his own evidence, thus exercising acts of ownership sufficient to show a waiver.\nFurther, Mr. Wallace's whole course shows that he did not intend to raise any question of title. On the day fixed for completion he went to the vendor's place of business, taking with him a blank mortgage deed for the purpose of at once carrying out the purchase. Then he never made any objections to the title to Mr. Ritchie save as before mentioned.\nThere is, however, a distinct ground for refusing specific performance. We must of course give credit to Mr. Ritchie's evidence, and he most distinctly proves that Mr. Wallace declared his inability to perform his agreement. He had, it seems, previously applied to Mr. Ritchie for an extension of time for the payment of the purchase money, but any agreement on this head had fallen through. Then at an interview Mr. Ritchie says, \"Mr, Wallace gave me to understand that it was inconvenient to pay the purchase money.\" Further, on what appears to have reference to a subsequent occasion, Mr. Ritchie says: \"Mr. Wallace said he could not carry out his contract. He never said he could pay part. The only thing he could pay was interest and taxes, about $100. He could not complete his part of the agreement.\"\nThe respondents then, finding that their purchaser who had taken possession of their property and had kept possession for some eighteen months without paying anything by way of rent or interest, was unable by his own admission, declared to their solicitor, to carry out the contract by paying the purchase money, had no alternative but to bring the action which they brought to recover the land; and in the face of the declaration of Mr. Wallace that he could not pay and after his application for an extension of time had been refused, it would be to set at naught all the principles regulating the exercise of the jurisdiction by way of specific performance, which require a purchaser to be ready, prompt and eager to complete, if the court were now to interfere and to interpose still further delay in the resumption by the respondents of the enjoyment of their property and to decree the execution of a contract which the purchaser had declared his inability to perform.\nThe judgment is perfectly right in giving the respondents the damages to which under one or other of the denominations of mesne profits, of damages for use and occupation, or on an equitable account against a purchaser in possession, the respondents were clearly entitled.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J.

The appellant's petition was filed on Monday the 31st of January, 1898. Certain preliminary objections were filed by the respondent, all of which are now immaterial save that on which the judgment appealed from proceeded, namely, that the petition was not filed in due time as required by the Dominion Controverted Elections Act as amended by the Act 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 20.\nSection nine sub-section (b) of the original Act as amended by section five of the latter Act now reads as follows:\nThe petition must be presented not later than thirty days after the day fixed for the nomination in case the candidate or candidates have been declared elected on that day and in other cases forty days after the holding of the poll,* * *\nThe remainder of the section has no application here.\nBy the \"Interpretation Act,\" Revised Statutes of Canada, chapter 1, section 7, sub-section 27, it is enacted as follows:\nIf the time limited by any Act for any proceeding, or the doing of anything under its provisions, expires or falls upon a holiday, the time so limited shall be extended to and such thing may be done on the day next following which is not a holiday.\nBy the twenty sixth section of the same Act it is declared that the expression \" holiday\" includes Sunday.\nThe second section of the same Act provides as follows:\nThis Act, and every provision thereof, shall extend and apply to every Act of the Parliament of Canada, now or hereafter passed except in so far as the provision is inconsistent with the intent and object of such Act, or the interpretation which such provision would give to any word, expression or clause is inconsistent with the context, and except in so far as any provision thereof is in any such Act declared not applicable thereto; and the omission in any Act of a declaration that the \" Interpretation Act \" applies thereto, shall not be construed to prevent it so applying, although such express declaration is inserted in some other Act or Acts of the same session.\nAt the election now in question the holding of the poll having taken place on the twenty-first of December, 1897, the fortieth day thereafter was the thirtieth of January, 1898, which was a Sunday. The petition in the case, as I have said, was not presented until Monday the thirty-first of January, 1898. The learned judge of the Superior Court has held that this presentment of the petition was too late.\nWe are all of opinion that the petition was presented in due time.\nThe provision embodied in sub-section 27 of the seventh section of the \" Interpretation Act \" must be read as if it had been expressly re-enacted in the \" Controverted Elections Act \" for we think the case cannot be brought within any of the exceptions contained in section two, and there is no declaration that the last mentioned Act shall not apply in the computation of time under the Controverted Elections Act or the Act amending it.\nThere is nothing to be found in the context requiring us to refuse to apply the prescribed interpretation to the clause in question nor can it be said that it is inconsistent with the intent and object of the \"Controverted Elections Act.\" If we were not to apply sub-section twenty-seven in the case before us we should be establishing a construction which would render this clause of the \" Interpretation Act \" useless and inapplicable in every case in which an Act of Parliament required some Act to be done within a pre scribed number of days, and we should thus reduce this useful rule of statutory interpretation to a nullity. The appeal must be allowed with costs, and judgment must be entered in the court below overruling the preliminary objection in question with costs.*\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: P. N. Martel.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F. X. Choquette.\n"}

Is the said Imperial Act in force in British Columbia?\nIf in force it would not apply to a prosecution for an offence under R. S. C. ch. 164 (The Larceny Act) sec. 58.\nAn action was brought on a covenant given for the purpose of stifling a prosecution for the embezzlement of partnership property under R. S. C. ch. 164, sec. 58, which was not re\u2014enacted by the Criminal Code, 1892.\nHeld, that the alleged Criminal Act, having been committed before the Code came into force, was not affected by its provisions and the covenant could not be enforced. Further, the partnership property rot having been held on an express trust the civil remedy was not preserved by the Imperial Act. APPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe action was brought on a covenant contained in an agreement under seal. dated the 25th day of October, 1894, by which the defendants covenanted to pay to the plaintiff $7,000.00 at the end of three years from its date, with interest at 8 per cent.\nThe defence set up is that the agreement was executed in consideration that a criminal prosecution would be stifled.\nThe plaintiff claims that on the evidence no offence under the Criminal Code was disclosed and there could, therefore, be no abandonment of the prosecution. He also contended that under the Imperial Act 20 & 21 Vict.ch. 54, sec. 12, such defence could not be set up as against misappropriation of trust funds.\nThe trial judge concurred in the latter contention and gave judgment for the plaintiff which was reversed by the full court.\nThe questions at issue upon this appeal are stated in the judgment reported.\nRobinson Q.C. for the appellant.\nChrysler Q.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed.\nIt was found by both the courts below that the covenant of the 25th October, 1984, upon which this action is brought, was given for the express purpose of stifling a prosecution against H.P. McCraney for certain statutory offences with which he was charged in respect of the embezzlement or misappropriation of the assets of a partnership firm of which he had formerly been a member, and which was comprised of the present appellant, H. P. McCraney and Thomas Robson Pearson, The evidence is so strong as to leave no doubt that the abandonment by the appellant of the prosecution which had been instituted and under which H. P. McCraney was then in prison, having been on a preliminary examination committed for trial by a police magistrate, was the express object which the respondents had in view in executing the covenant in question.\nThe principal question which has been raised is as to the application of an Imperial enactment (the 12th section of 20 & 21 Vict. ch. 54) to the case. It is said that this provision was in force in British Columbia at the time the covenant in question was given, and that it validates a transaction which but for it would be confessedly illegal and void.\nThe Act in question which made a breach of trust a criminal act provides that;\u2014\nNothing in this Act contained, nor any proceeding, conviction or judgment to be had or taken thereon against any person under this Act shall prevent, lessen or impeach any remedy at law or in equity which any party aggrieved by any offence against this Act might have had if this Act had not been passed, but no conviction of any such offender shall be received in evidence in any action at law or suit in equity against him, and nothing in this Act contained shall affect or prejudice any agreement entered into or security given by any trustee having for its object the restoration or repayment of any trust property misappropriated[2].\nIt has been contended in argument here that the Imperial Act referred to and consequently the 12th section just set forth, was not in force in British Columbia when the acts for which H. P. McCraney had been prosecuted or threatened with prosecution were committed and when the covenant was given. It is in my view not material to the decision of the present appeal to inquire whether the Act in question was in force or not.\nThe statute in question would not, in my opinion, have applied to authorize such a prosecution as that which had been instituted against McCraney. The class of trustees referred to in the Act were trustees who had been guilty of misappropriation of property held upon express trusts.\nFrom the evidence it appears that there was prima facie a case warranting a prosecution against McCraney under the 58th section of the Revised Statutes of Canada, ch. 164, which enacts that:\nEvery one who, being a member of any co-partnership owning any money or other property, or being one of two or more beneficial owners of any money or other property, steals, embezzles or unlawfully converts the same or any part thereof to his own use or that of any person other than the owner, is liable to be dealt with, tried, convicted and punished as if he had not been or were not a member of such co-partnership or one of such beneficial owners.\nThis section was not re-nacted in the Dominion Act known as \"The Criminal Code (1892)\" and the Act in which it was contained was by that legislation repealed.\nThe acts however charged against H. P. McCraney and for which he was threatened with criminal prosecution, and for one of which he had actually been imprisoned, and was in prison at the time the covenant in question was executed, had been committed in 1892, the co-partnership having been dissolved in 1891. Then the second sub-section of section 981 of the Criminal Code expressly reserves the liability to criminal prosecutions and punishment for acts committed under the repealed statutes, a list of which is contained in a schedule to the Act which includes chapter 164. The Criminal Code itself did not by the express provision in its second section come into force until the 1st of July, 1898, so that whilst it was in force at the date of the prosecution and the execution of the impeached agreement, it was not in force when the alleged criminal acts were committed and is therefore entirely without relevance in the present case.\nOf course it is out of the question to say that section 12 of the Imperial statute, if in force in British Columbia, could apply to a prosecution for an offence under section 58 of the Larceny Act (ch. 264 Revised Statutes of Canada.)\nThat the offences with which McCraney was charged, embezzling the money raised by a mortgage of partnership lands and other moneys obtained by drawing on the partnership bank account were criminal acts within section 58 of chapter 164 Revised Statutes of Canada, is too plain to require demonstration. Therefore an agreement to stifle a prosecution for these alleged acts must, in the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary, have been illegal as in contravention of the rule of the common law which declares illegal all agreements to suppress criminal prosecutions.\nReturning to section 12 of the Imperial Act I must say that even if that section were in force and applied to a case like the present, it appears to me that the judgment of the late learned Chief Justice of British Columbia was wrong in the construction which he placed upon the 12th section, for it appears very plainly to me that the enactment whilst it did provide that the civil remedies of a cestui que trust who had been defrauded should not be interfered with by the statute, and that he should be at liberty to accept reparation and restoration of the trust fund and securities therefor, did not authorize an express agreement to forbear criminal prosecution. Further, this section 12 would seem to be restricted to agreements or securities given by the defaulting trustee himself, and not to those given by third persons under no civil liability to the cestui que trust for the avowed purpose of rescuing him from criminal responsibility.\nFor the general law as to the illegality of agreements to stifle prosecutions I refer to Jones v. merionethshire Permanent Benefit Building Society (1) and to Flower v. Sadler (2). In the first case there are important observations upon the difference between securities given by the wrong doer himself by way of reparation and those given by third parties under no civil obligation to the party wronged merely for the purpose of stifling the prosecution. I do not think that by section 12 it was intended to legalize securities of the last class.\nThe appeal must be dismissed and I see no reason why it should not be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Gordon E. Corbould.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Davis, Marshall, McNeil & Abbott.\n[1] 5 B.C. Rep. 571.\n[2] 20 & 21 Vict. Ch. 54, s. 12.\n"}

M., a boy of fifteen years of age, in passing through the cemetery with some companions, found some of these caps lying about on the bank above the works, in front of a tool box used by one of the gangs of workmen, and put them in his pocket. Later on the same day he was scratching the fulminate end of one of them with a stick when it exploded and injured his hand. On the trial of an action against the contractors for damages, there was no direct evidence as to how the caps came to be where they were found, but it was proved that when a blast was about to take place the workmen would hurriedly place any explosives they might have in their possession under their tool box, and then run away. It also was proved that caps of the same kind were kept in the tool box near which those in question were found by M., and were taken out and put back by the workmen as occasion might require.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that in the absence of evidence of circumstances leading to a different conclusion, the act of placing the caps where they were found could fairly be attributed to the workmen, who alone were shown to have had the right to handle them; that it was incumbent on defendants to exercise a high degree of caution to prevent them falling into the hands of strangers; that the act of M. in exploding the cap as he did not necessarily import want of due caution, and if his negligence contributed to the accident the jury should have so found; and that whether or not M. was a trespasser, was also a question for the jury, who did not pass upon it. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming, by an equal division of opinion, the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendants.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nWallace Nesbitt, (Gauld with him,) for the appellant, cited McGibbon v. The Northern Railway Co.[1]; Williams v. Eady[2]; Scott v. London and St. Katherine Docks Co.[3] at page 601; Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims 298; Snyder v.

Eastern Counties Railway Co.[12]; Rogers v. Toronto Public School Board[13], Nagle v. Allegheny Railroad Co.[14]; Beven on Negligence (ed. 1889) p. 148.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. The jury could not have reasonably given a verdict for the plaintiff upon the evidence adduced, and therefore the case was properly withdrawn from them. I adopt the reasoning of the Chief Justice of Ontario in the Court of Appeal.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nKING J.\u2014The negligence complained of, consisted in the leaving of a number of highly explosive detonators or caps in a place where they might innocently be picked up and handled in a way leading to their explosion by persons unaware of their dangerous character.\nAt the trial the plaintiff was non-suited upon the ground that there was no evidence connecting the defendants with the act of leaving the caps where they were found. Upon direct appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld the non-suit, per Burton C.J.O. and Maclennan J.A., Osler and Moss JJ. A. dissenting.\nThe facts of the case are shortly stated in the opinions of the learned judges.\nAssuming what, upon the evidence, the learned Chief Justice thought might properly be found by a jury, viz. that the caps which were picked up were the property of defendants; and having regard to the proof that such kind of caps were kept by defendants in the tool box, in front of and near which the caps in question were found, and that they were taken out and put back as occasion might require by defendants\u2019 workmen; and having regard to the proof mentioned by the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Maclennan, that workmen in defendants\u2019 service, upon the same work but in other gangs, found it useful and expedient when a blast was about taking place to hurriedly place any such explosives as they might happen to have in their possession under their tool box and then run away; it would seem to be a fair inference, (in the absence of circumstances leading to a different conclusion) to attribute the act of placing the defendants\u2019 caps upon the ground outside the box to those who alone are shown to have had the handling of them or the right of handling them. The alternative supposition that they may have been removed from the tool box by a stranger and then left upon the ground has no probabilities, and no evidence in its support. If there were circumstances leading to such conclusion it was for defendants, with their fuller knowledge of the way in which their property was managed, to supply the proofs. On the case as it stands, the evidence seems sufficiently to connect defendants with the act or omission by which the caps were placed or left where they were found.\nThen as to the negligence involved in such act or omission, the law imposes a duty of carefulness upon those who have the management or control of things which are or may be dangerous to human life or limb.\nThe danger to be apprehended from the indiscriminate handling of these detonators was so great and so obvious that a high degree of caution was reasonably to be observed on the part of defendants to prevent them falling into the hands of strangers. None of the learned judges suggested that there was any lack of evidence from which negligence might be deduced, provided that the defendants were proven to be responsible for the detonators being found outside the tool box.\nAs to the plaintiff\u2019s act in exploding the cap by picking the apparently harmless substance in the bottom of the case with a piece of wood, this was not an act necessarily importing want of due caution. Assuming that defendants negligently suffered such a dangerous instrument to fall into the hands of persons unaware of its character, they might reasonably have foreseen that it might in the hands of such persons be treated in such a way as to explode it, and the act of such person in ignorance of its dangerous character whereby an explosion took place, could not be said to be his voluntary act in the sense that would incapacitate him from recovery. If he was negligent and thereby contributed to the result still, unless such negligence is necessarily to be imputed upon the evidence, it would be for the jury to pass upon it.\nA question was raised as to whether the place where the caps were found was a place where the plaintiff had no right to be; this however (as stated by the judges of the Court of Appeal) was, upon the evidence a question for the jury.\nFor these reasons the appeal should be allowed with costs, the non-suit set aside and a new trial had. The defendants must also pay the costs in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Nesbitt, Gauld & Dickson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bruce, Burton & Bruce.\n[1] 14 Ont.

C. P. (old text)\u2014R. of P. (S. C.) LV.\nWhere a grave injustice has been inflicted upon a party to a suit, the Supreme Court of Canada will interfere for the purpose of granting appropriate relief although the question involved upon the appeal may be one of mere local practice only. Lambe v. Arm strong (27 Can. S. C. R. 390) followed.\nUnder a local practice prevailing in the Superior Court, in the District of Montreal, the plaintiffs obtained an order from a judge fixing a day peremptorily for the adduction of evidence and hearing on the merits of a case by precedence over other cases previously inscribed on the roll and without notice to the defendants. The defendants did not appear when the cases was taken up for proof and hearing and judgment by default was entered in favour of the plaintiffs. The defendant filed a requ\u00eate civile asking for the revocation of the judgment to which the plaintiffs demurred. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the judgment maintaining the demurrer and dismissing the requ\u00eate with, cost;-\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench, that the order was improperly made for want of notice to the adverse party as required by the Rules of Practice of the Superior Court, and that the defendant was entitled to have the judgment revoked upon requ\u00eate civile.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), affirming the decision of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which maintained the plaintiffs' demurrer to a requ\u00eate civile filed by the defendant asking for the revocation of the judgment by default and dismissed the requ\u00eate with costs.\nThe circumstances under which the requ\u00eale civile was filed and questions at issue upon the appeal sufficiently appear from the judgment reported.\nAtwater Q.C. for the appellant. The judgment maintaining the demurrer gives as its sole reason that \" the petition in revocation of judgment (requ\u00eate civile) presented by the defendant does not disclose reasons which give rise to such a petition (requ\u00eate civile).\" in considering the demurrer, the allegations of the petition must be taken as admitted, and Art. 505, C. C. P. (old text) is designed to apply to cases where the parties might suffer from causes beyond their control, and an effective remedy could not be gained by appeal to a higher court, which would, of course, be bound by the record as it then stood. Cooke v. Caron ([1]); Kellond v. Reed ([2]).\nThe requ\u00eate alleges that the judgment was obtained by surprise and artifice; that the defendant was in ignorance of the issue on the supplementary demand, was not represented by counsel, and had no opportunity of properly pleading to the action, or of setting up facts which would entitle it to have the action and the supplementary demand dismissed. The article only states three of the cases where the petition is admissible. These have been held not to be restrictive of the cases where the petition will lie, but are merely indicative. The cases of Lusk v. Riddell ([3]) Neil v. Champoux ([4]), Marcotee v. Gu\u00e9vremont ([5]), Marcotte v. Cour des Commissaires, de St. Casimir ([6]), Doutre v. Bradley ([7]), Bayliss v. Leddy ([8]), all go to shew the unanimity of the jurisprudence in this respect, and the facts in many of them are very similar to those in the present case.\nThe remedy in law exists; the allegations of the petition and defence are sufficient to allow of its being exercised and the injustice which would be done to the appellant by the judgment now standing against it and to which it was condemned unheard, should be remedied by the admission of the defence and allowing the issues to go 10 trial.\nWe refer your Lordships also to the special observations upon the fourth report of the Commission for the revision of the Code of Civil Procedure, chap. 58, which will he found at page lxviii of Mitchell's Manual of Procedure, (ed. 1897), and to the decisions in Leet v. Lee Chu ([9]); Durocher v. Durocher ([10]); King v. Sandeman ([11]); and Mitchell v. Wilson ([12]). See also Rule of Practice LV, (Superior Court,) Foran's Code of Civil Procedure (ed. 1879) p. 651.\nBrousseau for the respondent. The petition in revocation does not disclose reasons which could give rise to such proceeding, and in the Court of Queen's Bench, Boss\u00e9, Blanchet, W\u00fcrtele, Ouimet and Tellier JJ. unanimously affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court dismissing it. Then the judgment of the Superior Court in the original demand praying for the annulation of the deed of sale was susceptible of appeal as was also the judgment on the incidental demand, for the recovery of moneys paid on account and omitted in the principal demand. The appellant had appeared and pleaded to the principal demand, the Court of Appeal had ordered that the record be sent back to the Superior Court to pronounce a judgment annulling the sale, after the filing of the judgment in Fait banks v. The Eastern Townships Bank, and McDougall et at mis-en-cause. There was no new appearance, no new demand of plea and no certificate of default or foreclosure required to proceed to judgment. The filing of the judgment in Fairbanks v. The Eastern Townships Banks and an inscription of the case upon the roll were the only documents required for the court to adjudicate finally on the principal demand, and when the case was called parties had a right to be heard. The appellant actually appeared by counsel who asked for an enlargement of the case but on the day fixed did not appear and judgment was rendered accordingly. If appellants were not satisfied they had an appeal, and they did inscribe the case before the Court of Review but desisted from their inscription.\nIf this can be considered a judgment rendered by default to appear or plead it maybe opposed according to articles 483a and 484 C. C P as amended by the R. S. Q., art. 5905 and 52 Vict. ch. 49 (Que). Petitions in revocation of judgment can be made only against judgements not susceptible of being appealed or opposed and as this judgment could both be appealed from and opposed, the appellant cannot petition in revocation.\nAgain the facts alleged in the petition do not constitute the fraud or deceit intended in article 505 of the Code of Procedure. There is no rule forbidding a judge to order a case to be added to the roll or put on in place of another case. There is a rule providing for eight days notice to the opposite party, but the appellant does not complain of the want of that notice. Yet he would have even in that case the remedy of opposition. There is no complaint that the judgment was rendered upon documents subsequently discovered to be false nor upon any unauthorized consent disavowed after judgment, nor that since the judgment documents of a conclusive nature have been discovered which had been withheld or concealed by the respondents. There is not, in fact, any complaint that brings the case within the operation of article 505 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nThe following authorities are in point;\u2014Dawson v. Macdonald ([13]); Dow v. Dickinson ([14]); Arts. 149, 152, 153, 192, 234, 235, 266; Dal. Rep. G-en. vo. Requ\u00eate Civile, nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and notes 16 & 17; nos. 6, 60, 63-70.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGIROUARD J.-The present appeal is from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench of the Province of Quebec, appeal side, which confirmed a judgment of the Superior Court sitting at Montreal maintaining a demurrer to a requ\u00eate civile. It involves a mere question of local practice and were it not for the grave injustice inflicted upon the appellant we would not interfere. Lambe v. Armstrong ([15]).\nThe petitioners, defendants in the court below and present appellants, by their attorneys, Messrs. Atwater & Mackie, allege in their requ\u00eate civile, that the respondents, plaintiffs\nserved a demand of plea upon the defendants' attorneys on the first day of June, 1896, and on the fifth day of June presented an inscription for proof and final hearing on the merits, as well upon the original action as upon a supplementary incidental demand, to Mr. Justice Curran and that the said judge, at the request of the plaintiffs par reprise d'instance, thereupon immediately fixed the said case upon the roll for proof and final hearing on both the said issues, for the sixteenth day of June, although the said role had been completed and prepared and no notice was given to the defendants, nor to their attorneys, of such application. The requ\u00eale civile further alleges:\nThat on the said sixteenth day of June, Mr. Mackie, one of the attorneys of record for the defendants, but who really was not con versant or familiar with the case or with the details thereof, appeared and protested against proceeding, but in spite of such protest, the plaintiffs par reprise d'instance were allowed to proceed and examine a witness who pretended to prove the items of the plaintiffs' supplementary incidental demand.\nThat the court continued the said case for the purpose only of allowing the cross-examination of the said witness until the nineteenth of June then instant.\nThat on the said nineteenth day of June, it being impossible, on the ground of public business, for the said A. W. Atwater to attend the trial of the said case, and it being practically useless to cross-examine the said witness or properly to present the defendants' case without a special answer or plea to the said supplementary incidental demand, the court nevertheless took the said case en delib\u00e9r\u00e9.\nOn the twenty-fifth day of June, 1896, judgment was rendered for a large amount against the appellants, who finally set forth in their requ\u00eate civile:\nThat the said judgment was obtained by the means aforesaid and by surprise and artifice with regard to the defendants, who were in ignorance of the issue of the supplementary demand, and who were not represented by counsel and had no opportunity of properly pleading to the action or of setting up the facts which they are advised would have entitled them to a dismissal of the action and of the supplementary demand.\nThat the undue haste and artifice made use of by the plaintiffs par reprise d'instance, in endeavouring to obtain the judgment complained of was prompted by the desire on their part to prevent, in bal faith, the bank from being able to carry out its obligations towards the plaintiffs and to enable them to escape from their obligation towards the bank to pay the price of the property which they had purchased and which was sold to them in good faith by the defendants, and of which they have had possession and the use since January, eighteen hundred and ninety-three.\nArticle 505 of the Code of Civil Procedure in force when the said petition was filed, provides that;\nJudgments which are not susceptible of being appealed or opposed, as herein above provided, may be revoked, upon a petition presented to the same court, by any person who was a party to, or was summoned to e a party to the suit in the following cases;\n1. Where fraud or artifice has been made use of by the opposite party. [See Art. 1177 C P. Q.]\nThe judgment rendered against the appellants can be attacked only by a requ\u00eate civile, if sufficient grounds be shown.\nIt is not necessary to decide the much vexed question as to whether or not article 505 of the Code of Civil procedure is limitative or simply illustrative. The appellants allege \"artifice\" and even Shad faith.\" True articles 234 and 235 gave the respondents the right to inscribe the case for hearing upon giving to the opposite party at least eight .days notice \" before that fixed for the proof.\" But how is the day for the proof to be fixed? The Code does not say. At all events, article 235 does not authorize any one party in a pending suit to have a precedence or a preference over other cases previously inscribed. It is admitted that to avoid confusion and expense, the practice prevailing at the time, was to file inscriptions for proof and hearing in blank and leave them with the prothonotary to be set down for hearing in turn, notice to be given of the setting down at least eight days before trial. Under that course of practice, sanctioned both by the Bench and the Bar, it is conceded that the appellants' case could not have been called or heard before the September term. The appellants' counsel had therefore every reason to presume that he should not have to prepare for his case, or to summon his witnesses before that term, as it is alleged in the requ\u00eate civile, that the June roll had been completed and there being no court to sit in the months of July and August.\nBut even if this view of the proceedure be wrong, the case should not have been set down by the judge for hearing on the sixteenth of June, without hearing the appellants.\nUnder the rules of practice of the Superior Court, (Rule LV)\nno motion can be received or heard unless previous notice thereof, of at least one day, be given to the adverse party,\nand this rule is one of common justice.\nThe application for a \" day fixed \" was a most important motion. Under articles 234 and 235 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the respondents were entitled to inscribe for hearing upon giving eight days notice, but they had to run their chance of being heard or not. These articles did not give them the privilege of securing a hearing on a fixed day without the order of the court and notice to the opposite party.\nWe are unanimously of opinion that notice should have been given, and, for that reason, the appeal is allowed with costs and the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench as well as that of the Superior Court maintaining the said demurrer are reversed and set aside and the said demurrer dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants; Atwater Duclos & Mackie.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Brosseau, Lajoie & Lacoste.\n[1] 10 Q.

Rainville, (1898) 29 S.C.R. 201\nDate: 1898-11-21\nThe Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nAlexander Rainville and Elizabeth Rainville (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1898: October 31; 1898: November 21.\nPresent: Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick, King and Girouard JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nNegligence\u2014Findings of jury\u2014Evidence\u2014Concurrent findings of courts appealed from.\nIn an action against a railway company for damages in consequence of plaintiffs\u2019 property being destroyed by fire alleged to be caused by sparks from an engine of the company the jury found, though there was no direct evidence of how the fire occurred, that the company negligently permitted an accumulation of grass or rubbish on their road opposite plaintiffs\u2019 property which, in case of emission of sparks or cinders would be dangerous; that the fire originated from or by reason of a spark or cinder from an engine; and that the fire was communicated by the spark or cinder falling on the company\u2019s premises and spreading to plaintiffs\u2019 property. A verdict against the company was sustained by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the latter court (25 Ont. App. R. 242.) and following S\u00e9n\u00e9sac v. Central Vermont Railway Co. (26 Can. S.C.R. 641); George Matthews Co. v. Bouchard (28 Can. S.C.R. 580); that the jury having found that the accumulation of rubbish along the railway property caused the damages, of which there was some evidence, and the finding having been affirmed by the trial court and Court of Appeal, it should not be disturbed by a second appellate court.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of Mr. Justice Ferguson at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs. The facts of the case may be stated as follows: The plaintiffs reside at the Village of Stony Point, in the township of Tilbury North, in the County of Essex, and adjoining the right of way of the defendants. On the 25th day of October, 1895, shortly after the passage of a locomotive along the defendants\u2019 line of railway, certain barns the property of the plaintiffs were observed to be on fire. The fire very rapidly spread and ultimately destroyed these buildings together with other property of the plaintiffs. The barns were situated about eight to ten feet from the fence bounding the company\u2019s right of way. Dry grass, the natural growth of that season, was on the company\u2019s right of way, and also on the plaintiffs\u2019 land between the said fence and barns.\nThe following were the questions submitted to the jury and their answers thereto:\n\u201c1. Was there any negligence on the part of the defendants in the construction or management of the engine? A.\u2014No, except that the master mechanic admits that any engine will emit sparks and cinders.\u201d\n\u201c2. Did the defendants negligently permit an accumulation of grass or rubbish or both on their road opposite the plaintiffs\u2019 place which in the case of the emission of sparks or cinders would be dangerous? A.\u2014Yes.\u201d\n\u201c3. Did the fire in question originate from or by reason of a spark or cinder from the engine? A.\u2014Yes.\u201d\n\u201c4. If so, was the spark or cinder communicated directly by means of a high wind from the engine to the barn, or stack of the plaintiffs, or was the communication by way of a spark or cinder falling upon the defendants\u2019 land and the fire then running by reason of dry material from the place where the spark or cinder fell to the fence and then to the plaintiffs\u2019 property? A.\u2014By falling on the company\u2019s premises, then to the plaintiffs\u2019 property.\u201d \u201cIn any case assess the value of the buildings and the value of the chattel property separately? A.\u2014Award to plaintiff on buildings $725. Award on chattels $440 with costs.\u201d\nA verdict for the above amounts was entered for the plaintiffs and was sustained on appeal to the Court of Appeal. The defendant company then appealed to this court.\nOsler Q.C. for the appellant, argued that the evidence was not sufficient to warrant the verdict and relied on S\u00e9n\u00e9sac v. Central Vermont Railway Co.[2]\nCowan for the respondents, referred to Smith v. London and South Western Railway Co.[3]; Canada Atlantic Railway Co. v. Moxley[4].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGIROUARD J.\u2014The respondents reside at the village of Stony Point, in the County of Essex, and at a distance from the railway of the appellants of only a few feet. On the 25th October, 1895, shortly after the passage of a fast express, the premises of the respondents were observed to be on fire, and were soon entirely destroyed. The present action was instituted to recover the amount of the loss, namely, $1,500.\nThe principles of law governing cases of this kind are well known. A railway company, like an individual, is liable for the consequences of its negligence only when that negligence is the cause of the damage, or at least has materially contributed to it. That is the general rule. It is submitted on the part of the appellants that where they use the most perfect locomotives, and are not otherwise guilty of negligence, which was certainly the cause of the accident, they are not liable, a proposition which is supported by considerable authority and seems to have received the sanction of this court in The New Brunswick Railway Co. v. Robinson[5]. This particular point, however, does not present itself in the present instance, as the jury have found negligence on the part of the appellants which was the cause of the damage. The questions submitted to them and their answers are as follows:\n1. Was there any negligence on the part of the defendants in the construction or management of the engine? A.\u2014No, except that the master mechanic admits that any engine will emit sparks and cinders.\n2. Did the defendants negligently permit an accumulation of grass or rubbish or both on their road opposite the plaintiffs\u2019 place which in the case of the emission of sparks or cinders would be dangerous? A.\u2014Yes.\n3. Did the fire in question originate from or by reason of a spark or cinder from the engine? A.\u2014Yes.\n4. If so, was the spark or cinder communicated directly by means of a high wind from the engine to the barn or stack of the plaintiffs\u2019, or was the communication by way of a spark or cinder falling upon the defendants\u2019 land and the fire then running by reason of dry material from the place where the spark or cinder fell to the fence and then to the plaintiffs\u2019 property? A.\u2014By falling on the company\u2019s premises, then to the plaintiffs\u2019 property.\nIt must be conceded that the evidence in support of the last finding is weak, and it is not therefore surprising that the trial judge (Ferguson J.) charged the jury in favour of the defendants, but being of the opinion that there were relevant circumstances given in evidence to go to them, he refused a non-suit; and in appeal his judgment was unanimously maintained (Burton C.J. and Osler, Maclennan and Moss JJ.A.)\nThe appellants have relied upon the recent decision of this court in S\u00e9n\u00e9sac v. Central Vermont Railway Co.[6] as supporting their contentions. If it has any application, it is against them. There the origin of the fire was a mystery; so two courts had found, and we declared that in a case of that kind where mere questions of fact were involved, the jurisprudence of the Privy Council and of this court was not to disturb the unanimous findings of two courts; and in other cases we decided that it was especially so when they were returned by a jury, unless clearly wrong or erroneous.\nIn the present instance, we agree with the courts below that there is some evidence of negligence which in the opinion of the jury, affirmed by the two courts below, was the cause of the damage, namely, the accumulation of the dry rubbish along the railway property; and following S\u00e9n\u00e9sac v. The Central Vermont6, The Geo. Matthews Co. v. Bouchard[7] and other cases, we are of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John Bell.\nSolicitor for the respondents: M.K.

Persons who have insured property with this company must forthwith give notice of any other insurance already made, or which shall afterwards be made, on the same property, and have a memorandum of such other insurance indorsed on the policy or policies effected with this company, otherwise this policy will be void; provided, however, that on such( notice being given at any time after the issue of the policy, it shall be optional with the company to cancel such policy. In the event of any other insurance on the property herein described having been once declared as aforesaid, then this company shall, if this policy shall remain in force, on the happening of any loss or damage, only be liable for the payment of a ratable proportion of such loss or damage whether such other insurance be in force or not, unless the discontinuance of such other insurance shall have been previously agreed to by this company by indorsement upon this policy.\nThe property insured was destroyed by fire on the eighteenth day of July, 1895. On the tenth of that month the plaintiff's son, the plaintiff being ill at the time, forwarded to the head office of the Quebec Fire Assurance Company at the City of Quebec an application for further insurance of one thousand dollars upon the property, which application was accepted by the Board on the seventeenth of July, 1895, the day before the happening of the fire. The plaintiff did not receive notice that the insurance in the Quebec Fire Assurance Company was accepted until after the fire occurred.\nThe question for decision was whether or not, under the circumstances, the policy was void for want of notice of the subsequent Insurance and indorsement thereof on the policy as required by the above condition.\nStockton Q.C. and Dixon for the appellant. The condition requires the assured to give the notice even after a loss has occurred. See Western Assurance Co. v. Doull[1]; Logan v. Commercial Union Ins. Co.[2]; Inland Ins. Co. v. Stauffer[3]; Jewett v. Home Ins Co.[4]; Bruce v. Gore District Mutual Assurance Co[5].\nPugsley Q.C. for the respondent. The notice is to be given \"forthwith,\" which means within a reasonable time. Mellen v. Hamilton Fire Ins. Co.[6]. Bunyon on Fire Insurance, 4 ed., p. 109.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGWICK J.\u2014On the 22nd day of August, 1891, the plaintiff insured his dwelling house for $1,500 with the appellant company for three years. The property was burned on the 18th of July, 1895. One of the conditions of the policy was as follows:\n11. Persons who have insured property with this company must forthwith give notice of any other insurance already made, or which shall afterwards be made, on the same property, and have a memorandum of such other insurance indorsed on the policy or policies effected with this company, otherwise this policy will be void; provided, however, that on such notice being given at any time after the issue of the policy, it shall be optional with the company to cancel such policy. In the event of any other insurance on the property herein described having been once declared as aforesaid, then this company shall, if this policy shall remain in force, on the happening of any loss or damage, only be liable for the payment of a ratable proportion of such loss or damage whether such other insurance be in force or not, unless the discontinuance of such other insurance shall have been previously agreed to by this company by indorsement upon this policy.\nUpon the plaintiff suing for the amount of his policy, the defendants set up failure on the part of the assured to comply with this condition as a defence, alleging that the assured had effected other insurance on the property but had not forthwith given notice thereof and had a memorandum relating to it indorsed on the policy. The facts upon which this defence is based are practically undisputed.\nThe plaintiff was an insurance agent in St. John, New Brunswick, where he lived, one company of which he was agent being the Quebec Fire Assurance Company, an institution having its head office in the city of Quebec. On the 10th July, several days before the fire, the plaintiff's son, in the absence of his father through illness, but with his implied authority, wrote to the office at Quebec requesting an additional insurance of a thousand dollars upon the property. On the 17th of July, the day before the fire, the directors of the Quebec company passed a resolution authorizing the additional insurance asked for to be effected. This resolution was not communicated to the plaintiff either directly or indirectly until the 20th of July, two days after the fire, and the plaintiff received notice of it in the course of mail on or about the 21st or 22nd July. The plaintiff being thereby expressly authorized by the Quebec company, after knowledge of the fire, to issue in their name the policy asked for did so, and the company paid him the amount of it, there being no question as to the accidental character of the fire and the property being worth an amount largely in excess of the insurance upon it.\nWe are of opinion that under the circumstances the verdict of the jury in favour of the plaintiff was right, and that upon two grounds: First, that there was no valid insurance such as that set up by the defence existing at the time of the fire; no policy was issued until some time subsequent to the fire. At the time of the fire there was no obligation on the part of the Quebec company to effect any insurance at all. The resolution authorizing the insurance passed on the 18th of July might have been rescinded immediately afterwards, and was not in any respect binding upon them until the 20th, after the fire, when it was communicated to the plaintiff. The fact that the company subsequently recognized the transaction as an insurance and paid it in fulfilment of what doubtless they conceived to be an honourable obligation does not support the allegation that there was an existing insurance at the time of the fire, and the ground upon which the court below proceeded was equally a bar to the defendants' contention.\nSecondly, the condition in the policy must be given a reasonable meaning. It cannot mean that a party is bound to give notice of an insurance of which he has not and cannot have any knowledge. Neither can we presume that it was intended to provide for a case where an insurance happened to be effected subsequent to a fire of which the assured was bound to give notice, and that under such circumstances the company should have the option of cancelling the policy. That could not have been the intention of the parties. It could solely have reference to an insurance effected before a fire of which subsequent insurance the assured before the fire could have given notice to the company.\nIf it is in the interest of assurance companies that policy holders should give such a notice as that contended for, it will be necessary that the condition be changed so as to compel notice of application for subsequent insurance rather than of the insurance itself.\nWe are all of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: M.

By a consent judgment in a former action between the same parties it had been agreed that a valuator should be appointed by the Commissioner of Crown Lands whose report was to be accepted in place of that provided for by the Timber Slide Companies Act, and to be acted upon by the commissioner in fixing the schedule of tolls.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that the above grounds of impeachment were covered by the consent judgment and were res judicata.\nHeld further, that the plaintiffs having treated the company as a corporation, using the works and paying the tolls fixed by the commissioner, and having in the present action sued the company as a corporation, were precluded from impugning its legal existence by claiming that its corporate powers were forfeited. By R.S.O. [1887] ch. 160. sec. 54, it was provided that if a company such as this did not complete its works within two years from the date of incorporation it should forfeit all its corporate and other powers \u201cunless further time is granted by the county or counties, district or districts, in or adjoining which the work is situate, or by the Commissioner of Public Works.\u201d\nSemble. The non-completion of the work within two years would not, ipso facto, forfeit the charter, but only afford grounds for proceeding by the Attorney General to have a forfeiture declared.\nAnother ground of objection to the imposition of tolls was that the commissioner, in acting on the report of the valuator appointed under the consent judgment erroneously based the schedule of tolls upon the report as to expenditure instead of as to actual value and the statement of claim asked that the schedule be set aside and a scale of tolls fixed.\nHeld, that under the statute the schedule could only be allowed or varied by the commissioner and the court could not interfere, especially as no application for relief had been made to the commissioner.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment of Meredith C.J. in favour of the defendant.\nThe material facts and questions raised for decision are sufficiently set out in the above head\u2011note and in the judgment of the court.\nKappelle and Bicknell for the appellant.\nWalter Cassells Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed.\nMr. Justice Moss in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal states the objections of the appellants to the judgment of Chief Justice Meredith as follows:\nUpon the argument of this appeal five main grounds of objection to the defendant\u2019s right to impose and collect tolls, as against the plaintiffs, were presented for consideration by their counsel:\u2014(1) That the dam, slides, booms, etc., in respect of which the claim of tolls is made, are not built or placed on properties mentioned in the letters patent, or upon the streams or waters mentioned therein; (2) that the defendants did not within two years from their incorporation complete the works for the completion whereof they were incorporated, and so forfeited their corporate and other powers and authorities; (3) that the defendants made false reports or returns to the Commissioner of Crown Lands, upon which the schedule of tolls was from time to time fixed; (4) that under a consent judgment in a prior action between the same parties, the report of a valuator appointed by the Commissioner of Crown Lands was to be accepted in place of the report or return provided for by the Timber Slide Co\u2019s Act, and to be acted upon by the Commissioner in fixing the schedule of tolls, and the Commissioner erroneously adopted the report as to expenditure, instead of as to actual value, in fixing such schedule, and also improperly treated the company as one, the duration of whose existence was only ten years, and included in the tolls an amount computed to ensure a return of the capital of the company at the end of that period and; (5) that the defendants are by these works and improvements obstructing navigable waters contrary to the provisions of the Timber Slide Co\u2019s Act, and are not entitled to exact tolls in respect of such obstructions.\nTo one or the other of these heads all the objections raised by the appellants in argument in this court and in their factum may be referred.\nI entirely agree with the judgments delivered in both the courts below regarding the effect of the consent judgment in the former action between the present parties. I am of opinion that it is conclusive against the appellants as regards the first, second, third and fifth grounds of impeachment before enumerated. It is impossible now in the face of that decree, and after the acquiescence and consent of the appellants on which it was founded, that the appellants can be permitted to insist that the respondents are not entitled to collect tolls for the use of their improvements by the appellants either for the reason that statutory requirements have not been complied with, or for the reason that the schedules of tolls in force anterior to the former action were improperly based upon false reports or returns to the Commissioner of Crown Lands.\nAs regards the first, second, third and fifth objections, these are all covered by the former consent judgment and are res judicata. In addition to this estoppel, the objection that the respondents\u2019 corporate powers were forfeited by reason of their failure to complete the construction of their works within two years from the 9th of May, 1893, the date of their incorporation, it seems clear that the appellants who have all along treated the respondents as a corporation, using their works and paying tolls fixed by the commissioner under the statute, and who now in the present action sue the respondents as a corporation, are precluded from insisting in this same action that the respondents do not constitute a corporation, and that therefore their own action is brought against a body having no legal personality. By suing in the way they have they have precluded themselves from impugning the legal existence of the body they sue.\nFurther, it appears to me that there is great weight in the suggestion to be found in both the judgments delivered in the courts below that notwithstanding the strong words of the statute R.S.O. 1887, ch. 160, sec. 54, (which was the enactment in force at the date of the issue of the letters patent,) the non-completion of the works within two years would not have worked a forfeiture of the respondents\u2019 franchise ipso jure, but would only have constituted grounds for proceedings by the Attorney General on behalf of the Crown to have a forfeiture declared.\nThis enactment is as follows:\nEvery such company shall, within two years from the day of their \u201cbecoming incorporated, complete each and every work undertaken by them and mentioned in the report required prior to the incorporation of the company, and for the completion whereof they may be incorporated, in default whereof they shall forfeit all the corporate and other powers and authority which they have in the meantime acquired, and all their corporate powers shall thenceforth cease and determine unless further time is granted by a by-law of the county or counties district or districts in or adjoining which the work is situate, or by the Commissioner of Public Works, and if any company formed under this Act for the space of one year abandons any works completed by them, so that the same are not in sufficient repair and cannot be used for the purpose proposed in the instrument of incorporation of the company, then the corporate powers of the company shall cease and determine.\nNow it will be observed that the provision shows in plain unmistakable terms that forfeiture by lapse of time may be covered by an extension of time granted either by a public body, the county or district council of the adjoining municipality, acting of course in the public interest, or by a high and responsible officer of the Crown. This shows that the lapse of the corporate powers provided for in the section quoted was entirely in the interest of the Crown and public. Whatever effect might otherwise have been given to the words used I cannot bring myself to think that more was intended than to authorize a proceeding by the Attorney General on behalf of the Crown to have a forfeiture judicially declared, and that it was not competent to a private person indirectly to insist on the cesser of the corporate powers of the respondents under the circumstances alleged. However, I do not insist upon this as a ground for upholding the judgments appealed against as the reasons already stated for holding the appellants precluded from taking the objection to the legal existence of the corporation are sufficient for the purpose. There are still further reasons for not readily assenting to the contention of the appellants on this head. The act of the Commissioner of Crown Lands by exercising his statutory powers in prescribing the tolls to be taken by the respondents is a plain recognition of the respondents as a corporation, and therefore from it alone might well be implied his assent to an enlargement of the time for completion of works as well as a waiver on the part of the Crown to any objection on the ground of the locality of the works as not being authorized by the charter. Again the supplementary letters patent issued on the 21st February, 1896, are a clear recognition of the respondents as a subsisting corporation and therefore a waiver of any right to forfeiture by reason of effluxion of the statutory term before completion, and also a virtual extension of the time which the Crown by its officer the Commissioner had power to grant.\nFurther, this objection to the respondents as a corporation de jure is not only answered in the way already suggested but, even if there had been an absolute forfeiture and the respondents had therefore ceased to be a corporation de jure, it would be difficult to establish that they had ceased to be a corporation de facto.\nThis last head is entirely distinct from the principle of estoppel which I think is here amply sufficient to preclude the appellants from taking the objection they insist upon.\nThe third objection mentioned by Mr. Justice Moss, viz., that the respondents made false reports to the Commissioner of Crown Lands from time to time upon which the schedule of tolls were fixed, is a plain case \u201cof harking back\u201d as Mr. Justice Moss well says, to the complaints which were raised in the former action, and intended to be concluded by the consent decree in that cause. Since that judgment was entered there has been no schedule of tolls except one made under the judgment and based upon the report of an expert according to the terms agreed upon by the parties and embodied in the judgment. The fourth objection which is the only one remaining to be considered has reference to the schedule of tolls fixed under the consent decree upon the report of the valuator agreed upon. This schedule of tolls is impeached upon the ground that the Commissioner fell into an error in settling it having made the mistake of basing it on the expenditure found to have been made instead of upon actual value. The court is therefore asked (see paragraph 7 of the claim for relief), for this alleged error of the commissioner, to set aside the schedule of tolls and to fix a new scale of tolls itself. The plain answer to this is that the court is here asked to do what the statute expressly delegates to the Commissioner who has express power conferred upon him by section 41 in a case in which tolls fixed by him are objected to as not having been fixed in accordance with the Act \u201cto alter or vary the schedule of tolls so as to make them correspond with the true meaning of the Act.\u201d The interference of the court is therefore invoked to do that which the Commissioner alone has jurisdiction to do and that in the absence of any allegation or suggestion of an unsuccessful or any application to the Commissioner for relief.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Laidlaw, Kappelle & Bicknell.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Blake, Lash & Cassels.\n"}

Q.\nA cow-boy aboard a ship on the eve of departure from the port of Montreal, was injured by the falling of a derrick then in use which had been insecurely fastened. He was not at the time engaged in the performance of any duty and although he had been warned to \"stand from under\" he had not moved away from the dangerous position he was occupying.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, that the boy's imprudence was not merely contributory negligence but constituted the principal and immediate cause of the accident and that, under the circumstances, neither the master nor the owners of the ship could be held responsible for damages on account of the injuries he received.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada maintaining in part the appeal of the defendants against the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, in favour of the plaintiff for $750 with interest and costs.\nThe appellants are the captain and the managing owner of the steamship Kildona, plying between Montreal and Liverpool, and the respondent as tutor of Herbert W. Ball, a minor, sued them for $4,000 damages, for injuries alleged to have been caused to Ball by the falling of a derrick on the ship in the port of Montreal. The case was tried with a jury and the Superior Court interpreting the verdict as being against the appellants, condemned them to pay respondent $750, interest and costs. The Court of Queen's Bench, on appeal, varied this judgment reducing it to $375, with costs, in the Superior Court, Boss\u00e9 J. dissenting, and from the latter judgment the defendants now appeal, asking for its reversal and the dismissal of the action with costs. The plaintiff, by cross-appeal, asks to have the Superior Court judgment restored.\nA further statement of the case will be found in the judgment reported.\nMacmaster Q.C. and Peers Davidson for the appellants. We ask that, upon the findings made by the jury, a judgment should be entered for the defendants; Arts. 491, 496, 508 C. P. Q. The court below erred in varying the judgment, and had only jurisdiction to grant a new trial or to render a different judgment. There was no question of contributory negligence to be considered. The owners cannot be held insurers of trespassers going aboard their vessel, and they have not been shown to have committed any fault to make them responsible, under Art. 1053 C. C.; Tooke v. Bergeron ([1]); Montreal Rolling Mills Co. v. Corcoran ([2]). The boy Ball, after being warned to \"stand from under,\" refused to move away, but remained as a trespasser in the dangerous position near the hatch where he ought not to have been.\nThe slipping of the knot did not constitute fault in law. The appellants are only responsible if guilty of the determining, principal or proximate cause, and the injury was found by the jury to have been the result of Ball's Own fault or folly. Moreover the result of the findings of the jury is actually a verdict in favour of the defendants; Cowass v. Marshall ([3]). The de fendants owed no duty to Ball at the time of the accident; The Caledonian Railway Co. v. Mulholland ([4]). It is evident that the reasonable expectation of being engaged, as found by the jury, was the expectation which any cattleman might have had at that season of the year. It would he an engagement on the wharf. There is no evidence that cattlemen are ever engaged on the ship itself. Hence a reasonable expectation of being engaged in no sense warranted his presence on the ship. Neither was Ball at his work and duty when injured.\nThe appellant relies upon the following authorities to support the contention that upon the findings a verdict ought to be entered for the defendants. 7 Larombi\u00e8re, (ed. 1885) no. 29; Dal. supp. v. \" Responsabilit\u00e9 \" no. 198; v. \" Travail\" no. 370; Prud'homme v. Vincent ([5]); Charlier v. Quebec Steamship Co. ([6]).\nThe plaintiff moved for judgment on the verdict. By doing so he accepted the verdict as it stands and is now precluded from taking any exception to any of the answers. Fletcher v. Mutual Fire Insurance. Co. for Stanstead and Sherbrooke ([7]).\nWe also refer to Mercier v. Morin ([8]), at page 90, and Paterson v. Wallace ([9]), per Cranworth L.J. at page 754, and to the French authorities summed up by His Lord ship Mr. Justice Girouard in The George Matthews Co v. Bouchard ([10]). Ball was volens; he took the risk of .staying in a dangerous way and suffers solely on account of his own imprudence.\nGeoffrion Q.C. and J. M. Ferguson for the respondent. Ball went aboard the ship with a lawful object, expecting to be signed on the ship's articles. He was licensee and. invitee of the owners and. entitled to be protected from the consequences of their negligent acts; The Canada Atlantic Railway Co. v. Hurdman ([11]). The proof showed only an indefinite notice to \"stand from under, \" a place where there would have been no danger but for a \"slippery hitch \" on the derrick chains, a negligently made knot which allowed the derrick to fall and cause the injuries at a spot beyond the usual area of danger in the swinging of the derrick. The defendants were guilty of gross fault in permitting such negligence in the working of a derrick, an operation which, under any circumstances, is attended with more or less danger. There is a presumption of fault against the defendants resulting from the mere fact of the fall of the derrick which is not rebutted and renders them liable; Ross v. Langlois ([12]); Corner v. Byrd ([13]); Evans v. Monette ([14]); Dupont v. Quebec Steamship Co. ([15]) Great Western Railway Co. of Canada v. Braid ([16]); Scott v. The London and St. Katharine Docks Co. ([17]); Smith v. Baker & Sons ([18]); Meux v. Great Eastern Railway Co. ([19]). In matters of d\u00e9lit and quasi-d\u00e9lit, the French law applies. See in Cossette v. Dun ([20]), at page 247, per Fournier J. referring to Carsley v. The Bradstreet Co. ([21]). See also 2 Domat. tit. 8 sec. iv, par. 1; 7 Larombi\u00e8re p. 541, no. 8, p. 560, no. 28; 20 Laurent, nos. 466, 467, 468, 472, 485, 487, 489, 490, 491.\nContributory negligence, or what is called faute commune, does not bar plaintiff's right of action, but only tends to a diminution of damages in proportion to the plaintiff's contributory share in the injury.

Leduc ([22]); Ibbottson v. Trevelhick ([23]) and Cowans v. Marshall ([24]).\nEven in English law it is not every species of contributory negligence that bars plaintiff's right of action; Radley v. The London & North West Railway Co. ([25]), per Penzance L. J. at pages 758-59 and 760; Foulkes v. The Metropolitan District Railway Co. ([26]); Tuff' v. Warman ([27]); Sewell v. British Columbia Towing Co. ([28]) per Strong J. referring to Davies v. Mann ([29]); Barnes v. Ward ([30]); at pa\u00ab*e 420, Tynch v. Nurdin ([31]), approved in Harold v. Watney ([32]), which also refers to and approves Jewson v. Gatti ([33]) Ball's alleged fault contributed but little, if any, to the injuries, and the jury though probably somewhat led astray by the judge's charge, have a very wide latitude in the determination of an action of this nature. Bridges v. Directors, etc , of North London Railway Co. ([34]) and Tue Connecticut Ins. Co v. Moore ([35]) confirming the judgment of this court. Although the Court of Queen's Bench had power to enter the verdict in accordance with what they deemed to be the true construction of the findings, they had no power to set aside the verdict for the plaintiff, and direct a verdict to be entered for the defendant in direct opposition to the finding of the jury on material issues.\nThe verdict of a jury assessing damages is not interfered with unless for very grave reasons. none of which appear in this case. Arts. 499, 500, 501, and 503 C. P. Q. are simply declaratory of the law, and settled jurisprudence as it existed previously; Ford v. Lacey ([36]); Great Western Railwag Co. v. Braid ([37]); and Dorion C. J. in Wilson v. Grand Trunk Railway Co. ([38]) affirmed in this court (Cass. Dig. 2 ed. 722); Metropolitan Railway Co v. Wright ([39]); Brown v. Commissioner for Railways ([40]); Wilkinson v. Payne ([41]); Lambkin v. South Eastern Railway Co. ([42]).\nThe Court of Appeal held, inasmuch as the jury found that both sides were in fault, and awarded $750.00 without mentioning that they had reduced the damages to this figure on account of contributory fault, that there was nothing to show that this figure did not represent the entire damage suffered, and so reduced the verdict by one half to represent plaintiff's contributory share in the injury. It is respectfully submitted that in so doing the court entirely misapplied the law. The presiding judge properly instructed the jury on the question of contributory fault, that if they found that the defendants' fault was the cause of the injury, but also found that plaintiff's fault contributed thereto they should take this fault of the plaintiff's into consideration in awarding damages and so reduce the damages accordingly, and there is a presumption juris et de jure that the jury followed their instructions and the trial court judgment ought to be restored. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nGIROUARD J.\u2014As we intimated at the time of the argument, we have come to the conclusion that this appeal should be allowed. The action was instituted by the tutor Hawkins, to recover $4,000 for compensation for certain injuries alleged to have been caused on the 17th July, 1897, to the minor, Ball, by the fault of the master and managing owner of the cattle steamship \" Kildona,\" then lying in the port of Montreal, and on the point of sailing for Europe. It appears that the boy, aged about eighteen, was injured by the falling of a chain in connection with the derrick after due warning had been given to him to move off the hatch. The case was tried with a jury in January, 1898, and to determine the question of responsibility it is sufficient to refer to the following questions submitted to them, and their answers:\n4th. Was the injury to said Ball caused by any fault or imprudence of the defendants, and if so state in what manner the same consisted?\nAnswer. Nine for; three against. Yes, imperfect hitching of the knot connecting the gantling with the chain.\n5th. Was said injury caused by any fault or imprudence of said Herbert William Ball, and if so, state in what the same consisted?\nAnswer. Unanimous. Yes, after due warning had been given.\n6th Was the said Herbert William Ball engaged on board the said steamship \" Kildona,\" at his work and duty at the time and place when and where the accident happened?\nAnswer. Unanimous. No, but on the ship with reasonable expectation of being engaged.\nDid said Herbert William Ball persist in remaining at the spot where the accident happened, notwithstanding defendants' warning asto the danger?\nAnswer. Unanimous. Yes, in ignorance of the danger.\n11th. Has the said Herbert William Ball and the plaintiff in hiscapacity suffered any damages from the injury above referred to, and. if so, in what sum do you assess such damages?\nAnswer. Nine for; three against. Yes seven hundred and fifty dollars. Upon these findings the trial judge (Archibald J.) condemned the defendants to pay $750 and costs.\nIt is clear from the answers of the jury that they found fault both against the plaintiff and the defendants, but failed to determine what was the principal and immediate cause of the accident; and consequently, after weighing the evidence, the majority of the Court of Appeals thought that, under art. 496 of the new Code of Civil Procedure, the ends of justice would be attained by reducing the amount of the judgment one half, that is, to $375. Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9. dissented, being of opinion that the facts disclosed show no right to damages, the accident being the result of the negligence of the boy alone. Mr. Justice Hall, who rendered the judgment of the court, stated that\nBall had been engaged to go upon the voyage and assist in the care of the cattle, by one who was authorised to make such engagement.\nThis statement is certainly contrary to the finding of the jury, who, in answer to question six, returned that Ball was not engaged on the steamship at his work and duty, but that he was \" on the ship with reasonable expectation of being engaged.\" There is evidence in favour of this finding. Walter Roffey, the only man authorised to engage the cattlemen for the voyage, does not remember having engaged Ball, but he further swears that when the time came to sign the ship's articles, the full list of the men engaged answered to the call. Ball's name was not among them. Therefore, it does appear that Ball was a mere trespasser on the ship, to whom the defendants owed no obligation or duty. But we do not rest our judgment upon that ground; even if he had any legitimate cause or right to be on the ship, for instance to seek for employment, he certainly was not employed in the movements of the derrick; he had no business to be on the hatch, and when ordered to \"stand from under,'' he should have moved from the hatch. The \" due warning\" is proved by Anderson, Greeshaw and other witnesses. It is not disputed; it is found by the jury and is admitted by the trial judge and the judges in appeal. But we do not share their opinion that the fault of the boy constitutes merely contributory negligence. We agree, on the contrary, with Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9, that it was the principal and immediate cause of the accident. See Dalloz, J. G. Sup. vo. Responsabilit\u00e9, n. 193; vo. Travail, n. 370. where several decisions are collected. A recent arr\u00eat of the Cour de Cassation (S. V. 83, 1, 402) is remarkably in point:\nLA COUR. Sur le moyen unique, tir\u00e9 de la violation des art. 1382, 1383 et 1384 C. civ. Attendu que l'arr\u00eat attaqu\u00e9 (Chamb\u00e9ry, 28 juill. 1880) d\u00e9clare, en fait, que, si les blessures qui ont entrain\u00e9 la mort de Pierre Duret ont eu pour cause l'effondrement d'un \u00e9chafaudage \u00e9tabli par Encrenaz pour le compte de Carton, et si cet effondrement a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par un vice de construction imputable \u00e0 Encrenaz, il est constant, d'autre part, d'apr\u00e8s les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la cause et des enqu\u00eates, que Duret, loin d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9, soit par Encrenaz, soit par Carton, \u00e0 monter sur cet \u00e9chafaudage, o\u00f9 sa pr\u00e9sence n'\u00e9tait motiv\u00e9e par aucun travail m\u00eame accidentel, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment averti que son concours \u00e9tait inutile aux travaux alors ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s sur le dit \u00e9chafaudage; qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 formellement invit\u00e9 \u00e0 se retirer et \u00e0 aller travailler ailleurs :\u2014Attendu qu'en d\u00e9cidant, dans ces circonstances, que Duret a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de son propre fait et de sa seule imprudence, et en rejetant pour ce motif, la demande en dommagesint\u00e9r\u00easts intent\u00e9e par sa veuve contre les d\u00e9fendeurs \u00e9ventuels, l'arr\u00eat attaqu\u00e9 n'a viol\u00e9 aucun des textes pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s;\u2014Rejette, etc.\nThis court laid down the same principle in Tooke v. Bergeron ([43]).\nWe are therefore unanimously of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the cross-appeal of the respondent, for a restoration of the judgment of the Superior Court, dismissed with costs. The action of the respondent is dismissed with costs before all the courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs;\nCross-Appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Peers Davidson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

Morris with them,) for the appellants. The actions were well founded, for the following among other reasons: 1. Appellants had a proprietary interest in the stock and funds obtained under by-law 37, and the respondents acted as their agents, trustees or managers; 2. Respondents so acted for the purpose of paying the debenture holders, who were the real creditors; 3. In this administration expenses have been incurred for a share of which appellants are liable, and in that respect they are entitled to an account.\nThe prime object of the by-law was to authorize the county to subscribe for shares in the capital stock of the St. Francis & Megantic International Railway Co., and to provide the means of paying for that stock. The appellants and other municipalities which separated from the county retained a proprietary interest in that stock and in the dividends and proceeds thereof. (Arts. 80 and 81 Mun. Code, Que.) When municipalities separate the assets and liabilities are divided on the basis of their respective valuations of taxable property, and Ascot's share would. represent its interest in the stock subscribed. In 1880 the Village of Lennoxville separated from the Township of Ascot and the respondents consented to divide the indebtedness, and to deal thenceforward separately with Lennoxville, on the basis of a division assented to by all the parties interested. They, therefore, each have a separate share and proprietary interest in the stock and funds which entitles each of them to an account of the management of the stock and of its earnings, if any, and proceeds. 3 Rolland de Villargues \"Compte\" No. 1; Bioche, Dict. de Procedure, \"Compte\" Art. 1; 4 Carr\u00e9 & Chauveau, p. 438, tit. IV.; 27 Laurent No. 495; Pothier Proc. Civ. (Bugnet Ed.), No.274; 8 De Lorimier, Code Civil, pp. 99, 114-115.\nIf the stock had been sold at a premium the appellants would have been entitled to their share of any surplus, and their remedy against respondents clearly would have been an action en redition de compte. The fact alleged that the stock sold for less than par would not relieve them of the duty of accounting; nor could they successfully defend such an action on the plea that the proceeds were insufficient to pay the debt and expenses of administration.\nThe real creditors are the debenture holders, and the debtors are the County of Compton, as presently constituted, and those municipalities which separated from it owing a joint debt to the debenture holders. The Municipal Code, arts. 79, 80, 81, 82, 83 providing for the levy and collection of the joint debts govern these municipalities, as between themselves. The municipality from which the territory has been separated is alone authorized and bound to settle with the creditors; but it does not follow that the recourse of the creditors, the debenture holders, is limited to that municipality. There is nothing to prevent the appellants from settling their own share of that joint debt with the debenture holders, and there are cases in which they might be bound to do so. Eastern Town ships Bank v. County of Compton ([2]). They, therefore, have an interest in the proper administration of the funds collected and might be held responsible for mal administration.\nThe appellants are also entitled to an account of the expenses of administration. Under C. S. L. C. ch. 25, sec. 6 sub-sec. 2 they would be liable only for such expenses as could reasonably and legitimately be attributed to the by-law. They are entitled to these accounts in a formal way, so that if necessary they may contest by debats de compte.\nH. B. Brown Q.C. for the respondent. Actions en redition de compte lie only against those who have administered the affairs of others; 3 Rolland de Villargues, vo. \"Compte,\" no. 1; 10 Pothier (ed. Bugnet) no. 274; arts. 1043, 1713 C. C. In these matters the County of Compton has merely administered its own affairs and is not liable to such an action.\nThere is no distinction between the taxes imposed under this by-law and other municipal taxes. C. S. L. C. ch. 25, s. 6. The tax imposed by a county council is levied on all the local municipal corporations of the county in accordance with the value of the taxable proderty in each. Mun. Code, Que., art. 938. The portion imposed on each local corporation constitutes a debt payable by such local corporation to the county corporation. Mun. Code, Que., arts. 939, 941, 946, 951; Simard v. Corporation of Montmorency ([3]); Corporation of Missisquoi v. Corporation of St. George de Clarence ville ([4]); Corporation of St., Guillaume v. County of Drummond ([5]). The legal position of the parties therefore is clearly that of creditor and debtor simply.\nWhen a local municipality is separated from a county, the position of one towards the other does not become changed in so far as regards the liability for taxes already imposed. There is nothing in the law to support the opinion that by such a separation the relation of creditor and debtor is converted into one of mandataire and mandant. Mun. Code, Que., arts. 78, 79, 82, 83, 84, 85, 88, 95. Cooley, Taxation, (2 ed.) p. 239, \"Taxes apportioned by Benefits.\"\nIt would certainly be anomalous if the various separated local corporations, with their subsequent sub-divisions, should each have a right to debats de compte, with appointment of practiciens, etc. as to the administration of the funds of the county under this by-law, and this before the completion of its administration.\nThe account asked for by the plaintiffs is not an account of their affairs alone, and it would be impossible for the county council to account to any one of the local municipalities for its own particular interest or share in the by-law so administered.\nThe judgment of the court was delive ed by:\nGIROUARD J. The present appeal is from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench sitting in appeal in Montreal, rendered on the 20th January, 1898, and confirming two judgments of the Superior Court (Sherbrooke), 12th January, 1897, dismissing plaintiffs' actions. They are two actions en redition de comptes brought by two local municipalities against the county corporation of which they formerly formed part, praying that the latter be condemned to account for its administration of a railway by-law, known as by-law no. 37, and in default of their doing so, to pay $10,000 and $5,000 respectively as reliquats de comptes.\nThis by-law was passed on the 14th September, 1870, under the provisions of chapter 25 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, an \" Act respect ing Municipalities taking stock in Railways and other Works \"; and by its terms authorizes the warden to take shares in the \" St. Francis, Megantic & International Railway Company,\" generally known as the \" Pope Road,\" to the amount of $225,540, and to raise the money to buy the stock by an issue of debentures to the same amount payable in 25 years.\nThe by-law was submitted to the vote of the rate payers in the various local municipalities, and approved by a majority thereof, and on the 26th December, 1870, it received the approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council.\nFrom the outset, this railway by-law has been a fruitful source of litigation between the county corporation and divers local corporations. In the first place its validity was contested by the present appellants and others, but the by-law was declared valid on the 7th January, 1876.\nPending this litigation, a bill was introduced in the legislature at Quebec (which became law 24th Dec, 1870,) separating the Town of Sherbrooke and the Townships of Oxford, Ascot and Compton from the County of Compton for municipal purposes, and forming them into the County of Sherbrooke. (34 Vict. cap. 30.)\nA special provision was inserted in the Act that\nnothing in this Act contained shall affect or shall prevent the operation of a certain by-law, &c, &c, and that if the said by-law [To wit, By-law 37] is finally declared valid by the Courts of Justice, it shall have full force and effect, &c.\nSee also art. 78 of the Municipal Code. Lennoxville was afterwards separated from the Township of Ascot as a village corporation, and Sherbrooke since its incorporation as a city, (1876), [39 Vict. cap. 50] has ceased to form part of either county corporation.\nIn consequence of this litigation, no levy of rates was attempted till 1876. As is usual in such cases in order to pay the interest on the debentures and to create a sinking fund for their redemption, a tax of five mills in the dollar had been imposed by the by-law on all the real estate in the County of Compton; hut in 1886, the county corporation sold all their shares to Sir George Stephen at 50 per cent discount, and realized $112,500 and in consequence reduced their rates to two mills.\nThe same local corporations refused to pay any assessment, and an action was brought in 1875 by the Eastern Townships Bank, ([6]), holders of 190 debentures of $1000 each for overdue interest. This action was contested by the local corporations of Ascot, Compton and others, and the validity of the by-law again raised unsuccessfully.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court gives a resum\u00e9 of the whole difficulty, and in the concluding part of the judge's note we find the following:\nThen it was submitted to the Lieutenant Governor in Council for consideration and approved; and lastly, and it is to be hoped finally, it has been brought again before this court, &\u00e7, &\u00e7.\nThis was in 1876, but the contest continues, and the Township of Ascot and the Village of Lennoxville have remained in rebellion to this by-law to the present day. History repeats itself, especially in railway matters. Ratepayers are generally very anxious to get railway facilities and they readily tell the promoters: \" Build your railway, we will take shares in it,\" but in practice they too often mean \" don't call for any money.\"\nSuits have been instituted by the respondent against the appellants and others, wherein the county is seeking to recover assessments amounting to several thou sands of dollars. In Compton v. Bury Mr. Justice Lynch condemned the Township of Bury to pay to the County of Compton $9,080.11 with interest and costs In Compton v. Oxford the sum of $3,509 was ordered to be paid. On the 4th day of May, 1898, in Compton v. Ascot the latter was condemned by Mr. Justice White to pay $6,494.81 interest and costs for rates up to the 1st January, 1892, the court reserving\nthe rights of the defendants on a final adjustment of the rates, which may be made for the years 1893, 1894, 1895 and 1896, to establish if it be so, that the said rate of two mills during the nine years subsequent to 1886, is more than sufficient to pay their just proportion of said debt and interest.\nThe appellants did not wait for this judgment to demand a revision of the rates On being sued in 1895, they sought to obtain relief by means of an action to account, taken in 1896, the object of which is well defined by Mr. Justice W\u00fcrtele in these few words:\nThey claimed they were entitled to obtain an account because they wished to ascertain their exact position. They alleged several grievances; in the first place that they were not allowed a sufficient amount of rebate for the proceeds of the sale of the stock in the railway to Sir George Stephen. They also alleged that the sinking fund had not been properly administered. They also alleged that the county council had paid large sums of money to cover up a defalcation in their accounts which had been made by their former secretary-treasurer; that the sum of twelve thousand dollars had been paid to that treasurer, and that he was not entitled to anything like that amount; that he might have been entitled under the by-law to a certain amount of salary for the work he had done in administering the by-law, but that he was not entitled to this amount, and they claimed, therefore, they had a right to obtain an account from the county council before they could be called upon to pay any amount of the tax. The defendant denied that in law they were bound to render any account to the plaintiffs for its administration of the funds collected under by-law no. 87; that they do not occupy the position of agents or trustees, but that of creditors.\nArt. 939 of the Municipal Code says:\nThe portion imposed on each local corporation constitutes a debt payable by such corporation to the county council, according to the conditions and on the terms fixed by such council.\nThe amount of such portion or debt is levied in the local municipality in the same manner as local taxes, on all the taxable property subject to such tax without its being necessary to make other by-laws or orders for that purpose.\nIn the case of refusal or neglect on the part of the local corporation to pay the portion which has been imposed upon it, such portion may be recovered from it in the manner set forth in article 951.\nThe Superior Court adopted the contentions of the defendants and dismissed the two actions with costs. This judgment was confirmed in appeal by Lacoste C.J. Boss\u00e9 and W\u00fcrtele JJ., Blanchet and Hall JJ. dissenting.\nWe entirely agree with the two courts below, and we think we cannot do better than reproduce the following remarks of Mr. Justice W\u00fcrtele in which we concur:\nThe first question is whether these municipalities possess the right to bring an action of account.\nIn the first place we must recollect that the administration with which the county council was invested with respect to the by-law, and with respect to the collecting of the funds for the purpose of paying off their debentures, has not yet terminated. There are still a great many debentures outstanding which have to be provided for, and if an action of account could be brought, it is certain it cannot be brought until the administration is terminated. They cannot pretend, if they have such a right, that they would have a right to bring on actions of account from time to time every year, or any other period. They certainly would have to wait until the administration is completed. Have they the right however, to bring that action? In the first place, the corporation of a county is composed of all the ratepayers living within that county. They are the corporators, the county council is merely the administrator, the body who administers the interests of the rate payers in the county, irrespective of the local municipalities, Then with respect to the levies in the interest of the whole county it is provided that amount shall be levied by a certain equal levy over the whole county, but that the amount due by the ratepayers in each individual municipality shall be collected and paid over to the county council by the local council administering the affairs of that municipality, and it is ordered by the Municipal Code that the amount thus payable is to be dealt with as if it was an ordinary debt, and is to be recovered by an action of debt, to be instituted by the county council against the local council.\nThe relations which exist between the two corporations are therefore, that of creditor and debtor. The county council is the creditor and the local council is the debtor for the amount of the taxes payable or leviable by the ratepayers , and even the local council has the power to levy that without passing any other by-law, to levy it under the original by-law, and they are the collectors for the amount due by the ratepayers within their limits, but does that give a right to any municipality or to any ratepayer of bringing an action of account against the county council? Would any ratepayer in any municipality, whether it be local or county, have the right to bring against the county council an action for account? Clearly not. The affairs administered by a county council are its own affairs, that is to say, the affairs of the corporators. They do not administer the affairs of another. The action of account, both by English and French law, is given against a person who administers the property of another, and who may be called upon to pay a certain amount on the accounts being stated and rendered.\nIn the present case, all the action of account asks for is that an account be rendered in order that these two municipalities may see the exact position in which they stand. They claim they have that right because they have been separated. Would any municipality which has not yet been separated from the County of Compton have that right? Clearly not. The county council administers their affairs. The affair for which they could ask for an action of account is not an affair of theirs independent of the affairs of the county. The county council only administers the affairs of its corporators, and therefore no corporator can have the right to bring an action of account against it. Because they have been separated, have they a right to bring this action, merely because they have been separated? The statute and the Code say that they shall remain in the same position quoad the by-law as they were in before the division. They have no more rights and are charged with no more obligations than if they had never been separated. It seems to the majority of the court, therefore, that th action of account does not exist; it may be a matter of inconvenience but still the municipalities interested, who wish an account, have every facility to obtain the information which they require. Under article 164 of the Municipal Code, it is provided that any mayor, or any municipal officer, or any ratepayer has the right at any time to go to the office of the county council or the local council and exact that all the books and papers of the municipal council be exhibited to him He is authorised to take extracts, and the secretary-treasurer is ordered to give him every facility in the examination of the accounts and state of the affairs of the municipality. Then, in the beginning of January of each year, the secretary-treasurer is bound to make a complete statement of all the affairs of the municipality and to render an account to the council under which he acts, either county or local, of all the money transactions that have taken place. In the event of a by-law being passed to issue debentures he is also bound to submit to the county council a clear and distinct statement of the state of the sinking fund on the first of January of each year. Therefore, every municipality, and in the present case the municipalities that remain in the County of Compton, and those detached, have every facility in order to obtain the information they require, without it being necessary to bring an action of account. They have the annual statement made by the treasurer; if they doubt the correctness of that statement, their officers and any ratepayer have the right to examine all the papers and documents of the council in order to ascertain if the statement is correct or not. We think that these local councils do not possess the right to bring an action of account, and we think if they have not that right, that all that results from their being deprived of that right is a certain amount of inconvenience in being obliged, instead of having a document furnished to them, to go to the office of the council in order to obtain for themselves the information they require.\nFor the same reasons, we are of opinion that the two appeals should be dismissed, and they are dismissed with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant, the Township of Ascot Lawrence & Morris.\nSolicitors for the appellant, the Village of Lennoxville: Hurd & Fraser.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Brown & Macdonald.\n[1] 3 Rev de Jur. 557.\n[2] 7 R.

A statement of the case will be found in the judgment reported.\nBuchan and R. C. Smith for the appellant. Agreements made by a company to the effect of discharging shareholders from responsibility as regards its creditors are null and a fraud against both the creditors and other shareholders.

Evans ([2]); In re Agriculturist Cattle Ins. Co., Stanhope's Case ([3]). See the, \"Winding-up Act,\" secs. 41-49. The shareholder's liability for the unpaid balances on shares subscribed constitutes an asset of a company in liquidation, and such a liability brings the person liable within the meaning of the word \"contributory.\" In re Accidental and Marine Ins. Corp., Bridger's Case ([4]); In re Blakely Ordnance Co., Creykes's Case ([5]).\nThe respondent cannot be permitted to usurp the functions of the Attorney General as to forfeiture of charter or to plead irregularities in the company's organization in order to avoid his liabilities as a shareholder.\nThe appellant submits that the respondent was rightly placed on the list of contributories, because the pretended cancellation of his subscription was a release to the detriment of creditors, was invalid, ultra vires, and did not discharge the respondent from his obligation as a shareholder; that even if the shares had been validly forfeited, he should still be placed on the list of contributories subject to the extent of his liability being determined when an order for payment is applied for. J. L. Morris Q.C. and B\u00e9\u00efque Q.C. for the respondent. The respondent ceased to be a shareholder when his shares were declared forfeited and taken over by the company. R. S. C. ch. 119, sec. 41.\nThe question is: Was the respondent liable as a contributor to the assets of the company at the time the winding up order was granted? There is no. fraud or collusion complained of here and section 44 of the \"Winding-up Act\" does not apply to respondent as he is not and was not a shareholder or member of the company when the company was put into liquidation. Sec. 45 applies only to shareholders who have transferred their shares under circumstances which by law do not free them from liability in respect thereof.\nHe could only have been held if he had retained his shares. The liquidator recognizes this and simply alleges that he is a shareholder. This being disproved his petition to fix respondent as a contributory, solely upon that ground, was rightly dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench.\nSec. 41 of the Companies Act gives a right of action only to certain creditors of the company and not to the liquidator and those creditors must first exhaust their remedies against the company under sec. 55.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The Dominion Cold Storage Company was incorporated on the 28th of September, 1895, by Letters Patent issued under the provisions of \"The Companies Act\" (Revised Statutes of Canada, chapter 119). In January, 1897, the company had become insolvent and a winding-up order was made against it, the appellant William J. Common being appointed liquidator. On the 14th of June, 1897, he petitioned the Superior Court under the provisions of \"The Winding-up Act\" to settle the list of contributories, attaching to his petition a schedule in which appeared the names of all the persons whom he sought to hold liable as such contributories. In this list was the name of the present respondent, alleged to be liable in respect to fifty shares, the par value of which was five thousand dollars, and upon which five hundred dollars was credited.\nThe respondent, McArthur, contested his liability upon several grounds, the substantial ones being: First, that the Letters Patent incorporating the company had been obtained by false representations, and that the company had therefore never become legally organized; and secondly:\nThat on the second of October, 1895, the respondent wrote to said company stating that he withdrew his subscription, and requiring it to remove his name entirely from their books, and from that date he supposed his subscription was cancelled and withdrawn; that the formal minute of the said company cancelling his subscription was only entered upon their books on the sixteenth of November last (1896), but it should date back to and have effect from the second of October, 1895.\nThe first ground was disposed of before the Superior Court, it having been there held, and we think rightly, that it is not within the power of a shareholder, at all events after the winding-up order has been made, to set up defects and illegalities in the organization of a company incorporated under \"The Companies Act,\" and that such a ground only can be taken by direct proceedings at the instance of the Attorney General. So that when the case came before us it was assumed that up to the second of October, 1895, he had been a shareholder of the company and then liable as a contributory for the amount unpaid on his subscribed shares. The only question now before us is whether under the circumstances presented in the evidence he had subsequently been released from that admitted liability.\nThe facts are undisputed. One Johnston was the principal shareholder and was the managing director of the company from the time of its organization until its collapse. To this gentleman Mr. McArthur, on the second of October, 1895, wrote the following letter:\nDEAR MR. JOHNSTON,\u2014Yesterday before I was out of bed I was served with a demand of assignment which was delivered in an uncovered form and caused no little excitement at No. 52. Then before 11 a.m., I had telephones from both \"Bradstreets\" and Dun & Co., and from Elliott an inquiry about 1 p.m. We were fortunate enough to keep it out of the papers.\nWhen we called on Taylor he had not the money, and I had to give a cheque for $1,250, which prevented me from paying my clerks and travellers their salaries for the first time since I have been in business. In fact, had I not had this in bank for salaries, I don't know what we would have done. On inquiry this a.m., Mr. Gilman replied, \"not sufficient funds in bank,\" and I had to send up our Mr. Brown to get it righted. To-day I was sent for by \"Molsons,\" and after answering quite a lot of questions, I was informed that I must give up indorsing or signing notes for anything outside of the regular-wall paper business or they would not have my account. So you see you must relieve me of all responsibility and take me off the \"Cold Storage\" altogether. I regret this very much, but at the same time cannot help feeling that both you and Mr. Taylor are very much to blame for it. Nothing else can be expected from doing business in such a hap-hazard way.\nIt is bad enough for yourselves, but to have me injured who has nothing to do with it is too bad. Taylor has the two notes still on hand which had better be returned.\nNo reply having been received on the 4th of November he wrote another letter calling attention to the previous one. On the 12th of November he received the following reply:\nYour letter of the 4th instant has remained unanswered and acknowledged until this date owing to my absence from the city till this morning. I now hasten to advise that, as a director, your name will not appear after to-day, but as a stockholder it will of necessity have to remain the allotment having been made. I shall take the opportunity of seeing you before many days, and am glad to learn from Mr. McGregor that your health is improving.\nIt is in evidence that the company never made any demand upon the respondent for any portion of his unpaid stock. There is no evidence that any call was made upon any of the shareholders. It is certain, however that no call was ever made upon him. But on the 16th of November, 1896, the directors passed the following resolution:\nResolved: That whereas Colin McArthur, of Montreal, appears as a shareholder upon the hooks of the company for fifty shares of the stock of the said company of the par value of five thousand dollars (5,000.00) and whereas the said McArthur has failed and refused after due notice, to meet the two calls, amounting to thirty per cent made on said stock, and has refused to acknowledge any liability on the same therefore it was resolved to declare said shares forfeited under the powers provided for by by-law ten of the company, and that said McArthur should be considered to have withdrawn from the said company and to have forfeited all interest in said shares.\nA perusal of the evidence leads to the inevitable conclusion that this resolution was passed at the instance of Johnston, not for the purpose of enabling the company to realize upon the stock as forfeited stock, but solely to release McArthur from his liability as a shareholder of the company in accordance with his written request made the year previously. The resolution was passed at a time when the company was hopelessly insolvent to the knowledge of the directors, and its only object could have been as I have stated. In the pleadings the respondent did not rely upon this resolution as a forfeiture of his shares but rather as an acceptance by the company of his surrender of them He did not in his pleadings set out 'his non-liability by reason of the directors having declared them forfeited.\nBut in the present case it is immaterial whether the transaction in question be considered as a surrender or a forfeiture, inasmuch as neither the one nor the other would have the effect of releasing him from his liabiiity. It is elementary law that a shareholder cannot, without statutory authority, surrender his shares to a company and thereby get rid of his liability as a shareholder. It is ultra vires of a company to so traffic in its own stock, unless its instrument of incorporation gives it the power, and it is not pretended that any such power existed here.\nThe only question is as to the effect of the alleged forfeiture. It is I think quite clear that there was in fact no forfeiture in the present case. The resolution was a collusive one, passed, not for the benefit of the company or its creditors, not for the purpose of enabling the directors to realise upon the forfeited stock, but for the purpose of conferring a benefit upon their friend McArthur. It was in fact the same as if the directors had taken from the treasury of the company the four thousand five hundred dollars due and had made a present of it to him.\nThe power of forfeiture given by the statute to the directors is given not to be exercised for the benefit of the shareholders, but for the benefit of the company and its creditors. If a resolution like the one here had the effect of releasing McArthur from liability, similar resolutions might have been passed releasing all the other shareholders from liability, thereby destroying the capital of the company and absolutely defeating the claims of creditors. To contend for the legality of transactions that might lead to such consequences is in my view absurd.\nReference need only be made to the leading case of Spackman v. Evans ([6]) where it was held in effect that the power of forfeiture for non-payment of calls is a power that is intended to be exercised only when the circumstances of the shareholder render its exercise expedient in the interests of the company. It is not a power to be exercised for the benefit of the share holder. The duty of the directors when a call is made is to compel every shareholder to pay to the company the amount due from him in respect of that call, and it is only when payment cannot be obtained that the power of forfeiture is to be resorted to. The power must be exercised bon\u00e2 fide for the good of the company, not to relieve a shareholder from liability.\nUpon the authority of this case, we think that Mr. McArthur never ceased to be a shareholder of the company, and therefore, that he was properly placed upon the list of contributories.\nIf this view be correct we are not now called upon to express any opinion as to the liability of a person whose shares have been legally forfeited to be placed upon the list of contributories in respect of those shares.\nHow a person contingently liable to contribute to the debts of a company under winding-up proceedings is to be dealt with in the setting of [the list of contributories is a question which, so far as this court is concerned, remains open.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

If kept longer than one month the rate to be forty dollars per day. K. to furnish tug, crew, provisions, oil, etc., and everything necessary except coal and pilots above Montreal. The tug to leave next morning's tide, and to be discharged in Quebec.\nThe company took possession of the tug, put her in charge of their pilot (who assumed the control, employment and navigation of the vessel), and used the tug for their purposes until 8th July, 1895 when while still in their possession, the pilot took her, in the day time into waters at the foot of the Cornwall Rapids, in the River St. Lawrence, where she struck against some submerged hard substance and sunk. She was raised a few days afterwards, towed to port and placed in dock for repairs at Montreal. The orders were to make the necessary repairs, to put the vessel in the same condition as she was immediately before the accident and on 30th July, K. was notified that the repairs were completed, that the tug would be put out of dock the following day and he was requested to receive the tug at Montreal. K. answered that the discharge was to be made at Quebec, that she was not in as good condition as when leased and requested the company to join in a survey, which, however, they declined to do. The survey was made by a naval architect who reported that, in addition to the repairs already made, it would cost $2,494.90 to restore the vessel to the same condition as when leased, to the company. On 1st August, K. took possession of the tug under protest and brought the action for the amount of this estimate in addition to the rent accrued with fees for survey and protest. The company admitted the rent due and tendered that portion of the claim into court. The Superior Court rendered judgment for the amount of the tender, dismissing the action as to the remainder of the claim on the ground that K. had been sufficiently compensated by the repairs which had been made by the charterers. The Courts of Review and the Queen's Bench increased the verdict to the full sum claimed $4909.90, by adding the amount of the surveyor's estimate and the fees. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, Sedgewick and Girouard JJ. dissenting, that the contract between the parties was a contract of lease: that the taking of the vessel, in the day-time, into the waters where she struck was 'prim\u00e2 facie evidence of negligence on the part of the company, and that as the company did not adduce evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption of fault existing against them they were responsible under the Civil Code of Lower Canada for the damages caused to the vessel during the time she was controlled and used by them.\nHeld, further, that the proper estimate of damages under the circumstances is the cost of the repairs which should be assumed to be the measure of depreciation in value occasioned by the accident, and that no substantial error arose from regarding the condition and value of the vessel at the commencement of the lease as that in which she ought to have been discharged.\nGarboard J. was of opinion that the Superior Court judgment should be restored\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), affirming the decision of the Superior Court, sitting in Review, at Quebec, by which the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec, at the trial, had been reversed with costs.\nThe appellant being engaged in the business of rafting timber and conveying it to Quebec, hired the steam tug\" \" Beaver \" from the respondent, the agreement between the parties being embodied in the following memorandum:\nQUEBEC, CAN., MAY 22nd, 1895.\n\"It is agreed between the undersigned, that Mr. J John C. Kaine charters the tug ' Beaver ' to the \" Collins Bay Rafting and Forwarding Company for \" not less than one month from date at the rate of forty \" five dollars ($45) per day of twenty-four hours.\"\n\" Should the tug be kept longer than one month, \" the rate per day for the balance of the period to be \" forty dollars ($40).\"\nJohn C.

The tug to leave here to-morrow morning's \" tide and to be discharged here on expiration of agreement.\n\"Signed on the day written above.\"\n\"JOHN C. KAINE,\"\n\"N. FLOOD,\n\"Agent for Collins Bay Rafting Co.\"\nThe company took possession of the tug, put her in charge of their pilot, who assumed the control, employment and navigation of the vessel, and used her for its purposes until 8th July, 1895, when, while still in its possession, the pilot took her in the day-time into waters at the foot of the Cornwall Rapids in the River St. Lawrence where she struck against some submerged hard substance and sunk. She was raised a few days afterwards, towed to port and placed in dock for repairs at Montreal. The orders given by the company were to make the necessary repairs to put the vessel in the same condition as she was before the accident, and on 30th July, K. was notified that the repairs were completed, that the tug would be pat out of dock the following day and he was requested to receive-the tug at Montreal. K. answered that the discharge was to be made at Quebec, that she was not in as good condition as when leased and requested the company to join in a survey which however was declined. The survey was made by a naval architect who reported that, in addition to the repairs already made, it would cost $2494.90 to restore the vessel to the same condition as when leased to the company. On 1st August, K. took possession of the tug under pro test and brought the action for the amount of this estimate in addition to the rent accrued with fees for survey and protest. The company admitted the rent due and tendered that portion of the claim into court\nThe Superior Court at the trial rendered judgment for the amount of the tender, dismissing the action as to the remainder of the claim on the ground that k. had been sufficiently compensated by the repairs which had been made by the charterers. The Court of Review increased the verdict to the full sum claimed, $4,909.90, by adding the amount of the surveyor's estimate and the fees. On appeal this latter judgment was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench.\nThe appellant asked to have the judgment appealed from reversed, and that the judgment by the Superior Court at the trial should be restored.\nFitzpatrick Q. C. (Solicitor General for Canada), and Walkem Q.C. for the appellant. This was not a demise but an agreement to give the vessel's services for one month in the first place and thereafter from day to day at a certain rate per day, the possession and management of the vessel remaining with the respondent. The pilot to be part of the crew and the servant of the respondent, the appellants paying for his services as well as for the coal. Thompson v. Fowler ([1]); The Manchester Trust v. Furness ([2]); The Bees wing'' ([3]); Abbott on Shipping, pp. 61-69. Respondent had a right to choose his own pilot if he wished to do so. The captain had supreme command and the pilot was under his jurisdiction. Abbott on Ship ping, pp. 191-192.\nKaine agreed to furnish the tug, crew, provisions, &c as the consideration of the payment to be made to him and when the vessel sank he ceased to fulfil this agreement and cannot claim compensation after that time. The clause providing that the vessel should be discharged in Quebec, on the expiration of the agreement, does not mean an undertaking or warranty to deliver the vessel but rather to pay for her services until she was sent back to Quebec. Thus, the charterer would have to pay for the time the vessel would reasonably take to reach Quebec, after cessation of employment. When the vessel sank the charterers were under no obligation to raise her, and for doing so and bringing her to the dock in Montreal after notice of their intention to do so, they would be entitled to salvage under the admiralty law.\nThe provisions of the Code, art. 1627, are not applicable. If there was no negligence on the part of the appellants, there would be no responsibility on their part in this action except for the charter money. In the lease of a vessel the risks are incidental to owner ship and user, the modes of user being by leasing or chartering. The accident was one of the ordinary incidents of the navigation in which the vessel was employed, one of peculiar risk and danger to the know ledge of the respondent. There was no evidence of negligence on the part of the pilot who was a competent careful man knew the river well and had been engaged in the business for many years. At the place of the accident there were thirty or forty feet of water.\nThe unfortunate result of the accident was due to the unseaworthy condition of the boat; the stern post was rotten, the heads of the spikes corroded, the planks at the stern loose. A vessel in our waters, particularly in the lakes and rivers, is expected to be able to stand concussion with the bottom. It is an every day experience that vessels touch in the rapids or in the river and any vessel in a seaworthy condition should have stood the shock without injury. See Abbott on Shipping, (13 ed.), pp. 384-385. The plaintiff should not recover damages sustained in consequence of unseaworthiness. The claim was covered by the amount paid into court, and the Superior Court found that the appellant had done all repairs necessary to put the tug in the same condition as she was before the accident.\nThe result of the judgments of the Court of Review and Appeal is to compel the restoration of the vessel to the condition in which she was when she left dock in Quebec in May 1895 and the accident happened in July, up to which time the boat was constantly in use. No allowance is made for wear and tear during that period. Yet the judgment appealed from compels the appellant to renew the boat.\nThe respondent offered no evidence on which a correct estimate of the damages could be based and the conduct of the respondent shows that he was satisfied with the repairs being done. The instructions were \" to examine the boat carefully and make her as good as before the accident,\" and these directions were fulfilled These instructions must have been known to the respondent and his captain who were both about when the repairs were being made. After the repairs were made the respondent used the vessel in his business both above and below Quebec and up to the time of the trial of the action no further repairs had been made upon her.\nThe appellant\u2019s conduct in dealing with the vessel should not prejudice the defense nor operate as an admission of liability. The company acted reasonably and prudently and for the benefit of all parties. If not at fault it would be entitled to salvage for raising the vessel, and, as wrecking is part of the company's business, raising the vessel and binging her to Montreal was a safe adventure. It certainly would not have been wise to leave the boat at the bottom of the river at the foot of the rapids while the parties were fighting out a dispute as to liability for the accident. The repairs were necessary to float the vessel. Everything was done after a repudiation of liability and a termination by the defendant of the contract and was so done without prejudice.\nv\u00bb also refer to Kopiloff v. Wilson ([4]); Steele v state Line Steamship Co. ([5]); and Murphy v. Labb\u00e9 ([6]).\nLanguedoc Q.C and Stuart Q.C. for the respondent.

Marsden on Collisions p. 110. The Beaver must have been very seriously damaged by straining and \" hogging\" for according to the pilot's evidence, he ran her ashore twice; the first time there were 5 feet of water forward and 18 feet aft and the second time she had 6 feet forward and 9\u00bd feet aft, which must of course have strained the vessel very much. The straining is established by the evidence; see The Clarence ([15]). The sufferer is entitled to restituiio in integrum. There is no difference between the admiralty and common law rules as to what damages are recoverable. See foot note Parsons Maritime Law, vol. 2, p. 215, and Giles v. Eagle Ins. Go. ([16]). It is a principle of Maritime Law that the wrong doer cannot claim salvage for services rendered to the ship, etc. Marsden, Collisions, p. 46. In any case the contract was to deliver the vessel at Quebec and respondent should have tendered a sufficient sum to cover the expenses of bringing her to Quebec, as well as the charter money for the time occupied in doing so, which was never offered.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nKING J. As to whether or not there was a demise of the vessel, the question in such cases is not one of title but of control. Has the owner parted during the period of the charter party with the entire possession and control? Baumvoll Manufactur von Scheibler v. Gilchrest & Co. ([17]); Steel v. Lester ([18]).\nThe evidence of the master shows that the charterer controlled the employment and navigation of the vessel. \" Macdonald, the charterers pilot) said 'Go here, go there,' and I took his orders * * I did nothing without he gave me his orders.\"\nIn this state of things the charterer is under the Code responsible for injuries and loss which happen to the demised vessel during his enjoyment of it unless he proves that he is without fault.\nApart from the provision of the Code, the fact that Macdonald personally directed the movements of the vessel, and took her in the day time into waters where she struck against a hard substance, is prim\u00e2 facie evidence of negligence. The theory that she may have struck upon a floating log sunken at one end is wholly conjectural and has not been accepted by any of the courssueiow.\nThen as to the amount of damages. The Superior Court held that this had been fully satisfied by the repairs made by the charterers, but the Courts of Review and Queen's Bench deemed that a further sum of $2,494 was needed to indemnify the plaintiff.\nThe charterers having undertaken to restore the vessel to the condition she was in just prior to the accident, the cost of repairs of damage occasioned by the accident is assumed by both parties to be the mea sure of depreciation in value.\nThe rule in the admiralty course is that the owner of a vessel wrongfully injured by collision is entitled to have the damage occasioned by the wrongful act fully and completely repaired without deduction on account of the substitution of new for old material\nIt is unfortunate that the appellants wholly ignored the request of the owner for a joint examination on the completion of the charterer's repairs in Cantin's dock. The report and conclusions of Auger, the per son nominated by the owner, show clearly that the repairs made by the charterer in Cantin's dock were but partial This is confirmed by Cantin's evidence who says that his orders did not require him to make full repairs.\nBut there is further a striking confirmation of Auger's report as to the condition of the vessel contained in the testimony of Mr. Leslie, the charterers manager under whom the repairs at Cantin's were made.\nQ. Will you look at it (Auger's report) now and go over it and make any remarks you think necessary, and say if you agree with that or not. (Witness takes communication of the paper.) Do you agree with the statements in the report? A. I deny that the state of things described in Mr. Aiger's report was occasioned by the accident. He refers to the butts being opened and filled with pine. That certainly could not have been occasioze by the accident.\nQ. Do you deny the statements in the report itself?\nA. No. What I deny is that this state of things described in the report was occasioned by the accident.\nIt is therefore to he taken as proved that the physical appearance and. condition of the vessel after the repairs put on her by the charterer were as described by Auger in his report.\nThen the question is: Was the damaged condition of the vessel occasioned by the accident? If it was not or to the extent to which it was not, the wrong doer is not under obligation to pay for or make good such damage. This is very clear.\nMr. Leslie in denying that the vessel's condition was the result of the accident specifies but one particular, viz., the but filled with pieces of pine. Now obvious that the accident could not have the effect of filling butts with pieces of pine, and it is not to be supposed that Auger intended to say otherwise.\nFollowing the usual form of such reports, the first part of it gives the physical appearanee of the vessel, and then follow the proposed repairs and estimates of cost.\nThat the paragraph of the report dealing with the vessels appearance is not a catalogue of things to be remedied is manifest from the fact that it notes, among other things, the new work done by the charterer on the vessel at Cantin's. In the same way reference is made to the butts filled with white pine, as a fact of appearance in connection with the strains of planking sprung in on both sides of the keel.\nIn the recommendations for repairs there is nothing to show that the planks filled with pine at the butts are to be dealt with in any way in consequence of their being so filled, certainly nothing in terms, and nothing impliedly except so far as repairs of the damage indicated by the springing of the planking would incidentally remedy the other at the same time.\nThere is therefore nothing in what is adduced by Mr. Leslie to show that Auoer's estimate of cost covered damage not occasioned by the accident.\nauger's testimony stands as that of a man of proved experience and capacity who has been credited by the Courts of Review and Queen's Bench as a trustworthy witness. In these circumstances the appeal should be dismissed. The amount of ordinary wear and tear in the few weeks elapsing between the beginning of the charter and the date of the accident would be so trifling that no substantial error arose from regarding the condition and value of the vessel at the earlier instead of the later period.\nFor these reasons the appeal should be dismissed and with costs.\nSedge wick J. dissented.\nGirouard J. (dissenting) The respondent chareered the tug \" Beaver\" to the appellants by a written contract in the following words:\nQuebEc, May 22, 1895.\nIt is agreed between the undersigned that Mr. Kaine charters the tug Beaver for not less than one month from date, at forty-five dollars ($45) per day of twenty-four hours. If kept longer than a month the rate to be forty dollars per day.\nMr Kaine to furnish tug crew, provisions, oil. etc. and everything necessary except coal and pilots abode Montreal. The tug to leave here tomorrow morning's tide, the tug to be discharged in Quebec.\nJ. C. Kaine,\nN. Flood,\nAgent for Collins Bay Rafting Co.\nThe appellants took possession of the tug in due time, and at the place indicated, and put her under the charge of their pilot, Capt. Macdonald, and used the same until the 8th of July, 1895 when, in their possession she was sunk in the St. Lawrence River, at the foot of the Cornwall Rapids.\nOn or about the 13th of July, 1895, the appellants, having raised the said tug towed her down to the port of Montreal and placed her in Cantin's dock for repairs. These were made and competed on the 1st August, and paid for by the company to the amount of $664.89, exclusive of the expenses of raising the boat and transportation to Cantin's dock, amounting to the further sum of $1,201.69.\nOn the 30th July, 1895, the respondent was notified that the repairs were completed, and that the tug would be put out of dock the following day, and was requested to receive the same in Montreal.\nThe respondent answered that the boat was to be discharged in Quebec, and moreover that she was not in as good condition as when leased, and requested the appellants to be present at a survey to be held in Cantin's dock, at 11 o'clock of the 1st August in which survey the appellants declined to take part.\nThe survey was made by one Auger, ship carpenter and naval architect of Quebec, who reported that the cost of repairing the tug, in addition to the repairs already made by Cantin, would amount to the sum of $2494.90. The survey was made on the 1st of August, but was written out and signed a day or two later on and reads as follows:\nMONTREAL, Cantin's Dry Dock 11 a.m.\nOn examination I found the lower piece of stem made new. Stern post, after end keel, two after garboards and the plank above made new. The keel bruised at several places, sixty-five feet from stern post and six feet from keel five straiks of planking sprung in on both sides. The open butts of planking filled with white pine. The knee on the starboard forward wheel beam started. The stringer between wheel beam on that side broken, has been strengthened by a piece of oak. The butts of the main deck open at covering board, windlass, butts, mooring butts and hatch coaming. The main deck joiner work started and moved forward The pilot house the cover of steam drum, casing of engine frame, two posts and mast started. The main keelson broken at cylinder. The butts of clamps and ceiling open. Beams and knees at wake of boiler started. The rods of two posts made to fit by seven-eighth washers. The after end of hull twisted to starboard. The boat was sighted and found to have sagged when afloat about eight inches from half-past three to five o'clock.\nI recommend the boat to be placed on dry dock. The main broken niece of keelson replaced the balance of the centre line to be fastened with seven-eighth iron, one bolt in each frame clinched on rings. The boiler to belied and replaced, all her connections made good. Two keelsons of elm about 110 feet, 11 x 12 to be fitted on both sides secured with one bolt of seven-eighth in each frame clinched on rings. The scarf\u2019s to be six feet bolted with seven bolts of three-fourth iron. Two elm straiks of arches to be bent on both sides about 110 feet, 5 x 10, secured with three-fourth iron bolts in each timber. Seven straiks of planking with two sheer straiks to be fastened with five eighth screw bolts one in each frame. The started beams and hanging knees to be secured. Deck to be respired and caulked joiner work to be secured and retailed.\nI recommend the aboee repairs to be done to put her in the same condition as when the boat came out from floating dock in the monk, of April, 1895.\nI estimate the materials and labour for those repairs to cost two thousand four hundred and ninety-four dollars and ninety cents-($2,494.90).\nELZ\u00e9AR AUGER,\nNaval Architect.\nOn the 1st of August the respondent took possession of the boat in Montreal under protest, and by an action taken on the 31st August, 1895 claims this amount in addition to the rents accrued to the day of delivery of the boat and $30 for the surveyor and notary's fees, altogether $4,9099.00.\nThe appellants pleaded that the contract was not one of lease and that, even if it was the accident was not the result of any fault on their part, but was purely accidental and caused by the dangers of navigation and the unseaworthy condition of the boat. They, however, tendered and deposited in court all the rents due to the 4th August, namely, $2,385, covering the whole time required to reach Quebec, reserving their recourse for the recovery of the salvage and the repairs at Cantin's dock, a reservation which was not made when the first offer was made through Flood.\nThe Superior Court (Caron J.) maintained this tender with costs of contestation, and the appellants were condemned to pay $2,385, with interest from the date of service of process and costs of suit incurred down to the filing of the plea.\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'il parait par Ia preuve de la D\u00e9fenderesse a fait toutes les r\u00e9parations n\u00e9cesaires pour remettre le dit remarqueur tel qu'il \u00e9tait avant l'accident, ce qui lui a co\u00fbt\u00e9 six cent soixante-quatre piastres et quatre-vingt-neufcenss et qu'elle l'a rdmen\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 ses frais etc.\nIn Review this judgment was modified, and the appellants were condemned to pay also the amount of the survey, $2,494.90, and the fees of the surveyor and costs of notarial protest, $30, altogether $4,909.90, Mr. Justice Routhier dissenting:\nConsidering that in this respect the said judgment errs inasmuhh as it is satisfactorily proved by the survey and the testimony of the surveyor (Auger) that it will require a further expenditure of two thousand four hundred and ninety-four dollars and ninety cents to restore the said tug;\nConsidering the defendants were duly notified to be present at the said survey but absented themselves, and have adduced no evidence whatever to contradict its conclusions or put in question its accuracy.\nIn appeal this judgment was unanimously confirmed.\nNone of the courts pronounced upon the plea of un seaworthiness; but the three courts held that the contract was one of lease and that the appellants were liable for the damage to the tug under art. 1627 of the Civil Code, unless they proved they were not in fault, and we agree in this proposition of law. The point at issue is as to the liability of the appellants for the amount of the survey made by Auger, namely, $2,494.90. Is it proved that it was necessary to place the vessel in the condition she was before the accident? Was she seaworthy?\nThe case was heard before the Superior Court at enqu\u00eate and merits. We have no notes of Mr. Justice Caron, but in his text judgment he has entirely ignored the survey and testimony of the surveyor in its support.\nThe trial judge was sitting as a jury, and unless manifestly wrong it seems to me that a Court of Appeal, whether sitting in review or elsewhere, which did not see the witnesses, should not disturb his findings of facts S\u00e9n\u00e9sac v. Central Vermont Railway Co ([19]); Cossetle v Dun ([20]); Gingras v. D\u00e9silets ([21]); Levi v. Reed ([22]). I find in the evidence ample proof that they were right.\nI have given this case a good deal of time. I knew that upon a question of fact. the findings of two courts go very far before this court. I therefore did my best to reconcile myself to the judgment appealed from, and must confess that I cannot do so.\nI believe that too much importance has been attached to the survey of Auger. The courts below took the view that his evidence is not contradicted. But is it conclusive? That is the least we should expect in a case like this, where he proceeded by default, accompanied only by the respondent and his employees. True he certifies, in his unsworn report, that the repairs he recommended to be made were necessary to put the boat in the same condition as when she came out in April, 1895, from Russell floating dock, which was under his superintendence. But when in the witness box, he is forced to admit that he made no examination of the boat in the Russell dock, or elsewhere, before he made the survey:\nQ. Avez-vous vu les morceaux qui out \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9s? R.\u2014Non, monsieur, parce que je n'ai pas fait un examen dans le dock, quand il \u00e9tait dans notre dock. On a rien que chevill\u00e9. Je naavais pas ordre de faire \u00e7a non plus.\nFinally he swears that the boat, as repaired by Cantin was not fit for towing below Quebec:\nQ. A moins d'y faire des reparations quevous avez recommand\u00e9es dans votre rapportt R.\u2014Non.\nThe truth is that during the fall of 1895 the tug made several trips in the Grulf, as far as Father Point, and was used, without any repairs whatever, in the towing business The whole of the following navigation season, till the 7th November, 1896, when the trial took place. We do not know what has happened since.\nIt seems to me that what Auger meant was to report not what was necessary to repair the damage caused by the accident, but what was necessary to put her in good condition, and he says so in express terms:\nQ. Vous avez recommand\u00e9 dans ce survey l\u00e0 ce qu'il fallait pour mettre ce vaisseau l\u00e0 en bon \u00e9taiit? R.\u2014Oui.\nQ. Enti\u00e8rement en bon \u00e9tat de reparation? R.\u2014Oui.\nIt is true that in answer to a leading question immediately following:\nVoulez-vus dire, pour le mettre dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tat qu'il \u00e9tait avant qu'il monte \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al et lorsqu'il est sorti de votre dock \u00e0 la fin de mai?\nHe immediately answers \" Oui, \u00e0 penpr\u00e8s.\"\nWhat is the value of this answer, in face of his statement that he did not examine the boat when in Russell's dock?\nThe same intelligence results from the testimony of Leslie who although not in a position to deny that the repairs recommended by Auger were not necessary, swears that they were not occasioned by the accident.\nHe says:\nI deny that the state of things described in Mr. Auger's report\u2014plaintiff's exhibit \" C \" was occasioned by the accident. He reefs to the butts being opened and filled with pine. That certainly could not have been occasioned by the accident.\nQ. Do you deny the statements in the report itself?\nA. No; what 1 deny is that this state of things described in the report was occasioned by the accident.\nIt must be borne in mind that the appellants were not bound to build a new boat. In collision cases, it has been held that the wrongdoer is not expected to replace decayed timbers which had to be renewed to make the injured vessel seaworthy, this damage being caused not by the accident, but by the old age of the vessel and this rule was enforced even when it is proved that the decayed parts, if undisturbed, would have lasted for some years. The Princess ([23]).\nThe \" Beaver \" was first built in 1858 for service in the construction of the Victoria Bridge. She was re built in 1873, and re-registered that year under the same name but, as stated in the certificate of registry, with the old engine. She was again rebuilt in 1884, and this time new boilers were put in. Respondent swears that he spent $5,000 or $6,000 in this recon strutting, but if his memory is as reliable as when he speaks of the repairs at Russell's dock as amounting to $400 or $500, whereas in fact they came to only $298, we must accept the figures of the respondent as exaggerated, and suppose that $3,000 or $4,000 were likely the correct ones. Whether they were or not, the respondent admits that the hull built in 1813 was of no value in 1884, and had to be renewed. The accident at the foot of the Cornwall Rapids happened just eleven years after the hull was rebuilt in 1884. No repairs had been made to the boat from that year to the spring of 1895, except small repairs, \" not very large,\" remarks the respondent in his evidence, \"just enough to keep her up.\" And the repairs in the spring of 1895 came only to $298, including $80 for docking charges. And in face of this indisputable fact, the respondent wishes us to believe that, after this third period of her existence, the hull of the boat was in good condition. The evidence shows that the vessel was a rotten one, unseaworthy, that is, unfit for the service for which she was chartered. The evidence adduced is conclusive that the tug was rotten in her stern which struck the rock or log, and it may reasonably be inferred that the rest of her hull considering her age, was in the same decayed condition; but whether it was so or not, we have the clearest proof that in her stern at least she was unseaworthy, and to the mind it matters very little whether in this respect the appellants repaired the damage or not; the fact remains undisputed that she was unseaworthy, that is, not staunch, to use the expression of art. 2423 of our Code. The fact that they did not insist Don their right in so far as the repairs to the stern of the boat were concerned does not take it away with regard to the remaining portions of the vessel. Consequently the appellants are not responsible for the damage, unless they exposed the vessel to extraordinary perils.\nThe learned Chief Justice of the Superior Court (Sir L. N. Casault), says that Capt. Macdonald directed the vessel to a dangerous spot of the river, but this is stated by only one witness, one Bergeron, the engineer of the \" Beaver,\" who is not only contradicted by Macdonald, but is only reporting what the wheelman, M\u00e9thot, told him, although not examined. Under article 1612 of the Civil Code, the lessor is obliged to maintain the thing leased in a fit condition for the use for which it has been leased; the thing must be delivered in good state of repair in all respects,. art. 1613; the lessor is even obliged to warrant the lessee against all defects and faults in the thing leased, which prevent or diminish its use, whether known to the lessor or not. Art. 1614. If the thing leased be a vessel art. 2423 provides that the lessor is obliged to provide a vessel tight and staunch, and to keep her in that condition till the end of the service. Art. 2413 provides that a lease or contract of anreightment of a vessel and the obligation of the parties under the same, is subject to the rules relating to carriers contained in the title of lease and hire when these are not inconsistent; and art. 1675, respecting carriers, says they are liable for the loss or damage of things entrusted to them unless they can prove that such loss or damage was caused by a fortuitous event or irresistible force, or has arisen from a defect in the thing itself.\nSeaworthiness implies that the hull is not only tight but sound staunch and strong, that is sufficiently strong to stand the ordinary risks of her undertaking.

Hooper ([28]); Douglas v. Scougall ([29]); see also decisions collected in 7 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law (2 ed.) pages 211 and following; Valin Ord. de la Marine 1681 liv. 3 tit. 3, art. 12. Pothier \"Charte Partie,\" n. 30, 68. In Douglas v. Scougall (6), a certificate of seaworthinsss had been issued by a ship carpenter who had repaired the ship immediately before the voyage began, but without making any thorough inspection. The ship sailed, and at the out set appeared to have been for two or three days in a violent storm. In the protest, the master stated that the sea sprung the boltsprit and wrought the stem entirely loose at the same time washed the boats out of the chocks, the ship making three feet of water per hour, and in consequence the master had to look for a place of refuge. In an action by the owners to recover from the insurers \u00a31,420, cost of repairing the ship, it was proved she was an old boat and materially decayed. The action was maintained by the trial judge but on appeal to the House of Lords this judgment was reversed. Lord Eldon said:\nThe ship sails, and appears to have been for two or three days in a violent storm. If so damaged as that the damage might be fairly considered as the effect of the storm that is one view of the case. But if damaged in such a manner as in common probability she would not be, if she had been sea-worthy when she sailed on the voyage, the implied warranty is not observed.\nOn the ship coming into port she was surveyed by Scott and Steele and, whatever Scott might say in 1812, it is clear that he and Steele, applying particular assertions to particular facts, upon this survey, stated that part of the timbers were decayed and that the iron work, in general, was very much decayed and wrought loose * *\nHaving considered the whole of this evidence I never was more clear about anything than that it is proved to be perfectly manifest, and proved to my entire satisfaction, that this vessel was not sea worthy for the voyage when she sailed, whatever might then have been the opinion of the owners and carpenters who repaired her.\nSeaworthiness is not a fixed inflexible quantity; it is a question of fact which must be decided according to the circumstances of each case; the degree required has a relation to the length and hazardousness of the employment. Dixon v. Sadler ([30]). The appellants had reason to suppose that the boat was at least sound and capable of touching bottom without going to pieces a very common occurrence in river and canal navigation, especially in the navigation of a tug engaged in the towing of rafts between the rapids of the St. Lawrence river.\nThe repairs done at Cantin's and the examination which preceded the same, disclose the fact that the boat was in a rotten condition. The very assertion made by Auger that a further expenditure of $2494.90 was required to put the hull in as good condition as before.(for the boilers and machinery were not injured), shows that a rebuilding was needed as was done in 1873 and 1884.\nWhile collecting some dispersed portions of a raft at the foot of the Cornwall rapids, her stern struck a submerged log or a rock, it matters very little which under the pleadings, and she was shortly after beached on an even bottom of the river without apparently receiving any further injury. Immediately Captain Fournier wrote to the respondent:\nWhen we struck that rock we were going to try to haul off drams on a shoal called the Crabs. In starting from a little bay on the south side of the river we struck a big rock near the stern post, they say that there never was any rocks there before; the stern post is split and & little piece of the rudder broke, and all the butts from her seven feet mark down to the keel are open from her stern post four inches, and three seams open about fifteen feet long and an inch wide and fore head the ten is about two inches open from the planking, and nearly all the butts from the wheel to the stern are open from the wheels to the stem. She bends five feet.\nThe boat was raised and towed down to Cantin's dock in Montreal, where she was examined by many experts, but by no one on behalf of respondent. Then was, however, the proper time for a survey. Instructions were given to put her afloat, and in a good condition to go about her usual work. This was done without any complaint on the part of the respondent, or his captain who watched the repairs and suggested some of them. Cantin says:\nQ. Did you examine the vessel pretty thoroughly?\u2014A. No. I did not. I examined the stern where the work was done.\nQ. What was the condition of the wood work at the stern? I mean independently of the accident?\u2014-A. It was pretty ripe.\nQ. Well, I suppose ripe means rotten?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. What did you find to be in that ripe condition you speak of? A The upper part of the stern post and the apron particularly were defective. We took them out and replaced them with new. They were rotten.\nO Not in such a condition as they should have been had the vessel been sea-worthy? A. The vessel if she had not touched anything would have got along all right.\nO If she did touch something 2 A She would not resist it quite as well\nQ How did you find the planking in the stern of the vessel? A. They came off pretty easily.\nQ. What did that indicate?\u2014A. It would indicate, of course, that they had been started by this accident.\nQ. How did you find the bolting or spiking at the stern of the vessel? A. Some of them were somewhat corroded by evidently, the salt water\nQ. What had corroded upon them? A. Underneath the part between the plank and the fiame-- the inside.\nQ What was the result of the corrosion so far as holding the vessel together was concerned?\u2014A. The vessel could have got along if she had not touched the bottom.\nQ That then was the condition of the vessel at the point where the accident occurred?\u2014A. The principal part.\nTrudeau Cantin's foreman:\nQ Avez-vous vu dans quel \u00e9tat \u00e9tait le bois du b\u00e2timent le corps du b\u00e2timent, dans quel that \u00e9tait-il? \u00e9tait-il pourri?\u2014R. Bien, pour le s\u00fbr qu'il \u00e9tait pourri vous savez bien cc qui \u00e9tait d\u00e9foncd\u00e9 \u00e9tait pourri. Le bord\u00e9 qui tait pourri, il fallait calfeutrer, et lorsque cane calfeutrait pas......\nQ. C'\u00e9tait tellement pourri qu'on ne pouvait pas calfeutrer?\u2014 R. Des places. Pas tout.\nQ. Est-ce qu'il y en avait pas mal comme ca?\u2014R. Pas bien mais iusciu'en haut des \u00e9choirs.\nQ. Jusqu'en haut de la ligne d'eau?\u2014R. Oui, Monsieur. Q. C'\u00e9tatt tout pourri, n'est-ce pas?\u2014R. Pardonnez, pas tout, ii ne faut pas mettre tout, un morceau d'un bord, un morceau de l'autre.\nCaptain Macdonald:\nQ. Did you see her put in Cantinss dock? A Yes.\nQ, Did you examine her after she was put in? Yes.\nQ. First as to the stern what did you find its condition to be? A. I found her stern post knocked to one side.\nQ. Which side? A. Knocked ove-r to the port side.\nQ. And anything more?\u2014A. .There was a plank loose on the bottom; the carpenters went to pry the plank off and it came off quite easily; it almost fell alone.\nQ. What was the condition of the other plans at the stern? A. The timber was rotten, nothing to hold them. '\nQ. Which timbers do you refer to? A. The frame where the planks were spiked.\nQ. What was the condition of the stern post? A All the dead wood was rotten, that is there was nothing to hold the stern post.\nQ. What did you find the condition to be of the bolts or spikes that fastened the timbers? A All the spikes were eaten off with rust * *\nThe place where I beached her is a flat bottom and very level.\nLeslie, manager of the company, appellants:\nI went to the scene of the accident as soon as I heard of it I went to the steamboat. I made no examination of the place\nQ How did you find the vessel herself? A. On the bank outside the Cornwall Canal, on the north bank of the river lying in a slanting direction Her bow was in about six and a-half feet of water and her stern nine and a half. She was lying on the bottom with a little list to port.\nQ. Was she resting at both ends?\u2014A. Yes. Resting straight through all the way; I had her examined by a diver there. He went all round her.\nQ. If there had been any rocks in the middle between the stem and stern what would have been the result? A She would have her bottom pinned up. There was no indication of that kind That is why we made the examination to see if we had to pump her at once.\nQ. What did you do then? A. We found out where the leaks were at the stern and we put some canvas and boards over it in the usual way and pumped her out and she floated. We put two pumps on her. In ordering the pumps, I thought it was as well to get two as one, as we had to bring the steamboat down with the pumps from Kingston. I sent for two. We pumped her out, patched her, and sent her to Montreal Referring to an examination he made of the boat in Cantin's dock he continues:\nQ. What did you find?\u2014A. I found how the accident had occurred. She struck her stern and the post was broken\u2014twisted o el to port, probably a foot at the bottom and the garboard started and we found the stern post and all the apron inside perfectly rotten.\nQ. Could you judge from the appearance of the stern post what had caused the accident?\u2014A. Yes, distinctly how it occurred. My supposition was strengthened that she had struck a stick of timber because there was no abrasion on the bottom of the keel; just as though something caught her at the stern post and she cleared it evidently at once. I found another thing that probably went on. Her butts had been opened and wedged evidently when she had been in the docks before. The butts' are where the planks come together.\nQ. What had been done to these?\u2014A. They had been open and pieces of pine put in from an inch to an inch and a half.\nQ. What did you find to be the state of the bolts?\u2014A. We had to pull the planks off aft. The oakun was taken out and they put in a bar to start the plank and the whole plank nearly fell off. They did not require to wedge it.\nQ. As a matter of fact what does that indicate?\u2014A. That the fastenings had all been rotted out; the iron fastenings.\nFinally, he says:\nQ. Was the vessel an old boat?----A. Yes.\nQ. Had she been kept in good repair?\u2014A. She was not in good repair when I examined her.\nQ. In what way do you mean?\u2014A. The stern poses were rotten, and the apron.\nQ. And you alluded to the bow?\u2014A. The stem had started and the opening had been filled up by driving m a piece of rope.\nAuger also swears:\nQ. Les butts qui \u00e9taient ouverts et qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 arranges par vous autres, ce n'est pas l'accident qui avatt cause \u00e7a?\u2014R. Non. Comme je viens de dire, c'est l'\u00e2ge du b\u00e2timent.\nIt seems to me that the appellants have proved their plea of unseaworthiness, and upon that ground and also for the reason that there is no satisfactory evidence that the repairs recommended by Auger were occasioned by the accident, I feel disposed to allow the appeal with costs. Were it not for the admission of the appellants in their pleas, and the tender made by Flood on their behalf, and renewed under reservation by their pleadings, I would dismiss respondents action for everything beyond the rent due on the day of the accident, the appellants having rebutted, in my opinion, the presumption of article 1627, by proving that the loss happened without any fault on their part, and that the unseaworthy condition of the boat was the immediate cause of the damage.\nIn France and on the continent of Europe generally, when it is proved that the vessel was unseaworthy at the beginning of the service, she does not earn any freight, and the owner is further responsible for any damage which the lessee might suffer. Art. 297 of the Code de Commerce and the Ordonnance de la Marine of 1681, liv, 3, tit 3, art. 12, say so in express terms. Valid, in his comments, seems to think that such is the universal maritime law. The English law, which is followed also in the United States and the British Colonies, is not so severe. The charterer is always liable in damages, but he may, in certain cases, recover a certain proportion of the freight, and even the whole of it; and that seems to be the rule which was adopted by the Quebec Civil Code, arts. 1065, 2423, 2426, 2448. It is not necessary to dwell any longer upon this point in face of the admission contained in the pleas, which is in these words:\nThe defendants while denying any liability to the plaint in except for the sum of two thousand three hundred and eighty-five dollars ($2,385) being the balance of the charter money, nevertheless tendered to the plaintiff, before this action was brought, the sum of two thousand three hundred and eighty-five dollars, without preju dice or admission of liability on the part of the defendants, in full satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s claim which sum the defendants allege was amply sufficient to pay such claim, but the plaintiff refused to accept the sum so tendered. And the said defendants deposit here with the said sum of two thousand three hundred and eighty-five dollars and of the said tender pray acte. It is undoubtedly a very unfortunate admission and tender as it includes the rent accrued after the accident till the delivery of the boat supposed to have taken place in Quebec, on the 4th of August. It is in contradiction of the previous allegations in the plea. Evidently the appellants were anxious to avoid litigation, and on the 23rd August, 1895, they authorized their agent in Quebec, Flood, to offer, and through him did offer, the respondent,\u2014but not \u00e0 deniers d\u00e9couverts\u2014the sum of $3,015, less $630, already paid, that is all the rent to the 4th of August in full settlement of your claim against said company for services rendered by tug \" Beaver.\" It is this offer which the company has repeated by their pleadings under reservation.\nI am not willing to extend the scope of that admission or tender beyond its terms; and therefore, upon the two grounds that the tug was unseaworthy and that it is not proved that the repairs recommended by surveyor Auger were occasioned by the accident in question, I am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed, and the judgment of the Superior Court restored with costs before this court the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Review.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fitzpatrick & Taschereau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Caron, Pentland & Stuart.\n[1] 23 O.

The Trust and Loan Co. of Canada v. Quintal (2 Dor. Q. B. 190), followed.\nMere exposure to eviction is not a sufficient ground for vacating a sheriff's sale.\nA sheriff's sale in execution of a judgment against the owner of lands, grev\u00e9 de substitution, based upon an obligation in a mortgage having priority over the deed creating a substitution, discharges the lands from the unopened substitution without the necessity of making the curator to the substitution a party to the proceedings. Chef dit Vadebonc\u00e6ur v. The City of Montreal (29 Can. S. C. R 9) followed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, (appeal side), affirming the decision of the Superior Court sitting in Review at Montreal ([1]) which reversed the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal ([2]), dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nA statement of the facts and questions at issue on the appeal will be found in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Taschereau.\nBelcourt for the appellant. The purchaser at a judicial sale, who has paid the purchase price, need not await disturbance before asking the sale to be annulled. That principle does not apply to bidders at judicial sales. Moat v. Moisan ([3]); arts. 953, 959, 961 2060 C. C.;\narts. 710, 714 C. C. P. The case of The Trust and Loan Co. of Canada v. Quintal ([4]) did not rest upon a contrary doctrine. Numerous judgments have annulled judicial sales under article 714 C. C. P. even after the payment of the purchase price. Thomas v. Murphy ([5]); Compagnie de pret et Jr\u00e9dit Foncier v. Baker ([6]); Desjardins v. La Banque du Peuple ([7]). In the cases of Desjardins v. La Banque du Peuple (7), and Moat v. Moisan (3), the purchase price had not only been paid, but even distributed, and the collocated creditors were ordered to return to the purchaser the moneys so received. See also Bigras v. O' Brien ([8]), and Perron v. Bouchard ([9]) in which the payment of the purchase money did not prevent the setting aside of the sale.. In The Trust and Loan Co. of Canada v. Quintal (4), the true decision of the Court of Queen's Bench was that the respondent had failed in his proof to establish that he was exposed to disturbance, and moreover that tlie sale had been ratified. Judicial sales cannot be considered as subject to rules affecting private sales and consequently the judgment appealed from is wrongly based upon articles 1586 and 1587 of the Civil Code.\nAt the time of the codification of our laws in 1866, the French doctrine and decisions required the calling in of the substituess, even though the property be sold by law to satisfy a creditor of the grantor; 2 Pigeau\u2014 Procedure Civile (ed. 1779), no. 616: Denisart, J.

Other authoss who lay down the contrary opinion base themselves on the ordinance of 1747 which was not enregistered in Canada, and on the presence at the trial of the Minist\u00e8re Publique an institution that does not exist in Quebec. See Caty v. Perrault ([10]); Trust and. Loan Co- of Upper Canada v. Vadeboncceur ([11]). Arts. 2059 and 2060 C. C. make special reservation of the substitute's rights, even where an action against the institute is based on a hypothec anterior to the institute's possession, consequently on the grantor's debt. Duranton, t. 9, p. 573, no. 591, mentions the recourses of the substitute.\nThe purchaser is exposed to be disturbed \" in many ways and for many reasons, and asks to be freed from his purchase in virtue of article 714 C. O. P There is an established precedent in Jobin v. Shuter ([12]) that a purchaser is not obliged to remain exposed to such hazards.\nBarnard Q. C. and Rielle for the respondent The Superior Court purported to follow Moat v. Moisan ([13]), which the learned judge considered in conflict with the Trust and Loan Co of Canada v Quintal ([14]) No such conflict exists. The first question is whether the position of a buyer at sheriff's sale is similar to that of the buyer at an ordinary sale, or whether, under the circumstanses indicated, his rights are different from those of the latter. Contractual sales are regulated by arts. 1506-1531 and 1535 of the Civil Code. The fact of the payment of the price regulates the rights of the buyer. Before payment the buyer can object or ask for security on the grounds either of actual disturbance or of just cause to fear disturbance, but once the price has been paid the buyer can only reclaim it on the ground of actual dis turbance or eviction, not even alleged here. Pothier, Vente, no. 282; Aubry & Ran, no. 356, p. 497; 1 Duver-gier, pp. 430 et seq. Troplong, Vente, no. 614. Art. 4511 C.C. The position of the adjudicataire at sheriffs sale is similar. Arts. 1586-1591 C. C.; Arts. 714 C. C. P; Trust and Loan Co. of Canada v. Quintal (2). This last case confirmed the jurisprudence on the subject and cites prior decisions. See also Blondin v. Lizotte ([15]); Jobin v. Shuter ([16]).\nOn the question whether the substitution was dis charged by the sheriff's sale the authorities on the old French law, the arr\u00e9ts rendered under that law, and the settled jurisprudence of the province are all in favour of the respondent.

See also Mandeville v. Nicholl ([17]). In principle the gr\u00e9v\u00e9 is the representative of the substitution, all actions passive and active residing in his person, and all judgments against him binding the appel\u00e9, except in very exceptional circum stances, such as fraud, just as the judgments against the heir bind the legatee. Judging by the earliest arr\u00e9ts to be found in the books the power of the gr\u00e9v\u00e9 as the administrator and representative of the substitution, to sell voluntarily and without restraint the property of the substitution in matters of necessity, was unlimited. A usage, however, gradually grew up, so far as appears after the establishment of the Conceal Sup\u00e9rieur at Quebec, to obtain the authorization of the judge after calling in the appel\u00e9s. It is not necessary to decide how far the usage prevailed in Canada; it is sufficient, if it be admitted that it is a question whether art. 959 C. C. does not go further than the law as it stood before the Code, and to what extent as to the voluntary sale by the gr\u00e8v\u00e9 of substituted property in cases of necessity. But at no time in France either before or since the ordinance of 1747, and at no time in Lower Canada since 1663, has it been doubted that the sale by d\u00e9cret on the gr\u00e9v\u00e9 alone for the debt of the substituant. bound the appel\u00e9 although he has not been impleaded. The principle established by these authorities has been definitively adopted by arts. 953, 2058 and 2060 C. C. and art. 710 C. C.P.\nIn this case the claim, on the face of the proceedings, was a prior one, being for a debt of the grantor, and the question has long been regarded as settled in our jurisprudence. Macintosh v. Bell ([18]); Vade-bonc\u00e6ur v. City of Montreal ([19]). See also Gray v. Dubuc ([20]).\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the judgment pre pared by my brother Taschereuu, and for the reasons he gives, which are the same as those given by the Court of Review I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nI also concur with my brother Girouard and the Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench, in holding that the appeal was rightly dismissed for the reason given by the latter in his elaborate judgment, holding that the appellant had not brought himself within article 714 of the Code of Civil Procedure by showing that he was \" liable to eviction\" in the terms of that article\nTASCHEREAU J. On the tenth of September, 1895, the appellant purchased a certain property at sheriff's sale in Montreal. On the sixteenth of October, following, he paid the price of adjudication, which was subsequently duly distributed among the credit ors of the judgment debtor. On the third of February, 1896, he presented a petition under article 714 of the Code of Civil Procedure to have the sale set aside, and the amount paid refunded to him on the ground that he was liable to eviction by reason of a substitution on the property, not discharged by the sheriff's sale. The respondent demurred to this petition on the ground that such a sale cannot be so set aside when the purchase money has been paid, and the price refunded, merely because the purchaser is exposed to eviction; that in such a case, it is only when actually evicted, not upon the ground of a mere contingent liability to eviction, as alleged in the petition that the purchaser is entitled to such relief.\nI am of opinion that the demurrer is well founded. Article 714 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not give the right claimed by the petition to recover the money paid. And why? Because it is intended to apply only to a sale not yet paid for to a sale not perfected by payment, a sale of which the sheriff has not yet given the deed. Art. 706, C. C. P.; Pothier, \" Procedure Civile,\" page 254; \" Guillouard, Vente, no. 315, et seq.\nBut, argues the appellant, if I cannot get my money back under such a petition, I am at least entitled to have the sale vacated. To my mind he could not more clearly show how untenable is the position he takes. Could it be possible that a sale duly paid for might be vacated for mere liability to eviction under the Code of Civil Procedure and yet that the purchaser should, under the Civil Code (art. 1586) have to wait till he is actually evinced (which may never happen), to recover his money back? For by that article of the Civil Code, it is only when actually evicted that a purchaser at a judicial sale has the action condictio indebiti to recover his money back. Then article 1591 of the Civil Code enacts that such sales, as a general rule, are governed by the principles applicable to ordinary contracts of sale, and ordinary contracts of sale, it is conceded cannot after payment be set aside for mere liability to eviction. Articles 1511, 1535, Civil Code; Pothier, \" Vente,\" no. 282; 4 Aubry et Ran, (4 ed.) page 397.\nAnd the appellant does not allege that he was unaware of this substitution when he paid on the 16th of October; he simply alleges that he was unaware of it on the 10th of September, at the time of the adjudication.\nThis exceptional remedy by petition should not be extended by construction. It is not a new right that this article 714 purports to create, but simply an exceptional remedy. It gives the right, if the purchaser chooses to do so, to proceed by petition in the same case, instead of by action, but only in cases where the action lies. And the action does not lie until actual eviction, to set aside any sale that has been duly paid, and recover the money paid. Art. 1586 C. C. An enactment of this nature in a Code of Procedure must be construed, when possible, as an enactment on procedure, and nothing more. Such is the decision given in 1882, by the Court of Appeal in the province in the case of The Trust and Loan Co of Janada v. Quintal ([21]).\nThe Court of Review in the present case, in accordance with that decision allowed the demurrer. The Court of Appeal, though dismissing the petition on another ground overruled the case of The Trust and Loan Co of Canada v Quintal (1), and dismissed the demurrer. In my opinion the judgment of the Court of Review is the right one.\nI would allow the demurrer and dismiss the petition as unfounded in law. The appeal therefore fails.

In 1891 mutual releases of all claims and demands against each other, based upon statements so submitted by the active partner, were executed by each. In an action against the active partner to set aside these releases and open up the accounts.\nHeld, that all it was necessary to establish was, that in the accounts as settled there were such errors and mistakes as would inflict material injustice upon the plaintiff if the accounts should be held to be closed. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario varying the judgment at the trial which ordered a reference to take an account of the partnership affairs of the parties.\nThe material facts of the case are fully set out in the judgment of the court.\nAylesworth Q.C. and Madden for the appellant.\nClute Q.C. and Masten for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This was an action instituted by the plaintiff for taking the accounts of a partnership formed in September, 1875, by and between one Joseph Connolly, the defendant and the plaintiff, in which the plaintiff had one-half interest, and Connolly and the defendant one-fourth each. The defendant says in his evidence that articles of partnership were signed but that they have been burned. There is however no dispute as to the terms upon which the partnership was formed which may be taken from the statement of the defendant who says\u2014that he was to have absolute control of the business of the firm, and of the books, and was to keep the books. He was to be, and in fact was the banker of the firm, and that the monies of the firm were until he purchased out Connolly in 1885, paid into the bank to the credit of Connolly & Benjamin, and afterwards into the defendant\u2019s own name, which continued until November, 1890, when, as he says, the plaintiff went in with the defendant\u2019s boys; further he says that he was to be accountable for all the moneys of the firm, that the proceeds of all sales of the goods of the firm were received by him or by Baxter for him; this Baxter was a person in the employment of the firm, not a professional bookkeeper, but whom the defendant employed to keep the books for him. He says that until January, 1883, no cash book was kept, but that until then cash received was entered in a day book. The defence set up to this action in the defendant\u2019s statement of defence is that as he alleges on several days between the 4th of February, 1882, and the 31st December, 1890, diverse settlements took place of all the partnership transactions between the plaintiff and the defendant, which as the defendant contends constituted, and were signed and accepted by the plaintiff as constituting, final and conclusive settled and stated accounts of the said transactions at the respective dates of such statements of account, and that thereby all right of the plaintiff to have the account now taken is barred, and as a separate defence the defendant pleaded a release bearing date the 23rd day of June, 1891. The question now is whether the documents or statements relied upon by the defendant as constituting settled and stated accounts are sufficient to bar the plaintiff\u2019s right to have an account taken of the partnership transactions. In the month of February, 1882, the defendant prepared or caused to be prepared by Baxter a statement purporting to show the money value of the capital stock of the firm at the formation of the partnership in September, 1875, and of the amounts alleged to have been received by the defendant on account of the firm up to the 31st December, 1881, thus\u2014$54,010.38 disbursed\u2014$64,964.94 received.\nThis statement assuming the defendant\u2019s statement of the amounts received and disbursed by him to be correct showed that upon the 3lst December, 1881, there still remained due by the plaintiff on account of his share in the capital stock, the sum of $6,405.44. This paper, the plaintiff having no experience in accounts and bookkeeping and having, as he says he then had, most implicit confidence in the defendant, signed at the request of the defendant and upon his assurance and the assurance of Baxter, the bookkeeper employed by the defendant, that the statement was perfectly correct; and now although his confidence in the plaintiff is not as it then was he does not desire to question anything stated in that paper because that by reason of the complete control given to the defendant by the terms of the partnership and of his mode of keeping the accounts of the firm, and of the fact that he kept no cash book it would be futile for the plaintiff to attempt to prove any wrong in the statement so made by the defendant. He is therefore willing to let everything in it remain unquestioned, and that the account should be taken from the 1st of January, 1882, upon the basis that everything stated in that paper is correct. After the signing of the paper of the 4th February, 1882, the partnership continued as before but new articles dated the 14th April, 1882, were entered into whereby the partnership was continued as from the 1st of January preceding upon the old terms, and it was expressly declared that the defendant should have complete control as before\u2014that he should have absolute power to buy, sell, collect, hire and discharge, and to do the full business of the firm, and he therein and thereby undertook to give half yearly a full account of all monies received and disbursed by him from the proceeds of the said business from the first day of January, 1882.\nIn the month of December, 1882, the defendant purchased from the plaintiff one-sixth part of his half share, thus reducing the plaintiff\u2019s interest to one-third share, and accordingly new articles were prepared and signed, bearing date the first day of January, 1883, providing for this change. By these articles the defendant retained as from the beginning absolute control over the business of the firm, and as to hiring and discharging all persons in the service of the firm, and the absolute right in himself to receive and disburse all the monies of the firm, and he continued under the obligation to render half yearly true accounts of all sums received and disbursed. In these articles, however, is introduced the following clause:\nThere is now due by the said firm to the said Elijah Wesley Benjamin as per settlement, the sum of $1,932 87\/100, which sum is to be paid to the said Benjamin as soon as the company can get the money.\nThe settlement here referred to has been produced, and it is simply a debtor and creditor account between \u201cE.W. Benjamin and the Hub Factory\u201d wherein he charges himself with having received during the year 1882 certain sums, and he credits himself with having monthly disbursed certain specific sums for the firm, and he draws the balance upon such debit and credit items in his own favour to the amount of $1,932 87\/100. This document is signed by the defendant and Connolly and the plaintiff. The plaintiff set his signature to it as he had done to that of February, 1882, relying upon the assurance of the defendant in whom he had then most implicit trust and confidence that it was quite correct and showed truly all the sums received and disbursed by the defendant and for which he was accountable. The account does not profess to show the stock in hand of the firm, nor the debts outstanding due to the firm upon open account or commercial paper, nor the debts due by the firm, so that it does not purport to be a stated account of the partnership affairs at the respective dates named. It is in fact an account rendered by the defendant in compliance with the obligation resting on him by the partnership articles to render half-yearly accounts of his receipts and disbursements for the firm; and by signing it, neither the plaintiff nor the defendant is concluded from showing errors. In the month of April, 1885, the defendant purchased Connolly\u2019s interest in the firm and the business continued to be conducted by the plaintiff and defendant on the former terms until the 10th of February, 1888, when the plaintiff and defendant signed new articles of partnership in which their appears a recital that on the 1st of January of that year a settlement was effected between the plaintiff and defendant of their partnership business and transactions up to that date, and that upon such settlement they had agreed to grant to each other mutual releases of all debts and demands up to the said first day of January, and by the said articles it was again provided, as formerly, that the defendant should conduct the financial part of the business and should attend to the selling of the goods of the firm and the collecting of the firm\u2019s debts, and the signing of all bills, notes and cheques for and on behalf of the firm, and shall further exercise a general superintendence and management over the whole business. On the 23rd day of June, 1891, an instrument was executed by and between the defendant and the plaintiff in which after reciting that a settlement of their partnership affairs was that day made between the plaintiff and the defendant to the effect therein stated the parties thereto, in consideration of the sum of one dollar therein stated to have been paid by each to the other, executed mutual releases to each other of all actions, suits, claims and demands, excepting as therein excepted, from the beginning of the world to date.\nUp to this time the plaintiff continued to have the utmost confidence in the defendant but subsequently that confidence was lost and the plaintiff believing the accounts so as aforesaid rendered by the defendant and so as aforesaid procured to have been signed by the plaintiff to be materially incorrect instituted the present action wherein the sole issue was whether or not the right of the plaintiff to an account against the defendant as the partner who has assumed the position of being responsible for all the accounts and all the receipts and disbursements of the firm was barred by the statements relied upon by the defendant as stated and settled accounts or by the releases set up and relied upon by the defendant which appear to have been executed upon no other consideration than the assumption of the correctness of the said accounts.\nThe conclusion arrived at by the learned trial judge was that it was established as a fact upon the uncontradicted evidence of accountants examined before him that a thorough examination of the partnership books disclosed that if the accounts relied upon by the defendant should be treated as settled the result would be a clear loss to the plaintiff of about seven thousand dollars. And further, he found as a fact that the plaintiff was a man without business capacity and had not capacity to understand the subjects necessary to be taken into account in arriving at a proper adjustment of the partnership accounts; and that all the statements of account relied upon by the defendant were signed by the plaintiff in reliance upon the representations of defendant that the statements so signed were correct statements of the accounts, and he made a decree referring it to the master to take the accounts.\nUpon an appeal by the defendant, the Court of Appeal at Toronto set aside that decree and made a decree referring it to the master to inquire into and to report upon eleven items amounting in the whole to about $1.900, and they adjudged that the plaintiff should pay to the defendant the costs of the appeal and of the action.\nNow, part of the loss of $7,000 mentioned in the decree of the learned trial judge and in the evidence of the accountants examined before him consisted of $2,800 distributed over forty items which the books of the firm showed that the defendant had received from debtors of the firm but that no charge to the defendant for such amounts had been entered in any book of the firm from which the statements of account signed by the plaintiff had been made up, and the items referred to the master by the Court of Appeal were eleven of those forty items. We do not think that the limitation of the inquiry to those eleven items can be maintained. The evidence given at the trial and adopted by the learned trial judge applied equally to the forty items as to the eleven, namely, that the books for which the defendant was accountable showed that the amounts had been received by him and did not show that he had charged himself therewith; and the learned trial judge has also found as a fact that the plaintiff signed the statements of account furnished by the defendant upon his assurance that they were correct; the defendant indeed admits this to be the fact. Then there is the evidence of the accountants who have examined the books which evidence the learned trial judge has adopted as uncontradicted, to the effect that the loss which would result to the plaintiff if those statements of accounts should be held to conclude him, would, as appearing on the books of the firm, result in a clear loss to him of about $7,000. Now all that it was necessary to establish in order to set aside the releases pleaded, and to open the accounts was that in the accounts as taken there were such errors or mistakes as would inflict material injustice upon the plaintiff if the accounts should be held to be closed. The defendant has throughout retained in his own hands absolute control over the receipts and disbursements of the firm and has assumed absolute responsibility and account- ability for the manner in which the books have been kept.\nIn the face of the evidence as to what a thorough examination of the books of the firm discloses it would be manifestly unjust that the plaintiff should be bound by releases executed under the circumstances as found by the learned trial judge. We are of opinion therefore that the appeal must be allowed with costs and that the decree of the learned trial judge for a general account varied so as to open and take the accounts only from and including the first of January, 1882, should be restored. The decree will declare all the releases in the pleadings and evidence mentioned shall be set aside, and the plaintiff consenting that the matters stated in the document bearing date the 4th February, 1882, shall remain undisturbed, declare all statements of account subsequent thereto to be set aside and of no effect, and refer it to the master to take the accounts from and including the first of January, 1882. The decree will adjudge to the plaintiff his costs of the action to the hearing and will reserve all further costs until the account shall be taken, in the usual form.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Deroche & Madden.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Herrington & Warner.\n"}

Thus where, on the sale of a mining claim, it turned out that the whole property sold was included in prior claims whereby the purchaser got nothing for his money the contract was rescinded though the vendor acted in good faith and the transaction was free from fraud.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant.\nIn June, 1896, the defendant and others had taken up a gold mining claim in the neighbourhood of Rossland, British Columbia, of which he claimed and represented himself to be the owner of one-half. This claim was designated as the \"Eldorado.\" The plaintiff, through his agent, Oscar G. Laberee, believing the representations of the defendant to be true and relying entirely on such representations, became the purchaser of the undivided half of the claim for the sum of $5,250, which Laberee paid to the defendant in cash, who therefore executed an assignment of his undivided half to the plaintiff. Soon afterwards it turned out that the greater part of the \"Eldorado\" plot was included within the limits of the prior claim called \"Mascot,\" and that a strip which remained containing an area of some ten or fifteen acres was included in other claims. The plaintiff therefore got nothing for the money he paid. The defendant made the sale in perfect good faith, and his representation which turned out to be untrue was innocently made and the transaction was free from fraud. Both parties dealt upon the mistaken belief that the \"Eldorado\" was an actually existing mining right, whereas in truth, owing to other claims which were entitled to priority having been previously made, the whole of the \"Eldorado\" was included in pre-existing claims.\nThe plaintiff brought his action for rescission of the contract and return of the purchase money. Mr. Justice McColl who tried the case held that rescission would not be decreed for mere innocent misrepresentation and dismissed the action. His judgment was reversed by the full court and judgment entered for the plaintiff. The defendant then took an appeal to this court.\nClute Q.C. for the appellant. To obtain rescission of an executed contract fraud must be proved; Bell v. Macklin[2]; even when there has been a mistake by which the party seeking relief has suffered injury; Allen v. Richardson[3]; Clare v. Lamb[4]; Ducondu v. Dupuy[5].\nTravers Lewis and Hamilton for the respondent referred to Granger v. Fotheringham[6] Huddersfield Banking Co. v. Henry Lister & Son[7]; Cooper v. Phibbs[8]; Hart v. Swaine[9].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The facts of this case are few and simple. In June, 1896, the appellant and others had taken up a gold mining claim in the neighbourhood of Rossland, British Columbia, of which claim the appellant claimed and represented himself to be the owner of one-half. This claim was designated as the \"Eldorado.\" The respondent, through his agent, Oscar G. Laberee, believing the representations of the appellant to be true and relying entirely on such representations, became the purchaser of the appellant's undivided half of the claim for the sum of $5,250, which Laberee paid to the appellant in cash, who thereupon executed an assignment of his undivided half to the respondent. Soon afterwards it turned out that the greater part of the \"Eldorado\" plot was included within the limits of a prior claim called the \"Mascot,\" and that a strip which remained containing an area of some ten or fifteen acres was included in other claims. The respondent therefore got nothing for the money he paid. There can be no doubt on the evidence that the appellant represented himself to be the owner and made the sale in perfect good faith; that his representation which turned out to be untrue was innocently made and that the transaction was free from fraud. In short both parties dealt upon the mistaken belief that the \"Eldorado\" was an actually existing mining right, whereas in truth, owing to other claims which were entitled to priority having been previously made, the whole of the \"Eldorado\" was included in pre-existing claims. The respondent brought this action to have the contract rescinded and to obtain repayment of the money which he had paid for a consideration which had entirely failed. The action was tried before the present Chief Justice of British Columbia (then Mr. Justice McColl), and that learned judge acting upon what he considered to be the law applicable to the case, dismissed the action. On appeal to the full court (Walkem and Drake JJ.), this judgment was reversed and a judgment entered for the respondent. The learned trial judge considered the respondent's right to rescission dependent entirely on the misrepresentation, and held that in the present state of the law an executed contract\u2014and especially an executed contract for the sale of an interest in land\u2014will not be rescinded for mere innocent misrepresentation. That this was a correct view of the law as administered by Courts of Equity up to the date of the amalgamation of jurisdictions effected by the judicature Acts, and as it has existed down to the present time, I am not upon the authorities able positively to controvert. Strange as it may seem that there should be dearth of authority upon such a point I find that with the exception of one case, that of Legge v. Croker[10], there is no direct authority upon the point. That case of Legge v. Croker[11] supports the judgment of the chief justice, as Lord Manners there held that to entitle a party to have rescission of an executed contract for the sale of land upon the ground of misrepresentation there must be fraud. There are no doubt dicta the other way emanating from judges, some of great authority, for we find Sir Edward Sugden, Lord Justice Turner and Sir George Jessel, all stating the law to be that such a contract would be rescinded for innocent misrepresentation, provided, of course, that it formed the basis of the contract. It would not, however, be safe to act on these dicta. Mr. Dart in the 6th edition of his work on Vendors and Purchasers[12], has this passage which I think a fair statement of the law. The learned writer says:\nA Court of Equity would not only refuse its discretionary remedy of specific performance, but would go further and restrain a vendor from asserting his legal right to claim damages in a court of law, on the ground that it was unconscientious in him to do so. But the principle would not be extended to the taking away after completion the price of the property, which at law had become absolutely the vendor's, without advancing the interference of the Court of Equity further than has yet been authorized by judicial decision. In other words it seems that misrepresentation is no ground for setting aside an executed contract, unless such misrepresentation would be not only sufficient to afford ground in equity for rescission of an executory contract, but also is deceitful in contemplation of a court of law. Whether or not this limitation of the jurisdiction of Courts of Equity is satisfactory, either in practice or in principle, the present state of the authorities justifies its enunciation.\nSir Edward Fry in his treatise on Specific Performance (2 ed.) p. 295, commenting on Edwards v. M'Leay[13], says:\nBut it must not thence be inferred that every representation that the vendor has a good title will enable a purchaser to set aside an executed contract or successfully resist specific performance.\nI conclude therefore in favour of the proposition that mere innocent misrepresentation will not warrant the rescission of an executed contract for the sale of an interest in land.\nThere is, however, another principle which I think may be invoked in the respondent's favour and which is quite open to him on the pleadings and evidence before us.\nIt has been determined by several authorities and is well established law that where by the mutual mistake of the parties to a contract of sale the subject of the sale turns out to be non-existent or is already the property of the purchaser, both parties having fallen into error merely, and there being no fraud or deceit in the case, the purchaser who has paid his purchase money and taken a conveyance will be relieved and the contract rescinded by a Court of Equity. In such a case where there is a complete failure of consideration as in the present case it would be unjust and unconscientious that the vendor should retain money paid to him for a supposed consideration which has utterly failed.\nIn Bingham v. Bingham[14] Fortescue, M. R. holding that where it appeared that the estate for which the purchase money had been paid already before the sale belonged to the purchaser decreed rescission and said that\nthough no fraud appeared and the defendant apprehended he had a right, yet there was a plain mistake such as the court was warranted to relieve against, and not to suffer the defendant to run away with the money in consideration of the sale of an estate to which he had no right.\nSir Edward Fry in the work already quoted from at page 337 (2 ed.), says:\nFurther, where both parties to a contract are at the time of the contract in mistake or error as to the matters in respect of which they are contracting, this will not only furnish a ground for resisting specific performance but enable the court to rescind the contract.\nDart (6 ed. p. 907) has this passage:\nIf it appear that the estate belonged to the purchaser, he can in equity, and probably at law, recover his purchase money, although he might have discovered his right from the abstract of title; nor is it clear that the absence of fraud in the vendor will bar the relief. And it has been held that a purchaser who, although without any fault on the part of the vendor, buys an estate which in fact has no existence, (e. g. a remainder expectant on an estate tail which has been barred), can obtain relief in equity; but it is of course otherwise if the purchaser buys an estate the existence of which he knows to be doubtful. The principle has been doubted by Lord St. Leonards, but it has been decided that, even at law, an action lies in such a case to recover the purchase money as money paid without consideration ;\u2014as where a life annuity is sold after the death of cestui qui vie.\nIn Cooper v. Phibbs[15], Lord Cranworth and Lord Westbury both recognized the authority of Bingham v. Bingham[16] and acted on it in decreeing rescission in a case in which the facts were essentially the same. The observations of Lord Cranworth leave no doubt as to the principle that where there is by reason of a mistake of this kind an entire failure of consideration, the completion of the contract by conveyance and payment of the purchase money will constitute no bar to relief by a court of equity.\nIn Cochrane v. Willis[17], Lord Romilly M.R., in the court below, and Lord Justice Turner in the Court of Appeal, acted upon the authority of Bingham v. Bingham[18]. Further in Jones v. Clifford[19]. Vice Chancellor Hall, a very high authority on such a question, says speaking of Cooper v. Phibbs[20].\nNothing can be clearer than this, that Lord Cranworth recognized the principle that the court would, even in the case of a completed contract, give relief against a common mistake in the same way as it would against fraud.\nLord Westbury in Cooper v. Phibbs[21], says:\nIf the parties contract under a mutual mistake and misapprehension as to their relative and respective rights, the result is that that agreement is liable to be set aside as having proceeded upon a common mistake.\nSee also Webster on Conditions of Sale[22], and Clerke & Humphrey on Sales[23].\nThe result is that the evidence in this record being clear that the consideration for the money paid by the respondent to the appellant utterly failed, as indeed appears from the admission of the appellant himself, the respondent upon the authorities referred to was entitled to the relief the court below has given him and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John S.

Act\u201d to make allotments of the capital stock of the company at a rate per share below the face value, and any by-law or resolution of the directors assuming to make such allotment without the sanction of a general meeting of the shareholders of the company is invalid.\nA by-law or resolution of the directors of a joint stock company which operates unequally towards the interests of any class of the shareholders is invalid and ultra vires of the company\u2019s powers.\nWhere shares in the capital stock of a joint stock company have been illegally issued below par the holder of the shares is not thereby relieved from liability for \u0441\u0430lls for the unpaid balances of their par value.\nJudgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Manitoba (11 Man. L. R. 6293 reversed, Taschereau J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Manitoba ([1]) reversing the judgment of the trial court by which the plaintiff\u2019s action was dismissed with costs.\nThe plaintiff brought suit claiming that she was the owner of a number of shares in the capital stock of the company which had been issued to her as fully paid up and non-assessable on payment of a sum less than the face value thereof under an agreement between her and the directors that the shares should be so issued to her at a discount, and asked for a declaration that certain calls made upon her said shares and the forfeiture thereof for non-payment of the calls were illegal and void, and alternatively that she should be reinbursed the actual sum paid by her for the shares in question. The case was tried before Sir Thomas W. Taylor, Chief Justice of Manitoba, who dismissed the action with costs, but on appeal to the full court, his judgment was unanimously reversed, and it was ordered that a judgment should be entered in favour of the plaintiff under certain terms and conditions and saving certain rights of persons therein mentioned.\nA statement of the facts and questions of law at issue in the case appears in the judgment of the court as delivered by His Lordship, Mr. Justice Sedgewick,\nEwart Q.C. for the appellant. All the judges in the courts below found that the directors as promoters of the company acted fraudulently in allotting these shares at a discount and thereby giving an advantage over other shareholders. There was no express contract that the shares should be issued at the discount allowed, and the respondent who received them knew that the action of the directors was a fraud upon the company and that the company was not bound by their agreement. The transaction was managed by the plaintiff\u2019s husband, who was her agent and at the same time a promoter, a director and the trustee of the company. This case is similar to Dr. Daniel\u013es Case (1) which was followed in the case of McCraken v. Mclntyre (2), and reference, made to it at pages 494, and 527. See also Welton v. Saffery ([2]), per Macnaughten L. J. at page 321; Re Western of Canada Oil Co.; Carling Hespeler & Walsh\u2019s Cases ([3]), per Mellish L. J. and James L. J.; Leeke\u2019s Case ([4]); Re Disderi & Co. ([5]); Re Canadian Oil Works Corporation; Hay\u2019s Case ([6]); Re Railway Time Tables Publishing Co. ([7]), per Lindley L. J. at page 115, and Bowen L. J. at page 117; Re Cachar Co.; Lawrence\u2019s Case ([8]); Re Madrid Bank; Wilkinson\u2019s Case ([9]); Re Addlestone Linoleum Co. ([10]), and Oakes v. Turquand ([11]) at pages 851 and 352. The plaintiff, through her agent, had full knowledge of the circumstances, and chose to place herself in a position to take advantage of any benefits that might be obtained, and as holder of the stock she should be compelled to bear the burthens of it. See remarks of Richards C. J. in McCraken v. Mclntyre ([12]) at pages 495 and 510. See also In re Reese River Silver Co.; Smith\u2019s Case ([13]) and The Central Railway Co. of Venezuela v. Kisch ([14]) at page 125; Preston v. Grand Collier Dock Co. ([15]) It was a surreptitious and fraudulent dealing; Panama & S. \u0420\u0430\u0441. Tel. Co. v. India Rubber, etc. Co. ([16]), per James L.J. at page 527. See Lindley on Companies (5 ed.) at page 781 and the cases cited in support of the statement there made as to contributories.\nThe issue of shares at a discount is illegal under English law; Welton v. Saffery; it is also illegal under Canadian law, McCraken v. Mclntyre at page 509, and the Manitoba statute, R.S.M. c. 25, ss. 30 and 33, gives no power to make by-laws contrary to law, even by implied construction. See Mollwo, March & Co. v. Court of Wards (1), followed in Pooley v. Driver (2). A misapprehension of the law by the Legislature does not make that the law which it has erroneously, assumed the law to be: Earl of Shrewsbury v. Scott (3) at page 53.\nIn this case it is not pretended that any general meeting of the company ever dealt with this issue of the stock at a discount. The discount resolution was in February, 1890, but in October, 1889, the company had covenanted with the Edison Electric Light Company that all shares (save their 200) \u201cshall be of the par value of $100 each * * * and shall be issued for full payment in cash only.\u201d A general meeting of the company was held between these dates, and it is fair to assume that the agreement was then either expressly, or impliedly, approved by the company; Re British, Provident Life & Fire Assur. Co.; Coleman\u2019s Case (4) at page 503; and if so the company had (within the precise wording of section 30) \u201cat a general meeting of the company\u201d absolutely declared that the shares should not be issued at a discount. It was, therefore (upon any construction of the statute), impossible for the directors to issue the shares below par. Even if this cannot be assumed the company had under its seal made the requisite declaration, and the directors had no power to disregard what the company had thus done.\nThe director\u2019s resolution was ultra vires, because it was unreasonable\u2014this, apart from any statute. Shareholders are entitled to be treated equally and fairly by the directors. Even majorities of shareholders have no power to infringe that equality. Lindley on Companies (5 ed.) 396; Brice on Ultra Vires (3 ed.) 195-196; Menier v. Hooper\u2019s Telegraph Works ([17]), at page 353; Ex parte Cowen ([18]); Beatty v. Northwest Transportation Co. ([19]); Hutton v. Scarborough Cliff Hotel Co. ([20]). Issuing shares at a discount, even to all the shareholders, is a breach of the equality\u2014 for some shareholders may possibly not be able to take them. Guinness v. Land Corporation of Ireland ([21]); Ashbury v. Watson ([22]).\nThe plaintiff cannot complain of any misrepresentations by the company as to the character of the shares, or its power to allow the discount because the scheme was a fraud perpetrated by Walsh himself, and in any case, the company, as distinguished from individual directors, is not chargeable with such misrepresentations. Houldsworth v. City of Glasgow Bank (7); Re Addlestone Linoleum Co. (8); Lynde v. Anglo-Italian Hemp Spinning Co. (9).\nAs to the alternative claim the plaintiff never has repudiated the shares, and does not now claim to do so; upon the contrary she has obtained a judgment declaring that she is the owner of fifty-three of them. She is therefore not in a position to claim rescission. Lapse of time alone would be a sufficient bar to any such claim. Clarke v. Dickson (10); Sharpley v. Louth & East Coast Ry. Co. (11).\nJ. Stewart Tupper Q.C. for the respondent. This case cannot be governed by English cases decided under the English statute, which contains a clause respecting breaches of trust upon which those cases rely. The statute which determines the powers and rights questioned here has no such clause. There was no fraudulent intention in respect to the issue of the stock in question in this case; it was honestly made in the belief that the power to do so existed, however, incidentally, the trustees may have erred in their duties.\nThe company allowed the respondent to exercise her full privileges as owner of the shares, and to attend the next annual meeting of the company and to vote thereat by her attorney, and also to transfer two of the shares to her husband, which transfer was duly registered by the company, and the shares transferred in the books. See In re British Provident Fire & Life Assurance Co.; Lane\u2019s case ([23]); Re British Provident Fire & Life Assurance Co., Grady\u2019s Case ([24]); Phosphate of Lime Co. v. Green ([25]); clear evidence of the adoption of the contract is also found in the action of the appellant in making calls upon the shares and in taking proceedings to forfeit the shares for non-payment of calls. The husband was managing director until March, 1890, but he had no connection with the company as shareholder or director for eight months previous to the issue of the share certificate to the respondent on the 24th of February, 1891.\nThe Manitoba Act provides for the creation of corporations, and the liability of shareholders to creditors is expressly declared by section 44. Their liability to the company and to each other is by section 49 \u201c for all sums of money by them subscribed.\u201d Not only is there no prohibition against issuing shares at a discount, but sub-section (b) of section 30 and sub-clause (d) of section 72 are clear recognitions of such a power. See the language of Maclennan J.A. in Re Ontario Express and Transportation Company (1) at page 661. There are no such provisions in the English Act under the provisions of which (secs. 7, 8 and 11) the Court of Appeal in England reversed the decision of Mr. Justice Chitty, who, so recently as 1888, held that a company could issue its shares at a discount: In re Almada and Tirito Co. (2). See also In re Addlestone Linoleum Co. (3); Ooregum Gold Mining Co. v. Roper (4); In re Railway Time Tables Publishing Co. (5).\nIn the Manitoba Act, by section 30, the directors are empowered \u201c to administer the affairs of the company,\u201d and to make any description of contract which the company might, by law, enter into, also to make bylaws, not contrary to law or to the Letters Patent of the Company to regulate the allotment of stock; and by section 33 it is declared that, if the Letters Patent make no other definite provision, the stock of the company shall be \u201c allotted\u201d when and as the directors by by-law or otherwise may ordain.\u201d It seems quite clear that the appellants had power to sell the respondent the shares in question at a discount, and that the proviso (b) to this section is intended to limit the powers of the directors only when a price, either at a premium or discount has been fixed by the shareholders for the shares. As a matter of fact, however, the shareholders had authorized the transaction in question by by-law No. 2, in which authority was conferred on the trustees to dispose of the stock on such terms as they saw fit. In any event the respondent was entitled to assume that the sanction of the shareholders had been obtained so as to make the issue legal; Royal British Bank v. Turquand (6); Lindley on Companies 166; County of Gloucester Bank v. Rudry Merthyr Steam etc. Co. ([26]). The onus was on the appellants to show that the action of the directors was unauthorized by the shareholders, and no such evidence was given. This subsequent ratification is equivalent to prior authorization; Irvine v. Union Bank of Australia ([27]).\nThe use of the word \u201c bonus\u201d does not prevent the sale of the shares in question being a sale at a \u201cdiscount,\u201d as it is the substance of the transaction which governs, not the language with which it may be clothed: In re Licensed Victuallers Mutual Trading Association ([28]); In re Faure Electric Co. ([29]); In re London Celluloid Co. ([30]); In Re New Chile Gold Mining Co. ([31]).\nThe agreement with the Edison Company could not confer authority on the appellants to make the calls. At most that transaction would merely give a right of action to the Edison Company against the appellants. Nor need there be any serious discussion respecting the appellants\u2019 novel contention that they can \u201c approbate and reprobate.\u201d It has been decided again and again that this cannot be done. The contention that the sale of the stock at a discount was proof of fraud is idle in view of the fact fact that there was no evidence to show that the stock was worth more than the respondent gave for it. But even if there had been fraud, the appellant company had to repudiate or affirm the contract. It was bound to accept or reject it as a whole. The contract was to pay $3,200, and it cannot be turned into an agreement to pay $16,000. Currie\u2019s Case ([32]); DeRuvigne\u2019s Case ([33]); Anderson\u2019s Case ([34]); Waterhouse v. Jamieson (10).\nIf the company had no power to issue shares at a discount we should recover the money paid on the ground that there was an entire failure of consideration. In re Ince Hall Rolling Mills Company ([35]); In re Railway Time Table Publishing Company; Ex parte Sandy\u2019s ([36]). Lindley on Companies, (5 ed.) pp. 189, 235. Mere laches do not disentitle the holder of shares to relief against an invalid forfeiture. Garden Gully United Quartz Mining Co. v. Mc Lister ([37]). Besides such a defence is not open to the appellants, as it is not raised in the pleadings: Clarke v. Hart ([38]).\nTASCHEREAU J. (dissenting).\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. The reasoning of Mr. Justice Killam seems to me unanswerable.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by \u0e30\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The respondent\u2019s husband was a promoter and corporator and the original managing-director of the appellant company. The company was incorporated on the fifteenth of June, 1889, by letters patent, issued under the provisions of the Manitoba Joint Stock Companies Incorporation Act, (Consolidated Statutes of Manitoba), ch. 9, div 7, with a capital of one hundred thousand dollars divided into one thousand shares of one hundred dollars each, the object of the company being the carrying on of an electric lighting and power business in the province.\nThe applicants were George H. Strevel, Frank J. Walsh, Jefferson Davis, James w. Johnston and Henry J. Dexter, each of whom had subscribed twenty shares of the capital stock of which they at first had paid ten per cent and eventually the remaining eighty percent. The applicants were the provisional directors of the company.\nOn the fifteenth of July, 1889, the provisional directors passed the following resolution \u0e30\nThat whereas an agreement was entered into by this provisional board with the negotiators and the persons by whom money is advanced on mortgage bond security for the establishment of the business of the company, which agreement requires the handing over to trustees the amount of all unsubscribed stock fully paid up and non-assessable, to be disposed of as such trustees see fit, on the production of the necessary cash surrender value of mortgage bond or bonds, be it resolved therefore that this Board hereby nominate F. G. Walsh and H. J. Dexter, trustees, and direct the issue to them of nine hundred (900) shares of this company, fully paid up and non-assessable for the above purposes.\nIt may be here noted that as a matter of fact there was no agreement ever come to or even contemplated such as was that referred to in this resolution. Nor was any money advanced by any person whatever for the purpose mentioned and no one has ever yet been able to give an intelligent or reasonable account of its meaning or object. However at a meeting of the shareholders of the company subsequently held this resolution was confirmed and incorporated in the by-laws of the company as follows:\nBY-LAW NO. 2.\u2014Be it enacted that the remainder of the capital stock, to wit, nine hundred \u2018 (900) shares be issued to enable this company to carry out the spirit of resolution passed on the fifteenth day of July, 1889, which reads as follows: \u201c That whereas an agreement was entered into by this provisional board with the negotiators and the persons by whom the money is advanced on mortgage bond security for the establishment of the business of the company, which agreement requires the handing over to trustees the amount of all unsubscribed stock fully paid up and non-assessable to be disposed of as such trustees see fit on the production of the necessary cash surrender value of mortgage bond or bonds, be it resolved therefore that this board hereby nominate F. G. Walsh and H. J. Dexter, trustees, and direct the issue to them of nine hundred (900) shares of this company, fully paid up and non-assessable for the above purposes.\u201d This by-law likewise is as inexplicable as the resolution upon which it was based, but the directors acting upon it issued to F. G. Walsh and Henry J. Dexter, as trustees, the remaining nine hundred outstanding shares of the company in the following form :\nTHIS CERTIFICATE entitles F. G. Walsh and Henry J. Dexter, trustees, to nine hundred (900) shares in the capital stock of the Northwest Electric Company (Limited), fully paid up and non-assessable, and transferable in the books of the company in person or by attorney on surrender of this certificate.\nAnother extraordinary thing had occurred before the issue of this certificate. On the seventeenth of October, 1889, the company entered into a contract with the Edison Electric Light Company, by which the latter company was to transfer the use of certain patents relating to electric light in consideration of which and of the sum of four thousand dollars in cash the company agreed to deliver to the Edison company two hundred fully paid up shares of its capital stock, agreeing at the same time that the remaining six hundred shares should be issued only after full payment in cash.\nAt a meeting of the directors of the company held on the 3rd February, 1890, the following resolution was passed:\nThat whereas by-law No. 2 appointed Frank G. Walsh and Henry J. Dexter trustees of nine hundred shares of the capital stock of this company for the purposes set forth in the by-law; and whereas the said trustees have reported the allotment of certain portions of trust stock in the following manner, to wit: James McNaught, St. Paul, one hundred and sixty shares; Joseph M. Graham, Winnipeg, Man., one hundred and sixty shares; Edison Light Company, New York, two hundred shares on the conditions that a bonus be received from each of the allottees, as follows: From James McNaught, the sum of $3,200 cash; from Joseph M. Graham, the sum of $3,200 cash; Edison Electric Light Company, the sum of four thousand dollars cash; and have further allotted of such stock to Mary E. Dexter and Mary C. Walsh of Winnipeg, in consideration of and in the following manner, viz.: Mary E. Dexter, one hundred and sixty shares, and Mary C. Walsh, one hundred and sixty shares of fully paid up and non-assessable stock, for which each of them is to pay a bonus, within twelve months from the date hereof, the respective sums of $3,200. Be it resolved that the board hereby ratifies and confirms the same and directs the secretary and president or vice-president to issue certificates subject to such conditions and allow the necessary transfer to be made in the transfer books.\nCertificates were accordingly issued to McNaught, Graham and Mary E. Dexter, for one hundred and sixty shares each and to the Edison Electric Light Company for two hundred shares, and on the 3rd of February following, Walsh, the husband of the respondent, paid to the company $3,200, and on its receipt she was entered upon the lists of the company\u2019s shareholders and received a certificate that she was the owner of one hundred and sixty shares, fully paid up and non-assessable in the capital stock of the company. The respondent subsequently transferred two of these shares to her husband.\nIt is not contended that Mrs. Walsh was a purchaser for value without notice, or that she has any greater rights than her husband would have had had he issued the shares to himself, so that for the purposes of this opinion I propose to treat him as the real plaintiff and not his wife.\nSo far it would seem that all the stock of the company had been disposed of, and that seven hundred of these shares had realised not 170,000 as they would have, had they been sold at par, but only $14,000, the holders of the other shares having paid for them $30,000.\nIt might here be observed that whether this transfer to the directors and their wives at eighty per cent below par was legal or not, it was especially flagititious because of the existence of the agreement to which I have referred between the appellant company and the Edison Electric Light Company. Doubtless the consideration which influenced the Edison Electric Light Company in making their venture was the fact that the whole of the capital stock would be subscribed and paid for in full, it being evident that nothing would be more likely to impair the success of the concern than any serious curtailment of the statutory capital.\nAnd so it happened sometime previous to the 10th of September, 1891, that the company became seriously involved in financial difficulties. The debts amounted to about $98,000, a judgment had been recovered for $1,100, and other creditors were pressing for payment of their claims. The then shareholders of the company made an investigation into its affairs when the manipulations above stated in regard to the stock became known and the company was advised that the directors and shareholders who had received the seven hundred shares at less than par were liable to pay the balance. On the 10th of September, 1891, a resolution was passed authorizing the company to make two calls of twenty per cent each upon the stock. These calls were duly made, and all of the shareholders except Mrs. Walsh and her husband, who held the two shares, paid the eighty per cent, they alone refusing to do so. Their stock was thereupon declared forfeited, and certain portions of such forfeited stock were subsequently sold by the directors at eighty cents, fifty-three shares still remaining in the treasury undisposed of, although this was not known to the plaintiff at the commencement of the action.\nThe plaintiff thereupon brought this suit claiming that she was the owner of one hundred and fifty-eight shares of $100 each of fully paid up and non-assessable stock of the company, and that the defendant\u2019s action in making said calls and forfeiting said stock was illegal, and that the company\u2019s register be amended so as to show the plaintiff the holder of said stock; asking in the alternative, for a declaration that the defendants were indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $3,200, and that they may be ordered to pay the same, etc.\nThe case was tried before Sir Thomas Taylor, Chief Justice of Manitoba, who dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s claim. But his judgment was unanimously reversed upon appeal before Dubuc, Killam and Bain JJ.\nThe first question to be determined is as to the legality of the issue below par of these one hundred and sixty shares, above referred to, to Mrs. Walsh.\nI am of opinion, as in fact all the judges below in dealing with the case seem to have held, that they were illegally issued and that the by-law and resolution upon which such issue purported to be based were absolutely void in so far as they authorized the issue of stock for a sum of money below par.\nThree considerations lead me to this conclusion.\nIn the first place it is elementary law that no joint stock company can issue stock below par unless authorized to do so by the legislature under whose authority it was created. A joint stock company is as a rule a trading association, and except for the limitations of its charter or of the creating statute each of its members would be liable to the uttermost farthing for every obligation of the association. The legislature however gives immunity to the shareholders either in whole or in part in consideration of each member paying in to the company\u2019s treasury a fund which in the judgment of the legislature will be sufficient protection to the public against its probable liabilities. In other words the company on behalf of its members contracts for their immunity from obligation in consideration of their providing a fund which the legislature on behalf of and for the protection of the public considered sufficient for that purpose, the dominant and cardinal principle being that the investor purchases immunity from liability beyond a certain limit on the terms that there shall be and remain a liability up to that limit. The principle that no joint stock company unless expressly authorized can issue its stock below par is taken for granted by this court in the case of McCraken v. Mclntyre ([39]), and has been reiterated over and over again in the House of Lords and Privy Council, notably in the recent cases of Ooregum Gold Mining Company of India v. Roper ([40]), and in Welton v. Saffery (3), so that so far as the general principle is concerned there can be no question of controversy. But it is contended that under the special provision of the Manitoba Joint stock Companies Incorporation Act, now chapter 25 of the revision of 1891, such special authority has been given or may be inferred as being possessed by companies incorporated under it. Section 30 is mainly relied upon in support of this contention. After providing that the directors may make any description of contract which the company might by law enter into and make by-laws not contrary to law or to the letters patent of the company to regulate the allotment of stock, the making of calls thereon, the payment thereof, the forfeiture of stock for non-payment and the disposal of the forfeited stock, etc., etc., it contains the following proviso.\nProvided also that no by-law for the allotment or sale of stock at any greater discount or any less premium than that which had been previously authorized at a general meeting or for the payment of the president or any director shall be valid or acted upon until the same has been confirmed at an annual meeting or a special general meeting. This proviso doubtless gives rise to some difficulty and at first sight would seem to lead to the conclusion that the legislature did suppose that the company might sell its stock at a discount without special authorization and enacted this particular clause under the impression that such was the law. There is no other provision in the statute indicating this intention except as may be inferred from the power of allotment. But the word \u201callotment\u201d has no connection whatever with the amount to be paid for stock, but only with the number of shares which may be issued to this or that individual altogether irrespective of the consideration to be paid for it. So that there being no conveyance of direct power to the directors, the proviso must refer either to cases where possibly the letters patent themselves give authority to issue, stock below par (on the legality of which I do not express an opinion), or to cases where the company incorporated under the general Act may have had special power conferred upon it by special Act, or it may possibly refer to cases where before issue of stock a general meeting has determined upon the amount beyond par at which the stock should be sold, and the proviso limits the power of the directors to issue below that amount except under the specified conditions. But whatever the draftsman of this clause or the legislature which passed it had in view, I am perfectly satisfied that it cannot be held to authorize the directors of the company to destroy its capital stock, as they have here to some extent attempted to do, and thereby nullify the checks and guards which the legislature has wisely provided in order to the protection of the public interest\nBut in addition to this it may be observed that any enactments of the legislature as to what the law is, is not of itself equivalent to the making of the law. The enactment is no doubt of great weight as evidence of the law, but it is by no means conclusive, and when the existing law is shewn to be different from that which the legislature supposed it to be, the implication arising from the statute cannot operate as a negation of its existence. Mollwo March & Co. v. Court of Wards ([41]).\nA misapprehension of the law by the legislature would not have the effect of making that the law which the legislature had erroneously assumed it to be. The Earl of Shrewsbury v. Scott ([42]).\nIn the second place the by-laws and resolutions are bad because, assuming the proviso to authorize the issue of stock below par, the issue in the present case was not confirmed at any annual or special meeting of the company.\nAnd in the third place the by-laws and resolutions were bad upon the general common law principle that a by-law must not be unreasonable or work unequally towards members of any one class affected by it. In the case of the present by-law there are many flagrant inequalities. McNaught and Graham were to get their stock upon payment of twenty per cent cash down. The Edison Electric Light Company were to get their stock upon payment of twenty per cent cash down, but in addition they were to hand over valuable patents in connection with the work of the company, while Mrs. Walsh and Mrs. Dexter, the wives of the two trustees specially charged to protect the interests of the company, were not required to pay cash down but were allowed a whole year to pay the twenty per cent.\nThis clear, manifest and gross favouritism stamps the by-law upon its face as invalid. I take it then to be clear for these reasons that the issue of the stock was illegal and ultra vires of the company.\nI am further of opinion that the company, so soon as they were aware of the fact that the directors had illegally issued the stock in question, not only had a perfect right but it was their duty not to repudiate the bargain but to enforce it by making the necessary calls.\nThe fact that the respondent held a paper which upon its face, stated that she held so much stock paid in full, while evidence of the statement, was not conclusive evidence of it. As a matter of fact, the stock was not fully paid up and the existence of the certificate could not by any possibility be equivalent to full payment. The statute gives power to the directors to call in and demand from the shareholders all sums of money due for payment of stock and to enforce all calls for interest thereon by action in a competent court.\nApart from the operation of the doctrine of estoppel I know of no reason why any holder of stock which has not been paid for in full should not be liable for the balance due in respect of it. The latest case dealing with this particular phase of the question is Bloomenthal v. Ford (1). That was a case where the appellant lent money to a limited company upon the terms that he should have as collateral security fully paid up shares in the company and the company handed to him certificates as of fully paid up shares. No money had in fact been paid upon the shares, but the appellant did not know this and believed the representation that they were fully paid up shares. It was held by the House of Lords that he was not liable to contribute in respect of these shares, but solely upon the ground of estoppel. Had he taken the shares as security for the loan knowing the fact that they had never been issued at all and had come direct from the company\u2019s treasury to him, it is clear that the House of Lords would have held him liable as a contributory.\nThen in the Ooregum Case ([43]), it was decided that the liquidator of the company should call upon the shareholders of the shares such as these in the present case for the balance due upon them for the purpose of paying the creditors of the company; while in Welton v. Saffery ([44]), carrying the doctrine to its fullest extent, it was held that shareholders might be called upon to contribute not only enough to liquidate the company\u2019s debts and the costs of winding up, but also a sufficient amount to adjust the rights of all the company\u2019s contributories inter se.\nIt is argued that inasmuch as there was a contract between the respondent and the company in respect to these shares, the company must confirm the contract in toto or not confirm it at all. I do not think that doctrine applies to a case such as this. This is not so much the case of a contract, the case of one party making a proposition and another accepting it in good faith. It is the case of a director having in his possession or under his control the treasury of the company and of his fraudulently, or to say the least, for his own personal advantage, helping himself to its contents at the expense of those whose interest he was bound to conserve and whose property he was obliged to protect.\nIn the present case the transaction would have been no different had these directors placed in the treasury an amount sufficient to pay for the stock they issued to themselves and then immediately taken out of it the eighty per cent, of their deposit. That is practically the present case. And to me it is impossible to conceive that when they are called upon to refund the eighty per cent dishonestly or illegally abstracted they can raise the defence which is made in the present case.\nWhat Lord Justice Turner said in the Daniell Case ([45]) is extremely applicable here.\nBut it was argued on Mr. Daniell\u2019s behalf that the shareholders could not claim against him except on the footing of the resolution and that if they claimed against him on that footing they must take the resolution as it stands, and treat him as a holder of shares in respect of which five pounds had been paid; that the contract into which he had entered could not be severed. This argument, however, rests as it seems to me upon this basis, that in determining this case we are to look to contract and to contract only, and I think that that basis is unsound. There was, in truth, no contract in this case. These shares were placed in the name of Dr. Daniell under no contract with the shareholders, but by the mere unauthorized act of the directors, of whom Dr. Daniell was one, and we are bound, I think, to consider this in determining the question before us. Taking then this consideration into account, how does this case stand ? These two thousand four hundred shares were assets of the company. Dr. Daniell appropriated two hundred of them to himself. By that appropriation they were prevented from being disposed of for the benefit of the company. Can trustees (and directors of companies are trustees, or quasi-trustees) appropriate the trust property to themselves, and then say to their cestuis que trustent: \u201cWe took this property on the terms that we should not be liable for any loss which might arise upon it ?\u201d I think a court of equity would not permit this, but would view the matter in this light; there is a double breach of trust, a breach of trust in taking the property at all, and a further breach of trust in introducing this stipulation into the contract, and the cestuis que trustent must have the option of affirming the one breach of trust and disaffirming the other.\nAnd so Lord Macnaghten in Welton v. Saffery (2), already referred to, says:\nThere, as it seems to me, lies the fallacy. How was the supposed contract made ? Who gave the requisite authority for making it ? Not the company, nor yet the shareholders. It is beyond the power of a limited company to limit the liability of the shareholders in a, manner inconsistent with the memorandum of association. The directors therefore had no authority from the company to issue shares at a discount, or on any terms relieving the shareholders from liability to pay in full. If the directors acted without authority, how can their action bind those who are supposed to have given them authority, but who, in \u0e40 fact, gave them none? The truth is, as it seems to me, that there never was a contract between the company or the shareholders on the one hand and the persons to whom these discount shares were offered on the other. There was an offer by the directors, purporting to act on behalf of the company, but it was an offer of that which the company could not give, because the law does not allow it. There was an acceptance by the discount shareholders of that offer. But that offer and acceptance could not constitute a contract. Both parties acted under a misconception of law, and the whole thing was void. The company, however, placed the names of the discount shareholders on the register; they allowed their names to remain until their remedy against the company was gone, and now they cannot be heard to say that they were not shareholders.\nI could have understood that argument if I could have found a contract. It may be well that one party to a contract cannot escape from his obligations by pleading incapacity to perform them in full if the other party is willing to take something less than that which is bargained for. But if there is no contract 1 cannot see what equity there is to compel a principal to submit to one set of conditions because his agent had attempted ineffectually to bind him to another and a different set.\nI take it that the maxim \u201capprobo non reprobo\u201d does not apply to or enure to the benefit of a trustee in transactions between him and his beneficiary when he has illegally attempted to secure a benefit for himself.\nThe beneficiary undoubtedly can approve and take advantage of all benefits accruing from his transactions and at the same time hold him responsible for all losses suffered therefrom.\nI am of opinion that the ground taken by the respondent, and upon which the learned judges in the court of appeal reversed the original judgment, are untenable.\nI think therefore that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ewart, Fisher & Wilson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Macdonald, Tupper, Phippen & Tupper.\n[1] 11 Man.

At the time of the sale C was not aware that the defendant was acting for an undisclosed principal and the name of a principal was not disclosed within the time limited for \u201csettlement\u201d of transactions by the custom of the exchange. The transferee\u2019s name was left blank in the transfer book in the bank, but it was noted in the margin that the shares were subject to the order of the defendant who, three days after settlement was due according to the custom of the exchange, made a further marginal memorandum that the shares were subject to the order of H. The affairs of the bank were placed in liquidation within a month after these transactions and the plaintiff\u2019s name being put upon the list of contributories, he was obliged to pay double liability upon the shares so transferred under the provisions of \u201cThe Bank Act,\u201d for which he afterwards recovered judgment against C and then, taking an assignment of C\u2019s right of indemnity against the defendant, instituted the present action.\nHeld, that as the defendant had not disclosed the name of any principal within the time limited for settlement by the custom of the Exchange and the shares had been placed at his order and disposition by the seller, he became legal owner thereof, without the necessity of any formal acceptance upon the transfer books and that he was obliged to indemnify the seller against all consequences in respect of the ownership of the shares, and the double liability imposed under the provisions of The Bank Act.\u201d\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court of the High Court of Justice[2] which had reversed the decision of the trial court and ordered a judgment to be entered in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff sued under an assignment from one Robert Cochran of a claim against the defendant which arose in respect of the sale of twenty shares of the Central Bank of Canada. The plaintiff, prior to the sale, was the owner of the shares and sold and transferred them to Cochran, who shortly afterwards sold them to the defendant. Within thirty days of this transfer the bank went into liquidation, and the plaintiff was placed on the list of contributories and compelled to pay double liability on the shares. The plaintiff claimed that Cochran was bound to indemnify him against such payment, and Cochran, while admitting such liability contended that Gzowski was in turn bound to indemnify him, and having assigned his claim to the plaintiff an action was brought by him against them both. In an action judgment was recovered against Cochran, but the action as against Gzowski was dismissed without prejudice to the rights of the plaintiff upon the ground that at the time of the assignment by Cochran he had no judgment against Gzowski, and that the right was not assignable at that time. The plaintiff obtained a new assignment from Cochran subsequent to the judgment against him, and then brought this action, which was dismissed with costs at the trial by Mr. Justice Meredith. On appeal to the Divisional Court, composed of Armour C.J. and Falconbridge and Street JJ., the trial court judgment was set aside and a judgment ordered to be entered against the defendant, Gzowski, for the amount of the judgment recovered against Cochran with interest and costs. The plaintiff now appeals from the judgment of the Court of Appeal which reversed the decision of the Divisional Court and restored the trial court judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs.\nThe facts of the case and questions at issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nH.J. Scott Q.C. for the appellant. The contract in this case may be summarized as being an offer by one party of a price for the stock and an acceptance by the other. This constituted a complete contract between the parties, and is the contract upon which this action is brought. It is a contract of the simplest kind, the purchase and sale of stock unaccompanied by any special terms and conditions. There was no necessity for any written contract nor was any entered into. The legal results of such a contract are: First, the duty on the part of the vendor to deliver the stock; Secondly, the duty on the part of the purchaser to take the stock when delivered, to pay for it and to accept it cum onere, that is to indemnify the vendor against all the consequences of ownership. It is upon this latter part of the contract that the appellant relies. Both Cochran and Gzowski are brokers and members of the Toronto Stock Exchange, which, unlike the London Stock Exchange, has no rules governing sales, and the rights of the parties depend upon the general principles of law apart from any special regulations, Maxted v. Paine[3]. All the judges agree upon this. See judgments of Meredith and Street JJ.[4]; and of Burton C.J.O., and Osler J.A.[5] See also the cases cited in the various judgments, and particularly Kellock v. Enthoven[6].\nCochran was therefore entitled, and appellant, as his assignee, is entitled to be indemnified by the respondent, for the amount for which judgment has been recovered against Cochran. The fact of acting for an undisclosed principal does not relieve the respondent from personal liability. The transfer to Henderson was really made by the respondent and he cannot by his own act be relieved from liability. As to transfers in blank see Lindley on Companies (5 ed.) pp. 471 and 472. The equitable ownership of shares, agreed to be sold, depends on the contract of sale and not on the form of transfer; consequently where there is a binding agreement for the sale and transfer of shares it is comparatively immaterial, as between the buyer and seller, whether a transfer in blank has been executed or not. Cases like Loring v. Davis[7] involving the doctrine of trustees and cestuis qui trust do not depend upon privity of contract and cannot affect the rights of parties under contracts.\nI refer also to Cabana, Money Securities, (2 ed.) p. 516; and the case of Hughes-Hallett v. The Indian Mammoth Gold Mines Co.[8]\nAylesworth Q.C. for the respondent. The plaintiff\u2019s liability as a contributory arose while he himself held the shares, and in consequence of his having held them within one month before the bank\u2019s suspension; but his recourse was preserved under the Act as against Henderson, to whom the shares had been transferred, and who, as the registered holder of the shares at the date of the bank\u2019s suspension was also made a contributory; R.S.C. c. 120, ss. 70 and 77. The master\u2019s decision upon the effect of these marginal transfers was considered and upheld In re Central Bank of Canada; Baines\u2019s Case[9], and the judgment of the master forms a complete bar to the plaintiff\u2019s claim and, under the present circumstances, there cannot be any liability on the part of the respondent towards the appellant. The obligation to indemnify is to be implied from the circumstances of the case in the sense of being the tacit agreement between the parties and not as being imposed by law whether the parties agreed to it tacitly or not; not to be forced upon them by law or in equity nolens volens.\nThe learned trial judge found that it was not contemplated that the defendant should in any case become the transferee, and that the real contract between the two brokers was, that defendant\u2019s firm should be personally answerable for the payment of the price of the shares on the day following the purchase, and that upon such payment Cochran would transfer them to any one defendant\u2019s firm might name, or by way of \u201cmarginal transfer\u201d put it in that firm\u2019s power to transfer the shares to any competent transferee, and that it was never contemplated by either that defendant should be in any case bound to take a transfer of the shares, or otherwise come under any personal liability in respect to them, beyond payment of the purchase money, and procurement of a valid transfer of them. The implied obligation was not that the transferee of the shares was to indemnify plaintiff against the double liability which arose whilst he was the holder of them but, more consistently with the principles of indemnification, it was that the purchaser had the right to call upon the plaintiff or upon Cochran, if he were really the vendor, for indemnity in respect of this liability. Humble v. Langston[10]. The principle of the case of Burnett v. Lynch[11] does not apply, and although Grissell v. Bristowe[12] deals particularly with the usages of the London Stock Exchange, note the remarks by Cockburn C.J. at page 50 of the report.\nThe evidence in no way warrants the conclusion that there was at any time a completed transaction of sale and purchase of these shares as between Cochran and the defendant. The effect of the adoption of the form of transfer used in the transaction was to prevent personal liability in respect to the shares from attaching to defendant, and the purpose and intent of the parties was that the shares might be transferred directly to and accepted by the real purchaser, Henderson. The transfer executed by Cochran became, as was intended, a transfer from him directly to Henderson, the real purchaser, establishing direct privity of contract between them. The marginal transfer executed by Cochran was a power of attorney from him to defendant\u2019s firm to put forward the person to whom the shares might be sold as the final purchaser, instead of the firm, and this is what was done, he was accepted as the transferee, and he became the shareholder, subject to the double liability, and liable, if any one was, to indemnify Cochran. A novation took place which precluded Cochran from asserting any demand against defendant in respect of their agreement. In Walker v. Bartlett[13] the defendant was the real purchaser, and yet was not bound to take a transfer of the shares in his own name, but could cause the shares to be registered in that of some other person to be named by him as the owner thereof, the seller having signed an order for a transfer of the shares, leaving a blank space for the name of the transferee. See also Hawkins v. Maltby[14] and Re Central Bank of Canada, Baines\u2019s and Nasmith\u2019s Cases[15].\nThe new Bank Act[16], in more clear and precise language makes plain the intention, that the \u201crecourse\u201d of shareholders who had transferred their shares within the prescribed time before the bank\u2019s suspension is and was intended to be against those only by whom such transferred shares were actually held at the time of the bank\u2019s suspension.\nThe cases relied upon by the appellant turn upon the view that under the rules of the English Stock Exchange the purchasing broker was held liable, not because he was deemed a purchaser, but because having under the Stock Exchange rules entered into an engagement to produce a purchaser within a certain time and have his name entered as the transferee, he had failed to perform some of the terms of the engagement and was to be held liable as if he had been the purchaser. The rules and usages of the London Stock Exchange are set out in Lindley\u2019s Law of Companies, (5 ed.) pp. 548 to 557. See also Fry on Specific Performance, (3 ed.) pp. 655 to 671, and the rules are given in full in a foot note to Grissell v. Bristowe[17] begining at page 53. The inquiry in these cases was, who was the purchaser, and if the court is not able to find any other purchaser at all competent to deal with the vendor, then the person who assumed to make the contract with the vendor is deemed to be the purchaser. I refer to remarks on the case of Kellock v. Enthoven[18] in the judgment of the learned trial judge and the cases there cited by him in that connection. The cases referred to by Mr. Justice Street are inapplicable to the circumstances of this case, because the liability (if any) of a purchaser to indemnify his vendor lasts only as long as the purchaser is the registered owner or holder; Shaw v. Fisher[19]. The respondent never held the shares at all; or, if he ever held them, he had parted with them before the liability in respect of which he is now sued, arose; the liability (if any) which arose during the time defendant held the shares, (if he ever held them,) was a liability on the shares in respect of which Cochran might or could be held liable, and not a liability on the shares in respect of which defendant could be rendered liable which arose while he held them, if he ever did so. Lastly it is found and determined as against the appellant in such a manner as to be res judicata against him and to estop him from now contending the contrary, that Cochran was not damnified until after the commencement of the action in which judgment was recovered against him; therefore, the liability in respect of which the appellant is sued did not arise while he held the shares, if he ever held them. Henderson, as the real purchaser and transferee, became directly responsible and liable to the vendor Cochran in respect of any liability or obligation against which the purchaser of shares is liable to indemnify his vendor, and Cochran\u2019s remedy was and is against Henderson. Brown v. Black[20]; Evans v. Wood[21]; Maxted v. Paine[22]; Coles v. Bristowe[23]; Grissell v. Bristowe[24]; Paine v. Hutchinson[25]; Bowring v. Shepherd[26]; Loring v. Davis[27].\nThe effect was that Cochran as vendor accepted Henderson either as the original purchaser or as a sub-purchaser from the appellant, entitled to a transfer of the shares, and transferred the shares to Henderson at the respondent\u2019s request; and this dealing put an end to any liability on the part of the respondent to indemnify Cochran, if any ever existed. All liability of the respondent (if any ever existed) ended with the payment of the purchase money and the transfer to Henderson accepted by him, and this remedy being against Henderson, he is not entitled also against the respondent Gzowski, who only acted as intermediary between the real parties to the transaction, and the appellant has no higher or better right than Cochran, who by his own act, made the transfer directly from him to Henderson. See Castellan v. Hobson[28] also Coles v. Bristowe[29]. Moreover the right (if any) of the appellant was and is barred by the proceedings and judgment in the former action referred to in the judgments in this action.\nThe rules of the Toronto Stock Exchange provide for the settlement of disputes arising between members in reference to any transaction entered into between them in the exercise of their profession as stockbrokers by arbitrators, members of the board, and the matter of defendant\u2019s liability (if any) was and is a matter to be determined between him and Cochran according to the rules of the Exchange, and no assignment by Cochran could put an end to this right to have the matter determined and disposed of in the domestic forum. At all events there is no recourse to the courts until after the domestic forum has been invoked. Field v. Court Hope of A.O.F.[30]; Essery v. Court Pride of the Dominion[31]. In fact this question was before the assignment by Cochran duly dealt with and determined by the Toronto Stock Exchange in favour of the respondent, and both Cochran and the appellant are bound by that decision or determination.\nTASCHEREAU J. (dissenting).\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. I concur in my brother Gwynne\u2019s reasoning.\nGWYNNE J. (dissenting).\u2014In the conclusion arrived at by the learned judge who tried this case, and by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, unanimously, that this action must be dismissed, I entirely concur.\nThe plaintiff Boultbee, who was examined as a witness on his own behalf says that upon the 21st or 22nd of October, 1887, being desirous of selling some shares, paid up in full of the capital stock of the Central Bank which stood in his name on the stock registry book of the bank, he employed a Mr. Cochran, a practising broker on the Toronto Stock Exchange, to sell twenty of such shares for him, and he then signed a printed paper which Cochran presented to him for his signature. He does not think that he read the paper, and he cannot say what it was save that he supposes it was a power of attorney or some authority enabling Cochran to sell the shares for him. He says that on the following day he went to Cochran to see if the shares had been sold, and that Cochran then informed him that he had not succeeded in selling them; that he again went the next day for the like purpose, and was again informed that the shares had not yet been sold, and that a short time after he called again, and in fact that he called every day until the affair was completed by Cochran giving him his cheque for $1,940, being at the rate of $97 per share for the twenty shares. He never signed any paper whatever save that above spoken of when he employed Cochran as his broker to sell the shares for him; after the receipt of the said sum of $1,940 as the proceeds of the sale of his shares, he never heard anything more of the matter until the failure of the bank, when there arose a discussion as to who was liable to the liquidators of the bank for the statutory double liability on the shares.\nNow upon Saturday, the 22nd day of October, 1887, a Mr. Henderson employed Messrs. Gzowski and Buchan, who were also brokers practising on the Toronto Stock Exchange, to purchase for him thirty shares in the capital stock of the said bank. Upon the next business day namely, Monday the 24th of October, 1887, the secretary of the Stock Exchange in the ordinary manner according to the usage and practice of the Toronto Stock Exchange, called up Central Bank stocks for transactions on change when Gzowski and Buchan acting as brokers for Mr. Henderson, bid $97 per share for ten shares, which Cochran, acting as vendor\u2019s broker, agreed to accept, and the transaction on change was thereupon closed at that price. The usage and practice of the Toronto Stock Exchange for brokers purchasing stock for their principals is to pay upon the next business day after the transaction on change, the amount fixed by such transaction to the vendor\u2019s broker, and subsequently, within a reasonable time, for no time is limited for that purpose by any rule of the Toronto Stock Exchange, the transaction is closed by a formal transfer of the shares by the vendor in the stock transfer book of the bank, and upon the purchaser signing underneath the transfer an acceptance thereof, the transfer is effected. There were no certificates of shares in the Central Bank transferred by the vendor\u2019s broker to the purchaser\u2019s broker leaving it to the purchaser to have his name entered as owner upon the stock registry book; the only transfer of shares in the Central Bank stock was effected by the above formal transfer and the acceptance thereof in the share transfer book of the bank. Upon the 25th day of the said month of October, Messrs. Gzowski and Buchan, in accordance with the usage and practice of the Toronto Stock Exchange, gave their cheque to Mr. Cochran for $970, the price of the ten shares bid for by them on the preceding day, and upon the same 25th day of October, they in like manner as upon the 24th, bid $95 per share for twenty-five other shares in the Central Bank stock, which bid Cochran, also acting as vendor\u2019s broker, accepted, and this transaction was closed at that price in the ordinary course of the stock exchange as on the preceding day. For these twenty-five shares Gzowski and Buchan gave their cheque to Mr. Cochran upon the 26th of October for $2,375, according to the usage and practice of brokers purchasing shares for their clients upon the Toronto Stock Exchange. There is in these transactions so closed on change no mention made of any particular shares, nor of any particular owner or owners of the shares contracted for. These are matters which, as is well understood by the contracting brokers, are never disclosed until shares in fulfilment of the vendor\u2019s broker\u2019s contract come to be transferred in the share transfer book of the bank. But although it never is disclosed on change who a broker is selling or purchasing shares for, still there can be no doubt now upon the evidence in the case that in point of fact as to thirty of the thirty-five shares so bid for and paid for by Gzowski and Buchan, they were purchased and paid for on behalf of Mr. Henderson, the actual purchaser through his brokers Gzowski and Buchan; and it is equally clear, I think, upon the evidence, that as to twenty of those thirty-five shares, Mr. Cochran was acting merely as broker for Mr. Boultbee, the actual owner and vendor of those shares. Mr. Cochran\u2019s evidence was not given with that precision which one would expect from a broker who could, or at least should, have no doubt whether in his transactions on the Stock Exchange he was acting as a vendor of his own property or as broker for a client. Still however, notwithstanding his want of precision, the fact I think does abundantly appear that he was acting as broker for Mr. Boultbee who was the real owner and vendor of twenty of the thirty-five shares. It is proved by the evidence of Mr. Boultbee himself that he never signed any paper relating to the shares unless it was a power of attorney to Cochran to sell the shares for him, and that upon several days after conferring such power upon Cochran he was informed by Cochran that the shares had not yet been sold, and upon a subsequent occasion he received a sum of money from Cochran as the proceeds of the sale of the shares; it is established therefore that Boultbee had never executed any instrument purporting to transfer himself the shares to any one. Mr. Cochran on his examination as a witness for the plaintiff admitted that in his dealings with Gzowski and Buchan on the said 24th and 25th of October, he was pursuing his ordinary calling of a broker buying and selling on the stock exchange, and that he then sold twenty shares of Central Bank stock for Mr. Boultbee; in another place he says that he believes he sold them for him; that he did so, is abundantly apparent from other passages in his evidence. He produced a book containing entries as to these transactions. It contained an entry of a charge \u201cto Central Bank stock, 20 shares at $97, from Boultbee.\u201d That entry he said might be read either that he sold for Boultbee or possibly that he bought for himself; but he added that he did not think the latter was likely and he repeated that it was not likely\u2014that it was not what he was in for. This book also shewed two payments on the 24th October, and he said that he gave Mr. Boultbee a cheque for $1940 representing as he said 20 shares at $97 per share; as shewn above he had contracted with Gzowski & Co. for the sale of 10 shares at $97 per share, and he himself had also stated that he had sold 10 shares on the 24th and twenty-five on the 25th October to Gzowski & Co. He was asked then to explain how he came to pay Boultbee on the 24th, to which he answered that he did not know how he paid him more than he had sold for, and added that \u201cit was very foolish.\u201d This was all the explanation that Mr. Cochran could give, or at least did give, that it was very foolish for him to give Mr. Boultbee more for his shares than he had sold them for. An explanation might possibly be found in the fact that the sale of the ten shares to Gzowski & Co. on the 24th having fixed the price on change on that day, and as Mr. Boultbee was, as appears by his own evidence, very urgent upon Mr. Cochran to effect a sale, the latter may have given his cheque for the 20 shares at the rate at which the ten had been sold to Gzowski & Co. not doubting that he would be able to sell the other ten shares for the like amount; in this however, he was disappointed, for the 25 shares sold on the 25th realized only $95 per share, or possibly he might have sold ten shares to some one else of which we have heard nothing. Then being asked to fix the day on which he sold Boultbee\u2019s shares he could not say for the reason that as he said he could not tell which were Boultbee\u2019s shares \u201cbecause all that stock\u201d (namely the thirty-five shares sold to Gzowski & Co.) \u201cwas probably in my own name,\u201d an expression the significance of which will appear later. The evidence as already shewn, clearly establishes that Cochran and Gzowski and Buchan were respectively acting as brokers for undisclosed principals in accordance with the usage and practice of the Toronto Stock Exchange, which usage and practice is, like the usage and practice of the London Stock Exchange \u201cnot dissimilar,\u201d as is said in Torrington v. Lowe[32] \u201cto the usage and practice of other branches of commerce,\u201d and the question which remains simply is: What was the nature and effect of the contract entered into between Cochran as vendor\u2019s broker, and Gzowski and Buchan as purchaser\u2019s brokers, in respect of the said thirty-five shares at the time of the respective transactions which took place on change being there closed in relation to such thirty-five shares? And the plain construction of such transactions, as was well understood and intended by the contracting brokers, in my opinion is, that Cochran as a vendor\u2019s broker thereby undertook upon receipt from Gzowski and Buchan, acting as purchaser\u2019s brokers, in accordance with the usage and practice of the Toronto Stock Exchange, of the monies agreed by them to be paid for the shares to cause thirty-five shares to be transferred in the transfer share book of the bank unto the nominees or a nominee of Gzowski & Co., so that such nominees or nominee could become legal owners or owner thereof on the shareholders\u2019 list in the bank; and Gzowski and Buchan upon their part contracted to pay the price agreed upon for the shares on change in accordance with the usage and practice of the Toronto Stock Exchange, and further to provide a person or persons to accept such shares in the share transfer book of the bank. When Gzowski and Buchan paid, as they did pay, the price agreed upon for the shares nothing remained for the completion of their contract by Gzowski and Buchan but to produce a person or persons who should accept a transfer or transfers of the shares in the transfer book of the bank as provided in section 24 of ch. 120 R.S.C. and who should thereby assume all responsibility attached to being owners or owner of shares so transferred, which liability, as the shares were all paid up in full, consisted wholly, in so far as the vendors or a vendor of the shares or any of them were or was concerned, in an obligation to idemnify the vendors of the shares so transferred against any loss which might be occasioned (in the event of the bank becoming insolvent) by force of the provisions of section 77 of the said ch. 120 which enacts that\npersons who, having been shareholders in the bank, have only transferred their shares or any of them to others, or registered the transfer thereof within one month before the commencement of the suspension of payment by the bank, shall be liable to all calls on such shares as if they had not transferred them, saving their recourse against those to whom they were transferred.\nNow the proceeding adopted by Mr. Cochran for the purpose of fulfilling his part of the above contract appears to have been, as to twenty shares, for we have no information as to the other fifteen, balance of the thirty-five shares, that he went to the bank and signed in the share transfer book of the bank a blank transfer of twenty shares fully paid up in the capital stock of the bank, at the foot of which entry in the bank transfer book is subjoined the acceptance following by Mr. Henderson for whom Gzowski and Buchan had acted as purchasers brokers.\nI do hereby accept the foregoing assignment of twenty shares in the stock of the Central Bank of Canada assigned to me as above mentioned at the bank this 29th day of October, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-seven.\n(Signed)J.D. HENDERSON.\nFrom the time of the signing by Mr. Henderson of this acceptance he has been accepted and entered on the books of the bank as the owner of twenty fully paid up shares as so transferred, or intended so to be, and as such owner he has been entered on the list of contributories upon the winding up of the bank, and as such transferee he has assumed the burthen imposed by ch. 120 R.S.C. upon transferees of shares in the bank. The circumstances under which Mr. Henderson thus became the acceptor, transferee and owner of these twenty shares were that, in the margin of the blank transfer which Cochran had signed in the share transfer book of the bank, he inserted the words \u201csubject to the order of Gzowski and Buchan. R.C.\u201d\nMr. Cochran in his evidence says that this was the ordinary mode adopted by the bank for enabling transfers to be perfected; the ordinary way, he said, was to give the above order the object being, as he explained, that Gzowski and Buchan might either accept the shares themselves in the share transfer book of the bank, or nominate somebody else who should so accept them without Gzowski and Buchan themselves becoming transferees of the shares. This was the mode adopted by the bank of complying with sec. 29 of the ch. 120 R.S.C. which enacted that no assignment or transfer should be valid unless it is made and registered and accepted by the person to whom the transfer is made in a book or books kept by the directors for that purpose.\nNow this marginal order so made by Mr. Cochran had no further operation than to direct the bank to accept as Mr. Cochran\u2019s transferee of the twenty shares whomsoever Messrs. Gzowski and Buchan should nominate, and accordingly Gzowski and Buchan with this intent inserted on the margin of the blank transfer signed by Cochran in the share transfer book of the bank below the marginal order signed by Mr. Cochran with his initials \u201cR.C.\u201d the words following \u201csubject to the order of J.D. Henderson, G. & B.\u201d In accordance with this order Mr. Henderson signed the acceptance of the shares and thereby became Cochran\u2019s transferee and the owner of the shares covered by the blank transfer in direct succession to Cochran on the bank books, and thereby also Gzowski and Buchan fulfilled in every particular their contract made with Cochran in so far as 20 shares of the thirty-five contracted for were concerned.\nThis case is to be governed by the usage and practice of the Toronto Stock Exchange just as much as transactions on the London Stock Exchange are governed by the usage and practice of that exchange, and there is no necessity that such usage and practice should be evidenced by written rules. By Mr. Cochran\u2019s own evidence it is sufficiently established that he inserted the marginal order in the blank transfer in accordance with the ordinary usage and practice of brokers on the Toronto Stock Exchange, and for the express purpose of enabling Gzowski and Buchan to nominate the person to accept the transfer and who upon acceptance thereof in the share transfer book of the bank should become transferee and owner of the twenty shares. Upon the London Stock Exchange there is a certain class of persons called \u201cjobbers\u201d who purchase shares on change for speculation, and who are allowed to pass their contract through various hands before ever any person is found to accept and become the actual purchaser of such shares; a day is fixed which is called the name day, by which the jobber must name a person who shall accept and hold the shares so dealt with. Whether there is any usage or practice upon the Toronto Stock Exchange in relation to such \u201cjobbers\u201d does not appear, nor is it material that it should appear in the present case which was plainly one of a purchase by Gzowski and Buchan as brokers for their client a purchaser for investment, and not at all a purchase by themselves for \u201cjobbing\u201d and speculative purposes. The name day in the case of \u201cjobbers\u201d in England, is fixed for the purpose of closing the further \u201cjobbing\u201d with the shares so purchased. By this day the \u201cjobber\u201d must find a person to take the shares as the actual purchaser and owner, or be himself held to his purchase. When a person is so produced to accept the shares as the purchaser, the transaction with the purchasing jobber on change is brought to the same point as in the case of a bon\u00e2 fide purchase on change by a broker for his client, who is the real purchaser and as such accepts and takes a transfer of the shares contracted for by his broker. Merry v. Nickalls[33] must govern the present case. It lays down the law as now finally established after much contrariety of opinion. The case was one where shares were purchased on change by a \u201cjobber,\u201d but an actual purchaser had been found for the shares by the name-day.\nNow that judgment and the rule of law thereby established is in its principle precisely applicable to the case of a broker who purchases for a client who pays for and accepts a transfer of the shares and therefore can be equally applied to the circumstances of a transaction like the present. It is there said in the House of Lords that\nit is to be considered as now settled that if the jobber in performance of his contract gives to the broker of the seller the name of a person who is able to contract and is willing to be named as purchaser of the shares and the name is accepted on the part of the seller, the jobber is discharged.\nNow applying the principle of that rule, so said to be established as settled law after much difference of opinion, to the case of a contract like the present, as made between Cochran as vendor\u2019s broker, and Gzowski and Buchan as brokers of an actual bon\u00e2 fide purchaser for investment, it seems beyond controversy that when Cochran entered in the margin of the transfer in blank signed by him in the share transfer book of the bank the order and direction that Gzowski and Buchan\u2019s nominee should be accepted and entered as transferee, and when Henderson who was such nominee signed the acceptance of the transfer in the share transfer book and was entered in the bank books as transferee and owner of the shares mentioned in the blank transfer, Gzowski and Buchan became thereupon absolutely discharged from their contract with Cochran or his principal and from all responsibility whatever in respect thereof. This, as it appears to me, is the true and rational construction of this transaction construed as it must be by the usage and practice of the Toronto Stock Exchange where the transaction took place by the intention and understanding of the parties to the contract, and by the mode of transfer in the share transfer book of the bank adopted by the bank; and it is the construction which is in conformity with the principle of the rule applicable to the case as now finally established by the House of Lords in Nickalls v. Merry[34].\nThis mode of effecting transfers of shares from a vendor to a purchaser upon a purchase contracted through brokers on change by means of these orders inserted in the margin of transfers in blank signed by the vendor appeared in the winding up proceedings of the Central Bank to have been much abused for the purpose of purely jobbing transactions upon a most extensive scale, being thereby carried on by the bank itself and its officers and other persons, passing from hand to hand through divers persons, the original contract made on change for jobbing and speculation solely before ever any person should become transferee of the shares, and these jobbing transactions were carried to such an extent as to cause the failure of the bank, and its affairs to be wound up in liquidation; but such abuses so practised cannot effect a case like the present in which the purchasing broker\u2019s client, and for whom alone in point of fact the brokers acted in contracting with Cochran as a vendor\u2019s broker for the shares in question, accepts in due form of law in the bank books the transfer in blank therein made and signed by Cochran, who thereby assumed for the first time in the transaction the position of vendor. It is perfectly clear upon the evidence that Gzowski and Buchan did not nor did either of them, ever intend to become or contract to become, or in point of fact become transferees or transferee of the shares in question, or of any of them. They never in point of fact acted in the transactions relating to these shares or any of them in any other capacity than as brokers for Henderson, who has accepted the transfer of the shares as made by Cochran, and all the obligations attached by law to such transfer.\nIf Gzowski and Buchan had failed to nominate a person who should accept a transfer thereof in the bank transfer book as they had by their transaction on change contracted with Cochran to do, they would doubtless have been liable in an action at suit of the vendor for all damages accruing to him by such their breach of contract, but that is a very different thing from the liability which is attempted to be imposed on them in the present action, which is simply in effect that a broker acting on change for a purchaser is bound to indemnify a vendor against all damage, in the event of his client after acceptance of a transfer of the shares on the books of the bank fail- ing to discharge the obligations imposed upon him by his so becoming transferee of the shares.\nThe Divisional Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in their judgment which reverses the judgment of the learned trial judge whose judgment the Court of Appeal for Ontario have restored, proceeded, first, upon the misconstruction of the contract made on change between Cochran and Gzowski and Buchan, holding it to be similar to that in Walker v. Bartlett[35], which was a contract not made on change at all or even between brokers, but between the actual owner and vendor of the shares and the actual real purchaser thereof for his own use and benefit, and holding further that the transfer in blank executed by Cochran is to be regarded as having been so executed for the mere convenience of Gzowski and Buchan in the sense that the blank transfer in Walker v. Bartlett, which was shown in evidence to have been so executed by the direction of, and solely for the convenience of the defendant, who was himself and for himself alone the actual purchaser of the shares. The court thus assumed that Gzowski and Buchan were the actual real purchasers and intended transferees of the shares on the bank books, thus ignoring altogether the evidence in the case, and the usage and practice of brokers on the stock exchange, subject to which the brokers were contracting, as was well understood by them and as is explained and admitted by Mr. Cochran himself in his evidence. The court seems to have assumed that brokers practising on the Toronto Stock Exchange could not be governed in their transactions on change by any usage or practice not evidenced by written rules, but there is nothing to prevent persons contracting, wherever the contract may be entered into, namely, whether on change or elsewhere, from contracting in accordance with the usage of a particular trade, or with any well understood usage in relation to a particular matter. All transactions must be construed in accordance with the plain intention of the parties to the contract with relation to contracts on change. Merry v. Nickales[36] is a conclusive authority that they must be construed in accordance with the usage and practice of brokers, and that such usage may be evidenced partly by oral evidence, partly by written rules. As to the practice and usage of the Toronto Stock Exchange, as affecting the transactions in question here, there is no conflict of evidence. The contract entered into on change by Gzowski and Buchan as already shown was not in relation to any particular shares, nor as to the shares of any particular vendors, but that they would pay for (which they did) thirty shares in the Central Bank to be transferred by Cochran to some persons or person to be nominated by Gzowski and Buchan, who should accept such transfer in the bank transfer book, and relieve the owner from, and indemnify him against all the obligatians imposed upon him as vendor and transferor of the shares. Now that Walker v. Bartlett[37] has no application to the present case is apparent from this, that there the defendant was the actual purchaser of the shares who had himself contracted for the purchase for his own sole use and benefit, but as it was necessary that as purchaser he should be entered as such upon the stock registry of the company whose shares he was purchasing, he requested that the vendor should deliver to him a transfer in blank so that he might substitute the name of some other person as the transferee, and accordingly the vendor (at the purchaser\u2019s request and for his sole convenience, not for the purpose of doing anything which was part of the vendor\u2019s contract to do) delivered to the defendant a transfer in blank, and the defendant having failed to have the name of any other person inserted as transferee, and having thus suffered the vendor\u2019s name to remain on the stock registry list of the company, was held bound to indemnify the vendor from obligations to which he was subjected so long as his name appeared on that list. But in the present case, Gzowski and Buchan never put themselves forward as the actual purchasers of the shares or any of them, nor was the transfer in blank executed by Cochran at their request, or in point of fact for their mere convenience, but in accordance with the well known usage and practice of the bank in relation to the transfer of shares bought and sold on change from a vendor to the purchasing broker\u2019s client, and to enable such purchasing brokers to nominate their client the actual purchaser of the shares and the person to be inserted transferee thereof in the bank book, which they did, and he in the usual form accepted the transfer and the obligations incident thereto.\nThe Divisional Court also relied upon the case of Kellock v. Enthoven in the Exchequer Chamber[38]. That case also, as pointed out by the learned trial judge, has no application in the present case, for there, the person made liable to indemnify the plaintiff, the vendor, was a person to whom the shares had actually been transferred upon the stock registry and who although he had sold and in like manner transferred the shares to another, was made liable to the vendors who had so transferred the shares to the defendant under sec. 38 of 25 & 26 Vict. ch. 89. In precise accordance with this judgment is sec. 77 of ch. 120 R.S.C. which alone imposes upon the persons therein mentioned who have ceased to be shareholders in a bank, the same liability as is imposed by sec. 70 upon the share- holders at the time of a bank becoming insolvent, as if the persons affected by the sec. 77 \u201chad not transferred their shares saving their recourse against those to whom they were transferred,\u201d but as Gzowski and Buchan never were, nor was either of them, such transferees or a transferee of any of the shares in question, this case of Kellock v. Enthoven[39] is inapplicable in the present case.\nSecondly, the Divisional Court proceeded upon the ground that in their opinion the double liability under sec. 77 of the ch. 120 is a liability inseparably attached to the shares themselves which are transfered precisely in the same manner as the liability to pay a mortgage upon real estate is attached to the assignment of the equity of redemption in the estate mortgaged and becomes imposed upon every assignee of such equity of redemption, but if this ratio decidendi should prevail, then first, the liability to indemnify a vendor of shares against the double liability which is imposed by sec. 77 of ch. 120, would pass to and upon the ultimate transferee of the shares \u201cwithin the month preceding the commencement of the suspension of payments by the bank,\u201d which would be contrary to the express provision for recourse which, by the section, is reserved to the transferor against his transferee, which transferee must be the person to whom the transfer of shares is made under sec. 29 of the Act. And secondly, if the liability by sec. 77 is attached to the shares transferred in the same manner as the liability to discharge a mortgage upon an estate is attached to the assignment of the equity of redemption in the estate mortgaged then of necessity the identity of the shares to which such liability is attached must needs be unequivocally apparent on the instrument transferring them, but in the instrument executed by Cochran as a transfer which Henderson accepted there are no shares mentioned so as to be capable of identification by numbers or otherwise, as having been shares which Boultbee ever owned. How the bank determined what shares should be appropriated by them to Henderson as representing the shares which he had bought through Gzowski and Buchan as his brokers, we have no means of knowing, nor are we now concerned to inquire, but what we do know from Cochran\u2019s own evidence, is that he could not distinguish which of the thirty-five shares which he contracted with Gzowski and Buchan to sell belonged to Mr. Boultbee, for the reason that as he said, all those shares\u2014not were his own property\u2014but \u201cprobably were in his name.\u201d What he meant by this expression is not apparent, for there is proved to be in the share transfer book of the bank a paper purporting to be a transfer not of any particular shares capable of being identified by numbers or otherwise, but of \u201ctwenty shares,\u201d in the stock of the bank as from Boultbee to Cochran executed by Cochran himself as attorney for Boultbee to Cochran himself, and accepted by him and dated the 22nd October, 1887, the day on or about which Boultbee had given to Cochran a power of attorney to sell twenty shares for him. Of this instrument by way of transfer it is plain upon Boultbee\u2019s evidence that he was not aware when several days after having giving the power of attorney to Cochran he received from Cochran the proceeds of the shares as sold for him by Cochran on change\u2014a sum in excess, to Cochran\u2019s surprise, of the amount for which as he says he has sold the shares and had gotten for them. In fact Boultbee could have had no knowledge of this instrument purporting to be a transfer to Cochran until after the failure of the bank, for he says in his evidence that from the day of his receiving the proceeds of the sale of his shares on change for him by Cochran, he never heard anything in relation to the matter until after the failure of the bank, when as he says, discussions arose as to who were liable for the double liability. Then for the first time it would seem that he heard how the transaction had been carried out by Cochran, and then he took proceedings in the liquidation of the bank against Gzowski and Buchan claiming that they, as purchasers of his shares, should indemnify him against his statutory liability. In that proceeding he failed, but now for the purpose of effecting what he then failed in, through the intervention of Cochran he adopts the document so executed by Cochran bearing date the 22nd October, 1887, as evidencing a sale made by him to Cochran, while his own evidence and also Cochran\u2019s, plainly proves that no such sale ever took place; Cochran says in his evidence that in dealing with Gzowski and Buchan in respect of the thirty-five shares he was dealing as vendor\u2019s broker, and that he could not tell which of the thirty-five shares were Boultbee\u2019s for that all were probably in his own name, and he could not understand how he did such a foolish thing as pay to Boultbee as the proceeds of the sale of his shares on change, more than he had sold them for. His practice appears to have been that upon receiving from his client a power of attorney to sell shares for him he put them into his own name by permission of the bank authorities. By this mode of dealing with his client\u2019s property without his authority it is not strange that he should be unable to distinguish what shares were intended by a sale when the shares were not identified by numbers or otherwise. When he executed the blank transfer which Henderson accepted he may have had fifty or one hundred shares standing in his name, but all really belonging to different clients, or partly to clients and partly to himself as the real owner; when then he transferred or executed an instrument purporting to transfer shares not identified by numbers or otherwise, it is natural that neither he, or any one else could say to what particular shares any such transfer related; what loss to his clients and what complications would be created by this mode of conducting the business by a broker, in respect of shares which he was authorised to sell for his clients and by this absence of identification of the shares sold by him and professed to be transferred by him, we are not concerned in the present case; all that is necessary for the present purpose is to show that adopting the ratio decidendi upon which the Divisional Court proceeded, it is impossible for the plaintiff to succeed in the present action, for the onus probandi wholly lies upon him, and upon the evidence in the present case it is impossible upon this record judicially to say that any shares of which Boultbee had been the owner were ever transferred to any one by Cochran.\nThen again, Cochran was not in the liquidation proceedings charged with any liability to the liquidators of the bank under sec. 77 of the Act, as a person who had been a shareholder within the month preceeding the commencement of suspension but who had transferred his shares before the suspension, so that his transferee does not seem to have been liable to any action for indemnity at his suit in virtue of the provisions of sec. 77. If his transferee could be liable in any action at his suit it must be independently of that section; and the liability is assumed to be of this nature\u2014that Cochran\u2019s transferee by force of the transfer from him is under an implied obligation to indemnify him against an implied obligation which it is contended he lies under to Boultbee to indemnify him under sec. 77 as being the transferee from Boultbee of his shares. But as it appears in evidence that Boultbee never did in point of fact transfer any shares to Cochran a grave question would arise whether or not Cochran\u2019s irregular and unauthorized dealing with Boultbee\u2019s shares, which he was authorised to sell and professed to have sold for him on change, created any liability to indemnify Boultbee under the provisions of sec. 77 against the obligation imposed upon him by that section or whether Cochran\u2019s liability to Boultbee would not in such case arise rather out of and by reason of his irregular dealing with Boultbee\u2019s shares; and in the latter case, whether or not his transferee, who had no knowledge that he was acquiring by a transfer from Cochran any shares in which Boultbee had any interest, would be under any obligation to indemnify Cochran in the interest of Boultbee against such his obligation to Boultbee. But it is unnecessary to consider these points further now, or to do more than suggest that these questions would seem to require more consideration than they have received if the case must needs be decided upon the ratio decidendi upon which the Divisional Court proceeded. But for the reasons first above given, I am clearly of opinion that the judgment of the learned trial judge and of the Court of Appeal for Ontario should be affirmed, and this appeal dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014There is little or no dispute as to the facts of the case, and they are very simple. The appellant Boultbee, prior to the 26th of October, 1887, was owner of twenty shares of the stock of the Central Bank of Canada, and he sold them to Robert Cochran, a stock broker, doing business in the Toronto Stock Exchange. On the 24th of October they were put up for sale by Cochran on the stock exchange and were purchased by a firm of stock brokers, Messrs. Gzowski and Buchan, according to the usual course of business on the exchange. Cochran sold as principal, and Gzowski and Buchan purchased for an undisclosed principal, one J.B. Henderson, who it would appear was neither then, nor has he been since, a person of any means. On the 26th of October the buyers paid Cochran for the shares so purchased whereupon the latter went to the office of the bank and signed a transfer, leaving out of the body of the transfer the name of the transferee, but writing in the margin opposite the blank where the transferee\u2019s name under ordinary circumstances would be: \u201csubject to the order of Gzowski & Buchan.\u201d Subsequently Gzowski went to the bank and wrote under the marginal note initialled by Cochran the words \u201csubject to the order of J.B. Henderson, G. & B.\u201d and subsequently, on the 29th of October Henderson signed an acceptance of those shares, all of the documents so far as the present question is concerned, being as follows:\nSubject to the order of Gzowski & Buchan. (Sgd.) R.C.\nFor value received from\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026I, R. Cochran, of Toronto, do hereby assign and transfer unto\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..of\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..twenty shares (on each of which has been paid\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.dollars), amounting to the sum of two thousand dollars in the capital stock of the Central Bank of Canada, subject to the rules and regulations of the said bank.\nWitness my hand at the said bank, this 26th day of October, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-seven.\nSubject to the order of J.D. Henderson. (Sgd.) G. & B.\n(Sgd.) ROBERT COCHRAN.\nWitness: (Sgd.) A.B. ORDE.\nWithin thirty days from the time that Boultbee made his transfer to Cochran and Cochran made the transfer just set out, the Central Bank of Canada went into liquidation, and Boultbee was placed on the list of contributories and compelled to pay the liquidators of the bank $2,125 as double liability on his shares pursuant to the provisions of the Bank Act. He thereupon sued Cochran and obtained a judgment against him for the amount so paid to the liquidators. Cochran thereupon transferred his claim of indemnity against Gzowski & Buchan to Boultbee, and Boultbee, brought this action as such assignee for the purpose of obtaining indemnity from the latter.\nThere is, as I have said, practically no dispute about the facts. The transaction on the boards of the Stock Exchange of the 24th of October was an ordinary transaction of the simplest kind, Cochran offering for sale the shares in question, Gzowski purchasing them at the price named and a memorandum being made of the transaction by an officer of the exchange. There was nothing more, nothing less than this; no special terms or conditions of any kind. There is not much doubt in ordinary cases as to the legal results of such a contract. They are (1) the duty on the part of the seller to deliver the stock; (2) the duty on the part of the buyer to take the stock when delivered, to pay for it and to accept it cum onere, that is to indemnify the seller against all the consequences of ownership. It is so laid down by Blackburn J. in Maxted v. Paine[40].\nOn the other hand the buyer would be bound not only to pay the price and to accept the benefits of ownership, but also to relieve the seller from all the burthens of ownership.\nAnd in Lindley on Companies, 5 ed. p. 492:\nThe obligation of the purchaser is to pay the price agreed upon and to accept a transfer of the shares and to indemnify the vendor from all liability in respect of them accruing after the purchaser has become their equitable owner.\nAnd at p. 493:\nThe obligation of the purchaser to pay the price, accept the shares and indemnify the vendor against liability in respect of them, was recognised at law even before the Judicature Acts and for a breach of such an obligation an action will lie.\nThere was not any denial at the argument of these elementary and fundamental propositions, but it was contended that under all the special circumstances connected with the transfer there must have been within the contemplation of the parties an intention to absolve the brokers, Gzowski and Buchan, not from responsibility to pay the purchase money, but to give them an immunity from double liability in respect of the shares under the provisions of the Bank Act.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange is an ordinary incorporated association having certain rules and customs which all members of the association as between themselves are presumed to know, and upon the faith and understanding of which they are presumed to contract, but there is no express rule dealing with the subject of indemnity or with the respective rights of the buyer and the seller of shares upon the exchange, nor as far as I can see is there any evidence whatever of any custom or of any understanding as between the members of the exchange upon this question of indemnity. Special provision has been made for it in the rules of the London Stock Exchange, and every contract there made is of course made subject to those rules, but in Toronto a contract such as this was must be governed by the general provisions of the common law apart from any custom or convention varying that law.\nThe learned trial judge in dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action, and the learned judges of the Court of Appeal in reversing the judgment of Divisional Court which had maintained his action, found in the transfer from Cochran above set out evidence that there must have been, within the contemplation of the parties at the time of the sale upon the Exchange, an intention in the minds of both parties that the buyer was not to be held responsible for any liability that might ever arise in respect of the shares purchased under the Bank Act. The only substantial oral testimony, as far as I can see, affecting the question is the evidence of Cochran, and it is as follows:\u2014\nQ. Do you recollect when it was that you gave this marginal transfer?\u2014A. It must have been the same day that I got paid by Gzowski and Buchan.\nQ. Why didn\u2019t you give him an assignment, an actual transfer on the books?\u2014A. The ordinary way is simply to give the order.\nQ. Why?\u2014A. So that they can give it to any one, or accept it themselves.\nQ. It puts them in the position of enabling somebody else to accept it?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And puts them in the position of not being acceptors of the stock?\u2014A. Yes, in the books.\nQ. They do not become transferees of the stock on the books?\u2014A. No.\nQ. It is to enable them to deal with it without becoming transferees?\u2014A. Yes.\nHIS LORDSHIP.\u2014Can the witness help us in that? There is the document.\nIt seems to me this is evidence, not of any custom of the stock exchange, but of an irregular practice which the Central Bank of Toronto had permitted to grow up by allowing transfers to be made in this, what I would suppose to be an unusual and extraordinary fashion. But it does not suggest the idea that there was any intention that the common law rights of the parties arising from the simple contract when the shares were up for sale should in any way be altered. But looking at the transfer itself, it is not I take it in any sense a transfer in blank, as that phrase is generally understood. The name of the buyer was not set out in the space where ordinarily it is set out, but the buyer\u2019s name was indicated in the margin, and it was impossible for any other name to be filled up in the transfer than such as the seller might approve. No disposition could specially be made of the shares without the signature and transfer of the buyers Messrs. Gzowski and Buchan, and the document is to be construed as an ordinary mercantile instrument like a delivery order or a dock warrant for goods. The seller by placing the shares subject to the order and disposition of the buyer, enabling the buyer to do as he liked with them, ceased himself to have any possession or control in respect of them, and as between him and the buyer the latter cannot dispute that he is a legal owner and liable as such owner to all the consequences which his contract of purchase entails. It made no difference to Cochran whether Gzowski and Buchan were acting for themselves or for an unknown principal. The moment the contract of sale was made on the 24th, in my view Cochran possessed of all his rights as a seller, and Gzowski likewise become subject to all the obligations of a buyer, Cochran fulfilling his obligations by the transfer of the stock to the order of Gzowski, and that altogether independently of whether Gzowski ever formally indicated his acceptance of the stock upon the transfer books of the bank. There is no indication in the evidence that there was any intention that the common law obligations of the buyer should be split up, one of these remaining the personal obligation of the buyer himself, and the other the personal obligation of somebody of whom the seller knew nothing and never did know anything until long after the whole transaction had been completed. I venture to say with great submission, that the judgment of the court appealed from has made a contract for these parties which they themselves never dreamed of. Special terms and unusual conditions not within the contemplation of the parties, and not made by them, have been forced into it by giving a fallacious efficacy to the terms of the transfer which was not any part of the contract but simply giving effect to the contract so far as the seller was concerned. As stated in Lindley on Companies, pages 472\u2011473:\nThe equitable ownership of shares, agreed to be sold, depends on the contract of sale and not on the form of transfer * * * Consequently where there is a binding agreement for the sale and transfer of shares, it is comparatively immaterial, as between the buyer and seller, whether a transfer in blank has been executed or not.\nI am clearly of opinion that Messrs. Gzowski & Buchan (the name of Mr. Buchan has been eliminated from the case by consent of parties) are as purchasers of these shares liable to indemnify the plaintiff in respect of them.\nI do not deem it necessary to refer to the further points raised by the respondent as they were substantially disposed of at the argument. In my opinion the judgment appealed from should be reversed and the judgment of the Divisional Court restored, the whole with costs.\nKING J. concurred.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014The whole question seems to be: Was Gzowski a transferee of the Boultbee or Cochran shares or was he acting as a mere broker? It is admitted that brokers on the Toronto Stock Exchange, standing in this respect very differently from brokers in the London and European Exchanges, buy and sell on their own account. According to the custom of the Toronto Stock Exchange, all transactions must be \u201csettled\u201d not later than the following day, and on the Monday following if the sale be made on Friday, the exchange being closed on Saturday, a custom which seems to be reasonable. It is not proved what this settlement fully means; it certainly means the payment of the purchase money and the transfer of the shares by the vendor; but does it also comprise its acceptance by the client of the broker or the real purchaser? It is alleged that it is sufficient to accept and disclose his name within a reasonable time. I find no evidence of any custom to that effect, and to my mind the word \u201csettlement \u201cmust mean everything that is necessary to complete the transaction, that is the payment of the purchase money, the transfer of the shares and its acceptance either by the broker or his principal, who must be disclosed not later than on the day of settlement, if the broker wishes to free himself from any personal responsibility. The committee of the Toronto Stock Exchange, who were called upon to report on this transaction at the request of Cochran, admit that the brokers are bound to disclose their principals, but omit to mention when this should be done, although it is conceded it is never done at the board at the time of the sale. But in this instance, the disclosure was made on the transfer book of the bank three days after the day of settlement, and I easily understand why the committee would not decide whether, as a matter of fact, the two brokers, or even one of them, had acted as mere brokers or on their own account. In the absence of any custom to extend the time of the acceptance of the transfer, and consequently the disclosure of the real purchaser, beyond the day of settlement, I feel that I am bound to apply the ordinary principle of law, that a broker buying on a stock exchange, without disclosing his principal within the delay fixed by the regulations of the association, is personally responsible for the transaction, just as if he had acted on his personal account. It seems to me therefore that, as no transferee\u2019s name other than that of the buying broker, was mentioned on the day of settlement, the transaction was closed, \u201csettled\u201d on his behalf and for his own benefit and subject to all the burdens attached to the same. Any other conclusion would lead to any amount of uncertainty which is not consistent with stock exchange operations. I am therefore of opinion that the appeal should be allowed, and the judgment of the Divisional Court restored with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Boultbee & Boultbee.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Barwick, Aylesworth & Franks.\n[1] 24 Ont.

Default was made in payment of the mortgage moneys and the mortgagor obtained judgment against the institute and caused the land to be sold in execution by the sheriff in a suit to which the curator had not been made a party.\nHeld, that as the mortage had been judicially authorized and was given special preference by the statute superior to any rights or interests that might arise under the substitution, the sale by the sheriff, in execution of the judgment so recovered, discharged the land from the substitution not yet open and effectually passed the title to the purchaser for the whole estate, including that of the substitute as well as that of the grev\u00e9 de substitution, notwithstanding the omission to make the curator a party to the action or proceedings in execution against the lands.\nAn institute greve de substitution, may validly affect and bind the interest of the substitute in real estate subject to a fiduciary substitution in a case where the bulk of the property has been destroyed by vis major in order to make necessary and extensive repairs, (grosses r\u00e9parations), upon obtaining judicial authorization, and in such a case the substitution is charged with the cost of the grosses reparations, the judicial authorizaiion operates as res judicata and the substitute called, to the substitution is stopped from contestation of the necessity and extent of the repairs.\nThe sheriff seized and sold lands under execution against a defendant described in the writ of execution, process of seizure and in the deed to the purchaser as \"grev\u00e9 de substitution.\"\nHeld, that the term used was merely descriptive of the defendant and did not limit the estate seized, sold or conveyed under the execution.\nJudgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada affirmed, Taschereau and King JJ. dissenting.\nHeld, further per Taschereau J. that article 2172 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada, as interpreted by the statute 29 Vict. ch. 26, applies to hypothecs and charges only, and does not require renewal of registration for the preservation of rights in and titles to real estate.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review at Montreal, and affirming the judgment of the Superior Court District of Montreal, which maintained the de fence and intervention of the respondent and dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe plaintiff brought his action (p\u00e9litoire), against the universal legatees of one Michel Laurent, deceased, to recover the property in question with rents, issues and profits. The land formerly belonged to the plaintiff's grandfather who died in 1843, having previously made his last will and testament whereby he bequeathed it to his son, the plaintiff's father, for his lifetime subject to the condition or charge of preserving the fonds and that, at his death, it should be returned and delivered over to his children born in lawful wedlock as their property absolutely. The plaintiff, the only surviving child of the institute, renounced his father's succession and claims title to the property as being called to the substitution created under his grandfather's will upon the death of his father, the institute, which happened in 1883.\nThe deceased Michel Laurent had acquired the land from the City of Montreal, intervenant in the action, which had become the purchaser of the property at sheriff's sale, and sold it to him at public auction under the following circumstances:\u2014In 1852, while the institute was in possession of the property, an extensive conflagration occurred in the City of Montreal, and. amongst the buildings destroyed were those upon the land in question An Act was passed by the Legislature (16 Vict. ch. 25) for the relief of sufferers and to facilitate the negotiation of loans to enable them to rebuild the property destroyed by the fire, and the City of Montreal was thereby authorized to guarantee loans made for the re-construction of buildings in the place of those so destroyed. The institute took advantage of the privilege, and he, together with the curator to the substitution, obtained judicial authorization to borrow $9,600 from a loan company which was expended in re-constructing buildings on the land in question. As the institute had no personal revenues, and the revenue from the lot in question had been bequeathed by way of maintenance, the loan was indispensable. The third section of the \" Relief Act t provided that sums so lent should be secured for the principal interest and costs, by privilege, upon the houses or other buildings erected and built upon the lot of ground,\" and that such privilege should be s superior to and have preference over any other claim, debt, mortgage or privilege whatever, on such houses or buildings,\" and that to secure such privilege it should not be necessary to observe any of the formalities then \"re-\u201c quired by law, or any other formality whatsoever; \" provided always, that such privileges shall, as \" regards the ground itself upon which such houses or \" buildings may be erected, rank next after the privileges, debts, mortgages or claims already existing or \" which may exist upon such ground (fonds) at the \" time of making such loan; but nothing herein contained shall prevent the parties making such loan or \" loans from taking a hypothec as provided by law, \" upon the said ground (fonds), which hypothec, if \" duly registered, shall rank as aforesaid.\"\nThe institute made default in payment of the loan and the company recovered judgment against him and caused the land with the buildings thereon to be seized and sold under execution by the sheriff. The curator to the substitution had not been made a party to this suit and, in the writ of execution and process of seizure and sale as well as in the sheriff's deed the defendant was described as \" grev\u00e9 de substitution. \" At the sheriff's sale, the City of Montreal, in order to protect its warranty, became purchaser of the property for $7,000, and afterwards sold it by public auction when Laurent became the purchaser as above mentioned, at the price of $6,800. The sheriff advertised the land itself, (fonds,) for sale with the buildings thereon and sold and granted his deed, in the usual form and for as much as might be in him, for the land and buildings as advertised.\nFor the defence it was contended that these sales were a final and unimpeachable alienation, that any rights which may have belonged to the plaintiff were thereby divested, especially as the loan was authorized by the court, and was in fact effected in the interest of the substitute himself. The defense also urged that the plaintiff's real rights, if any, had not been preserved by registration within the time limited after the proclamation of the official cadastre subsequently made of the division in which the land is situated as required by article 2172 C. C., and that, in any event, the plaintiff could only recover upon condition that he should reimburse all costs of improvements made in good faith with interest.\nOn the part of the plaintiff it was contended that the curator to the substitution had not been properly made a party to the action by the loan company, but that the institute had been therein sued and condemned alone; that his rights as grev\u00e9 de substitution only had been seized and alienated by the sheriff's sale, leaving the rights of the substitute still subsisting and sufficiently protected by the registration of the will.\nThe Superior Court dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs maintaining the defence and intervention by the City of Montreal (defendant in warranty), and condemned the plaintiff to pay the costs of the demand in warranty. In the Court of Review the judgment of the Superior Court was reversed, the plaintiff's action maintained with costs and the judgment as to the demand in warranty modified. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, the judgment of the Court of Review was reversed and set aside and the judgment of the Superior Court restored with costs.\nBelcourt for the appellant. Under the execution the sheriff only sold the rights of the institute and not those of the substitute; and the will having been once registered it was not necessary to renew the registration at the time of the establishment of the cadastre, since the question at issue is one of proprietorship. Renewal of registration is only necessary for the conservation of hypothecs. See Banque du Peuple v. Laporte ([1]); Welts v.Gilmour ([2]); Wheeler et al. v. Black et al ([3]); Surprenant v. Surprenant ([4]); and Page v. McLennan ([5]). The principal question in this case is whether or not the sale by the sheriff caused the rights of the substitute to disappear. The title of the institute is as an owner it is true, but on the opening of the substitution the estate must revert and be delivered up in conformity with the will creating the substitution; [Arts. 944 950 955 961 C. C.1; and sheriffs sales do not purge lands from substitutions not yet open [Art. 710 C. C. P. 1 unless the curator has been called into the suit; [Art. 959 0. C.] See also Art. 2060 C. C. and the judgment on the appellant\u2019s opposition to the seizure in 1859, reported as The Trust and Loan Company of Upper Canada v. Vadeboncaur ([6]), maintaining the contestation on the ground that his rights could not he effaced by a sheriff's sale.\nIn the sheriff's deed issued to the respondent the estate conveyed was limited by mentioning that the lots were seized as belonging to the institute through the will and the conveyance was expressed by him to be only in so far as it on me depends and as I can legally do so.\" There is full reservation made of the rights of the substitute by the use of these terms in the sheriff's deed\nIn reply to the claim for reimbursement of money expended on grosses r\u00e9parations, the appellant claims that the value of the repairs are compensated by rents, issues and profits received and enjoyed by the defend ants during their possession of the property.\nWe refer also to 2 Pigeau, Proc. Civ. (ed. 1779) pp. 506, 616; Denisart, \" Acte de Notori\u00e9te\" (3 ed.) pp. 407-408; 2 Mourlon, n. 936; 22 Demolombe, 500; They. d'Essaules, n. 689, 690; 9 Rolland de Villargues, in. 254, 255, and the case of Berub\u00e9 v. Morneau ([7]), and arts 2130 2172 and 2172a of the Civil Code. Ethier Q.C. for the respondent. We call attention to the absence of any proof of record to show that the testator is dead; and the appellant can have no rights, as consequently it does not appear that the substitution is yet open; all further argument is under reserve of this plea.\nThe clause in the \" Fire Relief Act\u201d which declares those loans to constitute a privilege on the immoveable, in preference to any claim, debt or hypothec whatsoever, without it being necessary to comply with any of the formalities required by law, or any formality whatever, dispensed with the necessity of securing authorization from the court to borrow the sums necessary to reconstruct the buildings, and that formality was thus evidently adopted only ex majore cautela.\nEven by Art. 951 C.C. permission is given to alienate the substitution in cases of necessity; see also Art. 953 C. C. and Caty v. Perrault ([8]). Under any circumstances the registration of the will has not been renewed since the filing of the cadastral plans and proclamation thereof as required by Art. 2172 C. C., which is fatal to any rights claimed thereunder; Poitras v. Lalonde ([9]) per Mathieu J. La Banque du Peuple v. Laporte ([10]), per Baudry J., and Despins v. Danean ([11]) per Ouimet J. Art. 2131 C. C. requires such renewals in case of all real rights whatsoever which are subject to registration. Art. 711 C. C. P. uses the term r real rights \" in the same wide sense.\nAs to the estate sold at the sheriffs sale we simply refer to the terms of the deed to show that the sheriff really conveyed to the city, in the most formal manner the whole estate in the immoveable in question without mentioning the usufruct, or any reservations whatever. The descriptive term applied to the defendant in the process has no effect towards limiting the estate seized and sold.\nLastly the buildings reconstructed on the land with the money specially borrowed for that purpose were necessary and urgent repairs of an extensive characer, grosses r\u00e9parations, absolutely required to make the property, bequeathed \u00e0 litre alimentaire, revenue bearing, and they enure to the benefit of the substitution and consequently are a charge upon it. The maxim \"nemo locupletari debet damno allerius\u201d applies here.\nTASCHEREAU J. (dissenting.)\u2014There is no controversy upon this appeal as to the facts of the case.\nIn 1840, one Fran\u00e7ois Vadeboncceur, appellant's grandfather, made his will in favour of his son, Louis, with substitution in favour of his grandson, the appellant. The testator died in 1843. Louis, the institute, died in 1883, when appellant, Louis Joseph, became entitled to the legacy made in his favour by his grandfather. By his action he claims from the respondents the ownership of a lot of land in Montreal included in that legacy of which they or their ayants cause are in possession The respondents met that action by a plea alleging that they had bought the lot in question at a sheriff's sale, under execution of a judgment recovered by the Trust and Loan Company against both the institute and the curator to the substitution. Appellant replied that it was only against his father, the institute, as institute that this judgment had been recovered, and not against the curator to the substitution As a matter of fact that is so, and it is now conceded by the respondents that this part of their plea is unfounded; the curator was not even a party to the action of the Trust & Loan Company. Notwithstanding this, however, the respondents contend that the appellant's rights were extinguished by the sheriff's sale under that judgment against the institute alone. Prima facie, such a contention seems untenable. And the three courts below are unanimous in holding that, under ordinary circumstances, a substitute cannot be so deprived of his rights upon proceedings to which neither he, nor the curator, were parties.\nBut the Superior Court and the Court of Queen's Bench have found, in the following additional facts of the case, a bar to appellant's right of action.\nIn 1852, while the institute was in possession, a fire having destroyed a large portion of the city, including the buildings on the lot in question, the legislature, by 16 Vict. ch. 25, deemed it expedient to come to the relief of the victims of this disaster by enabling them to borrow the funds necessary to rebuild upon the security of the City Corporation, present respondents. The institute took advantage of that legislation, and jointly with the curator to the substitution borrowed $9,600 from the Trust & Loan Company, upon, among other securities, the guarantee of the City Corporation as authorized by the aforesaid statute. Upon default to pay the overdue installments, the Trust and Loan Company took a judgment in 1857 against the institute, but not against the cure tor, and had the lot in question seized and sold in 1860 by the sheriff to the present respondents. The provision in this statute, upon which the respondents mainly rely, is contained in section 3, which reads as follows:\nAnd be it enacted that any person or persons, company or firm or persons, body politic or corporate so making any loan or advance under any instrument to which the Corporation shall be a party as aforesaid, shall have a privilege for such loan in principal, interest and costs, upon the houses or other buildings erected and built upon the lot of ground described in such instrument, which privilege shall be superior to, and have preference over, any other claim, debt, mortgage or privilege whatsoever, on such houses or buildings, and that to secure such privilege it shall not be necessary to observe any of the formalities now required by law, or any other formality whatsoever; Provided always that such privilege shall, as regards the ground itself upon which such houses or buildings may be erected, rank next after the privileges, debts, mortgages or claims already existing or which may exist upon such ground (fonds) at the time of making such loan; but nothing herein contained shall prevent the parties making such loan or loans from taking a hypothec as provided by law, upon the said ground (fonds) which hypothec, if duly registered, shall rank as aforesaid.\nThe last part of the section relating to conventional hypothecs upon the ground fonds) itself has no bearing on the case, as it is not alleged, nor evidenced on the record that the deeds in favour of the Trust and Loan Company have ever been registered. So that the companies privilege was clearly restricted to the buildings. But even if these deeds had been registered, appellant's rights or claim to the lot itself which had been previously registered, are clearly protected by that legislation. The company, however, had undoubtedly the right to take a judgment against the institute on his personal obligation, and excuse it on the lot itself. The institute was owner of it\u00bb Appellant could not, and does not attack that judgment. He simply argues that as the curator was not a party to it does not concern him. It is the effect of the judgment that he puts in issue, not its legality or validity.\nThe same as to the sheriff's sale to respondents. Appellant does not, and could not; ask to have it set aside. It was a perfectly valid one as far as it went. The controversy is merely as to what passed under it, or as to what it is that the city bought. Did they or did they not buy it subject to appellant's rights under the substitution? It seems to me evident that nothing but a substituted property was seized, and nothing but a substituted property was sold. Of course, it was the land that was sold, and that sale might have become free from all claims if the appellant had died before the opening of the substitution. But upon a judgment against the institute alone for his debt, the substitute's right to the owner ship cannot be wiped out if he survive the institute., It is from the grantor that he takes the property. He is not the ayan-cause of the institute. The appellant has renounced his father's succession. Then the city knowingly purchased a substituted property; it was sold as such; and they had notice of the substitution by its registration and publication en justice. That is why an opposition afin de charge was not necessary to preserve appellant's rights. The sheriffs deed, moreover, expressly says that the sale is only of what he legally can sell; Pothier, subsist. 551. And the purchaser under it cannot have another or a better title than the judgment debtor had. Appellant could not have intervened to stop the sale. He in fact attempted it, but his opposition was dismissed on the ground that he could not be prejudiced by proceedings against the institute alone. That judgment is reported as Trust & Loan Co. of Upper Canada v. Vadeboncceur. ([12]).\nThe Trust and Loan Company had the personal obligation of both the institute and the curator, and had they taken their judgment against both could have executed it against both. But having chosen to take judgment against one of them only all that they could seize and sell on that judgment was the property of that one and not the property of the other And if their judgment debtor had only a life-estate in the lot in question, it is only a life-estate that can have been seized and sold. And it is only a life-estate that respondents purchased under the sale in execution of that judgment. It is not his liability for the re imbursement of this loan that the substitue now questions; he simply contends that, as he has not been sued for it and condemned, no execution against his co-debtor can have extended to his own property.\nThe judgments against the appellant in the Superior Court and in the Court of Queen's Bench seem to be based on the consideration that this loan was made in appellant\u2019s interest and for his benefit. But this is a disputed fact and not at all clear upon the evidence. Appellant contends that it was made exclusively in the institute's interest. However, assuming that he did benefit thereby, it does not follow that his property was, or could be, sold under a judgment against a third party.\nIt was said in the Court of Queen's Bench that under art. 710 C. C. P. the appellant's rights were extinguished by the sheriff's sale because the Trust and Loan Company's claim was preferable to the substitution. But this article of the Code of Procedure is not given as new law and cannot be construed as an addition to or an alteration of section 953 of the Civil Code.\nExtensive repairs (grosses reparations) and necessary disbursements of an extraordinary nature do not, it is true, fall exclusively upon the institute, but that is as between the institute and the substitute. Art. 947 C C. And it does not follow therefrom that the party who has made these repairs at the request of the institute has a right of action against the substitute, stillless that, under a judgment against the institute alone he can sell the substitues's rights. And when the substitute invokes the protection of the sacred rule that no one can be condemned before being heard or summoned, it is no lawful answer that if he had been heard he would have been condemned. Moreover, by the statute, the Trust and Loan Company had no lien on the lot itself, as I have already remarked. And even if they had that could not have had the effect of rendering a judgment against the institute executor on any but the institute's rights and property. The substituted property was his property no doubt, but pro tem., and subject to the substitution, if the substitute were to survive the institute. Such was the judgment of the Court of Review, and such would be my determination of the controversy.\nThen, assuming that the appellant were liable for the amount of this loan that would not be in my opinion, a reason for dismissing his action. All that could he contended for would be that before he could get back his property, he should repay what the respondents have disbursed upon the loan. If the substitution had opened immediately after this loan to the grev\u00e9, the company's action upon it would have been against the appellant. He would then have had the option of retaining his property upon re-payment of the loan. Why should he be deprived of this option now? I do not see any reason for it, and I think that, in any case, the judgment dismissing his action is wrong. The judgment of the Court of Review should be restored with reserve of any recourse the respondents may have to recover from the appellant the amount disbursed by them to pay the Trust and Loan Company, in so far, at least, as he has benefited thereby. They may have that personal recourse, but, in my opinion, the appellant has a right to his property.\nThe respondent raised a point as to the necessity under art. 2172 C. C. of renewing the registration of the will creating the substitution in question. The three courts below are against them on this point, which is settled in that sense by the jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal in the province since 1874. La Banque du Peuple v. Laporte ([13]); Wells v. Gilmour ([14]); Wheeler v. Black ([15]), in this court, hut point abandoned.\nI agree that such a renewal was not necessary. The subsequent Act of 1875, 29 Vict. c. 26, interprets the article as applying only to hypothecs. It would be with great reluctance that we could be induced to upset a well established jurisprudence of the Provincial Court of Appeal upon a point of this nature affecting vested rights and titles to realty.\nAnother objection raised by the respondents is that it has not been proved that Francois Vadebonceur, the grantor, is dead. This is a futility. Their very deed from the sheriff upon which they base their defence would not exist if the institute had not been in possession as institute, and he could not have been in possession as institute if the grantor had not been dead. Moreover, this objection was taken in the Court of Appeal for the first time and that could not be done on such a point. Lyall v. Jardine ([16]); Bank of Bengal v. Macleod ([17]); Bank of Bengal v. Fagan ([18]); Owners of the Taasmania\" v. Owners of the \"City of Corinth \" ([19]); Connecticut Fire Insarancp co. v Kavanagh ([20]).\nThe appeal, in my opinion, should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the Court of Review re stored, with reserve of respondents rights, as I have mentioned.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014While concurring in the judgment of my brother Girouard who has dealt with the case very fully the case appears to me to be concluded by the statute 16 Vict.ch. 25 That statute, after reciting that a then recent disastrous conflagration in the city of Montreal had destroyed upwards of one thousand houses, and that the greater number of the persons who had suffered by that conflagration had lost all they had and were unable to rebuild the property so destroyed without assistance, and that the Corporation of the City of Montreal had expressed a willingness to become surety to the extent of one hundred thousand pounds for such of the said persons as might borrow for the purpose of enabling them to rebuild on the property so destroyed, enacted that it should be lawful for the said corporation to become surety for monies borrowed by any such sufferers for the purpose of rebuilding upon their land made vacant by the fire, such surety ship being by the statute declared to constitute an obligation for the repayment of the moneys borrowed and of the interest thereon in the event of the lenders being unable to enforce payment thereof from the parties borrowing the same after due diligence and the discussion of the personal and real estate of the said parties for that purpose; and by the Act it was enacted that no such loan should exceed the sum of \u00a36500 on each lot of ground to be built upon, and further, that any person or persons, etc., making any loan under an instrument to which the corporation should be a party as surety\nshould have a privilege for such loan in principal, interest and costs upon the houses or other buildings erected and built upon the lot of ground described in such instrument, which privilege should be superior to and have preference over any other claim, debt, mortgage or privilege whatsoever on such houses or buildings, and that to secure such privilege it shall not be necessary to observe any of the formalities now required by law, or any other formality whatsoever; Provided always that such privilege shall, as regards the ground itself upon which such houses or buildings may be erected, rank next after the privileges, debts, mortgages or claims already existing or which may exist upon such ground at the time of making such loan.\nAmong the sufferers by the said fire were Louis Vadeboncoeur and his infant son, the now plaintiff, the former of whom at the time of the said fire was by the last will of his father Francois Vadeboncoeur then deceased seized as gtev\u00e9 de substitution of a piece of land having a frontage of eighty feet on St. Mary Street in the City of Montreal, and a depth of eighty feet with houses thereon which were destroyed by the said fire, and the ownership of the said piece of land in reversion was by the said will of the said Francois devised to the children of the said Louis begotten in lawful marriage as substitu\u00e9s.\nFor the purpose of availing themselves of the benefit of the said Act (16 Vict. c. 25) the said grev\u00e9 and one Treffl\u00e9 Goyette, as and being the duly appointed curator to the substitution established by the said will of the said Francois, jointly petitioned the judge of the Circuit Court at Montreal that they should be judicially authorized to borrow under the conditions in the said Act contained, the sum of two thousand pounds (currency) for the purpose of building four houses upon the said piece of ground; and such proceedings were thereupon had that the said petitioners were in due form of law by the judgment of the said court judicially authorised to borrow the said sum and for the purpose of securing payment of the said principal sum and the interest thereon to hypothecate the said piece of land.\nIn pursuance of the authority so judicially obtained the said grev\u00e9 and the curator of the said substitution borrowed from the Trust and Loan Company the said sum of two thousand pounds in four several sums of five hundred pounds each which were expended in erecting four houses as authorised by the judgment of the Circuit Court and for the purpose of securing repayment of the moneys so borrowed they, upon the 22nd day of June, 1853, executed four several mort gages each securing $2,000 and interest thereon upon several portions of the said piece of land each having a frontage of twenty feet on said St. Mary Street, and a depth of eighty feet. And the said Corporation of the City of Montreal became parties to the said several mortgages and thereby respectively became cautions of the said borrowers for the repayment of the said sums by the said mortgages respectively secured under and in pursuance of terms of the said Act of Parliament.\nAfterwards, the said sum of eight thousand dollars having been found to be insufficient for the completion of the said four houses, the said grev\u00e9 and the curator to the said substitution upon the 8th day of September, 1853, in due form of law petitioned the said court for leave to borrow a further sum of \u00a3500 for completion of the said four houses under the provisions of the said Act (16 Vict. c. 25), and a certain other Act (16 Vict. c. 77), passed for the purpose of amending the said Act (16 Vict. c. 25), and such proceedings were thereupon had that the said petitioners were by the judgment of the said court judicially authorized to borrow and did accordingly borrow, the further sum of \u00a3400 upon the security of the said piece of land from the said Trust and Loan Company, and for the purpose of securing repayment thereof with interest they executed another mortgage bearing date the 10th of September 1853, upon the whole of the said piece of land having a frontage of eighty feet by a depth of eighty feet to which mortgage also the corporation of the city of Montreal became parties as surety of the said borrowers under the conditions and in accordance with the provisions of the said Acts of Parliament At the times of the said respective loans having been effected and of the execution of the said respective mortgages in security therefor there were not any other debts, mortgages or claims existing and affecting the lands upon which the said four houses were erected with the money so borrowed, having privileged or precedence over the said mortgages, and consequently the said Trust and Loan Company, in virtue of the said respective mortgages and of the provisions of the said Acts of Parliament, had for the said loans in principal, interest and costs, privileged as well over the land upon which the said houses were so as afore said erected as over the houses themselves superior to and having preference over every other claim, debt or privilege whatsoever. The mortgages covered the whole estate in the land and the houses thereon erected not only of the grev\u00e9, but also of those in substitution. Default having been made in payment of the moneys secured by the said several mortgages, the Trust and Loan Company recovered judgment in consideration of such default against the grev\u00e9, and issued execution thereon in due form of law and by process of a writ of venditiori exponas issued upon the said judgment caused to be sold at sheriff's sale upon the 6th of February, 1860, the whole estate in the said land which had been so mortgaged to them under the provisions of the said statutes, and at such sale the corporation of the city of Montreal being the highest bidders therefor became the purchasers of the said land and premises at and for the sum of $7,000, paid to the sheriff by whom the said sale was made. The mortgaged estate thus realized less than the amount secured by the said mortgages, and thereby the corporation of the said city in their character of surety for the said borrowers became liable under the said statutes to the said Trust and Loan Company for the balance.\nThe said grev\u00e9 died upon the 25th of October, 1883, and the sole question now is as to the estate acquired by the said corporation by their purchase at the said sheriff's sale.\nIt is not questioned that the said estate in substitution was subject to the mortgages so as aforesaid executed equally as was the estate of the grev\u00e9, and was liable to be sold for satisfaction of the claim of the Trust and Loan Company but it is contended that the proper form of procedure to enable the mortgagees to sell the land in which the plaintiff had the estate in substitution, was not pursued inasmuch as the curator to the substitution had not been made party to the action in which the judgment upon which the sale took place was rendered.\nIt is not suggested that if the curator to the substitution had been made a party to that action it would have derided any benefit or could hayed prevented the land and premises mortgaged from being sold for the purpose of satisfying the judgment recovered for default in payment of the moneys secured by the mortgages. It appears obvious upon the evidence that the joint and several covenants of the grev\u00e9 and the curator to the substitution were in view of the impecunious condition of the institute and the substitute, of value only as providing a mode of reaching by judicial process the land and premises mortgaged, all remedies against which the statute, 16 Vict. c. 25, sec. 1, seems to have required to be exhausted before the guarantee of the Corporation of the City of Montreal should become exigible.\nUnder the circumstances above appearing there cannot I think be entertained a doubt that the claim of the Trust and Loan Company under the mortgages so as aforesaid judicially authorised, constituted by force of the special statute (16 Vict. c. 25), a privileged claim superior to and in preference over the substitution, and consequently that by force of articles 950-951 and 953 C. C. and art. 710 C. C. P., the sheriff's sale on the execution issued upon the judgment recovered in the action instituted by the mortgagees, the Trust and Loan Company, effectually passed the whole estate that of the substitute as well as that of the grev\u00e9, all which was made subject to the mortgages for realising payment of the moneys secured by which the judicial sale took place, and that therefore, upon the death of the grev\u00e9 such judicial sale was not dissolved in favour of the substitute, the present appellant.\nThe appeal must, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J. concurred in the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs,\nKING J. dissented being of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nGIROUARD J. Lors de la plaidoirie orale devant nous, j'\u00e9tais sous limpression que le d\u00e9faut d'avoir mis en cause le tuteur \u00e0 la substitution \u00e9tait un juste motif de nullit\u00e9 du d\u00e9cret \u00e0 l'encontre de l'appel\u00e9 \u00e0 la substitution; mais apr\u00e8s une plus s\u00e9rieuse \u00e9tude de la question je suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 une toute autre conclusion. D'apr\u00e8s les dispositions de nos Codes\u2014qui ont simple ment reproduit le droit ancien\u2014il faut le supposer jusqu'\u00e0 preuve du contraire; Herse et Dufaux ([21]); la seule cons\u00e9quence de ce d\u00e9faut est que le jugement qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la saisie n'est \"pas choee jug\u00e9e contre l'appel\u00e9, tandis qu'il le serait, Si le curaeurr \u00e0 la substitution eit \u00eat\u00e9 mis en cause. (C. C. art. 945 959.)\nLa loi dit formellement que le d\u00e9cret par le sh\u00e9rif n'affecte, en aucune fa\u00e7on les droits des appel\u00e9s, sauf dans quelques cas specialement mentionn\u00e9s, et ce sans distinguer si le curateur \u00e0 la substitution est en cause ou non. (C. C. art. 950, 953; C. P. C. art. 710.) Les ventes forc\u00e9es de biensffonss substitu\u00e9s sont assueetties \u00e0 des r\u00e8gles particuli\u00e8res, qui, au moins avant le Code, ne reconnaissaient \u00e0 l'appel\u00e9 aucun droit \u00e0 faire valoir avant l'ouverture. Trust and Loan Co. of Upper Canada v. Vadeboncoeur ([22]); Wilson v. Leblanc ([23]); voir sous le Code l'art. 956\nL'article 710 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile (art. 781 du nouveau Code), post\u00e9rieur au Code Civil, et beau coup plus large que l'art. 953 de ce dernier, ajoute :\u2014\nLe d\u00e9cret ne purge pas les substitutions non ouvertes sauf le cas o\u00f9 il existe une cr\u00e9ance ant\u00e9rieure ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable, apprente dans la cause.\nLes auteurs et la jurisprudence sont unanimes \u00e0 regarder comme une charge de la substitution les grosses reparations, et \u00e0 plus forte raison la reconstruction des \u00e9difices incendi\u00e9s, particuli\u00e8rement de ceux dont le revenu \u00e9tait, aux yeux du substituant, et en fait n\u00e9cessaire au soutien de tous les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la substitution, ce qui existe dans l'esp\u00e8ce, puisqu'il le declare alimentaire et insaisissable, et que ces immeubles formaient tout leur avoir C. C. art. 947, 951, 958; in re Desrivi\u00e8res ([24]); Caty v. Perrault ([25]); Thevnnot d'Essaule (Ed. Mathieu) nn. 685, 689, 691, 692 et page 463.\nAu num\u00e9ro 685 Theventt dit:\nQuant aux grosses reparations, le grev\u00e9 n'est point oblig\u00e9 de les faire; par exemple s'il s'agit de relever et reconstruire des choses tomb\u00e9es par v\u00e9tust\u00e9, ou par force majeure, sans qu'il y alt faute de sa part. Au No. 686, il ajoute:\nQue si le grev\u00e9 les a facies, il est fond\u00e9 \u00e0 en r\u00e9p\u00e9ter le montant, lors de la restitution des biens. IL y a une loi qui le dit express\u00e9ment, pour l'h\u00e9ritier grev\u00e9 qui a reconstruit les maisons incendi\u00e9es.\nThevenot n'exige pas m\u00eame l'autorisation du conseil de famille: D\u00e9nizarrt vo. \" Subs.\" no. 109, et Lacombe, vo. \"Subs.\" p. 183, no. 10, sont du m\u00eame avis. A plus forte raison, la substitution est-elle responsable du co\u00fbt de ces reconstructions, lorsque, comme dans l'esD\u00e8ce elles out \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9es en justice? Dans le premier cas, l'appel\u00e9 pourra contester l'urgence on la valeur des reparations ou constructions; dans le second, l'autorisation en justice est chose jug\u00e9e contre lui (C. C. Art. 959) \u00e0 moins qu'il ne prouve la fraude on la collusion entre le grev\u00e9, le tuteur \u00e0 la substitution et le cr\u00e9ancier. Ici rien de semblable n'est all\u00e9gu\u00e9. L'ordre du juge a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e9rement obtenu suivant la pratique imm\u00e9moriale suivie dans la province de Quebec, et l'appelant admet lui-m\u00eame que les b\u00e2timents \u00e9rig\u00e9s avec les fonds emprunt\u00e9s, valent aujourd'hui m\u00eame la somme de $9,600, le montant total des emprunts. Je consid\u00e8re donc que les hypo th\u00e9ques en question en cette cause sont valides aux yeux du droit commun et constituent une reclamation pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable aux termes de l'art. 710 du Code de ProC c\u00e9dure. A plus forte raison doit il en \u00eatre ainsi en face du Statut 16 Vict. ch. 25 qui a autoris\u00e9 le cautionnement de la cite de Montr\u00e9al et \u00e0 mon avis c'\u00e9tait plut\u00f4t pour l'obtenir que pour valider les emprunts, qu'il fut pass\u00e9. M\u00eame si le doute \u00e9tait permis sur ce point, les termes du statut sont si clairs, si larges, qu'il est impossible de ne pas consid\u00e9rer la reclamation comme pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable, ainsi que M. le juge Gwynne le d\u00e9montre. Ce point ne me paralt pas s\u00e9rieusement contest\u00e9 par l'appelaut. L'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 forcee d'acheter les biens subst tu\u00e9s pour prot\u00e9ger son cautionnement, et elle le fit, non pas \u00e0 vii prix, mais en payant la pleine valeur de l'immeuble, savoir $7,000, puisque cinq ans plus tard elie le vendait, \u00e0 l'encan public, \u00e0 Michel Laurent, pour $6,800, sans qu'il n'apparaisse aucune d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration ou d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation extraordinaire. Tous ces faits apparaissent au dossier; l'incendie des lieux au grand feu de 1852 dont le grev\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait certainement pas responsable; l'autorisation de l'intim\u00e9e par la Legisla ture de se porter caution des victimes du feu pour reconstruire les edifices incendi\u00e9s; l'autorisation du conseil de famille et du juge au grev\u00e9 et au tuteur de la substitution de faire les emprunts; les hypoth\u00e8ques consenties par les deux tant sur les b\u00e2tisses que le fonds; le jugement base sur toutes ces hypoth\u00e9ques; le d\u00e9cret par le sh\u00e9rif en execution du dit jugement et paiement des dits emprunts et enfin la valeur actuelle des b\u00e2tisses. Tous ces faits, notamment la bonne foi de toutes les parties, sont apparents dans la cause; et d'apr\u00e8s la jurisprudence bien \u00e9tablie de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, tant avant le Code que depuis ils constituent une cr\u00e9ance pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable apparente dans la cause, aux termes de l'article 710 du Code de Procedure Civile c'est-\u00e0-dire, une cr\u00e9ance qui prime la substitution elle m\u00eame et pour laquelle l'appele est responsable, absolu ment comme il l'est pour une dette du substituant, ou une hypoth\u00e8que ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la substitution et pour le paiement de laquelle le cr\u00e9ancier n'est pas oblige d'attendre l'ouverture de la substitution ou de provoquer la nomination d'un curateur \u00e0 la substitution, mais peut proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance contre le grev\u00e9 absolu ment comme s'il n'y avait pas de substitution, C. C. 2060; Voir aussi, Laurent, Vol. 14, n. 565; Actes de Notori\u00e9t\u00e9, p. 407; H\u00e9ricourt, Des Im., p. 150; D\u00e9nizart vo. \"Subs.\" nn. 99,102,103; Lacombe, vo. \"Subs.\" p. 180, n. 2. V'est ce que fit le cr\u00e9ancier dans l'esp\u00e8ce; il fit vendre l'immeuble par le sh\u00e9rif, sur le grev\u00e9 qui alors \u00e9tait le seul propri\u00e9taire connu animo domini, (C. P. C. art. 632), et \u00e0 mon avis, cela suffisait aux termes de l'art. 710 qui est exorbitant du droit ordinaire en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9cret. Cet article n'exige pas que le tuteur \u00e0 la substitution soit en cause, et je ne crois pas que les tribunaux doivent imposer cette formalit\u00e9.\nIl en serait autrement si le sh\u00e9rif n'e\u00fbt vendu que les droits du grev\u00e9 ainsi que la Cour de Revision 1'a suppos\u00e9; alors ii n'y aurait pas lieu de se m\u00e9prendre sur la port\u00e9e du d\u00e9cret t mais, ici le sh\u00e9rif ne fait mention du grev\u00e9 que pour indiquer qu'il vend our le grev\u00e9, non pas ses droits simplement mais tout l'immeuble, sans en rien r\u00e9server. Ii out \u00e9t\u00e9 sans doute, plus prudent de mettre en cause le curateur \u00e0 la substitution et peut-\u00eatre plus conforme \u00e0 la pratique ordinairement suivie mais il me semble que les tribunaux ne doivent pas exiger l'accomplissement de cette formalit\u00e9, \u00e0 peine de nullit\u00e9 du d\u00e9cret, lorsqu'il n'y a aucune loi qui la prononc\u00e9e on fasse m\u00eame mention do cette formalit\u00e9; et qu'au contraire l'article 710 semble pr\u00e9voir le cas o\u00f9 il n'est pas en cause et qu'enfin il y a absence totale do griefs de la part do l'appelant.\nLa majorit\u00e9 de cette cour est done d'avis do renvoyer lappel avcc d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lamothe, Trudel & Trudel.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Roy & Ethier.\n[1] 19 L.

In the course of the trial, objections were raised by counsel for the prisoner against the reception of some of the evidence adduced, upon four points, as follows:\n\"1. That certain admissions alleged to have been made by the prisoner, had been obtained under the influence of improper inducements by persons in authority;\"\n\"2. That the prisoner's deposition made before the coroner at the inquest was not admissible in evidence against her.\n\"3. That the evidence of a witness who was under accusation of having been a party to the murder, was not admissible against her; and\n\"4. That secondary evidence of the contents of two letters was not admissible, as there was no proof that their production was impossible.\"\nThe first point was reserved as a question of law by the presiding judge on the trial, but he refused to reserve the case upon the three other objections raised on behalf of the prisoner. Leave to appeal on the three last points was subsequently obtained on application to the Attorney General for Quebec and the trial judge accordingly stated the case to be sub mitted to the Court of Queen's Bench, sitting in appeal, for the opinion of the court upon all the objections so taken.\nThe Court of Appeal decided:\n1. That it did not appear that the confession had been made under the influence of improper inducements, but was free and voluntary, and admissible as evidence before the jury; 2. That the deposition before the corner should not have been received in evidence at the trial in consequence of the provisions of the Canada Evidence Act, 1893;\n3. That the evidence of the witness accused of having been a party to the murder was admissible as he had not been indicted jointly with the prisoner, and was not being tried jointly with her; and\n4. That the secondary evidence of the contents of the letters should not have been admitted, as it had not been proved that it was impossible to produce them, nor even that they had ever existed.\nThe Court of Appeal accordingly ordered and adjudged that there had been a mistrial; that the verdict against the prisoner should be quashed and set aside, and a new trial of the prisoner had upon the indictment, two of the judges of the Court of Appeal dissenting from the opinion of the majority of the court, upon the question as to the admission of the confession in evidence.\nThe prisoner on this appeal did not attack the order in a new trial but her object was to obtain a reversal of the decision that the confession had been properly admitted in evidence, and was based upon the dissent of these two judges upon that question as above mentioned.\nOn the appeal being called for hearing a motion was made to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nCannon Q.C., Assistant-Attorney-General for Quebec,\nfor the motion. No appeal lies, inasmuch as the conviction was not affirmed on the appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, but on the contrary the conviction was quashed and set aside by the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench and a new tidal granted. See Criminal Code, s. 750. Poirier contra The appeal in the court below was on several grounds, and as to one of the questions raised, that respecting the admission of the confession in evidence, the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench affirmed the decision of the trial judge allowing this evidence to go to the jury. We contend that the decision is not according to the law of evidence that should govern the case, and it may have a serious effect to the prejudice of the prisoner on her new trial unless that part of the judgment is reversed on the appeal now sought to this court. There are dissents from this part of the judgment by two of the judges who heard the appeal in the court below, and consequently an appeal on this ground should be allowed, as was done in the case of Mclntosh v. The Queen ([2]), for there has been upon this point both affirmance and a dissent as contemplated by the statute.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (Oral.) The court is unanimously of opinion that there is no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal in this case. Section 742 of the Criminal Code, 1892, makes provision for appeals to this court where there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal, but that appeal is given only as there in after provided; this proviso refers to section 750 of the Criminal Code, by which such appeals are restricted to cases where the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal has affirmed the conviction on an appeal under section 742. in the present case the Court of Appeal did not affirm the conviction, but on the contrary quashed it and set it aside upon two of the grounds raised by the appellant and directed a new trial upon the indictment. This distinguishes the case from that of McIntosh v. The Queen (1) in which the decision appealed from was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this case, although the majority of the Court of Appeal affirmed the decision as to the admission of the confession in evidence against the prisoner, and two of the judges who heard the appeal dissented from the view of the majority of the court upon that question, yet this difference of opinion and the questions raised as to the confession and whether it was improperly obtained, and what effect this opinion of the majority of the Court of Appeal might have at the new trial of the prisoner, cannot in any manner affect the competence of this court. The jurisdiction of this court depends entirely upon the statutes from which it derives its powers in both civil and criminal matters, and we are given no jurisdiction to hear appeass in criminal cases except in those where there has been not only an affirmance of the conviction but also some dissent among the judges in the Court of Appeal. We have been given no jurisdiction in cases where the Court of Appeal by a unanimous judgment has ordered a new trial.\nIn section 742 the word \"opinion\" must be construed as meaning the decision or judgment of the court as clearly appears on reading the context contained in the first sentence of the subsection in which that word is used.\nThe appeal must be quashed.\nAppeal quashed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Poirier & Leduc.\nSelicitor for the respondent: L.

H. had a right at any time to examine the books and have an account of the stock, etc.; the net profits were to be shared between the parties; the agreement could be determined at any time by H. or by W. and wife on a month's notice.\nHeld, that the goods supplied by H. under this agreement as the stock of the business were not sold to W. and wife but remained the property of H. until sold in the ordinary course; such goods, therefore, were not liable to seizure under execution against H. at the suit of a creditor.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of the North-west Territories affirming the judgment of Rouleau J. on the trial of an interpleader issue.\nThe only question in this case is as to the title to goods supplied by Hatfield, the plaintiff, to one West, a merchant at Innisfail, in the district of Alberta, which agreement was as follows:\n\u201cAn agreement made between Thomas A. Hatfield, of the City of Calgary, in the district of Alberta, in the North-west Territories of the Dominion of Canada, general merchant, of the one part, and G. W. West, of Innisfail, in the said district of Alberta, merchant, and Mary Jane, wife of the said G. W. \"West, of the other part, whereby it is agreed as follows:\n\"1. The said G. W. West and Mary Jane, his wife, will during the continuance of these presents provide and furnish free of rent and taxes a store at Innisfail aforesaid suitable for carrying on the business of a general merchant.\n\"2. The said Thomas A. Hatfield will supply to the said Gr. W. West and Mary Jane, his wife, at Innisfail aforesaid, all such goods and stock in trade as are usually necessary and required in the trade or business of a general merchant, and replenish such stock in trade from time to time as occasion may require, and the said Thomas A. Hatfield deem expedient.\n\"3. The said G. W. West shall, except when prevented by sickness, devote the whole of his time and attention to carrying on the trade or business of a general merchant at Innisfail, aforesaid, and diligently employ himself therein and promote to the utmost of his powers the benefit and advantage of the same.\n\"4. The said G. W. West and Mary Jane, his wife, shall make a report to the said Thomas A. Hatfield of the sales made and the cash balances once in each and every month during the continuance of this agreement, and shall render unto the said Thomas A. Hatfield a general account of the stock in trade, credits, property and effects, debts and liabilities of the said business once every three months.\n\"5. The said G. W. West and Mary Jane, his wife, shall remit to the said Thomas A. Hatfield, at Calgary, all monies received by them from sales in the course of the business as aforesaid, such remittances to be made on Tuesday and Friday in each and every week deducting freight charges and such amounts as may have been paid out in cash for local merchandise and farm produce.\n\"6. The said Thomas A. Hatfield may from time to time and at all times visit the said store at Innisfail and examine all and any of the books of accounts kept by the said G. W. West and Mary Jane, his wife, and take an account of the stock in trade, credits, property and effects, debts and liabilities of the business, and the said G. W. West and Mary Jane, his wife, shall whenever called upon give to the said Thomas A. Hatfield full explanations with regard to any matters concerning the said business as aforesaid.\n\"7. Proper books of account shall be kept by the said G. W. West and Mary Jane, his wife, and entries immediately made therein of all receipts and payments made and all such other matters and things as are usually entered in similar books of account.\n\"8. The net profits of the said business after deducting all freight charges shall be shared in equal proportions between the said Thomas A. Hatfield and G. W. West.\n\"9. This agreement may be determined at any time by Thomas A. Hatfield.\n\"10. If the said G. W. West and Mary Jane, his wife, wish to terminate this agreement they shall give to the said Thomas A. Hatfield one month's written notice of their desire so to do.\"\nSeveral creditors of West, having obtained judgments against him, executions were issued and the goods supplied by Hatfield under the agreement were seized by the sheriff. Hatfield obtained an interpleader order, and an interpleader issue was tried resulting in his favour. The execution creditors then brought this appeal. Latchford and McDougall for the the appellants. The agreement is inconsistent with West being a manager for, or partner wilh Hatfield. Ex parte White: In re Nevill ([i]).\nThe business was carried on in the name of West, and those dealing with him had, and could have, no knowledge of Hatfield being interested.\nKnott for the respondent was not called upon.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014At the time when the agreement which is the subject of consideration in this case was entered into, there were executions in the sheriffs hands against the goods and chattels of \"West, one of the parties to the agreement, so that if the contention of the appellants should prevail, then eo instanti that the goods of Hatfield came into the possession of \"West and his wife, they became \"West's property under the agreement, and would be liable to the executions in the sheriff's hands. Now it is, I think, apparent upon the terms of the agreement, although I admit that this might have been more perfectly expressed, that the intention of Hatfield was to make impossible such a result. The parties never contemplated a sale of the goods by Hatfield to \"West, or to him and his wife. There is nothing in the agreement warranting such a construction There is no provision that West and his wife, or West, shall pay anything to Hatfield as the price of the goods to be placed in the possession of West and his wife under the agreement; in fact the construction of the agreement appears to me to be that Mrs. West should supply the shop where the goods should be sold; that she and her husband, acting as agents of Hatfield, should weekly render a statement of the amount of sales made by them of Hatfield's goods, less certain allowed charges, and that West and his wife, for all their services rendered to Hatfield, should receive nothing whatever but one-half of the net profits arising from the business, and that Hatfield should have the right of determining that agreement at his pleasure at any moment.\nUpon such a contract it is impossible for us to hold that the goods placed by Hatfield in the hands of West and his wife, or of West, under the agreement, became the property of West, and therefore liable to the executions in the sheriff's hands against his goods, or that Hatfield ever lost his property in the goods, except as to the goods sold by West and his wife, under the agreement, as to which there is no question here.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McCarthy & Stuart.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Crispin E.

Lindsay, (1898) 29 S.C.R. 99\nDate: 1898-11-02\nJohn Hyde (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThomas Lindsay (Defendant) Respondent.\n1898: October 24; 1898: November 2.\nPresent: Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick, King and Girouard JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nAppeal\u2014Right to, in Ontario cases\u201460 & 61 V. c. 34\u2014Application to pending cases.\nThe Act 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 34, which restricts the right of appeal to the Supreme Court in cases from Ontario as therein specified, does not apply to a case in which the action was pending when the Act came into force although the judgment directly appealed from may not have been pronounced until afterwards. MOTION for approval of a bond for security for costs on appeal referred to the court by King J. in Chambers.\nThe application to the Judge in Chambers to have the security approved was opposed on the ground that the judgment for the plaintiff at the trial, which was reversed by the Court of Appeal, was for less than $1,000, and the case did not fall within any of the provisions of 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 34, which limits the right of appeal to the Supreme Court from judgments of the courts in Ontario. The plaintiff contended that the Act did not apply, as the proceedings in the cause were pending when it came into force.\nThe writ in the cause was issued in April, 1897. The trial was concluded and judgment reserved by the trial judge on June 25th, 1897, and the Act, 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 34, received the Royal assent on June 29th.\nThe trial judge pronounced judgment in favour of the plaintiff on August 3rd. The case then went to the Court of Appeal where judgment was given reversing the decision of the trial judge on May 10th, 1898.\nThe question for the determination of the court on the motion was whether or not the plaintiff was deprived of his appeal by the said Act.\nBelcourt in support of the motion. This court has decided that the Act 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 25, which extended the right of appeal in Quebec cases to judgments of the Court of Review, did not apply to cases which were pending when it came into force. See Hurtubise v. Desmarteau[1]; Couture v. Bouchard[2]; Williams v. Irvine[3]; Cowen v. Evans[4].\nIf that is the case with respect to an Act granting a right of appeal a fortiori must it be so in regard to the Act in question here by which such right is taken away.\nPratt, contra. The plaintiff applied to the Court of Appeal for special leave to appeal to this court under the Act which leave was refused and he cannot now obtain such leave indirectly.\nThe Act 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 34, is, by its terms, an enactment by Parliament of legislation previously passed in Ontario and cannot be treated as a new Act.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Motion for leave to put in security for costs. The respondent opposes the application on the ground, 1st. That the appellant has made an application to the Court of Appeal in Ontario for special leave to appeal under section 1 (e) of 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 34, which application has been refused. 2nd. That the case is for less than $1000, and not appealable under that section, sub-secs. a, b, c, d. The appellant\u2019s answer is that this statute has no application, because the case was pending before it was passed.\nThe dates are: Writ issued April 10th, 1897; trial, 25th June, 1897; judgment reserved and rendered August 3rd, 1897; judgment in Court of Appeal, May 10th, 1898. The statute in question, 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 34, was sanctioned on the 29th June, 1897.\nWe have to hold under the decisions of this court that the case is appealable, and that the statute does not apply to cases then pending (on June 29th, 1897), though the judgment of the Court of Appeal has been rendered since. If we were not fettered by authority, I, personally, would hold that the statute applies to all cases in which the judgment of the Court of Appeal has been given since it was sanctioned, but I am not at liberty to give effect to my individual opinion. In Hurtubise v. Desmarteau[5], and Couture v. Bouchard[6], the judgments of the Quebec Court of Review appealed from were given, or held to have been given, on the very same day that the Act giving the right to appeal from that court was sanctioned. The appeals were quashed. The decisions on those cases, however, do not directly apply here, though it might perhaps be said that it was assumed in both that if the judgments appealed from had been rendered after the passing of the statute, they would have been appealable. Strong J. (now Chief Justice) gave his opinion that even in that case the judgments would not have been appealable. However, the subsequent decisions of the court on the matter leave no room for doubt.\nIn the case of Williams v. Irvine[7], the action had been instituted in 1890, tried in June, 1891, and judgment reserved, subsequently given on the 17th November, 1891. Judgment in Review appealed from 29th February, 1892. The statute giving an appeal from the Court of Review had been sanctioned on September 30th, 1891. The appeal was quashed, because when the action was instituted there was then no right of appeal from the Court of Review. In Mitchell v. Trenholme[8], the action was for $5,000; the judgment in first instance given on the 27th September, 1890, granted $300 to plaintiff. The Court of Appeal confirmed that judgment on the 28th February, 1893. The statute which enacted that when the right to appeal is dependent upon the amount in dispute, the amount demanded is thereby meant, was passed on the 30th September, 1891. The appeal was quashed, as when the action was instituted it was the amount granted that governed, and as the amount granted by the judgment appealed from was under $2,000 the case was not appealable. In Cowen v. Evans[9], the judgment in the Superior Court, dismissing an action for $3,050, had been rendered on the 5th December, 1891. The judgment of the Court of Appeal on 28th February, 1893, had reversed the judgment of the Superior Court, and granted $880 to plaintiff. The defendant\u2019s appeal to this court was quashed, because the statute passed on September 30th, 1891, giving the right to appeal in cases where the amount granted was less than $2,000, if the amount demanded had been $2,000 or over, did not apply to cases pending en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 before the Superior Court on that day. The words en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 in the report of that case seem to have crept in by error, for, on the same day, in Mills v. Limoges[10], the appeal was quashed in a similar case, where the judgment of the Superior Court had been given in April, 1891, five months before the statute, though the judgment appealed from had been rendered over twelve months later.\nA similar case, The Montreal Street Railway v. Carri\u00e8re[11], is noted as a foot note, at page 335. Here, upon this application, we have the converse of these cases. There, it was a statute giving the right of appeal that was held not to apply to cases pending before the statute, though the judgments appealed from had been rendered since the statute had been enacted. Here we have the question presented under a statute taking away the right of appeal in cases where it existed previously. But I cannot see that it alters the result. If the statute in the former cases does not apply to pending cases, I do not see upon what principle we could hold that the statute in the present case does apply to pending cases. In the objection taken by the respondent that the appellant\u2019s application should be refused because he had unsuccessfully applied for special leave to the Court of Appeal in Ontario before coming here, there is nothing. The mistake he made of his rights cannot deprive him of those rights, or constitute a waiver thereof.\nMotion allowed with costs taxed at $25.\nMotion allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Belcourt & Ritchie.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Pratt & Pratt.\n[1] 19 Can.

N. A. Act. (1867) sec. 112\u2014Debts of late Province of Canada\u2014Res judicata.\nThe award complained of by the Province of Quebec determined that certain payments made by the Dominion of Canada in virtue of the Huron and Superior Treaties with the Ojibeway Indians for arrears of augmented annuities and interest from 1867 to 1873, and for increased annuities in excess of the fixed annuities with interest paid subsequently should be taken into account and included in the debt of the late Province of Canada mentioned in the 112th section of the British North America Act, 1867.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the arbitrators, that the question of these contingent annuities had been considered and decided by Her Majesty's Privy Council in the case of The Attorney-General of Canada v. The Attorney-General of Ontario ([1897] A. C. 199), and that the payments so made by the Dominion were recoverable from the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec conjointly in the same manner as the original annuities.\nAppeal on behalf of the Province of Quebec from the award of the Arbitrators made on the 7th of January, 1898, in the matter arising out of the Huron and Superior Treaties with the Ojibeway Indians maintaining the claim of the Dominion of Canada against the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec conjointly for $95,200, arrears of augmented annuities, with interest to 31st December, 1892, under the said treaties from the year 1867 to the year 1873, and the further sum of $389,106 80, amount of increased annnuities over the fixed annuities, with interest to 31st December, 1892, paid by the Dominion to the said Indians since the year 1874.\nThe arbitrators found \"that in ascertaining and determining the debt of the Province of Canada mentioned in the 112th section of the British North America Act, 1867, the contingent obligation devolving upon the Dominion of Canada to pay the increased annuities mentioned in the Robinson Treaties of the 7th and 9th of September, 1850, and any increased annuities which have become due to the Indians since the 1st day of July, 1867, up to and including the 31st day of December, 1892, shall be taken into account and included in such debt.\"\nTrenholme Q.C. for the appellant. No such award ought to have been made against the Province of Quebec, which ought not to bear any part of the increased annuities in question.\nIn the former appeals before this Court and the Privy Council[1] the question was whether or not Ontario took the lands acquired from the Indians under the Robinson Treaties subject to a trust or interest in favour of the Indians which imposed on Ontario alone the payment of the annuities. See remarks by Lord Watson, in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, at pages 208-211. The fact that the Dominion claimed against Ontario alone in the previous case, and now claims against both Quebec and Ontario, shews that the present case is not res adjud\u00edcala in this matter against Quebec. The previous case was expressly confined to the question of trust or interest in the lands, and the question of the joint liability of Quebec was not argued before the arbitrators, but was reserved for future action by the Dominion. The treaty provided that the Government which was to pay the increased annuities would only be liable to do so from time to time in the event of its receiving increased revenues from the lands. Quebec is now asked to pay increased annuities without receiving any revenue whatsoever, and the position is that the greater the revenue to Ontario the greater is the loss to Quebec. This may continue for an indefinite time and to an indefinite amount. Quebec does not and cannot fall under the conditions of the treaty which imposed the increased annuities, and there was no intention or assent on the part of Quebec at confederation to being placed in that position.\nIt is consistent with section 91 of The B. N. A. Act that such a contingent and uncertain liability connected with the Indians fell upon the Dominion at confederation, and did not go to increase the surplus debt existing at confederation to be borne by these provinces. Section 111 of the B. N. A. Act in declaring that Canada should be liable, not simply for the \"debts,\" but for the \"debts and liabilities\" of each province existing at the union had for its object and effect the imposing of such obligations upon the Dominion, and when by sections 11., 114 and 115 the word \"debt\" alone without \"liabilities\" is used in dealing with the subject of the public debt something different and more restricted is meant than by the use of the more comprehensive terms \"debts and liabilities\" in section 111. The term \"and liabilities\" added after the word \"debts\" means something and adds something, and should be so interpreted.\nThe surplus debt which Ontario and Quebec jointly assumed by section 112, is the surplus debt in actual existence at the time of the confederation, not something that may or may not arise in future out of transactions which the provinces previously entered into. See remarks by Mr. Justice Gwynne in the former case[2] at pages 520 and 523. As a matter of law the liability to pay these increased annuities for the years since Confederation was not a debt of the Province of Canada at that time. Pothier, Obligations No. 218. The award of 1870 dealt with the whole subject and does not support or contemplate imposing such a burthen on Quebec. So far as Quebec's liability for these annuities is concerned, it does not go beyond the inclusion in the debt of the late Province of Canada of the capitalized annuities granted for the Indian lands.\nHogg Q.C. for the respondent, was not called upon.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014(Oral.) The arbitrators came to a proper conclusion as to the point which is now raised and their award ought not to be interfered with, more especially as in the judgment of the Privy Council in the case of The Attorney-General for the Dominion of Canada v. The Attorney-General for Ontario[3], their Lordships, though not expressly deciding the question, may, from their interlocutory observations during the course of the argument, be presumed to have had under consideration contingent annuities as well as those presently payable.\nWe must dismiss the appeal. GIROUARD J. stated that he did not take part in the judgment as there was a majority without him.\n(His Lordship having formerly acted as counsel for the Province of Quebec, sat only by consent of the parties at the hearing of this appeal in order to form a quorum.)\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: N. W. Trenholme.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. D. Hogg.\n[1] The Attorney-General of Canada (1897) A. C. 199; 25 Can. S. v. The Attorney-General of Ontario; C. R. 434.\n[2] 25 Can. S. C.
