Sweezey (Defendant) Respondent.\n1943: November 15, 16; 1944: February 22.\nPresent: Rinfret, Kerwin, Hudson, Taschereau and Rand JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nTrust\u2014Mines and Minerals\u2014Prospector given mission under agreement, with knowledge disclosed to him as to mineral area\u2014Subsequent staking by him of claims in same area for benefit of himself and others\u2014Whether fiduciary relationship between him and other parties to first agreement\u2014Whether latter entitled to share in prospector's interests acquired through said subsequent staking\u2014Constructive trust.\nPlaintiffs and defendant were prospectors. Plaintiffs had in 1923 come across indications of asbestos in a place north of Bird river in Manitoba, and had staked and recorded claims, which lapsed; and had later at times prospected in the area. In 1937 plaintiffs disclosed the area to defendant and an agreement was made whereby defendant undertook \"to stake and record a certain group of Asbestos Mineral Claims in the Bird River area of Manitoba\" for the consideration of a one-fourth interest therein; plaintiffs were to pay the cost of recording and, for that and for \"imparting the special knowledge in directing [defendant] to the geographical location for these staking operations\", plaintiffs were to hold a three-fourths interest in the claims so staked. As found by this Court on the evidence, though the presence of asbestos was emphasized, any other discovery was contemplated; the parties knew that the district generally was mineralized and that any staking would embrace all possibilities. Plaintiffs furnished defendant with a small sketch and description of the location and directed where he could find a cache of mining tools. Defendant went to the district and on his return reported that he had staked four claims but that there was no asbestos and it was not worth while to record them; and consequently plaintiffs did nothing further. At a subsequent time defendant communicated with other parties regarding what he, thought were good prospects in said district and recommended them for further examination; and in the result, under agreements, defendant made visits to the area and staked claims, which were recorded, and which ultimately became subjects of options, defendant being entitled to an interest in what might be realized for the claims. Against this interest of defendant plaintiffs asserted a right.\nHeld: Plaintiffs had bargained for defendant's mature judgment and for that not only on the possibility of asbestos; the expression in the agreement \"asbestos mineral claims\" was descriptive of what had been originally staked (there was no such thing in the mining law as an \"asbestos mineral claim\"; a claim staked and recorded covered all minerals except a few specifically reserved by statute); plaintiffs desired an expert opinion on those claims in the totality of their possibilities. That was the measure of defendant's duty as the fiduciary of plaintiffs in acting upon their disclosure of their special knowledge of mineral indications; defendant undertook to apply his experience to everything found in the area of the claims and, on the strength of the opinion so formed, to stake, if that was called for, and to advise plaintiffs of that opinion. Defendant owed to plaintiffs the utmost good faith in his examination of the structure, formation, and other evidence of the land to which he was directed, and a duty to give them an unreserved account of what he had found and what, in his judgment, the mineral prospect was. He failed to observe that duty. Therefore, as to any interest held by defendant, acquired through the conversion and realization of property which he obtained through information gained in the course of the service he undertook for plaintiffs, he held it as a constructive trustee, and was liable to account to plaintiffs for their share of monies realized. (It would have been proper to take his outlays into account, had there been evidence of any.) Plaintiffs' share of that interest and monies was three-fourths (whether they were entitled to that only\u2014as the Court was inclined to think\u2014or to all, was not in question in this Court). (This Court directed amendment of the judgment for plaintiffs at trial, so as to exclude from its effect certain properties which this Court held were not within the area in respect of which plaintiffs' rights applied.)\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, 51 Man. R. 129, reversed.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] reversing the judgment of Major J.[2] which (by the formal judgment) declared that 75 per cent. of all the benefits which the defendant had received or to which he was or might thereafter become entitled under certain agreements (agreement between defendant and Mac's Mining Syndicate and the members thereof other than defendant, and agreement between defendant and Page; which are referred to in the reasons for judgment in this Court infra) were and would be received by him as trustee for the plaintiffs, declared that the defendant had received under the terms of said agreements certain sums which were received by him as trustee for the plaintiffs, and adjudged their recovery by the plaintiffs from the defendant with interest, granted an injunction and appointed a receiver, ordered that the defendant as trustee for the plaintiffs account to the plaintiffs for 75 per cent. of all money and shares of stock received by him under the provisions of said agreements, and ordered assignment on demand of shares of stock. By the formal judgment in the Court of Appeal, the appeal to that Court was allowed, the judgment of Major J. set aside, the order for receiver vacated and the action dismissed.\nThe material facts and circumstances of the case and the questions in issue are dealt with and discussed in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported and in the reasons (reported as above cited) in the Courts below.\nE. K. Williams K.C. for the appellants.\nP. C. Locke and H. B. Monk for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRand J.\u2014This appeal grows out of a transaction between three mining prospectors of Winnipeg. The plaintiffs, as early as 1923, had come across indications of asbestos in some rough country lying to the north of the Bird River in the Lac du Bonnet mining district of Manitoba and had staked four claims covering about two hundred acres. These were recorded but for lack of money were allowed to lapse. Between that time and 1937, however, on various occasions they visited the area and from time to time did prospecting on it.\nThe defendant had a high reputation as a prospector in Manitoba. He was acquainted with the plaintiffs and on one occasion when they happened to be together, towards the end of September, 1937, the latter intimated that they knew what they thought was a promising mineral spot in an out-of-the-way place, indicating its general location and that, with his assistance, something might be made of it. He readily took up the suggestion with the result that they went to the office of two mining brokers and there drew up a memorandum as follows:\nIt is hereby agreed by the party of the first part that he will undertake to stake and record a certain group of Asbestos Mineral Claims in the Bird River area of Manitoba, for the consideration of a one-fourth or 25 per cent. interest in the group of claims so staked.\nIt is hereby agreed by the parties of the second part that they will provide the necessary funds for the cost of recording such claims in the Mining Recorder's office in the Province of Manitoba, and for the further consideration of imparting the special knowledge in directing the party of the first part to the geographical location for these staking operations, that for so doing these things the parties of the second part are to receive a three-fourths or 75 per cent. interest in the claims so staked.\nIt is further agreed by the party of the first part that he will execute the necessary transfers of the said claims at the time of recording. These transfers to be executed in blank and delivered to the parties of the second part.\nIt is further agreed that the parties of the second part shall have full power to act in all matters respecting the business affairs in connection with the said claims. It is understood that such business affairs shall mean to include that of the disposal of the said claims.\nThe evidence of the plaintiff More and the witnesses Wither and Ward makes it clear that, although the presence of asbestos was emphasized, any other discovery was contemplated. The parties knew that the district generally was mineralized and that any staking would embrace all possibilities.\nThe plaintiffs furnished Sweezy with a small sketch and description of the location and indicated where he would be able to find a cache of mining tools. With this information the defendant, shortly thereafter, went out to look over the land. According to his own statement, he reached a section of bush in which he found evidences of previous prospecting and found also a few tools which he took to be those of the plaintiffs. He says also that he staked four claims.\nOn his return, as he gives it, he reported having done the staking, but protested somewhat violently that there was no asbestos and that it was not worth while to record the claims. On the strength of that opinion, which the plaintiffs accepted with all confidence, nothing further was done.\nSome time in November, when the thirty days for recording had elapsed, the defendant communicated with a Captain Page, manager of a shipping company, and also with a barrister named Buhr, regarding what he thought were good prospects in the district in question, and recommended them for further examination. In the result, under agreements with both, he went back in the early part of December, 1937, and in February of 1938, and either personally or by others under his direction staked twenty-four claims which included the four said to have been staked in October as well as the four originally staked by the plaintiffs in 1923. Later on other stakings were made, both in that area and some distance from it. These claims were recorded and on some, at least, of them assessment work was done by him. In 1942 chrome was discovered in the district. Ultimately, an option was given by Page to the Hudson Bay Exploration and Development Company Limited, covering all of the stakings done by Sweezey and under his direction. For his share in the claims called Page, Smelter and Ace, numbering twenty-seven, Sweezey became entitled to 22\u00bd per cent. of what might be realized for them. On the balance of the stakings, twelve in number, which cover what were known as the Robin and Buhr claims, he held a one-quarter interest in the Mac Syndicate, to which they had been transferred, and the total interests of which had been, in turn, optioned to Page for the considerations mentioned in a memorandum in evidence.\nThe trial judgment declared the defendant to hold all of these interests as to 75 per cent. of them under a constructive trust in favour of the plaintiffs, and in respect of cash received by Sweezey, the plaintiffs recovered the proportion that should have been paid over to them. On appeal that judgment was reversed; and the plaintiffs bring the controversy here.\nThe first question that arises is this: what was the precise undertaking of the defendant? Was it, as contended by him, merely an employment of his labour to stake the described claims without the benefit of his judgment on them or of the area in which they were to be found? I do not think so. The plaintiffs had special knowledge of mineral indications in this limited field off the beaten track of prospectors, and it was of value to them. To disclose that information meant to give up once and for all any advantage they thereby held; all would then be at large; and they did what they thought necessary to protect themselves accordingly. The obligation assumed by the defendant was what they took in return and it was all that remained to them. They had bargained for his mature judgment and for that not only on the possibility of asbestos. The expression in the memorandum of agreement, \"asbestos mineral claims\", was descriptive of what had been originally staked. The plaintiffs desired an expert opinion on those claims in the totality of their possibilities and not on one of them only. That, therefore, was the measure of the defendant's duty as the fiduciary of the plaintiffs in acting upon the disclosure of all the plaintiffs had of value; he undertook to apply his experience to everything found in the area of the claims and, on the strength of the opinion so formed, to stake, if that was called for, and to advise the plaintiffs of that opinion. There was no such thing in the mining law as an \"asbestos mineral claim\". A claim staked and recorded covered all minerals except a few specifically reserved by the statute. He, therefore, owed to the plaintiffs the utmost good faith in his examination of the structure, formation, and other evidence of the land to which he was directed, and a duty to give them an unreserved account of what he had found and what, in his judgment, the mineral prospect was.\nThe trial judge has found that he failed to observe that duty. Instead, he deliberately misled the plaintiffs into discarding the claims as prospects by falsely misrepresenting as to asbestos, and concealing as to other minerals, his own judgment of them.\nTrueman J.A. conceded the existence of a fiduciary relation but treated the original undertaking as at an end in October upon the report of the defendant and acquiescence in it by the plaintiffs. I find difficulty in following this reasoning. That acquiescence was induced by fraud. How can a termination of such a relation so brought about be held to be effective while the fraud still operates? The fraud continued to have effect both on the plaintiffs in their acceptance of the misrepresentation of opinion and on the defendant in his acquisition and capitalization of the claims, and the original duty remained: Carter v. Palmer[3]. I agree, therefore, that as to any interest held by him, acquired through the conversion and realization of property which he obtained through information gained in the course of the service he undertook, the defendant holds it as a constructive trustee and that he is liable to account to the plaintiffs for their share of the monies received in cash.\nIn the opinion of Robson J.A., this is not a case in which the plaintiffs are entitled to follow assets as on a breach of trust, and he cites Lister v. Stubbs[4] as authority for that view. There the agent for purchase of goods had accepted from the seller substantial rebates, and action was brought to recover these monies as having been received to the use of the plaintiff. An application was made for an interim injunction to restrain the defendant from dealing with property into which it was alleged the monies received had been put or invested, and it was on appeal from a refusal of this injunction that the judgment relied upon was given. The holding, however, was strictly limited and it was to the effect that, until the right of the plaintiff to money of the sort in question had been established by a judgment, the court would not assist him in pursuing it into other forms of property. We are dealing here with quite a different situation. The duty of the defendant still attached to the acquisition of the claims and, in his negotiations with Page and Buhr, he must, because of his breach of confidence, be treated as acting on behalf of the plaintiffs as well as himself. It is not a question of receiving money belonging to other persons as was the case in Lister v. Stubbs4, but rather of acquiring in the first instance property which in equity he must hold as a trustee: and any res into which it may be converted carries likewise the impress of the trust.\nRobson J.A. refers also to the case of Lydney v. Bird[5] in respect of allowances that would have to be made the defendant for expenditures properly attributable to the acquisition of the trust property. Since he must be treated as acting on behalf of the three included in the venture, outlays properly made would have to be taken into account, but there is no evidence that he made any. So far as appears, he was paid for all the work he did, and the interests which he now holds under his agreement with Page and in the Mac Syndicate result solely from the transfer to them of the claims. If there had been such disbursements, they should have been brought to the attention of the trial court and, in the absence of any evidence bearing on them, I must assume that there was none.\nMy only difficulty is as to the extent of the property that was so acquired by him. The area described by the plaintiffs, on which Sweezey was to exercise his judgment and act, cannot, I think, be held to take in the eight Smelter claims that lie across the Bird River, nor the three Ace claims. These are too far removed from the Page, Robin and Buhr locations admitted by Sweezey to be included in the area of his original staking in October, 1937, to be considered within the range of his instruction and mission.\nBut his agreement with Page covers an interest in the twelve pages the twelve Smelter, and the three Ace claims, and that interest is 22\u00bd per cent. Four of the Smelter claims are within the plaintiffs' area. There is nothing in the agreement or in the evidence to indicate the relative values of the claims, but if there is any implication in fact it is, I think, that all the claims were dealt with as a unit and without regard to any difference in value. It is as of the time of the agreement fixing that percentage that any relative value would have to be determined and as if the plaintiffs then owned the Page and four of the Smelter claims, and the defendant the balance, and that the 22\u00bd per cent. of total interest was divided between them. Of the twenty-seven claims, sixteen were, therefore, taken for the plaintiffs. The proportion attributable to them on a numerical basis would be 59\u00b73 per cent., but three of the four Smelter claims in the plaintiffs' area appear from the map to be about equal in size to any one of the other claims. I would, therefore, allot as a proper proportion 56 per cent. as being the basis upon which a division should be made. No question arises as to whether the plaintiffs are entitled to all of the defendant's interest or only 75 per cent. of it, because counsel for the plaintiffs stated that he was satisfied with the latter proportion. Even without this statement, I am inclined to think that the claim should be thus limited.\nThe appeal, therefore, should be allowed and the original judgment amended by limiting the share of the plaintiffs in the property to which the defendant may become entitled under the Page agreement to 75 per cent. of 56 per cent. of that interest, and by reducing the judgment for $2,025 to $1,134. The plaintiffs should have their costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nJudgment at trial amended.\nSolicitor for the appellants: N. E. Munson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: P. C.

In order to enlarge the runways, the Crown expropriated some land, surrounding the airport, belonging to the respondent, the latter remaining owner of property adjoining the airport and the expropriated land. The property of the respondent had been subdivided into lots some years previously. On the 28th of February, 1942, as the Crown had made no move to compensate him, the respondent obtained a fiat authorizing him to claim by petition of right due compensation. The respondent claimed $162,911.51, being the value at 9\u00bd cents a square foot of 514,648 square feet of the expropriated land and damages at the same rate to 1,200,210 square feet of adjoining land belonging to him. These damages, it was alleged, resulted from the general operation of the airport, and more especially from the noise, from the dust raised by the starting and the landing of the air machines and from the danger to persons and property; and damages were also alleged to have been created by a servitude or easement \"non aedificandi\" or \"altius non tolendi\" established by certain orders in council and zoning regulations passed by the Federal authorities. The Crown offered an indemnity of $3,000. The Exchequer Court of Canada granted to the respondent a sum of. $36,278.16, being $23,159.16 as the value of the expropriated land, i.e. 514,648 square feet at 4\u00bd cents per foot, and $13,122 for damages to the respondent's property adjoining such land and the air-port, this latter amount being arrived at by allowing 30 per cent depreciation on the value of the land estimated at the same price as the expropriated land. The Crown appealed to this Court, first on the ground that the value of 4\u00bd cents per square foot fixed by the trial judge was too high, and secondly that the respondent had no right to claim damages caused to his adjoining property, even if any existed.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, that the amount which the respondent was entitled to recover from the Crown, for the land expropriated, should be reduced to $10,292.96. Upon the evidence, the amount of 4\u00bd cents per square foot fixed by the trial judge is clearly excessive, and the price per square foot should be reduced to two cents.\nHeld, further, that the respondent was not entitled to any damage which may have been caused to the residue of his property adjoining the expropriated land and the airport.\nPer Rinfret, Taschereau and Rand JJ.\u2014The respondent's claim was brought under the Expropriation Act, which provides that the party expropriating must pay, besides the value of the land actually expropriated, a compensation for land \"injuriously affected\" as a result of the expropriation. But, in this case, it is not the expropriation itself which had \"injuriously\" affected the respondent's adjoining land. As to the depreciation, if any, resulting from orders in council and regulations, passed under the War Measures Act, creating a servitude of \"non aedificandi\" or \"altius non tolendi\", these orders in council were antecedent to the expropriation and would have created the same servitude, if there had been no expropriation. The respondent, therefore, must suffer such prejudice, the same as citizens generally suffer from different kinds of restriction imposed under the present state of war. The depreciation alleged to have resulted from the operation of the aeroplanes, especially from noise, dust raised by them and danger to person and property, may present a different aspect, as these inconveniences would have existed even in the absence of the orders in council; but the respondent is also precluded from claiming any relief on that account. The respondent having subdivided his land into lots, each of them possessed a different entity with no relation to the neighbouring lot; and, although the respondent remained the owner of all the lots, each of them was independent from the other. The principle laid down by the decision of the Judicial Committee in Holditch v. Canadian Northern Ontario Ry. ([1916] 1 A.C. 536, at 540) should be applied to the present case. Each lot taken apart does not confer any advantage to the neighbouring lot; and, therefore, the respondent is not entitled to compensation from the fact that, upon the compulsory taking of some of the lots, he is prejudiced in his ability to use or dispose of the remaining lots: the respondent is in no better position than he would be, if the expropriated lots would have been the property of another person. The mere unity of ownership does not add any value to the lots: there is a lack of such a connection between all the lots from which it would follow that, through the loss of some of them, the others would be depreciated by the privation of the advantages that they had and which were derived from the expropriated lots. Therefore no compensation ought to be awarded on account of noise, dust or danger which may result from the use of the expropriated land. City of Montreal v. McAnulty Realty Co. ([1923] S.C.R. 273) discussed.\nPer Davis and Kerwin JJ.\u2014In a claim arising under expropriation proceedings, the mere fact that a property has been subdivided into lots does not preclude, in all cases, the owner from claiming that lots still retained by him have been injuriously affected when others have been expropriated. But, in this case, there is no evidence of the existence, in relation to the adjoining land, of that unity of possession and control conducing to the advantage or protection of the property as one holding. Therefore, the respondent is not entitled to any allowance for depreciation of any lots retained by him due to the construction or operation of the airport.\nPer Davis J.\u2014The respondent's claim in respect of his adjoining property, for damages caused by the general operation of the airport, has never been made the subject-matter of any petition of right and, consequently, no fiat was ever granted by the Crown to litigate such claim: there was no power in the trial judge to amend the claim in the petition of right by allowing this additional and totally different claim in respect of other lands than those expropriated and covered by the petition of right.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Angers J., awarding to the respondent the sum of $36,278.16, in full compensation for the lands expropriated by the Crown under the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1927, p. 64, and also for damages arising out of such expropriation. The Crown had offered $3,000, and the respondent had claimed $162,911.51.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and Fran\u00e7ois Lajoie K.C. for the appellant.\nJohn Ahern K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Taschereau and Rand JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau, J.\u2014Il s'agit dans cette cause de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 due \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, dont certains terrains ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expropri\u00e9s par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\nA quelques milles, au nord du Cap de la Madeleine, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, une \u00e9cole d'aviation a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, et c'est pour agrandir le champ d'envol\u00e9e et d'atterrissage que les terrains en question ont \u00e9t\u00e9 requis. Il est admis par les parties, que les lots expropri\u00e9s ont une superficie de 514,648 pieds carr\u00e9s, pour lesquels le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a offert la somme de $3,000. C'est l'intim\u00e9 qui a pris l'initiative de faire d\u00e9terminer le montant, et dans sa p\u00e9tition de droit, telle que d\u00e9finitivement amend\u00e9e, il r\u00e9clame $162,911.51 pour la valeur des terrains expropri\u00e9s et pour dommages caus\u00e9s au r\u00e9sidu. En Cour d'Echiquier du Canada, le juge a accord\u00e9 $23,156.16 pour les terrains expropri\u00e9s, soit 4\u00bd sous le pied pour 514,648 pieds carr\u00e9s, et $13,122 pour dommages aux terrains voisins.\nL'appelant appelle de ce jugement, et pr\u00e9tend en premier lieu que le montant de 4\u00bd sous le pied carr\u00e9 est trop \u00e9lev\u00e9, et en second lieu que l'intim\u00e9 ne peut rien r\u00e9clamer pour dommages au r\u00e9sidu de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nEtudions d'abord le premier grief. La partie du lot 420 qui fait l'objet de cette expropriation est situ\u00e9e, comme nous l'avons vu, \u00e0 quelques milles au nord de la cit\u00e9 du Cap de la Madeleine, et constitue aussi la partie la plus au nord du champ d'aviation lui-m\u00eame. Elle est born\u00e9e au nord-est par la voie du chemin de fer Pacifique-Canadien; au nord par le lot 419; au sud par le lot 421; et \u00e0 l'ouest par la partie non expropri\u00e9e du lot 420, qui touche \u00e0 la route provinciale conduisant des Trois-Rivi\u00e8res \u00e0 Shawinigan.\nApr\u00e8s de nombreuses transactions entre J. B. H. Courteau, F.-X. Vanasse, Georges Morrissette, L. T. B. de Grosbois, et le notaire Lebrun qui fut le liquidateur de la Three Rivers Annex Land, l'intim\u00e9 devint propri\u00e9taire de la plupart des subdivisions des lots 418, 419 et 420. Au cours de ventes et de r\u00e9organisations qui se sont op\u00e9r\u00e9es, l'obligation fut contract\u00e9e de construire une fonderie sur le lot 416, et une manufacture de balais sur le lot 419. Environ 75 hommes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9s \u00e0 la fonderie durant un certain temps, mais en 1920 elle a cess\u00e9 d'op\u00e9rer, et fut ras\u00e9e par un incendie. Le lot est demeur\u00e9 vacant jusqu'au 14 avril 1931, date o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu par le sh\u00e9rif \u00e0 U. W. Rousseau. C'est \u00e9videmment la construction de cette fonderie qui, avant 1920, a provoqu\u00e9 dans la r\u00e9gion la vente de plusieurs lots, qui pour la plupart, cependant, sont demeur\u00e9s vacants. Quant \u00e0 la manufacture de balais, elle n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 en op\u00e9ration, et elle fut vendue le 15 juin 1920, par F.-X. Vanasse \u00e0 dame C\u00e9lina Dugr\u00e9, et plus tard d\u00e9molie. Il est important de signaler, que les lots 418, 419 et 420 sont depuis longtemps subdivis\u00e9s, et que des plans indiquant ces subdivisions avec rues et ruelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au bureau d'enregistrement.\nPour d\u00e9terminer l'indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre accord\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re d'expropriation, plusieurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments peuvent et doivent \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration. Ainsi, il est loisible au juge \u00e0 qui l'affaire est soumise d'examiner le prix d'achat, la valeur municipale, les prix pay\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9gion pour des terrains semblables, les d\u00e9penses pour am\u00e9liorations, les revenus provenant de l'immeuble, l'usage que le propri\u00e9taire peut en faire, l'augmentation de valeur des terrains voisins, les opinions des experts, et d'autres circonstances particuli\u00e8res qui peuvent aider \u00e0 trouver une solution. Et quand, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 ces divers \u00e9l\u00e9ments, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance arrive \u00e0 une conclusion o\u00f9 il n'y a pas d'erreur de droit, et que le montant accord\u00e9 est justifi\u00e9 par la preuve, un tribunal d'appel n'interviendra pas. C'est la jurisprudence de cette Cour, \u00e9tablie depuis longtemps, et r\u00e9affirm\u00e9e r\u00e9cemment dans la cause de Elgin Realty Co. vs. The King[1].\nMais si au contraire le tribunal d'appel est d'opinion que le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance appuie son-jugement sur des principes erron\u00e9s, ou que le montant accord\u00e9 est \u00e9videmment excessif, cette Cour alors doit intervenir. (Canadian National Railway Co. vs. Harricana Gold Mine Inc.[2].)\nDans la cause qui nous est soumise, il y a lieu tout d'abord de faire observer (et c'est l'opinion de presque tous les experts entendus) que les lots situ\u00e9s pr\u00e8s de la route Trois-Rivi\u00e8res-Shawinigan ont une valeur plus consid\u00e9rable que les lots expropri\u00e9s. Cette r\u00e9gion est beaucoup plus susceptible de d\u00e9veloppement, et les faits justifient cette pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant. C'est l\u00e0 que des maisons ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9rig\u00e9es, qu'une \u00e9glise et une \u00e9cole ont \u00e9t\u00e9 construites il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, et qu'un modeste bureau de poste a \u00e9t\u00e9 ouvert. A cette \u00e9glise se rendent les fid\u00e8les de la Mission de St-Odilon, \u00e9chelonn\u00e9e le long de la grande route sur une distance assez consid\u00e9rable, et c'est l\u00e0 aussi que les enfants de la m\u00eame r\u00e9gion fr\u00e9quentent la classe. Plusieurs personnes y ont achet\u00e9 des lots sur les subdivisions de 418, 419, 420, et si toutes n'ont pas construit de maisons, il y en a plusieurs qui semblent s'y \u00eatre d\u00e9finitivement fix\u00e9es. Depuis 1915, presque tous les lots en bordure de cette grande route ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus; et l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9galement trouv\u00e9 des acheteurs pour les lots situ\u00e9s sur la 1\u00e8re, la 2\u00e8me, la 3\u00e8me, la 4\u00e8me, la 5\u00e8me et la 6\u00e8me rues qui sont parall\u00e8les \u00e0 la route Shawinigan. Mais naturellement \u00e0 mesure que l\u2019on s'\u00e9loigne de l\u2019art\u00e8re principale, et que l\u2019on se dirige vers l\u2019est, les ventes se font de moins en moins si bien 6eme quelques lots seulement vendus Or, dans cette r\u00e9gion plus propice au d\u00e9veloppement, et certes plus attrayante pour quiconque veut construire une demeure, quel est le prix pay\u00e9 par les acqu\u00e9reurs? II me semble impossible, valeur actuelle des lots expropri\u00e9s, de prendre comme pris de base le prix d\u2019achat des lots vendus de 1915 \u00e0 1924. Il est, je crois, cependant, utile de rappeler ces prix afin de faire voir si la dans cette r\u00e9gion a gagn\u00e9 ou perdu de la valeur.\nDurant cette p\u00e9riode de temps, \u00e0 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 les terrains vendus \u00e0 des prix qui ont fluctu\u00e9 quelque peu. Ainsi, en 1915, vari\u00e9 de 7 \u00e0 12 sous le pied. En 1916, la moyenne entre 8 et 9 sous. En 1917, 7 sous est le prix g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement obtenu, et il en est de m\u00eame pour 1918, alors que trois lots ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus. En 1919, deux lots ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus au prix de 4 sous; en 1921, un lot \u00e0 6\u00bc sous, et enfin en 1924, un lot \u00e0 10 sous. Durant les premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, il faut n\u00e9cessairement attribuer le nombre de ventes assez consid\u00e9rable, au fait que la fonderie la manufacture de balais ont \u00e9t\u00e9 construite, mais il semble \u00e9vident que l\u2019impulsion donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la vente a consid\u00e9rablement avec la disparition de ces deux \u00e9tablissements.\nDe 1924 \u00e0 1927, il n\u2019y eut aucune vente, et au cours de cette derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e, sur la route Trois-Rivi\u00e8res-Shawinigan 5 lots ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus au prix de 1sou et 1\u00bd sou. Apr\u00e8s cette p\u00e9riode, les affaires semblent particuli\u00e8rement inactives, car la vente subs\u00e9quente est en date du 7 ao\u00fbt 1938, sur la route Trois-Rivi\u00e8res-Shawinigan, et ne rapporte que 2 sous carr\u00e9. Une autre vente est faite en d\u00e9cembre de la sur la m\u00eame grande route, au prix de 3 sous. Je laisse de c\u00f4t\u00e9 les deux autres transactions effectu\u00e9es la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e car il s\u2019agit de lots donn\u00e9s en paiement de services rendus et elles ne peuvent en aucune fa\u00e7on aider \u00e0 \u00e9tablir la valeur des terrains expropri\u00e9s. En 1939, 15 lots ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus, tous situ\u00e9s sur la 1\u00e8re rue et sur la route Shawinigan pour le prix moyen de 2\u00bd- sous; et en 1940, jusqu'\u00e0 la date de l'expropriation, le prix moyen obtenu pour 12 lots a \u00e9t\u00e9 3 sous le pied cane. Ces prix d\u00e9montrent clairement que si \u00e0 l'origine, lors de r\u00e9tablissement des deux industries, certains lots ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus 9 et 10 sous le pied, les prix ont sensiblement baisse depuis 1927 pour les lots situ\u00e9s dans le quartier le plus avantageux. Je n'ai tenu compte jusqu'\u00e0, maintenant que des ventes faites avant la date de l'expropriation, qui est celle o\u00f9 les plans ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s, le juillet 1940. J'entretiens des doutes s\u00e9rieux sur la l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la preuve de la vente des lots faits apr\u00e8s cette date, mais elle ne peut pas affecter le r\u00e9sultat de cette cause. Car depuis le 11 juillet 1940, jusqu\u2019au 21 septembre 1942, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, comprenant 23 lots, situ\u00e9s depuis la route principale \u00e0 la 6\u00e8me rue, \u00e0 des prix qui ont vari\u00e9 de 71 sous a 3 sous, faisant une moyenne d'environ 5 sous le pied.\nLa preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00e9galement que des ventes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites r\u00e9gion, des lots 418, 419 et 420. C'est ainsi qu'au sud du lot 420, C. N. de Grandmont a vendu le 22 septembre 1938 \u00e0 la corporation Cap de la Madelaine, pour l'agrandissement champ d'aviation, du lot 423) pour le prix de $3,250, ce qui fait $38 l'arpent, moins de 1\/5 de sou le pied.\nLe 22 avril 1935, le notaire Philippe Mercier a vendu \u00e0 Georges Bilodeau, sur le boulevard Madelaine, au nord de la ville, un endroit ou le terrain \u00e0 infiniment plus de valeur que les lots expropri\u00e9s, 60 arpents pour le prix de $1,400, soit moins de $25 l'arpent, ou une petite fraction de sou le pied. Pierre Loranger a \u00e9galement vendu, en 1939, \u00e0 l'International Foils partie du lot 157 avantageusement situ\u00e9e sur la route Montr\u00e9al-Qu\u00e9bec, 13 arpents de terrain au prix de $250 l'arpent, d'un pied. Enfin, pour ne signaler que ceux-l\u00e0, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 les plans ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s, l'Electric a achet\u00e9 de Philippe Mercier, Antonin Rocheleau, et A. Perreault , au prix de 4\/10 de sou des terrains situ\u00e9s sur le boulevard St-Laurent et dans les environs.\nSi pour determiner la valeur des terrains des expropries, l'on prend base la des terrains voisins, il me semble que la preuve ne justifie par le prix de 4\u00bd sous accord\u00e9 par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance. La grande majorit\u00e9 des ventes faites dans la r\u00e9gion voisine pour des terrains situ\u00e9s dans des localit\u00e9s plus avantageuses n'ont pas rapport\u00e9 ce prix. Au contraire, le prix obtenu a \u00e9t\u00e9 de beaucoup inf\u00e9rieur. Qu'il s'agisse des ventes faites au cours des plus r\u00e9centes ann\u00e9es sur la route Trois-Rivi\u00e8res-Shawinigan, sur les parties les plus avantageuses des lots 418, 419, 420, ou sur les boulevards Madeleine ou St-Laurent, plus pr\u00e8s du centre de la ville du Cap de la Madeleine, on voit que les prix obtenus par des personnes non oblig\u00e9es de vendre, et offerts par des personnes non forc\u00e9es d'acheter, varient d'une fraction de sou \u00e0 3 ou 4 sous le pied carr\u00e9.\nEt c'est sur le prix obtenu au cours des ventes des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es qu'il faut s'appuyer pour d\u00e9terminer la valeur de ces lots. Ce serait une erreur, je crois, d'essayer d'\u00e9valuer le terrain expropri\u00e9 en tenant compte des prix obtenus en 1914, 1915, 1917 ou 1921, car \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, certaines conditions existaient, qui sont disparues maintenant, et qui ne sauraient par cons\u00e9quent jeter aucune lumi\u00e8re sur ce litige. Si j'en ai tenu compte, c'est afin de d\u00e9montrer que cette r\u00e9gion expropri\u00e9e a moins de valeur qu'autrefois, que les lots se vendent \u00e0 meilleur march\u00e9, et la comparaison faite en est la meilleure preuve \u00e0 offrir. Le d\u00e9veloppement y est particuli\u00e8rement lent, et les possibilit\u00e9s d'avenir ne donnent certes pas \u00e0 ces terrains une valeur actuelle de 4\u00bd sous le pied.\nSi l'on ajoute \u00e0 cette preuve que je viens d'analyser, le prix pay\u00e9 par Halin lorsqu'il est devenu propri\u00e9taire des lots 418, 419, 420, ainsi que la valeur municipale, l'on verra la diff\u00e9rence entre ces chiffres, et le prix accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'expropri\u00e9. Il est vrai que le prix pay\u00e9 par Halin \u00e9tait singuli\u00e8rement peu \u00e9lev\u00e9, et que la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que l'\u00e9valuation municipale ne correspond pas \u00e0 la valeur r\u00e9elle de ces lots, mais tout de m\u00eame l'\u00e9cart est tellement frappant qu'il est utile de le signaler.\nLe 17 janvier 1914, F.-X. Vanasse et Georges Morrissette ont achet\u00e9 de J. B. H. Courteau tout le lot 420 pour la somme de $500. Ces m\u00eames personnes \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 propri\u00e9taires des lots 418 et 419, et au cours de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, ils vendirent \u00e0 Halin et \u00e0 de Grosbois ce m\u00eame lot 420 pour le prix de $8,000 payable $166.67 par mois. En 1915, Halin acheta 121 subdivisions du lot 419 et 84 subdivisions du lot 418 au prix de $25 le lot.\nApr\u00e8s la liquidation de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Halin et de Grosbois en 1916, le notaire Lebrun, en sa qualit\u00e9 de liquidateur, vendit \u00e0 Vanasse et Morrissette la plupart des subdivisions du lot 420. A la m\u00eame date, Vanasse et Morrissette revendirent \u00e0 Halin 422 subdivisions du lot 420, 459 subdivisions du lot 418 et 493 subdivisions du lot 419, faisant en tout 1,374 lots pour le prix de $12,000, soit moins de $10 le lot. Plus tard, cet acte non enregistr\u00e9 fut modifi\u00e9, et il fut convenu que le prix de vente pour tous les lots serait de $2,500 payable $500 par ann\u00e9e avec l'obligation de payer $5 par subdivision vendue, faisant un total de $7 par lot, d'\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 2,000 pieds carr\u00e9s. Et ceci ne repr\u00e9sente qu'une valeur moyenne, et les lots \u00e0 l'ouest valant plus, il r\u00e9sulte que Halin a pay\u00e9 moins de $7 pour les lots expropri\u00e9s.\nQuant \u00e0 la valeur municipale, elle est de $2 par lot. Evidemment, elle ne repr\u00e9sente pas la valeur r\u00e9elle; mais \u00e0 4\u00bd sous le pied chaque lot de 2,000 pieds vaudrait $90 et comme il reste 1,700 lots environ non vendus, ceci repr\u00e9senterait une valeur d'au-del\u00e0 de $150,000, \u00e0 rapprocher d'une valeur municipale de $2,400.\nPlusieurs personnes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendues de part et d'autre pour donner leur opinion sur la valeur de ces lots; toutes ne sont pas des \"experts\", mais il y a un grand nombre de personnes d'exp\u00e9rience qui connaissent les lieux et qui ont donn\u00e9 une \u00e9valuation qu'elles croyaient juste. Ainsi J. A. Roy, constructeur de maisons, \u00e9value ces lots \u00e0 \u00bd sou le pied. A la question qu'on lui pose:\n\"En quoi \u00e9tait le terrain?\"\nIl r\u00e9pond:\n\"C'\u00e9tait du petit bois qui poussait, du cypr\u00e8s, des bleuets.\"\nPierre Loranger, propri\u00e9taire de terrain au Cap de la Madeleine, d\u00e9crit le terrain de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que J. A. Roy, et Sim\u00e9on Lapointe, \u00e9valuateur du Cap de la Madeleine durant 10 ans, croit que les lots \u00e0 l'ouest valent $25, mais que la valeur va en diminuant jusqu'\u00e0 un dollar par lot en arrivant aux lots expropri\u00e9s. M. Ernest Fleury, ing\u00e9nieur de la cit\u00e9 du Cap de la Madeleine, conna\u00eet tr\u00e8s bien la ville. Il a fait un relev\u00e9 des ventes, et a produit un plan, o\u00f9 il indique la valeur des lots dans les diverses parties de la ville. Dans son opinion, les lots de Halin valent 1 sou le pied carr\u00e9. Rodolphe Houde, arpenteur de la cit\u00e9 des Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour qu'\u00e0 4\u00bd sous le pied carr\u00e9, le terrain de Halin aurait une valeur de $1,842 l'arpent; aucun autre terrain dans la r\u00e9gion ne s'est jamais vendu \u00e0 un prix aussi \u00e9lev\u00e9.\nEnfin, M. Charles Marquette t\u00e9moigne \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s dans le m\u00eame sens que les t\u00e9moins pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents. M. Marquette a \u00e9t\u00e9 durant plusieurs ann\u00e9es en charge des expropriations pour le d\u00e9partement de la voirie de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valuateur du Canadien-National et a figur\u00e9 dans un tr\u00e8s grand nombre de causes. Il est d'opinion que $20 par lot pour les lots expropri\u00e9s repr\u00e9senterait la valeur maximum.\nDe son c\u00f4t\u00e9, l'intim\u00e9 a fait entendre M. J. H. Laframboise, de Montr\u00e9al. Comme M. Marquette, M. Laframboise a une grande exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re d'expropriation. Il a rendu un t\u00e9moignage tr\u00e8s fouill\u00e9 et tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9, mais je crois qu'il proc\u00e8de sur une base qui est fausse. Il nous dit dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il a examin\u00e9 les ventes depuis 1914, et que la moyenne \u00e9tablit un prix de 0.063 sou le pied carr\u00e9. Pour en arriver l\u00e0, il a n\u00e9cessairement pris en consid\u00e9ration toutes les ventes faites le long de la route Trois-Rivi\u00e8res-Shawinigan, ainsi que celles des autres lots situ\u00e9s sur les 1\u00e8re, 2\u00e8me et 3\u00e8me rues, o\u00f9 la valeur est incontestablement sup\u00e9rieure. En second lieu, il a \u00e9galement tenu compte des ventes faites en 1914, 1915, 1916, 1917, date o\u00f9, \u00e0 cause de conditions sp\u00e9ciales, les prix les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenus. En proc\u00e9dant ainsi, il a de beaucoup augment\u00e9 la moyenne du prix de vente, et il s'ensuit que son calcul ne repr\u00e9sente pas la valeur r\u00e9elle de ces lots. De plus, M. Laframboise donne aux lots expropri\u00e9s une valeur de 8 sous, soit 1 2\/3 sous de plus que la moyenne \u00e0 laquelle il est arriv\u00e9 pour les autres lots.\nRosaire Gratton corrobore enti\u00e8rement le t\u00e9moignage de J. H. Laframboise de m\u00eame que Orner Lacroix, qui lui cependant donne \u00e0 ces lots une valeur de 7 sous.\nAvec beaucoup de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne puis accepter ces pr\u00e9tentions, pour les raisons donn\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, et aussi, parce que ces \u00e9valuations donneraient \u00e0 chaque lot une valeur de $150, soit pr\u00e8s de $3,000 l'arpent. Et malgr\u00e9 que j'aie lu et relu la preuve volumineuse soumise par les parties, je n'ai trouv\u00e9 aucune vente, soit sur la route Shawinigan, le boulevard Madeleine, le boulevard St-Laurent ou ailleurs, o\u00f9 le prix stipul\u00e9 approche ce chiffre fantastique. La preuve me para\u00eet r\u00e9v\u00e9ler au contraire que ces lots n'ont pas la valeur qu'on leur attribue, et qu'il n'y a aucun march\u00e9 permettant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 d'en disposer au prix qu'on lui a accord\u00e9.\nApr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les divers \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s tels que le prix d'achat, la valeur municipale ainsi que celle des lots voisins, les am\u00e9liorations apport\u00e9es, les possibilit\u00e9s futures susceptibles de faire conna\u00eetre la valeur actuelle, apr\u00e8s avoir lu les t\u00e9moignages des experts, et pes\u00e9 les raisons qu'ils donnent \u00e0 l'appui de leurs pr\u00e9tentions respectives, je suis d'opinion que deux sous le pied carr\u00e9 est le maximum auquel peut pr\u00e9tendre l'intim\u00e9.\nJe lui accorderais en cons\u00e9quence pour les lots expropri\u00e9s qui repr\u00e9sentent 514,648 pieds carr\u00e9s, la somme de $10,292.96 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats au taux de 5 pour 100 depuis le 10 juillet 1940, jusqu'\u00e0 la date du jugement de cette Cour.\nL'appelant a soumis en second lieu que l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas droit au montant de $13,122 qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 pour dommages aux terrains voisins de ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expropri\u00e9s. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion que ces autres terrains avaient la m\u00eame valeur que les terrains requis par les autorit\u00e9s f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. Le nombre de pieds affect\u00e9s serait de 972,000, ce qui, \u00e0 raison de 4\u00bd sous le pied donnerait un total de $43,740; mais comme la d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation n'est \u00e9valu\u00e9e qu'\u00e0 30 pour 100, nous arrivons au chiffre de $13,122.\nC'est en vertu de la Loi d'Expropriation, chapitre 64, statuts revis\u00e9s du Canada, que les pr\u00e9sentes proc\u00e9dures sont institu\u00e9es. Cette loi pr\u00e9voit que la partie qui exproprie doit payer non seulement la valeur des terrains actuellement expropri\u00e9s, mais qu'elle doit aussi payer une compensation pour les terrains \"injuriously affected\" comme r\u00e9sultat de l'expropriation.\nLe jugement de la Cour d'Echiquier du Canada mentionne que plusieurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9pr\u00e9cier ces terrains, et en particulier un ordre en conseil et des r\u00e8glements f\u00e9d\u00e9raux pass\u00e9s en vertu de la Loi des mesures de guerre, qui ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 une servitude de non aedificandi, ou altius non tolendi sur les terrains voisins de l'a\u00e9roport. Le jugement mentionne aussi comme autres causes de d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation, le bruit caus\u00e9 le jour et la nuit par le vol des avions, la poussi\u00e8re qu'ils soul\u00e8vent lors de leur d\u00e9marrage ou atterrissage, le danger constant de dommages \u00e0 la personne ou \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nIl me semble qu'on ne peut consid\u00e9rer comme une cause de d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation provenant de l'expropriation, l'ordre en conseil et les r\u00e8glements pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment mentionn\u00e9s. Ce n'est pas en effet l'expropriation qui affecte \"injuriously\" le r\u00e9sidu du terrain, mais bien les ordonnances \u00e9dict\u00e9es en vertu de la Loi des mesures de guerre, qui dans l'occurrence sont ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 l'expropriation, et qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 en vigueur, et cr\u00e9\u00e9 la servitude m\u00eame s'il n'y avait eu aucune expropriation. L'intim\u00e9 doit n\u00e9cessairement souffrir ce pr\u00e9judice, comme tout autre citoyen du pays souffre des restrictions impos\u00e9es par les n\u00e9cessit\u00e9s de l'heure. Le rem\u00e8de, s'il y en a un, se trouve dans la Loi (m\u00eame) des mesures de guerre (art. 7), qui pr\u00e9voit \u00e0 des compensations en certains cas; mais nous n'avons pas \u00e0 nous en occuper ici, car aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par le ministre de la Justice.\nLa d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation caus\u00e9e par le vol des avions, par la poussi\u00e8re qu'ils soul\u00e8vent, par le danger \u00e0 la personne et \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fb \u00e0 leur constante activit\u00e9, pr\u00e9sente un aspect diff\u00e9rent. M\u00eame s'il n'y avait pas eu d'ordre en conseil cr\u00e9ant la servitude, ces inconv\u00e9nients indiscutablement r\u00e9els auraient exist\u00e9, au moins durant un certain temps.\nMais comme nous l'avons vu, l'intim\u00e9 depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es a subdivis\u00e9 ses terrains en lots \u00e0 b\u00e2tir, et chacun de ces lots constitue une entit\u00e9 diff\u00e9rente, n'ayant aucune relation avec le lot voisin. L'intim\u00e9 est bien propri\u00e9taire de tous, mais tous sont ind\u00e9pendants les uns des autres. Or, dans la cause de Holditch vs. Canadian Northern Ontario Railway, jug\u00e9e par le Conseil priv\u00e9[3], il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ce qui suit:\nThe lots had been bought for speculation. They had little individuality. They were chiefly distinguished by the numbers assigned to them and the name of the street on which they fronted. They were sold out and out. No restrictive covenants were taken. There was no building scheme other than the lay-out shown on the registered plan, and this derived its fixity from the legislation affecting it, and not from any notice to the purchaser or any private obligation entered into by him. It is plain that, so far as in them lay, the proprietors of this building estate had parcelled it out in lots, made an end of its unity (other than bare unity of ownership), and elected once for all to treat this multitude of lots as a commodity to trade in.\nThe basis of a claim to compensation for lands injuriously affected by severance must be that the lands taken are so connected with or related to the lands left that the owner of the latter is prejudiced in his ability to use or dispose of them to advantage by reason of the severance. The bare fact that before the exercise of the compulsory power to take land he was the common owner of both parcels is insufficient, for in such a case taking some of his land does no more harm to the rest then would have been done if the land taken had belonged to his neighbour.\nLe Comit\u00e9 Judiciaire en est donc venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il y avait bien unit\u00e9 de possession de tous ces lots, mais que cette unit\u00e9\ndid not conduce to the advantage or protection of them all as one holding.\nDans la m\u00eame cause, on a \u00e9galement dit ce qui suit:\nAs soon as it is decided that the lands taken and the lands in respect of which the claims in question arise are in fact separate and disjoined properties, so that these claims have no connection with the lands taken, it follows upon authority which cannot now be questioned that the arbitrators were right in holding that the claims in respect of noise, smoke and vibration were beyond their jurisdiction.\nCette d\u00e9cision du Conseil priv\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintes fois cit\u00e9e devant cette Cour et en particulier dans la cause de City of Montreal vs. McAnulty Realty Co.[4] o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 avait droit en outre de la valeur des lots expropri\u00e9s \u00e0 une compensation pour les lots voisins d\u00e9pr\u00e9ci\u00e9s comme r\u00e9sultat de l'expropriation. Il est vrai que cette Cour est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la conclusion que les termes de l'article 421 de la charte de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, couvrant les dommages aux terrains voisins, \u00e9taient diff\u00e9rents de ceux employ\u00e9s dans la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d'Expropriation; mais il appert \u00e9galement au jugement que la cause Holditch[5] ne trouve pas d'application parce que les raisons qui, en fait, ont justifi\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision ne se rencontraient pas dans la cause McAnulty4.\nDans cette derni\u00e8re cause, la Cour a jug\u00e9 que comme r\u00e9sultat de conditions impos\u00e9es dans les actes de vente et d'autres circonstances particuli\u00e8res, il existait une telle relation entre les divers lots expropri\u00e9s et ceux qui restaient, qu'il y avait lieu d'accorder une compensation pour indemniser l'expropri\u00e9 des dommages soufferts. Le fait de rompre l'unit\u00e9 de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9ait n\u00e9cessairement une situation d\u00e9savantageuse pour le reste des lots, tandis que dans la cause Holditch[6], la seule unit\u00e9 de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de lots s\u00e9par\u00e9s, que rien ne reliait les uns aux autres, ne faisait pas na\u00eetre un avantage commun \u00e0 tous les lots.\nVoici ce que dit sir Lyman Duff, \u00e0 la page 288:\nOn the other hand, I am bound to say that if one were entitled to govern oneself by Holdritch's case6, Cowper-Essex's case[7], and the case of the Sisters of Charity[8], there appears to be abundant evidence of the existence in relation to Montreal Park of that unity of possession and control, conducing to the advantage or protection of the property as one holding, which was held to exist in Cowper-Essex's case7, and to be absent in Holditch's case6.\nEt M. le juge Anglin, \u00e0 la page 289:\u2014\nIf the principles of those English decisions should be applied, in my opinion, upon the facts in evidence, there was sufficient connection between the lots taken and other lots in the building subdivision still owned and controlled by the respondents to bring this case within the authority of the Cowper-Essex's case7, and the very recent Sisters of Charity of Rockingham case8, and to render inapplicable the decision in the Holditch case6.\nJe suis d'opinion que la pr\u00e9sente cause doit \u00eatre r\u00e9gie par ces principes. Les lots pris isol\u00e9ment ne conf\u00e8rent pas d'avantages aux lots voisins, et, par cons\u00e9quent, le fait pour l'intim\u00e9 d'\u00eatre priv\u00e9 de certains lots ne lui fait subir aucun dommage appr\u00e9ciable au sens de la loi d'expropriation. Il est dans la m\u00eame situation qu'il serait si les lots expropri\u00e9s avaient appartenu \u00e0 une autre personne. La seule unit\u00e9 de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 n'ajoute pas \u00e0 la valeur des lots. Il manque cette relation entre les divers lots qui ferait que par la perte de certains, les autres seraient d\u00e9pr\u00e9ci\u00e9s par la privation des avantages qu'ils avaient et qui provenaient des lots expropri\u00e9s.\nEt quant une cour en arrive \u00e0 cette conclusion, alors, comme cons\u00e9quence de la d\u00e9cision du Conseil priv\u00e9 dans Holditch vs. Canadian Northern Ry. Co.6 il ne peut \u00eatre question d'accorder aucune compensation pour Ie bruit, la poussi\u00e8re ou le danger qui r\u00e9sultent de l'usage du terrain expropri\u00e9.\nL'appel doit donc \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens contre l'intim\u00e9 devant cette Cour. Ce dernier aura droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 de $10,292.96 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats au taux de 5 pour 100 depuis le 10 juillet 1940 jusqu'\u00e0 la date du jugement de cette Cour (Elgin Realty Co. vs. The King[9] et aux deux tiers de ses frais et d\u00e9bours\u00e9s en Cour d'Echiquier du Canada.\nDavis J.\u2014I am in general agreement with the judgment of my brother Kerwin and concur in the disposition of the appeal which he proposes should be made. I have only a word or two to add.\nDealing first with the actual lands taken. During the somewhat extended review of the evidence as to value which we were afforded by counsel, the conclusion became inescapable from my mind that the amount of compensation fixed by the learned trial judge was excessive. The location and the nature of the land, and the almost total absence of any relevant and substantial evidence from which an assessment of present values can be drawn, make it difficult to fix compensation; but I am satisfied that the amount of $10,292.96 arrived at by my brother Kerwin will do no injustice to the suppliant and that judgment for that sum by this Court is a much preferable method of disposing of this branch of the appeal than sending the case back for a reassessment with the delays and expenses which would inevitably be involved.\nOn the other branch of the case, that is, the claim in respect of other lands which were not expropriated, for damages for the noise and general operation of the airport and the zoning regulations, I think the short answer to the claim is that it was never made the subject-matter of any petition of right and consequently, of course, no fiat was ever granted by the Crown to litigate the claim. There was no power in the trial judge to amend the claim in the petition of right by allowing this additional and totally different claim in respect of other lands than those expropriated and covered by the petition of right. Some very nice questions of law may well arise for determination in some other case as to the liability, if any, of the Crown for damages to the owner of lands adjoining or adjacent to a military airport which lands may be adversely affected by the operations carried on at or from the neighbouring airport, or damages for the interference with the freedom of the use of such land by virtue of zoning regulations such as have been passed by Orders in Council under the War Measures Act, but no such question is open upon the record in this case.\nKerwin J.\u2014This is an appeal from a decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada awarding the respondent suppliant, on a petition of right, $23,159.16 compensation for 514,648 square feet of his land expropriated at 4\u00bd cents per square foot; and $13,122 for damages to other land of his which adjoins the part expropriated and the airport at Cap de la Madeleine, in the province of Quebec. This latter amount is arrived at by allowing thirty per centum depreciation on the value of 972,000 square feet at 4\u00bd cents per foot and was awarded (a) for damages suffered by the respondent to such other land, due to the noise and general operation of the airport, and (b) for damages due to what is described as the servitude or easement established by certain Orders in Council and regulations.\nI am satisfied that the allowance of 4\u00bd cents per square foot is unreasonably high. A block of land, including the lots expropriated, was purchased by the respondent in 1914. During the first few years a number of lots were sold but practically none from 1927 to 1938, and since then very few. Many of the lots thus disposed of front on the road from Three Rivers to Shawinigan Falls and a number of these brought only 2 cents per square foot. The lots in question are far removed from this highway. While the municipal assessment is not a decisive factor, the very low assessment in the present case is additional evidence that the price awarded is excessive. In any event, the trial judge did not take into consideration the fact that the prices obtained on the sale of individual lots should not be applied to the disposal by the respondent of a great number of lots at one time. In view of these considerations, the price per square foot, for the lots expropriated, should be reduced from 4\u00bd cents to 2 cents.\nThe land expropriated and the land claimed to have been injuriously affected had been subdivided into lots some years previously. In a claim arising under the Exchequer Court Act and the Expropriation Act, I am far from saying that that mere fact precludes the owner from claiming that lots still retained by him have been injuriously affected when others have been expropriated. In City of Montreal v. MacAnulty[10], this Court had to consider the provisions of the Montreal city charter but Duff and Anglin JJ., as they then were, stated that if the decision in that case were to be governed by Holditch's case[11], there was evidence of the existence in relation to Montreal Park of that unity of possession and control conducing to the advantage or protection of the property as one holding, which was held to exist in Cowper-Essex case[12], and to be absent in Holditch's case11. Here, there is no such evidence and the respondent, therefore, is not entitled to any allowance for depreciation of any lots retained by him due to the construction or operation of the airport.\nThe first Order in Council referred to is P.C. 3867, dated November 28th, 1939, made under the provisions of the War Measures Act, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 206. This Order in Council made and established what are known as The Airport Zoning Regulations, 1939. By them a prohibition was enacted against any person erecting or constructing on land adjacent to any airport in Canada, designated by the Minister of Transport for direct or indirect use for military purposes, any building, chimney, pole, tower or other structure exceeding a height of one foot for every twenty feet that such building is located from the boundary of such airport, or exceeding the height of one foot for every fifty feet that such building, etc., is located from such boundary when the location is within the \"flightway\". The second Order in Council, P.C. 322, dated January 17th, 1941, amende P.C. 3867, but its provisions need not be detailed.\nThe airport at Cap de la Madeleine, which had been established by that municipality, was leased by the latter to the appellant as of June 3rd, 1940, for the duration of the war and as long thereafter as the appellant required. The expropriation occurred on July 10th, 1940, and it was only on November 12th, 1940, that the Minister of Transport designated the airport for direct or indirect use for military purposes and thus made it subject to the Airport Zoning Regulations, 1939. I doubt if the petition of right, even as amended, is sufficient to include any claim by the respondent for damages caused by such designation but, even if it were, neither the Expropriation Act nor the Exchequer Court Act provides for any such claim even where part of his lands was actually taken by the appellant. It is unnecessary to consider whether there has been an appropriation under the War Measures Act of any part of the respondent's lands not actually expropriated, as no order of reference has been made under section 7 thereof. The judgment a quo should be amended by substituting the following for clauses 3 and 4 thereof:\u2014\nThis Court doth order and adjudge that the said Suppliant, upon his delivering to His Majesty the King a valid and sufficient release or releases of any claim, liens, charges or encumbrances of any kind or nature whatsoever which may have existed upon the lands expropriated, including any seigniorial dues which may affect the land expropriated, is entitled to recover from the appellant the sum of $10,292.96 for 514,648 square feet of land expropriated at two cents per square foot; and this Court doth further order and adjudge that the Suppliant is not entitled to any damage that may have been caused to the residue of his property adjoining the said lands and the airport at Cap de la Madeleine, either for noise and general operation of the airport or by reason of the said airport having been designated a military airport under and by virtue of Orders in Council no. 3867, dated November 28th, 1939, and no. P.C. 322, dated January 7th, 1941, and the Airport Regulations, 1939.\nThis Court doth further order and adjudge that the said Suppliant is entitled to recover from His Majesty the King two-thirds of his costs of the action to be taxed.\nThe respondent is entitled to interest on the said sum of $10,292.96 at the rate of five per centum per annum from July 10th, 1940, to the date of the judgment of this Court but must pay to the appellant the latter's costs of the appeal to this Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs and judgment varied.\n[1] [1943] S.C.R. 49.\n[2] [1943] S.C.R. 382.\n[3] [1916] 1 A.C. 536, at 540.\n[4] [1923] S.C.R. 273.\n[5] [1916] 1 A.C. 536.\n4 [1923] S.C.R. 273.\n[6] [1916] 1 A.C. 536.\n6 [1916] 1 A.C. 536.\n[7] (1889) 14 A.C. 153.\n[8] [1922] 2 A.C. 315.\n7 (1889) 14 A.C. 153.\n6 [1916] 1 A.C. 536.\n7 (1889) 14 A.C. 153.\n8 [1922] 2 A.C. 315.\n6 [1916] 1 A.C. 536.\n6 [1916] 1 A.C. 536.\n[9] [1943] S.C.R. 49, at 53.\n[10] [1923] S.C.R. 273.\n[11] [1916] 1 A.C. 536.\n[12] (1889) 14 A.C. 153.\n11 [1916] 1 A.C. 536.\n"}

The present appeal was by the suppliant from the subsequent determination of the damages.\nHeld: The trial Judge had, in assessing the damages in respect of the vessel itself, correctly appreciated and properly applied the directions of this. Court; and had also properly disallowed interest on the amount awarded: the Crown is not liable to pay interest unless the statute or contract provides for it; but the amount awarded should be increased by allowance for loss of certain supplies; and also by allowance for loss of profits during the period which would have been required for repairs: the fact that the suppliant's petition of right was submitted on behalf of and for the benefit of underwriters (subrogated to the suppliant's rights) did not justify disallowance for such loss of profits; the underwriters stood in the place of the suppliant and were \"entitled to succeed to all the ways and means by which the person indemnified might have protected himself against or reimbursed himself for the loss\" (Simpson v. Thomson, 3 App. Cas. 279, at 284).\nAPPEAL by the suppliant from a judgment of Angers J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nThe action had been brought by way of petition of right to recover damages against the Crown (in the right of the Dominion of Canada) for the loss of the suppliant's tow-boat Ostrea (which was equipped for salvage operations) and its equipment and salvage equipment, resulting, so it was alleged, from its striking the submerged portion of the outward end of a jetty, the top portion of which outward end had been broken away by a storm. The facts as to the jetty and as to the accident now in question are discussed at length in a previous judgment of this Court reported in [1940] S.C.R. 153. That judgment was on an appeal and a cross-appeal from a previous judgment of Angers J. in the action[1]. Angers J. had held that the jetty was a public work within the meaning of s. 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 34), that the Ostrea struck the aforesaid submerged portion of the jetty, that the collision was attributable to the negligence of officers or servants of the Crown while acting within the scope of their duties or employment upon a public work (within said s. 19 (c)), and that the Crown was liable in damages; and those holdings were sustained by the said judgment of this Court[2]. But Angers J. had held that,\nafter the accident, the master of the Ostrea was negligent in not taking the means of ascertaining the extent of the damage caused to his vessel by the collision, before proceeding to sea. Had he found that the vessel was leaking, as I think he should have, if he had made a proper inspection of the hull immediately after the impact, he would not or at least should not, assuming he had acted prudently, have proceeded on his voyage but should have brought back his vessel to the wharf. He would thus have avoided the loss of his ship and of her equipment.\n***\nI have no doubt that the extent of the damage caused to the ship by the collision would have been detected if a proper inspection had been made immediately after the collision.\nIn the circumstances, I believe that the damage for which the respondent is responsible is limited to the cost of the repair of the vessel. Unfortunately there is no evidence in the record enabling me to determine the said cost. If the parties cannot agree on an amount, they will be at liberty to refer the matter to me and to adduce evidence for the purpose of establishing, as exactly as possible, what the repair of the vessel would have cost.\nand by the formal judgment in the Exchequer Court, the relief had been limited to\nthe damages to the vessel directly attributable to the collision with the obstruction in the vicinity of the pier as alleged, had such damages been ascertained immediately after the said collision, the amount thereof to be established by reference to the Court if the parties cannot agree.\nIn this Court, the Chief Justice and Davis J., dissenting on this question, would have allowed the suppliant the amount of damages claimed in its appeal, but the majority of the Court (Rinfret, Crocket and Kerwin JJ.), the judgment of whom was written by Crocket J., were of opinion:\nthat there was sufficient evidence to support the learned trial judge's finding that after the collision there was negligence on the part of the steamboat's officers in not discovering sooner than they did the extent of the damage caused to the vessel's hull in passing over the obstruction and that had they acted promptly and prudently in this regard, the vessel would not have continued its voyage for 3\u00bd miles into the open bay.\nThere can be little doubt that the total loss of the vessel and its equipment would have been avoided had an attempt been made either to return her to the wharf or to beach her at some nearby point. For this reason, though not convinced of the correctness of the statement appearing in His Lordship's reasons that the damage should be limited to the cost of the repair of the vessel, I concur in the terms of the formal judgment in so far as it declares that the suppliant is not entitled to compensation as for a total loss as claimed, but is entitled to recover the damages directly attributable to the collision. I would not, however, restrict the condemnation to damages to the vessel alone and would delete from the order the words \"had such damages been ascertained immediately after the said collision\", and leave the assessment open generally to such damages as are directly attributable to the collision. It is not at all clear upon the existing evidence that, had the extent of the damage to the steamer's hull been promptly discovered and the master brought her back to the dock or beached her at the nearest possible place, no further loss would have been sustained than the damages to the vessel itself, which were ascertainable immediately after her collision with the submerged obstruction.\n***\nFor the above reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs, allow the cross-appeal to the extent of varying the declaration of the formal judgment of the learned trial judge limiting the assessment of damages in the manner stated, and, failing an agreement between the parties, remit the case to the Exchequer Court for their determination on the basis of the suppliant being entitled to all such damages as are directly and naturally attributable to the collision. The suppliant, I think, is in the circumstances entitled to costs on its cross-appeal as well as on the appeal.\nand by the formal judgment in this Court, the Crown's appeal was dismissed, the suppliant's cross-appeal was allowed, and the judgment of Angers J. was varied \"by directing an assessment of damages in the manner stated in the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Crocket\", and, failing agreement as to the amount, the case was remitted to the Exchequer Court for the determination of such damages.\nThe matter of assessment of damages, on the basis laid down by this Court, came before Angers J. By his judgment (from which the present appeal is taken by the suppliant), he held: that the contention that it was impossible to bring back the Ostrea to the wharf or to beach her safely and that the loss of the vessel and her equipment was unavoidable, had been finally disposed of and was no longer at issue; and, on the evidence, that the Ostrea could have been brought back to the dock, securely, had someone on the vessel investigated carefully, immediately after the impact, to ascertain the extent of the damage, and in any case there was no difficulty in the way of beaching her on the west side of the breakwater, and further she could have been beached to the eastward, but, as there was a rocky bottom there, her hull would very likely suffer additional damage; that, with competent and prudent handling after the collision, the vessel, with her equipment, could have been saved; that if she had been brought back to the dock she probably would have sunk alongside the dock and would have had to be refloated; that it was reasonable to assume that the captain of a vessel, having two courses at his disposal, viz., taking her back to the dock or beaching her, would, the chances being equal, adopt the first one, thus avoiding the possibility of aggravating the damage in beaching the ship. He held that the suppliant should be allowed $3,000 for the cost of refloating and temporary repairs, $150 for a survey of the vessel, $500 for cost of repairing (a further allowance for taking her to a shipyard for repair would have been made had there been any evidence of such cost), $600 for the cost of salvaging the equipment, $60 for certain items of damage to the equipment (that, there being no amounts mentioned in connection with certain other items, nothing could be allowed therefor, the evidence was quite inadequate and unsatisfactory, and the burden of prooof was upon the suppliant; that much of the equipment would not have been damaged at all); that, as the petition was submitted on behalf and for the benefit of the underwriters, the question of loss of profits which the suppliant might have incurred need not be considered, as the underwriters had no interest in the profits, but had an amount been allowed, he would have been inclined to fix it at $400, representing the loss incurred during the period within which the repairs could have been properly effected. In the result, judgment was given for the suppliant for $4,310; without interest, as the Crown was not liable to pay interest except when provided for by statute or by contract. The suppliant was given the costs of the action.\nThe items referred to in the reasons for judgment in this Court infra as \"supplies described as disbursements\", as to loss of which no allowance was made in the judgment of Angers J., were: \"coal, water, oil, waste, grease, dynamite, batteries, fuse, electric wires, food, lanterns, cutlery.\"\nThe suppliant appealed to this Court, alleging errors in the findings and holdings of Angers J., and asking for allowance of a largely increased amount.\nW. C. Macdonald K.C. for the appellant.\nF. D. Smith K.C. and C. Stein for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014We think that in the assessment he made of the damages representing the loss of the Ostrea the learned trial Judge correctly appreciated and properly applied the directions contained in the judgment of this Court of the 9th of December, 1939[3]. We also agree with the learned Judge that no interest should be allowed on the amount awarded to the suppliant. The Crown is not liable to pay interest, unless the statute or contract provides for it; and such is not the case here.\nIt appears to us, however, that the suppliant is entitled to compensation for the loss of supplies described as disbursements. It is true that the evidence in respect of these disbursements was not altogether satisfactory; but, in our view, it establishes a loss to the value of at least $1,500, as a minimum.\nFurther, there is the question of the profits lost. The learned Judge said he felt inclined to fix them at $400, representing the loss incurred during a period of fifteen days within which repairs, in his opinion, could have been properly effected. He did not, however, allow the amount to the suppliant, on the ground that the petition was submitted on behalf of and for the benefit of the underwriters; and that the latter, according to him, had no interest in the profits. The judgment of this Court had already indicated that the appellant was entitled to the loss of profits while\" the Ostrea was undergoing repairs; and, moreover, with respect, in a case of this kind, the underwriters stand in the place of the suppliant and they are \"entitled to succeed to all the ways and means by which the person indemnified might have protected himself against or reimbursed himself for the loss\". (Simpson v. Thomson (1)). We are disposed to accept the amount mentioned by the learned Judge as representing the loss of profits, and we think that sum should be added to the award made.\nIn the result, the judgment appealed from should be modified and an additional sum of $1,900 added to the amount allowed to the suppliant. Otherwise the appeal should be dismissed. In view of the divided success, there should be no costs in this Court to either party.\nJudgment below modified by allowing additional sum to appellant; otherwise appeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L.

These \"costs\" are the costs of the action which a party to that action is condemned to pay. The costs of other suits, connected with the main action, which costs a party is condemned to pay in addition to the amount granted by the main action, really form part of, and should be added to, that amount in order to determine the \"amount or value of the matter in controversy\".\nIn the present case, the amount granted to the plaintiff by the main action was a sum of $1,882; but the appellant, defendant in sub-warranty, besides being condemned to pay that amount, was also ordered to indemnify in full the defendant in warranty and indirectly the principal defendant. The costs incurred by these two defendants, which the appellant was thus obliged to pay, should be added to the principal amount for the purpose of determining \"the amount or value of the matter in controversy\".

Caron a produit une intervention demandant le rejet de l'action principale et M. le juge Gibsone a maintenu cette intervention, a rejet\u00e9 l'action principale avec d\u00e9pens, ainsi que les deux actions en garantie, mais sans frais.\nLa Cour de Banc du Roi en est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente. Elle a rejet\u00e9 l'intervention, maintenu l'action principale pour la somme de $1,882, avec int\u00e9r\u00eats et d\u00e9pens, maintenu l'action en garantie, et condamn\u00e9 le d\u00e9fendeur en garantie \u00e0 indemniser le demandeur en garantie de la condamnation prononc\u00e9e sur l'action principale en capital, int\u00e9r\u00eats et frais, y compris les frais de l'action en garantie ex parte.

Evidemment il ne peut \u00eatre question de tenir compte dans la d\u00e9termination du montant en jeu, des frais de l'intervention, ni des frais de l'action en arri\u00e8re-garantie, qui sont les frais de l'action dans laquelle l'appelant est condamn\u00e9; mais il en est autrement des frais des autres actions qui sont entre des parties diff\u00e9rentes et qui font partie du capital que l'appelant doit payer, en vertu du jugement qui le condamne \u00e0 indemniser le d\u00e9fendeur en garantie, et indirectement le demandeur principal.\nComme le montant de $1,882 plus les int\u00e9r\u00eats et les frais de l'action principale, ainsi que ceux de Taction en garantie forment un montant sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 $2,000, il s'ensuit que cette Cour a juridiction de piano pour entendre cet appel, et que la motion doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.

Two of the defendants, who resided outside the jurisdiction, were not served with the writ of summons, and the action proceeded against the present respondent and the other defendant. The trial Judge, Robertson J., in a judgment written subsequent to the trial, held that the present respondent had no authority from his co-owners to enter into the agreement (as the trial Judge found he had done) and dismissed the action as against the said other defendant, but he held that the present respondent would be liable for damages for breach of warranty of authority and that the plaintiff should be allowed to amend his statement of claim by pleading a claim therefor. The formal judgment at trial gave the plaintiff liberty to amend his statement of claim by inserting therein a claim for damages against the present respondent for breach of warranty of authority, adjudged that the plaintiff was entitled to damages against the present respondent for such breach of warranty, to be assessed, and directed an enquiry as to damages. No assessment of damages was made. (No evidence as to damages under the original claim for damages was given at the trial, it being agreed that if there should be a finding for the plaintiff, there should be a reference as to the damages). An appeal by the present respondent was allowed by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], which dismissed the action as against him.

In accordance with leave granted by the trial judgment, the plaintiff amended his statement of claim but did not claim any specific amount of damages in connection with the alleged new cause of action.\nThe sums which had already been claimed have reference only to the cause of action originally put forward by the plaintiff, upon which he did not succeed even before the trial judge. The most that the plaintiff could secure by his appeal to this Court would be the restoration of the trial judgment.

One ground on which the judgment appealed from was based was that in the circumstances the discretion of the Court should be exercised against allowing the mandamus; and therefore the judgment was one \u201cmade in the exercise of judicial discretion\u201d and appeal was barred by s. 38 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 35); the case did not fall within the exception in s. 38 of \u201cproceedings in the nature of a suit or proceeding in equity * * *\u201d: while power resided in the Court of Chancery in England and now exists in the Supreme Court of Ontario to grant mandatory injunctions in suits or proceedings in equity, such jurisdiction was not and is not exercised against public officers to compel them to do their duty.\nMOTION to quash, for want of jurisdiction, an appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], which (reversing an order of Mackay J.) dismissed the present appellant\u2019s motion for a mandamus to compel the warden and the treasurer of the County of Victoria to execute and deliver a tax deed of certain land, of which the present appellant had become the purchaser at a tax sale; and also MOTION by the appellant for special leave to appeal, if in the opinion of the Court such leave was necessary. (Leave to appeal to this Court had been refused by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.)\nJ.E. Anderson K.C. for the motion to quash and against the motion for special leave to appeal.\nE.G. Gowling against the motion to quash and for the motion for special leave to appeal. THE COURT.\u2014In accordance with the Ontario Rules of Practice, J.W. Gravestock applied, by originating notice of motion, for a prerogative mandamus to compel the Warden and Treasurer of the County of Victoria to execute and deliver a tax deed of certain lands of which he had become the purchaser at a tax sale. The mandamus was granted by the judge of first instance but the Court of Appeal dismissed the application. So far as appears from the judgments, the lands are of very little value but, if jurisdiction exists in this Court, Gravestock is entitled to proceed with the appeal he has launched from the order of the Court of Appeal and the motion to quash should not be granted.\nThe reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal were given by Mr. Justice Kellock and concurred in by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Gillanders. It was therein determined that one Wood, who appears to have had no interest in the lands but who had paid to the Treasurer the amount necessary to redeem the lands, was a person entitled to redeem within the meaning of the phrase \u201cany other person\u201d as used in section 177 of The Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1937, chapter 272. If Gravestock decided to institute an action for a mandamus, he would be faced with this decision. However, he is also met with the objection that his appeal to this Court is barred by section 38 of the Supreme Court Act because Mr. Justice Kellock proceeded to declare that in the circumstances the discretion of the Court should be exercised against the applicant and the prerogative mandamus refused.\nSection 38 reads as follows:\u2014\n38. No appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment or order made in the exercise of judicial discretion except in proceedings in the nature of a suit or proceeding in equity originating elsewhere than in the province of Quebec.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal is based on two distinct grounds, neither of which may be treated as obiter, and is therefore a judgment made in the exercise of judicial discretion. While power resided in the Court of Chancery in England and now exists in the Supreme Court of Ontario to grant mandatory injunctions in suits or proceedings in equity, such jurisdiction was and is not exercised against public officers to compel them to do their duty. This case, therefore, does not fall within the exception in sec- tion 38 of \u201cproceedings in the nature of a suit or proceeding in equity originating elsewhere than in the province of Quebec\u201d.\nThe motion to quash is granted with costs. Even if special leave to appeal could be given, this is not a case where it should be granted and the motion therefor is dismissed with costs.\nMotion to quash granted with costs.

(Judg\u00adment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, 17 M.P.R. 147, which, by a majority, had affirmed judgment in the Probate Court admitting the document to probate, reversed.)\nPer the Chief Justice and Kerwin, Taschereau and Rand JJ.: Facts in evidence cast on the whole case such a doubt of the competency of the testatrix as required the Court to say that the onus of showing the document to be the will of a \"free and capable\" person had not been met.\nThere may be testamentary incapacity accompanied by a deceptive ability to answer questions of ordinary and usual matters: that is, the mind may be incapable of carrying apprehension beyond a limited range of familiar and suggested topics. A \"disposing mind and memory\" is one able to comprehend, of its own initiative and volition, the essen\u00adtial elements of will making, property, objects, just claims to con\u00adsideration, revocation of existing dispositions, and the like. Merely to be able to make rational responses is not enough, nor to repeat a tutored formula of simple terms. There must be a power to hold the essential field of the mind in some degree of appreciation as a whole, and this was not present here.\nPer Hudson J.: Once testamentary capacity is called in question, the onus lies on those propounding a will to affirm positively the testamentary capacity (Robins v. National Trust Co., (1927] A.C. 515, at 519). The trial Judge's decision was on the assumption that the onus was on those attacking the will, and in this (on the issue of testamentary capacity) he was mistaken. In view of that mistake and of the doubts he expressed in reaching his conclusion, the rule, suggested from decisions in this Court, against disturbing concurrent findings of fact in the courts below did not apply, and it was the duty .of this Court to review the evidence and come to its own con\u00adclusion, subject, of course, to the normal weight to be given to the trial Judge's findings and to the opinions of the Judges in. appeal. On the evidence, the deceased's mental capacity at relevant times was open to some doubt, and the rule is that wherever a will is prepared and executed under circumstances which taise the suspicion of the court, it ought not to be pronounced for unless the party pro-pounding it adduces evidence which removes such suspicion and satis\u00adfies the court that the testator knew and approved the contents of the instrument. (Hudson J. expressed \"some hesitation\" in his conclusion against validity of the will. Also, dealing with the issue of undue influence, he pointed out that the onus was on those asserting undue influence, and held that the findings below that undue influence had not been proved should not be disturbed.)\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division[1], dismissing (Fair-weather J. dissenting) the present appellants' appeal from the judgment of the Honourable Edward G. Byrne, Judge of Probate for the County of Gloucester, admitting to probate the document propounded as the last will and testament of Albina Poirier, late of Bathurst, New Brunswick, deceased, in proceedings taken (in view of caveat filed on behalf of the present appellants) by the present respondent, the executor appointed by the said document, to have the same proved in solemn form. The main grounds alleged against validity of the document as a will were testamentary incapacity and undue influence.\nJ. F. H. Teed K.C. for the appellants.\nC. T. Richard for the respondent. The judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin, Tasche\u00adreau and Rand JJ. was delivered by\nRAND J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Fairweather J. dissent\u00ading, affirming the finding of the Probate Court of Glou\u00adcester County that the document propounded for probate by the respondent was the last will of Albina Poirier. The probate was opposed by two grandchildren, the appellants, children' of a deceased daughter, and the grounds were undue influence on the part of a son, the respondent, and incompetency.\nThe testatrix at the time of executing the document, November 21st, 1941, was about seventy-nine years of age. Her husband had been a merchant in Bathurst and from the time of his death in 1918 she continued the business until 1935 or 1936 when it was transferred to the son. She had been a vigorous and capable woman but in the fall, of 1941 her health began to fail rapidly, ending in her death on March 2nd, 1942. The instrument was prepared by, a solicitor, Mr. Robichaud, and he states that at the time she was in a very feeble condition.\nFrom the spring of 1939 until her death, her home was occupied by her son with his wife and family. The num\u00adber of the children is not given but the family is described as large. In August, 1941, it was thought necessary to have someone in attendance to help the deceased look after herself and get about the house, and a young grand-niece, Rose Gosselin, was engaged who remained until some time in January, 1942. She was a bright girl of over seventeen years who, through close association, probably had a better opportunity than any other person to observe the actual state and progress of the mother.\nThis girl tells us that, from September until she left, in spite of the mother's protests, the front door of the home was kept looked and the key retained by the son or his wife. Persons calling to see the mother were admitted only after they had passed the scrutiny of the one or the other. Both the wife, of the appellant grandson and a Mrs. Lasnier, who had been brought up in the family, were told by the mother to enter the house by the back door and to go upstairs to her room without regard to the family below. On at least two occasions the son showed such anger and hostility to their visiting as to order them out of the house. In the spring of 1939 'he had done that to Mrs. Lasnier at the time of a 'short visit but, on the mother's plea, she had remained. These two young women were both thoughtful and considerate of the older woman who had for them a cordial regard; but to the son, particu\u00adlarly in the later stages, obsessed with a determination to control his mother's property, they appeared as if bent on frustrating him. So far as the evidence goes, such a notion was utterly groundless. All of this conduct, of course, was with reference to a home, not of his own, but of his mother's. That she desired to live alone is beyond doubt. She had spoken to; a Father McKenna about it. She disliked the son's wife. In August, 1941, she had consulted Robichaud as to means by which the family could be forced out. Later, she protested to the son that he must go away, that the children bothered her and she wanted to be alone; but to no purpose.\nOn the morning of November 21st, 1941, the son arranged with Robichaud to come to the home and prepare a will, but it does not appear who raised the matter in the first instance. In the afternoon, before Robichaud arrived, he had a conversation with his mother. The Gosselin girl was present part of the time and what was said is of much importance. She recounts the colloquy in which the mother's words were drawn out by the questions of the son:\nHe came and talked to her before Mr. Robichaud came how she was going to fix her affairs. \u2026 He asked her how much money she wanted to give.\nQ. What were the first words he told her that you do remember?\nA. \"How do you want to fix that?\"\nQ. What did Mrs. Poirier say?\nA. She didn't talk.\nQ. Did Mrs. Poirier repeat anything that Hector had said to her?\nA. Yes. When he asked her \"How do you want to fix that?\", she repeated that.\nQ. The exact words?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did she do that often, repeat the exact words?\nA. She nearly always repeated.\nQ. What did she say?\nA. She repeated what he said, \"What do you want to do? You want\nto give $2,000 to Adrien, $2,000 to Yvette?\"\nQ. After she repeated these words to Hector, what did Hector say?\nA. Hector spoke next. Hector said \"You want to give $2,000 to Adrien, $2,000 to Yvette.\" Mrs. Poirier would repeat behind what he said. Court : Just what words did she say?\nA. She repeated the same thing, \"$2,000 to Adrien, $2,000 to Yvette.\" That's what Mrs. Poirier said. \"You want to give $2,000 to Adrien.\" She repeated the same thing for Yvette. \"2,000 for Adrien, $2,000 for Yvette,\"\nQ. Now what conversation was said after that?\nA. About the house. Hector said, \"The house, to wham do you want to give it?\" She said, \"The house, I want to give it to Yvette.\"\nQ. Next?\nA. He said, \"You don't want to give it to Marcelle?\"\nQ. Who is Marcelle?\nA. The oldest girl at Hector Poirier's.\nQ. What did she say to that?\nA. She said \"Give the house to Marcelle? No.\"\nQ. What was said next?\nA. Hector said \"Give it to me.\"\nQ. What did she say?\nA. She said \"No.\"\nQ. Then what?\nA. Then I went away.\nQ. How did Hector address her, calmly?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did that change?\nA. Yes, when she wouldn't give him the ''house.\nQ. Did Hector get angry?\nA. He was not in good humour.\nShortly after three o'clock Robichaud was shown up-stairs by the son who remained in his mother's presence at least until the gifts of $2,000 were mentioned. He told the granddaughter, Mrs. Yvette Leger, when the will was produced by him to be read, that he did not know its contents: but a letter to Mrs. Lasnier of December 1st in evidence, the fact that the document had been handed to him by Robichaud following its execution, and his com\u00adplete assumption of authority over his mother's affairs thereafter, refute that statement.\nNow, the mother had made a will in 1930 in which the son was bequeathed $2,000, the grandson $5,000, and the residue, less a small bequest for masses, left to the grand-daughter. The executors were the last named and a Father Robichaud. This distribution was repeated in another drawn in 1040 in which a Father Poirier was named execu\u00adtor, the circumstances of the execution of which, however, on the objection of the respondent, were not allowed to be proven. Father McKenna, who drew both wills, says, a propos of having, a lawyer, that she seemed \"to have some kind of fear of lawyers and implicit faith in the clergy\". The first 'of these instruments was executed in the home of the grandson. The will of 1941, of an estate of 'approxi\u00admately $24,000, gave to each of the grandchildren $2,000 and, with a provision of $300 for masses, the residue to the son. This gives the latter about $17,500 more than he would receive under the prior instruments.\nApparently the will of 1940 was kept in a locked satchel, the key of which was carried by the mother in a small bag. Some time in October the Gosselin girl got it for the mother who kept it for a week or so and then had it locked up again. About the 14th of November, a date remembered by the girl in relation to wages due on the 13th which the mother, for the first time, forgot to pay, the small bag, in which money also was kept, disappeared. On the next day, when the loss was noticed, the mother, as she then so often did, began to cry. The girl went to Hector about it. He told her the bag had been dropped into the toilet from which he had recovered it and that he had put it in the safe in the store where it would remain. Whether the explanation given was true or not there is no way of deciding. This incident is clearly recalled by the girl as happening after the mother's mind and memory had become seriously weak\u00adened, from the effect of which her habits and controls, even as to natural functions, had become disorganized: and as the date is not disputed, it becomes a most material circum\u00adstance in her story. The satchel remained in the house and beyond doubt came into the possession of the son, but we know nothing more of its contents. This concurrence of circumstances, in which the son comes into the control of the satchel containing the will and a new document appears within a week, while the mother is in or approaching a critical stage of illness, is too striking to be quite disregarded.\nThe mother had visited Yvette in Ottawa in 1940 and had written the granddaughter if she might spend the winter of 1941-42 with her, but later on decided she was not well enough to travel so far and would have to put the visit off. There is no doubt of the affectionate regard in which she held the granddaughter: 'and on several occa\u00adsions, when alone with the Gosselin girl, she had remarked that her \"property\" was \"for Yvette\".\nThe grandson had enlisted in 1940 and left Halifax for overseas on July 21st, 1941. About a week before this departure, his grandmother had visited him at Sussex, New Brunswick, in camp there and what passed between them can best be given in his words:\nYes, when my grandmother was down to see me in Sussex, we were left alone about an hour and my wife and my mother-in-law were away. My grandmother mentioned at the time that even if I were going overseas, that she was looking after my family in spite of the fact that I mightn't return from overseas. She told me that she was leaving me 885,000. The way the conversation led to that was that she asked me if there was anything she could do for me and I mentioned the fact that I would be very glad if she would keep an eye on my family. It was a young family and anything she could do to help them out would be very much appreciated by myself. That led to her statement, saying she was leaving me $5,000 in her will.\nIn 1935 or 1936 the mother had conveyed to the son the Iand adjoining her home on which the store building stood, with, so far as the evidence goes, the business carried on in it. There is nothing in the case to indicate what the value of this property was.\nThe deceased had been attended by Dr. Coffyn and during either November or the early part of December suffered a nervous disturbance which brought about a severe mental confusion. There are documents in evidence which purport to record visits on November 25th and December 3rd and he fixes the latter as the date of the minor stroke; but admittedly this was only his recollection of the .occurrence in May, 1942. Admittedly, too, none of the documents brought forward by him were originals; they were said to be copies made in May, 1942, or later after the controversy had arisen; and the trial judge was quite justified in declining to place any reliance in them whatever. His comment, too, that \"this witness displayed, in my opinion, some of those attributes of advocacy which, however unconscious, are not wholly devoid of partiality\", was quite warranted. On the 15th of December, Mrs. Michaud, wife of the grandson, after having had almost to force her way into the house, found the mother dishevelled, \"terribly failed\", helpless in mind and body. Around Christmas Mrs. Leger paid a hurried visit to Bath\u00adurst but the 'son had given orders before she arrived that she was not to be left alone at any time with her grand-mother and she was not. Mrs. Poirier was at the height of her confusion at this time and it is doubtful if she recognized the granddaughter. Later on, in January, when it is claimed she was somewhat improved, 'the son paid the Gosselin girl off before the month was up, ostensibly on the ground that his mother was then able to look after herself. Toward the end of February a more severe paralysis set in, from the effects of which she died in a few days.\nNow, although the condition of the mother in August and September was fair, there is no doubt of marked deterioration as the fall wore on. The girl stresses the loss of memory, loss of initiative, a disintegration of habits, inability to carry on conversation, childishness, a tendency to repetition of words addressed to her, and. apathy; \"she would ask us something that had no sense. If we refused her she would cry\"; \"we would talk to her and she wouldn't answer\". The girl tells us also that \u2014the failure of memory was commented on by the son's wife in connection with a remark, made by the latter, that the mother had asked the son \"to make her will\", but whether before or after Novem\u00adber 21st is not clear. Neither is it wholly clear whether the marked change in memory, insisted upon by the Gosselin girl ,as taking place before the making of the will, was a result of the minor nervous seizure, \"not exactly a stroke, although her face was twisted and her tongue refused to talk properly\", as Dr. Coffyn puts it. Some time in Novem\u00adber she presented a \"glassy stare\" to the wife of the grand-son. No doubt to some degree she could be aroused but the picture is clear of a pronounced declension in her phy\u00adsical and mental condition. Although Dr. Coffyn spoke of \"visits that I cannot remember the dates\" of in November, his records show only one attendance. In any event, he would be concerned chiefly 'with questions as to which memory would play little, if any, part:\nWhen I talked to her about her own condition, she was able to answer me perfectly straightforward.\nHe was asked to comment on the following question and answer in the evidence of Rose Gosselin:\nQ. I am going to read you part of the evidence given by Rose Gosselin. \"Can you place the date when you first noticed any material change in her mental condition?\" (Page 78). She replies \"About the beginning of November, I think\" Is that correct?\nA. Not as far as my recollection goes.\nThe veracity of this girl, the chief witness to the essential facts, is conceded; the only challenge is as to the accuracy of her recollection of the precise time when the breakdown in memory took place. But the fact on which she was most emphatic was that that collapse preceded the will; she felt the elderly lady was being put to something beyond her condition; \"she had no commonsense in November\".\nNow, we know the intentions of this woman as to the disposition of her property at a time when she was in good health and able to look after her own affairs, and that those intentions, so far as the evidence discloses them, continued up to the day of signing the impeached will. Although the solicitor knew of her relatives, he made no enquiries of any sort regarding them, or her property, or an existing will. His opportunity to judge of her memory was of the most limited kind. According to the second witness, Meahan, throughout the time he was present, during which the will was read aloud and executed, not a word was uttered by Mrs. Poirier and she was unable to sign her name to the document.\nThese facts cast on the whole case such a doubt of the competency of the testatrix as, in my opinion, requires us to say that the onus of showing the document to be the will of a \"free and capable\" person has not been met. The direct evidence of Rose Gosselin remains uncontradicted by either of the only persons actually in a position to do it, the son and his wife. Neither took the stand; and the sudden and radical reversal of benefits remains unex\u00adplained, save by the state of mind and memory portrayed by the girl.\nThe findings of the trial judge on the point of capacity are neither clear nor satisfactory. He says:\nThe proponents of the Will at the time this ease was tried, must have realized that the evidence was confusing and I find it hard to understand why other evidence was not adduced by the proponents, for certainly these people living with the testatrix and who were in associa\u00adtion with her on the day that the Will was made should be in a position to state facts concerning the conversation, actions and doings of the testatrix an the day that the Will was made, which would have been of great value.\nAfter considering all of the evidence and having in mind my observa\u00adtions as to the partiality of certain witnesses in the matter, it is very difficult to arrive at a conclusion. I am satisfied, however, that prior to the making of the Will, the testatrix at times did not have her normal mental faculties and further I am satisfied that for some time prior to the making of the Will, her mental faculties were more impaired than would be normal for a woman of her age and I am accepting the testi\u00admony of Dr. Baxter and also of Dr. Coffyn that she was suffering from senile dementia. In saying this, however, I am not overlooking the fact that the testatrix could have and may have enjoyed what is known as a lucid interval on the date that the Will was made and further, in spite of the fact that her normal mental faculties were impaired, I am not prepared to say that the testatrix did not have sufficient mental capacity to make a Will on the 21st November, 1941, for even though her men\u00adtality could not be considered normal, she still could have had sufficient powers of mind to make a valid will.\nHe then proceeds to examine the question whether the proponents of the will had adduced preponderating evi\u00addence that there was sufficient testamentary capacity when the instructions were given, and he concludes :\nAnd I come to a very dubious conclusion based not only on the evidence of the witnesses, but also on the examination of the will itself which is in evidence and having in mind that the testatrix has executed what is apparently on its face a normal will, that the weight of evidence is slightly in favour of the proponents. But, as I say, it is dubious. Because of this, I am prepared to admit the will to probate, but it is with doubt that I do so.\nThroughout the trial he seemed to labour under the impres\u00adsion either that the prior wills and other evidences of inten\u00adtion were irrelevant or that they could be proved only by means that seemingly were not open to the appellants. He had previously stated that the evidence brought forward by the appellants had \"not satisfied the onus placed on them of proving conclusively that the testatrix was unduly influenced\".\nNow, in the majority judgment below, it is clear that both Baxter C.J. and Grimmer J. were powerfully influenced by the view that a pronouncement against the will neces\u00adsarily involved ,a reflection upon the integrity of Robi\u00adchaud, which was repelled by both his standing as a solici\u00adtor and the finding of the trial judge. But there is no doubt whatever that we may have testamentary incapacity accompanied by a deceptive ability to answer questions of ordinary and usual matters: that is, the mind may be incapable of carrying apprehension beyond a limited range of familiar and suggested topics. A \"disposing mind and memory\" is one able to comprehend, .of its ,own initiative and volition, the essential elements of will-making, prop\u00aderty, objects, just claims to consideration, revocation of existing dispositions, and the like; this has been recognized in many cases:\nMarsh v. Tyrrell and Harding[2] :\nIt is a great but not an uncommon error to suppose that because a person can understand a question put to him, and can give a rational answer to such question, he is of perfect, sound mind, and is capable of making a will for any purpose whatever; whereas the rule of law, and it is the rule of common sense, is far otherwise: the competency of the mind must be judged of by the nature of the act to be done, and from a consideration of all the circumstances of the case.\nQuoting from the Marquess of Winchester's Case[3], Sir John Nicholl adds:\nBy the law it is not sufficient that the testator be of memory, when he makes his will, to answer familiar and usual questions, but he ought to have a disposing memory so as to be able to make a disposition of his estate with understanding and reason.\nMurphy v. Lamphier[4] :\nAgain the words of Sir John Nicholl are apposite: \"To support a paper thus revoking and altering this will and substituting a disposition quite different from and the very opposite to it, would require the clearest and most indisputable evidence\": Dodge v. Meech[5].\nMenzies v. White[6].\nMerely to be able to make rational responses is not enough, nor to repeat, a tutored formula of simple terms. There must be a power to hold the essential field of the mind in some degree of appreciation as a whole, and this I am satisfied was not present here.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and direct that the judgment of the Probate Court be reversed and the docu\u00adment propounded be declared to be not the last will of the deceased. Because of special circumstances surrounding the controversy, however, all costs should be out of the estate.\nHUDSON J.\u2014This is a contest as to the validity of the will of Albina Poirier, deceased.\nThe due execution of the will is now conceded but it is claimed on behalf of the appellants that such execution was secured by undue influence of the respondent and that the testatrix lacked mental capacity at the time the will was executed.\nThe deceased left an estate of an estimated value of $24,000. By the will each of the appellants was given a legacy of $2,000 and the residue was bequeathed to the respondent with a direction that he should pay $300 to have masses offered for the repose of the testatrix's soul. The respondent was a son and the sole surviving child of the deceased. The appellants were her grandchildren, whose mother was the daughter, of the deceased and who had died some years previously. These beneficiaries were the only surviving descendants of the deceased, except a large family of the respondent to whom nothing was bequeathed.\nThe provisions of the will do not in themselves raise any suspicion, much less a presumption of either undue influence or mental incapacity.\nOn the issue of undue influence, the learned trial Judge held :\nAlthough, as I say, I am not quite satisfied that the testatrix was not unduly influenced, I am satisfied that by the evidence adduced the opponents of the will have not satisfied the onus placed on them of proving conclusively that the testatrix was unduly influenced and an this ground the will should be admitted to probate.\nThis finding was affirmed by a majority of the learned Judges in appeal.\nOn the issue of mental incapacity, the learned trial Judge found as follows:\nAfter considering all of the evidence and having in mind my obser\u00advations as to the partiality of certain witnesses in the matter, it is very difficult to arrive at a conclusion, I am satisfied, however, that prior to the making of the will, the testatrix at times did not have lier normal mental faculties and further I am satisfied that for some time prior to the making of the will, her mental faculties were more impaired than would be normal for a woman of her age and I am accepting the testi\u00admony of Dr. Baxter and also of Dr. Coffyn that she was suffering from senile dementia. In saying this, however, I am not 'overlooking the fact that the testatrix could have and may have enjoyed what is known as a lucid interval .on the date that the will was made and further, in. spite of the fact that her normal mental faculties were impaired, I am not prepared to say that the testatrix did not have sufficient mental capacity to make a will on the 21st November, 1941, for even though her men\u00adtality could not be considered normal, she still could have had sufficient powers of mind to make a valid will.\nA majority of the Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the trial Judge. Chief Justice Baxter said :\nI have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion, that the testatrix was competent to make her will at the time it was executed.\nMr. Justice Grimmer said:\nThere is in my opinion evidence to sustain the judgment which I think should have been rendered without the least hesitation. It is suggested on behalf of the respondent that there were concurrent findings of fact and that by a long series of decisions of this Court it is now well settled that such findings should not be disturbed.\nIn respect of the finding as to undue influence, I would say at once that if that stood alone the Court would, in my opinion, not be justified in disturbing the judgment. The onus on the issue of undue influence is clearly on those who assert it. Craig v. Lamoureux[7], and in the case of Robins v. National Trust Company[8], Viscount Dunedin after discussing the onus in the case of a charge of mental incapacity proceeds, ,at p. 522:\nNo question of this sort arises as to the procuring of the will by fraud or undue influence, because it is admitted that in that case the onus is always on the person who attacks the will.\nOn the second ground, however, that of mental inca\u00adpacity, the situation is different. The learned trial Judge came to his conclusion because he assumed that the onus was on the appellants. In this I think he was mistaken. The .authorities on the point are numerous. In the above-mentioned case of Robins v. National Trust Company (2), Viscount Dunedin states at page 519:\nThose who propound a will must show that the will of which probate is sought is the will of the testator, and that the testator was a person of testamentary capacity. In ordinary cases if there is no sug\u00adgestion to the contrary any man who is shown to have executed a will in ordinary form will be presumed to have testamentary capacity, but the moment the capacity is called in question then at once the onus lies on those propounding the will to affirm positively the testamentary capacity.\nIt was also stated by Viscount Dunedin in the same case at page 518, in regard to the rule of concurrent findings of fact:\nIf it can be shown that the finding of one of the Courts is so based on an erroneous proposition of law that if that proposition be corrected the finding disappears, then in that case it is no finding at all.\nIn view of the doubts expressed by the trial Judge and his mistake as to the onus, it would seem that the rule of concurrent findings does not apply and that it is the duty of this Court to review the evidence and come to its own conclusion, subject, of course, to the normal weight to be given to the findings of the trial Judge and the opinion of the learned Judges in appeal. In this instance the findings of the trial Judge really .conflict with his conclusion. On the other hand, Chief Justice Baxter and Mr. Justice Grimmer on appeal had no hesitation in concluding on the evidence that the testatrix had mental capacity. Mr. Justice Fairweather dissented and came to an opposite conclusion.\nI was much impressed by the careful analysis of the evi\u00addence by Chief Justice Baxter, but .an ,anxious perusal of the whole evidence has led me to the conclusion that the mental capacity of the deceased at relevant times was open to some doubt and, as said in Tyrrell v. Painton[9], the true rule is that wherever a will is prepared and exe\u00adcuted under circumstances which raise the suspicion of the court, it ought not to be pronounced for unless the party propounding it adduces evidence which removes such suspicion and satisfies the court that the testator knew and approved the contents of the instrument.\nIn the present case the respondent, with whom the deceased was then living, was in the house at the time the will was prepared and executed. He was the chief bene\u00adficiary under and the proponent of the will in these pro\u00adceedings but he was not called as a witness and no expla\u00adnation was offered for his failure to testify.

The Court of Appeal held that, on the evidence and the trial Judge's findings, the presumption of gift to the defendant had been rebutted; and also held against an alternative contention by the defendant that it should be found that the plaintiff had taken the property in the defendant's name so as to protect it from creditors and therefore should be refused assistance of the Court in recovering it.\nC.F.H.

Said legislation of 1932 had exempted $1,200 only, \"being income derived from annuity contracts with the Dominion Government or like annuity contracts issued by any Provincial Government or any company incorporated or licensed to do business in Canada\", but preserved, as to income arising out of annuity contracts entered into prior to the 1932 legislation, the exemption provided by said legislation of 1930.\nAppellant in 1918 entered into a contract with an insurance company which entitled him, after paying premiums for 20 years, to receive, at his option, either a lump sum, or monthly payments during his lifetime with the payments going thereafter to his wife, if surviving him, during her lifetime, and with a guaranteed period of payment of 20 years. During the payment of the premiums the contract constituted a policy of insurance and on appellant's death the monthly sums would become payable to his wife, if then living, for her lifetime, with the same guarantee of 20 years. There was provision in the contract for payment of dividends, for cash surrender values, loan values and paid-up term insurance options. After paying, the premiums for 20 years, appellant elected to receive the monthly payments, commencing January 1, 1939. For the amount so received in 1940, $1,500, he claimed exemption from income tax, for the whole amount or alternatively for $1,200.\nHeld, affirming judgment of Thorson J., [1943] Ex. OR. 202, that the payments so received were subject to income tax, without exemption.\nPer the Chief Justice, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.: The income from a company, in order to be exempt under said legislation of 1930 as properly interpreted, must be derived from an annuity contract which was \"like\" annuity contracts being issued by the Dominion or a province, and, in order to be exempt under said legislation of 1932, must be derived from an annuity contract which was \"like\" annuity contracts being issued by the Dominion. The contract of 1918, in question, was not, on the evidence, a \"like\" contract, as required. It was of no avail to say that by 1939 the insurance feature had gone and there was then only an annuity contract like those of the Dominion: the rights and obligations upon appellant's exercise of his option were determined by the contract of 1918, the company's payments were in fulfilment of its promise of 1918, and pursuant to what was really appellant's direction as to how the benefits which had accrued to him should be satisfied. Dealing with a further point, raised only before this Court, it was held that in view of s. 3 (1) (b) of the Act as it now stands (so enacted since the decision in Shaw v. Minister of National Revenue, [1939] S.C.R. 338), taxation of the payments was not objectionable on the ground that they were in the nature of a return of capital.\nPer Rand and Taschereau JJ.: The language used in the legislation of 1930, on its true construction, must be taken to refer not only to the company but to the contract out of which the payments arise; and the question is whether appellant's contract was an annuity contract like those at the time issued by the Governments mentioned. In the exempting legislation now in question, what is dealt with is an \"annuity contract entered into\" prior to certain dates. The contract here was \"entered into\" in 1918 and it is that contract which must be considered, not the situation existing after January 1, 1939 (when, so appellant contended, all insurance features had dropped and, whatever the contract was before, it was then an annuity contract with the characteristics of Government contracts): the payments arising in 1939 flowed from the obligations created in 1918; what the legislation contemplated was an annuity contract as of the time it was made, not as of any moment thereafter which might mark the beginning of some stage of performance under it. Assuming that the contract in question could properly be described as an \"annuity contract\" (of which doubt was expressed), the circumstance of insurance and other features differentiating it from a Government annuity contract were ample grounds upon which the Minister could rule, as he did, that the contract in question was not \"like\" a Government annuity contract; no error in the interpretation of the statute on his part had been shown and his exercise of judgment in this case should be held to be, under the legislation, within his exclusive field of determination. (It was remarked that no question arose as to whether the sums received by appellant were or were not income within the statutory definition; the amount received during 1940 was included in his return, and it was only on the question of the right to the exemption claimed that this appeal turned.)\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Thorson J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing the appellant's appeal from the decision of the Minister of National Revenue affirming an assessment of the appellant for the year 1940 for income tax under the provisions of the Dominion Income War Tax Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, and amendments). The main question in dispute was as to appellant's right to exemption, under s. 5 (k) of said Act (and with reference to provisions of s. 3 of c. 24 of the statutes of 1930 and of s. 6 of c. 43 of the statutes of 1932) in respect of the amount received in the year 1940 in monthly payments under a contract with The Mutual Life Assurance Company of Canada.\nA. L. Fleming K.C. and A. L. Smoke for the appellant.\nRobert Forsyth K.C. and E. S. MacLatchy for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nHudson J.\u2014The appellant made a return for the year 1940, showing as income received in that year $1,500 from an annuity paid by the Mutual Life Assurance Company. He claimed an exemption in respect of same to the extent of $1,200. This claim to exemption was disallowed by the Minister on the ground that under the provisions of Section 3 (b) of the Act, income includes annuities or other annual payments received under the provisions of any contract except as in this Act otherwise provided; that the provisions of paragraph (k) of Section 5 of the Act are not applicable as the said annuity contract was not similar to those issued by the Dominion Government and the decision of the Minister in this respect is final and conclusive and that under no other provisions of the Act is the said annuity exempt from tax.\nAn appeal to the Exchequer Court was dismissed.\nIn 1918 the appellant insured his life with the Mutual Life Assurance Company. Under the terms of the policy, upon paying his premiums for twenty years he became entitled at his option to either a lump sum or annual payments for the remainder of his life. In case of his death his representative was entitled to substantial benefits. It was in fact what is commonly called an endowment policy.\nThe appellant completed his annual payments and on the 2nd of December, 1938, he signed what was called a \"direction re optional settlement\" by which he elected to receive annual payments rather than a lump sum. It is the amount received from this source in the taxation year of 1940 which gives rise to the present controversy.\nAlthough the appellant claimed in his return exemption to the extent of $1,200 only, in these proceedings he has claimed alternatively that the whole amount received is exempt under the provisions of the amendment to the statute of 1930, or in the alternative to an exemption to the extent of $1,200 under the provision of 1932. He also claims that the payments were in the nature of a return of capital and, therefore, not taxable under the Act.\nThe relevant statutory provisions are as follows:\n3. For the purposes of this Act, \"income\" means the annual net profit or gain or gratuity * * * received by a person from * * *\n***\n(b) annuities or other annual payments received under the provisions of any contract except as in this Act otherwise provided.\nThe deductions and exemptions allowed are specified in section 5 of the Act as follows:\n5. \"Income\" as hereinbefore defined shall for the purposes of this Act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions.\n***\n(k) The income arising from any annuity contract entered into prior to the twenty-fifth day of June, 1940, to the extent provided by section three of chapter twenty-four of the statutes of 1930 and section six of chapter forty-three of the statutes of 1932 * * * The decision of the Minister in respect of any question arising under paragraphs * * * and (k) hereof shall be final and conclusive.\nBy the Statutes of 1930, chapter 24, section 3, paragraph (k), it was provided:\n(k) the income to the extent of five thousand dollars only derived from annuity contracts with the dominion or provincial governments or any company incorporated or licensed to do business in Canada effecting like annuity contracts * * *\nBy the Statutes of 1932, chapter 43, paragraph (k) above referred to was repealed and the following substituted therefor:\n(k) twelve hundred dollars only; being income derived from annuity contracts with the Dominion Government or like annuity contracts issued by any Provincial Government or any company incorporated or licensed to do business in Canada.\nTo entitle the appellant to total exemption under the Statutes of 1930 the payment must arise from an annuity contract with a company \"effecting like annuity contracts\" (that is, annuity contracts like those being issued by the Dominion or a province).\nIt is fairly clear on the evidence that the contract entered into in 1918 was not like any contract then being issued by the Dominion or by the provinces. It was so held by the Minister and by the learned President in the court below and I agree with them.\nBut it is contended that the exemption given by the statute extends to annual payments made by companies who in fact sold annuities similar to those issued by the Dominion or a province, even if the particular contract in question was unlike any of those so issued.\nThe wording of the section lends some colour to this argument, but when Parliament was legislating about annuities it gave exemption to some but not all annuities and the purpose seems to have been to extend such exemption to those issued by companies. No reason is suggested for granting a greater privilege in respect of money paid under contracts of private companies than those procurable from the Government. I am of the opinion that this contention fails.\nUnder the amendment of 1932 this question does not arise. The language is \"annuity contracts with the Dominion or like annuity contracts with companies\". It is next contended that when the exercise of the option became effective in 1939 the contract had been stripped of all insurance benefits and what remained was in fact only an annuity contract similar to those issued by the Dominion.\nThe rights of the appellant and the obligations of the company upon the exercise of the option were determined by the contract of 1918. The payments made by the company to the appellant were made in fulfilment of its promise made in 1918. What is spoken of as an exercise of an option was properly called in the instrument itself a \"direction\" and it was a direction as to how the benefits which had accrued to the appellant should be satisfied. I am of the opinion that the appellant fails on this point.\nThe appellant also raised in this Court for the first time a claim that the payment in question was in the nature of a return of capital, citing the decision of this Court in Shaw v. Minister of National Revenue[2]. Subsequent to that decision, paragraph (b) of section 3 of the Act as considered in the Shaw case was repealed and there was substituted therefor the following:\n(b) annuities or other annual payments received under the provisions of any contract, except as in this Act otherwise provided.\nIt was argued on behalf of the Minister that this amendment no longer left room for the argument which was successful in the Shaw case1 and with this I agree.\nAnother argument pressed upon us was that by the final clause of paragraph (k) of section 5 the decision of the Minister was final and conclusive. Having come to the same conclusion as the decision of the Minister that there was no like annuity contract in the present case, it becomes unnecessary to decide whether or not the decision of the Minister is conclusive.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Rand JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Exchequer Court which upheld a ruling by the Minister of National Revenue that a payment of $1,500 received by the appellant during the year 1940 was not income arising from an annuity contract within the exemption provisions of the Income War Tax Act. The contract, under which monthly payments of $125 were made, was entered into in the year 1918. In general, its terms provided for the payment of annual premiums for twenty years, upon the completion of which the insurance company, subject to a lump sum commuted value option, would pay to the appellant, the insured, the sum mentioned during his lifetime, and, at his death, to his wife for her lifetime. Underlying both these life interests was a guaranteed period of twenty years. During the payment of the premiums the contract constituted a policy of insurance and, on the death of the insured, the monthly sums would become payable to his wife, if then living, for her lifetime, with the same guarantee of twenty years. There was provision also for the payment of dividends both during the endowment period and thereafter, and as well for cash surrender values, loan values and paid-up term insurance options. Both the assured and his wife were living on January 1st, 1939, when the policy matured and when the monthly instalments became payable.\nIn 1930 the Income War Tax Act was amended to the effect that income to the extent of $5,000 derived from annuity contracts with the dominion or provincial governments or with a properly licensed incorporated company \"effecting like annuity contracts\" should be exempt from taxation. In 1932 this was in turn amended by reducing the amount of exemption to $1,200 but preserving the exemption of the 1930 legislation to all contracts entered into prior to May 26th, 1932, when the 1932 Act came into force. In 1940 a further amendment was made by which the exemption was limited to the income arising from an annuity contract entered into before the 25th day of June, 1940, to the extent provided by the legislation of 1930 and 1.932.\nNo question arises as to whether these annual sums are or are not income within the definition of that term in the Income War Tax Act. The amount received during 1940 was included in the return of the appellant and it is only on the question of the right to the exemption claimed that this appeal turns.\nThe amendment of 1930 provided that the decision of the Minister in respect of any question arising under the paragraph dealing with annuities should be final and conclusive. Such a question did arise under that paragraph, section 5, par. (k), and it was whether the contract of the appellant was one \"like\" an annuity contract of the governments mentioned. Some point was made that the language of the 1930 amendment, \"income * * * derived from annuity contracts with * * * any company incorporated or licensed to do business in Canada effecting like annuity contracts\", characterized only the company and not the actual contract and it was argued that, as admittedly the insurance company in question did both in 1918 and 1939 issue contracts of the same sort as those made by the dominion and provincial governments, the contract in the case, being an annuity contract issued by such a company, was, therefore, within the exempting legislation. On its true construction, however, the language used in 1930 must be taken to refer not only to the company but to the contract out of which the payments arise, and the question remains whether or not the contract upon which the appellant stands is an annuity contract like those at the time issued by the two governments.\nWhether, at the time it was made, the contract could properly be described as an \"annuity contract\" is extremely doubtful. It was argued to be a contract of insurance plus annuity. But it is also contended that, whether or not it was so before 1939, on January 1st of that year all insurance features had dropped and that at that moment it had become both an annuity contract and one with the characteristics of government contracts: it is then urged that in each case the question to be asked under the Income War Tax Act is this: what is the nature of the obligation under which the income is paid at the moment when it is paid? and from these premises the conclusion of exemption is drawn.\nIn the amendments made in 1930, 1932 and 1940, what is dealt with is an \"annuity contract entered into\" prior to certain dates. That language is plain and well understood. The contract here was entered into in 1918 and the payments arising in 1939 flow from the obligations then created. What is contemplated is an annuity contract as of the time of its being made and not as of any moment thereafter which may mark the beginning of some stage of performance under it. The essential characteristic of the government annuity agreement is that the benefits shall be fully purchased by the annuitant. That may be either by one payment or by a series of payments, but until the price has been received the right to the annuity does not arise. In the contract in question, for the first twenty years there was present a fundamental obligation of insurance for which there was no purchase in the annuity sense. Assuming, then, that it was an annuity contract, a point which I do not find it necessary to decide, the circumstance of insurance and the other differentiating features mentioned were ample grounds, I should say, upon which the Minister could rule that the contract was not \"like\" a government annuity contract. No error in the interpretation of the statute on his part has been shown and, if this exercise of judgment is not within his exclusive field of determination, I should feel at a loss to know in what circumstances such a ruling would not be reviewable.\nThe decision of the President of the Exchequer Court was, therefore, right and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fleming, Smoke & Mulholland.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

This the appellant has done before the pleadings were closed and, having also tendered the amount of costs then incurred, has discharged her obligation under the contract. Gagnon v. La Coop\u00e9rative F\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9e de Quebec, (Q.R. 43 K.B. 57) approved.\nPer The Chief Justice and Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau JJ.\u2014The lawful or testamentary heir inherits of right at the death of the de cujus; but it does not follow necessarily that he will be entitled to take immediate possession of the estate, or, in other words, that he will have the seizin. In principle, the ownership of the thing is transferred simultaneously with the seizin; but the simultaneity of the transmission of both should not lead to confuse these two entirely distinct operations of the law, the former being related to the ownership of the thing while the latter affects only the legal possession of it; one may claim the ownership of a thing although admitting that its legal possession was subject to certain formalities, while inversely one may have the seizin of a thing without yet having the ownership of it.\u2014When the seizin is thus suspended through some provisions of the law, it has a retroactive effect to the date of the death of the de cujus, whenever the condition imposed has been fulfilled or the bar to its operation has been removed.\u2014The prohibition contained in subsection 7a that \"no transmission of any property * * * shall take place * * *\" does not come into conflict with the recognized principle of civil law that an heir inherits operatione legis of the estate of the deceased: the transmission of the property, from the moment of the death of the de cujus, is not subordinated to the payment of the succession duties: the condition imposed by the statute merely suspends the transmission of the property, or, in other words, the legal possession of that property, i.e., the seizin. It cannot be presumed that the legislator, by that subsection, intended to enact that, as long as the duties would not have been paid, the estate would not have any owner, with the result that the economy of the law would be destroyed and serious legal situations would thus be created: the sole purpose of the legislation is to safeguard the payment of the duties to the Crown.\u2014The contract between the parties is not tainted with absolute nullity, and the appellant has validated the transfer made to the respondent. The only recourse of the respondent would have been by way of an action in resolution of the contract or for damages, if the appellant had failed to deliver to the respondent a valid title to the thing sold.\nPer Rand J\u2014The language of subsection 7a cannot be construed as an absolute suspension of the transmission and as a prohibition of any contract which purports to deal with the transfer of property of a decedent before the certificate mentioned has been obtained. The subsection does not forbid the execution and delivery of an instrument of transfer, much less does it prohibit a contract the effect of which could not in any manner defeat its purpose. What the subsection does is to suspend final validity of a transfer so long as the conditions mentioned are not met: it contemplates the accomplishment or execution of assumed rights upon the payment of the duties. To declare that no transfer shall be valid while duties are unpaid is to assume the possible existence of acts or relations which, upon the payment, become eo instanti of full legal efficacy. Interpreted in conjunction with the implied rights in the heirs or legatees, it becomes in effect a statutory suspensive condition. It negatives any implication that until the duties are paid no binding engagement can be entered into. So construed, the necessities of the practical handling of estates are accommodated and the administrative sanctions of the statute left unimpaired.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 1943 K.B. 314) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Pr\u00e9vost J.[2] and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe action claimed a declaration of nullity ab initio of a sale, made by the appellant to the respondent, of an insurance agency business, on the ground that the succession duties of the business, which had belonged for half of it to the late husband of the appellant, had not been paid at time of the sale.\nGustave Monette K.C. and A. Talbot K.C. for the appellant.\nL. E. Beaulieu K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of The Chief Justice and of Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014Cette cause pr\u00e9sente de s\u00e9rieuses difficult\u00e9s, et en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et en Cour du Banc du Roi, elle a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 des expressions d'opinion diam\u00e9tralement oppos\u00e9es.\nL'appelante, dame Lauretta Jean, d\u00e9fenderesse en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, avait \u00e9pous\u00e9 Ferdinand Bergeron, sans contrat de mariage, et par cons\u00e9quent, sous le r\u00e9gime de la communaut\u00e9 l\u00e9gale. Celui-ci est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 28 janvier 1941, et par testament, l\u00e9gua tous ses biens \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse, dont son commerce d'assurance. Environ quinze jours plus tard, par contrat authentique re\u00e7u devant le notaire Jules Gauthier, elle vendit ce commerce, y compris client\u00e8le, achalandage, commissions de renouvellement, etc., \u00e0 monsieur Hector Gagnon, pour la somme de $4,000 payable $1,000 comptant, et la balance \u00e0 terme sans int\u00e9r\u00eat.\nLe 27 f\u00e9vrier, soit exactement quatorze jours plus tard, l'intim\u00e9 Gagnon institua contre l'appelante une action, o\u00f9 il demande en premier lieu une d\u00e9claration \u00e0 l'effet que le contrat est nul de nullit\u00e9 absolue, parce que les droits successoraux n'auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s, et en second lieu, alternativement, il demanda que le contrat soit annul\u00e9, parce que entach\u00e9 d'erreur, de dol et de fraude.\nLa cour de premi\u00e8re instance a rejet\u00e9 cette action, mais la cour d'appel l'a accueillie, les honorables juges Galipeault et Marchand dissidents.\nDevant cette Cour, seule la demande de nullit\u00e9, r\u00e9sultant de ce que les droits seraient impay\u00e9s, a \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9e, l'intim\u00e9 par ses procureurs ayant renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 se pr\u00e9valoir des autres moyens.\nAu moment de l'institution de l'action, soit le 27 f\u00e9vrier 1941, il est admis que l'appelante n'avait pas produit de d\u00e9claration au percepteur du revenu, qu'elle n'avait pas pay\u00e9 les droits exigibles s'il y en avait, ou qu'elle n'avait pas obtenu comme le veut la loi, un certificat constatant qu'aucun droit n'\u00e9tait payable. Cependant, le 19 mars, l'appelante obtint du percepteur du revenu un certificat \u00e0 l'effet qu'aucun droit n'\u00e9tait exigible, le fit offrir au demandeur, avec les frais de l\u2019action \u00e0 date, et vu le refus d'accepter de ce dernier, renouvela ses offres avec son plaidoyer. C'est ainsi que s'est engag\u00e9 le d\u00e9bat.\nDans les Statuts Refondus de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, 1925, la section 14, sous-section 7, chap. 29, Loi des Droits sur les Successions, se lit ainsi:\nSujet aux dispositions de Part. 13, nul transport de biens d'une succession n'est valide et ne constitue un titre, si les droits payables en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente section n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s.\nCependant en 1930, la loi fut amend\u00e9e, et aujourd'hui Ton trouve dans les Statuts Refondus de 1941, section 15, sous-section 7a, chap. 80, cet article modifi\u00e9 qui se lit ainsi:\nSubordonn\u00e9ment aux dispositions de l'article 13, nulle transmission de biens appartenant, lors de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, \u00e0 une personne d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e ne peut se faire, et un transport de ces biens n'est valide, et ne constitue un titre \u00e0 ou pour ces biens, tant que les droits exigibles en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente section n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement pay\u00e9s. * * *\nC'est ce dernier amendement qui r\u00e9git la cause qui nous est soumise, et sur lequel se base le demandeur-intim\u00e9 pour conclure \u00e0 la nullit\u00e9 du contrat.\nAvant d'examiner les effets juridiques de cette disposition de la loi et les cons\u00e9quences qu'elle entra\u00eene, il est n\u00e9cessaire, semble-t-il, de rappeler certains textes de notre code civil, ainsi que certains principes que nous essaierons de concilier avec la loi que nous venons de citer, et qu'il est important de ne pas oublier, si Ton veut \u00e9viter certaines contradictions, cependant plus apparentes que r\u00e9elles.\nIl est certain, en premier lieu, que par le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du de cujus l'h\u00e9ritier l\u00e9gitime ou testamentaire h\u00e9rite de plein droit. \"Le mort saisit le vif\", et c'est ce que Pothier a exprim\u00e9 dans les termes qui suivent:\nSuivant notre droit fran\u00e7ais, une succession est acquise \u00e0 l'h\u00e9ritier que la loi y appelle, d\u00e8s l'instant m\u00eame qu'elle lui est d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e, et avant qu'il en ait encore la moindre connaissance, c'est-\u00e0-dire, d\u00e8s l'instant de la mort naturelle ou civile du d\u00e9funt qui a donn\u00e9 ouverture \u00e0 sa succession. C'est ce que signifie cette r\u00e8gle de notre droit fran\u00e7ais qui est en la Coutume de Paris, art. 310, et en celle d'Orl\u00e9ans, art. 301: \"Le mort saisit le vif, son hoir plus proche et habile \u00e0 lui succ\u00e9der.\" Cette r\u00e8gle a lieu dans toutes les provinces du Royaume, et quoiqu'elle soit diam\u00e9tralement oppos\u00e9e aux principes du droit romain, elle ne laisse pas d'\u00eatre suivie dans les provinces du Royaume r\u00e9gies par le droit romain. (Trait\u00e9 des Successions, ch. 3, sec. 11.)\nAinsi que le signale Pothier, il y a sur ce point une diff\u00e9rence fondamentale entre le droit romain et le droit fran\u00e7ais A Rome, les h\u00e9ritiers d\u00e9sign\u00e9s par la loi ou par la volont\u00e9 du d\u00e9funt avaient simplement la facult\u00e9 de devenir h\u00e9ritiers, de sorte que la succession \u00e9tait d'abord simplement offerte ou d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e (delata), \u00e0 l'appel\u00e9. Celui-ci n'acqu\u00e9rait la succession que s'il acceptait cette offre et cette manifestation de sa volont\u00e9 se nommait adition d'h\u00e9r\u00e9rit\u00e9 (adire hereditatem). C'\u00e9tait le principe reconnu, sauf quelques exceptions, dont parle M. Petit dans son \"Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de Droit Romain\".\nCependant, en France et chez nous, le syst\u00e8me est diff\u00e9rent. Par la mort, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 se transmet et s'acquiert de plein droit dans toute la succession. Il n'y a pas deux moments distincts, comme chez les Romains, s\u00e9par\u00e9s par un intervalle de temps plus ou moins long, la d\u00e9lation et l'adition. Et \u00e0 cause de cette diff\u00e9rence essentielle, on voit le danger qu'il y aurait de s'inspirer du droit romain en la pr\u00e9sente mati\u00e8re. Le droit fran\u00e7ais ne conna\u00eet pas l'Heriditas Jacens du droit romain. C'est ce que Planiol et Ripert soulignent de la fa\u00e7on suivante (Trait\u00e9 de Droit Civil, 10e \u00e9d. vol. 3, page 447):\nDe quelle mani\u00e8re se fait la transmission aux h\u00e9ritiers des biens laiss\u00e9s par le d\u00e9funt? Cette transmission est imm\u00e9diate et elle a lieu de plein droit. Le patrimoine du d\u00e9funt est donc acquis \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers sans qu'il se produise une solution de continuit\u00e9 dans la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Nous n'avons plus en droit fran\u00e7ais de jacence de l'h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9, comme il s'en produisait en droit romain; les biens d'une succession ouverte ne sont jamais res nullius, en supposant bien entendu qu'il y ait des h\u00e9ritiers dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 l'acqu\u00e9rir.\nCe changement instantan\u00e9 de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 s'op\u00e8re en faveur non seulement des h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gitimes et testamentaires, mais aussi en faveur des h\u00e9ritiers irr\u00e9guliers, comme l'Etat dans le cas de biens vacants et sans ma\u00eetres. Les biens h\u00e9r\u00e9ditaires en effet ne peuvent demeurer sans propri\u00e9taires. D\u00e8s l'instant de l'ouverture de la succession, les h\u00e9ritiers sont investis des droits qui r\u00e9sultent pour eux de l'ouverture de la succession.\nFuzier-Herman (R\u00e9pertoire du droit fran\u00e7ais, vol. 35, page 82, n\u00b0 943) s'exprime ainsi:\nQuel que soit le titre auquel une personne est appel\u00e9e \u00e0 une succession, qu'elle y vienne comme h\u00e9riti\u00e8re, ou en qualit\u00e9 de successeur irr\u00e9gulier, la transmission en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 tant de l'h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9 elle-m\u00eame que des biens la composant a lieu imm\u00e9diatement et de plein droit \u00e0 son profit. Cette personne devient donc, d\u00e8s l'instant de la mort du d\u00e9funt, propri\u00e9taire, cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re, d\u00e9bitrice \u00e0 sa place. Dalloz (R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, vol. XI, page 569, n\u00b0 11) dit lui aussi:\nEn mati\u00e8re de succession, la transmission de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens du d\u00e9funt s'op\u00e8re de plein droit au profit des successeurs du de cujus, sans distinction entre les h\u00e9ritiers et les successeurs irr\u00e9guliers.\nPlaniol et Ripert (cit\u00e9 supra, page 446) partagent les m\u00eames opinions:\nCette r\u00e8gle s'applique sans distinction aux successeurs irr\u00e9guliers aussi bien qu'aux h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gitimes; les uns comme les autres sont, aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s la mort du d\u00e9funt, propri\u00e9taires, cr\u00e9anciers, d\u00e9biteurs \u00e0 sa place.\nMais si les h\u00e9ritiers sont ainsi investis de plein droit de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens du de cujus, ceci ne signifie pas n\u00e9cessairement qu'ils aient la possession de ces biens, en d'autres termes qu'ils en aient la saisine. En principe, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens est transmise simultan\u00e9ment avec la saisine. Mais la simultan\u00e9it\u00e9 de la transmission de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et celle de la saisine ne doit pas faire confondre ces deux op\u00e9rations l\u00e9gales enti\u00e8rement distinctes l'une de l'autre. La premi\u00e8re touche la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens, la saisine au contraire n'affecte que la possession l\u00e9gale de ces m\u00eames biens. On peut fort bien, en effet, \u00eatre propri\u00e9taire d'un bien, tout en admettant que la possession l\u00e9gale soit soumise \u00e0 certaines formalit\u00e9s, comme inversement on peut avoir la saisine d'un bien sans en avoir la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. C'est bien le cas de l'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire, qui n'a aucun titre \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens qu'il administre, mais qui a tout de m\u00eame la saisine des biens meubles. C'est l'article 918 C.C. qui dit:\n918. L'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire est saisi comme d\u00e9positaire l\u00e9gal, pour les fins de l'ex\u00e9cution du testament, des biens meubles de la succession, et peut en revendiquer la possession m\u00eame contre l'h\u00e9ritier ou le l\u00e9gataire.\nCette saisine dure pendant l'an et jour \u00e0 compter du d\u00e9c\u00e8s du testateur, ou du temps o\u00f9 l'ex\u00e9cuteur a cess\u00e9 d'\u00eatre emp\u00each\u00e9 de se mettre en possession.\nLa confusion n\u00e9e jadis du d\u00e9faut de faire cette distinction n\u00e9cessaire est aujourd'hui disparue, et tous les auteurs reconnaissent maintenant les diff\u00e9rences essentielles qui les caract\u00e9risent.\nPandectes fran\u00e7aises (vol. 54, page 181, n\u00b0 1676):\nLe code distingue entre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et la possession des biens qui composent l'h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9. Tandis que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 s'acquiert et se transmet de plein droit dans toute la succession, et que les successeurs irr\u00e9guliers l'obtiennent au m\u00eame titre et de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que les h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gitimes, la possession au contraire se transmet d'une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente aux h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gitimes et aux successeurs irr\u00e9guliers.\nIdem (page 182, n\u00b0 1684):\nLa saisine, comme on le verra, ne concerne que la transmission de la possession.\nPlaniol et Ripert (page 451):\nLa saisine n'a aucun rapport avec la transmission de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, qui s'accomplit imm\u00e9diatement, aussi bien au profit des h\u00e9ritiers qui en sont priv\u00e9s que de ceux qui la poss\u00e8dent.\nDalloz (R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, vol. XI, page 569, n\u00b0 12):\nLa saisine est l'investiture l\u00e9gale de la possession des biens de la succession qui s'acquiert au profit de l'h\u00e9ritier en m\u00eame temps que la transmission de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens h\u00e9r\u00e9ditaires.\nJuris-Classeur Civil (art. 724, nos 3 et 4):\nLa saisine peut se d\u00e9finir: \"L'investiture l\u00e9gale et de plein droit de la possession des droits h\u00e9r\u00e9ditaires au profit de l'h\u00e9ritier.\" C'est en cela, et en cela seulement qu'elle consiste. La transmission de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 n'a rien de commun avec la saisine. H\u00e9ritiers, successeurs, l\u00e9gataires, sont d\u00e8s le (moment de la mort du de cujus investis de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des droits qui r\u00e9sultent pour eux de l'ouverture de la succession ou de l'efficacit\u00e9 du testament.\nMais, le Juris-Classeur contient ensuite ce passage particuli\u00e8rement int\u00e9ressant qui fait bien voir la diff\u00e9rence entre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et la saisine, et qui d\u00e9montre bien que cette derni\u00e8re est un compl\u00e9ment de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, en ce sens qu'elle permet aux propri\u00e9taires \"de mettre en \u0153uvre les droits dont ils sont investis\". C'est bien ce que dit l'article 607 du code civil:\nLes h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gitimes, lorsqu'ils succ\u00e8dent, sont saisis de plein droit des biens, droits et actions du d\u00e9funt, sous l'obligation d'acquitter toutes les charges de la succession; etc.\nEt en ce qui concerne les h\u00e9ritiers testamentaires, l'article 891 C.C. est dans le m\u00eame sens.\nL'on peut donc dire, je crois qu'en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, chez les h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gitimes et testamentaires, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens ainsi que leur possession l\u00e9gale, quoique diff\u00e9rentes entre elles, se transmettent simultan\u00e9ment. Mais, il n'en est pas ainsi des h\u00e9ritiers irr\u00e9guliers, comme l'Etat, qui dans le cas de biens sans ma\u00eetre devient, par le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du de cujus, instantan\u00e9ment propri\u00e9taire, mais qui pour obtenir la possession ou la saisine, doivent remplir certaines formalit\u00e9s qu'on appelle l'envoi en possession. L'article 401 C.C. dit en effet:\nTous les biens vacants ou sans ma\u00eetre, ceux des personnes qui d\u00e9c\u00e8dent sans repr\u00e9sentants, ou dont les successions sont abandonn\u00e9es, appartiennent au domaine public.\nEt l'article 607 C.C. qui dit que les h\u00e9ritiers, lorsqu'ils succ\u00e8dent, sont saisis des biens, droits et actions du d\u00e9funt, ajoute:\nMais le Souverain doit se faire envoyer en possession par justice dans les formes indiqu\u00e9es au code de proc\u00e9dure civile.\nCeci signifie \u00e9videmment que, comme les h\u00e9ritiers, l'Etat h\u00e9rite de plein droit la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens, mais n'a la saisine que par l'effet de l'envoi en possession.\nC'est la th\u00e9orie que les auteurs enseignent.\nFuzier-Herman (vol. 35, page 82, n\u00b0 945):\nMais ainsi trait\u00e9s de m\u00eame fa\u00e7on par la loi quant au fond du droit, l'h\u00e9ritier et le successeur irr\u00e9gulier diff\u00e8rent profond\u00e9ment quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re d'appr\u00e9hender l'h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9, et de devenir possesseur des biens h\u00e9r\u00e9ditaires individuellement envisag\u00e9s, de se mettre en situation d'exercer activement et passivement les actions h\u00e9r\u00e9ditaires.\nDalloz (R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, vol. XI, page 569, n\u00b0 11):\nL'acquisition de la possession au contraire n'a lieu de plein droit par l'effet de la saisine h\u00e9r\u00e9ditaire, qu'au profit des h\u00e9ritiers \u00e0 l'exclusion des successeurs irr\u00e9guliers.\nEt voici ce que disent Planiol et Ripert (page 455):\nComme les h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gitimes, les successeurs irr\u00e9guliers sont propri\u00e9taires des biens de la succession ou de leur part dans ces biens d\u00e8s le jour du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, mais ils n'ont pas la saisine.\nEt, \u00e0 la page 447:\nMalgr\u00e9 cette ressemblance sur le fond du droit, il existe cependant une diff\u00e9rence grave entre les successeurs l\u00e9gitimes et les successeurs irr\u00e9guliers sur la mani\u00e8re de prendre possession de l'h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9, ce qui n'est, \u00e0 vrai dire, qu'une question de forme, mais \u00e0 laquelle on a donn\u00e9 dans notre droit une importance v\u00e9ritablement excessive: les uns ont la saisine; les autres ne l'ont pas et sont oblig\u00e9s de demander l'envoi en possession.\nC'est aussi l'opinion exprim\u00e9e par Laurent (tome 9, n\u00b0 207) et par Demolombe (tome 13, n\u00b0 123).\nQuand cet envoi en possession a eu lieu, suivant les formalit\u00e9s l\u00e9gales, il s'ensuit donc que l'Etat qui n'\u00e9tait que propri\u00e9taire, a en outre acquis la possession l\u00e9gale des biens par l'effet de cette saisine judiciaire, et qui r\u00e9troagit \u00e0 la date du d\u00e9c\u00e8s. Dans ce cas, la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 de la saisine ne peut \u00eatre mise en doute, et voici la doctrine enseign\u00e9e par les auteurs: Juris-Classeur Civil, art. 769 \u00e0 772, Successions, n\u00b0 45:\nUne fois envoy\u00e9 en possession, le successeur se trouve, vis-\u00e0-vis de l'h\u00e9ritier, dans la m\u00eame situation que s'il \u00e9tait h\u00e9ritier. Il ne lui manquait que la saisine de l'exercice des droits; elle lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9e par la justice, et la diff\u00e9rence entre lui et l'h\u00e9ritier a \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi effac\u00e9e.\nJuris-Classeur Civil, art. 769 \u00e0 772, n\u00b0 4:\nL'envoi en possession n'est pas pour le successeur le moyen d'acqu\u00e9rir le droit, mais seulement la condition de sa mise en exercice. Le droit lui-m\u00eame est acquis d\u00e8s le jour de l'ouverture de la succession; d\u00e8s cet instant, il fait partie du patrimoine du successeur, et au point de vue de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et \u00e0 celui de la possession.\nN\u00b05:\nIl s'ensuit que si le successeur d\u00e9c\u00e8de avant d'avoir soit accompli les formalit\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires, soit renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 la succession, il transmet son droit \u00e0 ses propres h\u00e9ritiers.\nPlaniol et Ripert (page 456):\nQuand l'envoi en possession a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9, le successeur irr\u00e9gulier se trouve dans la m\u00eame situation que s'il \u00e9tait h\u00e9ritier l\u00e9gitime. La saisine lui \u00e9tait refus\u00e9e par la loi, mais l'envoi en possession la remplace exactement. On peut dire qu'il donne au successeur irr\u00e9gulier une saisine judiciaire et cette saisine r\u00e9troagit au jour de l'ouverture de la succession. Le successeur a d\u00e8s lors tous les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices de la possession, pour laquelle il est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir succ\u00e9d\u00e9 au d\u00e9funt \u00e0 partir du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, et il a l'exercice actif et passif des actions d\u00e9pendant de l'h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9.\nFuzier-Herman (R\u00e9pertoire du Droit Fran\u00e7ais, vol. 35, n\u00b0 1020, page 87):\nL'envoi en possession r\u00e9gulier a pour effet de mettre les successeurs irr\u00e9guliers dans la m\u00eame situation que s'ils \u00e9taient h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gitimes. C'est une sorte de saisine judiciaire qui remplace pour eux la saisine l\u00e9gale, et cette saisine r\u00e9troagit au jour de l'ouverture de la succession.\nBaudry-Lacantinerie et Wahl (Droit Civil, vol. 7, Des Successions, 1, page 609, n\u00b0 817):\nLes successeurs irr\u00e9guliers, pourvu qu'ils se fassent envoyer en possession, ont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e8s le jour du d\u00e9c\u00e8s; cela r\u00e9sulte de l'article 711, Code civil, d'apr\u00e8s lequel la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 se transmet par succession; c'est-\u00e0-dire que l'attribution est r\u00e9troactive.\nL'envoi en possession est donc la condition de l'exercice du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais ne lui sert pas de point de d\u00e9part. Et le m\u00eame auteur ajoute aussi \u00e0 la page 611, ce qui suit:\nEn outre, le successeur irr\u00e9gulier continue d\u00e8s le jour du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, s'il se fait envoyer en possession, la prescription acquisitive commenc\u00e9e au profit du d\u00e9funt. Et \u00e0 la page 612, n\u00b0 821:\nLes successeurs, une fois envoy\u00e9s en possession, ont droit aux fruits d\u00e8s le jour du d\u00e9c\u00e8s. C'est l'application du principe que l'accessoire suit le principal; les fruits sont une cons\u00e9quence du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et nous avons montr\u00e9 que le successeur irr\u00e9gulier, envoy\u00e9 en possession, est propri\u00e9taire d\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s; un texte formel e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire pour le d\u00e9pouiller des fruits. On a exprim\u00e9 la m\u00eame id\u00e9e en se basant sur la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 de l'envoi en possession.\nEnfin, Planiol et Ripert (page 450) ajoutent qu'il y a \u00e9galement r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 de la saisine en faveur de l'h\u00e9ritier appel\u00e9 comme r\u00e9sultat d'une renonciation \u00e0 une succession:\nMais si la saisine n'est pas collective, elle est tout au moins sucessive, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'elle passe aux h\u00e9ritiers de second degr\u00e9 par l'effet de la renonciation du premier, et ainsi de suite: chaque cat\u00e9gorie appel\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9faut des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes arrive \u00e0 la succession avec la saisine, en supposant qu'elle y ait droit par son titre, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il s'agisse d'h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gitimes, et non d'un successeur irr\u00e9gulier, comme le conjoint. Cette saisine leur est d\u00e9volue r\u00e9troactivement, par l'effet de la renonciation du rang pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, qui est cens\u00e9 n'avoir jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 h\u00e9ritier.\nIl r\u00e9sulte de tout cela qu'il faut se bien garder de confondre la transmission de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens du d\u00e9funt avec la saisine qui n'affecte que la possession l\u00e9gale de ces m\u00eames biens, ind\u00e9pendamment de la possession de fait qui se r\u00e9alise par l'appr\u00e9hension mat\u00e9rielle d'une chose. En outre, quand par l'effet de la loi, la saisine est suspendue, elle agit r\u00e9troactivement \u00e0 la date du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, quand la condition impos\u00e9e est r\u00e9alis\u00e9e, ou que l'obstacle qui l'emp\u00eachait d'op\u00e9rer est \u00e9cart\u00e9.\nDans la cause soumise \u00e0 cette Cour, la section 15, sous-section 7a, de la Loi des Successions, d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9e, comporte que \"nulle transmission de biens * * * ne peut se faire, et un transport de ces biens n'est valide * * * tant que les droits exigibles * * * n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement pay\u00e9s.\"\nJe ne puis arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que les mots \"nulle transmission de biens\" viennent en conflit avec le principe reconnu de notre droit civil qui veut, comme nous l'avons vu, que l'h\u00e9ritier h\u00e9rite operatione legis des biens du d\u00e9funt. Il me semble impossible en effet d'admettre que ce texte de la Loi des Droits sur les Successions ait ainsi r\u00e9volutionn\u00e9 les dispositions du code civil, et que l'on ait voulu que tant que les droits successoraux ne sont pas pay\u00e9s, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens demeure suspendue, et que ceux-ci n'appartiennent \u00e0 personne. Quand la l\u00e9gislature a voulu que la transmission de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 un h\u00e9ritier f\u00fbt suspendue jusqu'au paiement des droits, elle Ta dit en termes clairs et explicites. En effet, au chapitre 30 des Statuts Refondus de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, 1925, on y trouve la loi concernant La Saisine de Certains B\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires qui est cependant maintenant rappel\u00e9e. Cette loi stipulait que:\nnonobstant toute loi \u00e0 ce contraire, l'h\u00e9ritier l\u00e9gitime domicili\u00e9 ou r\u00e9sidant ordinairement en dehors de la province, \u00e0 qui est transmis par le d\u00e9c\u00e8s d'une personne qui est domicili\u00e9e dans cette province la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 * * *n'est pas saisi de plein droit de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, de l'usufruit ou de la jouissance des biens qui lui sont transmis par ce d\u00e9c\u00e8s, etc., etc.\nLes expressions employ\u00e9es dans cette loi d\u00e9montrent bien que la l\u00e9gislature avait v\u00e9ritablement l'intention de suspendre la transmission de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et elle a fait usage pour le dire de termes non \u00e9quivoques. C'est la transmission de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'elle a frapp\u00e9e, et non seulement la possession des biens, et pour qu'il n'y ait pas d'erreur, elle a \u00e9galement stipul\u00e9 par amendement en 1930 (20 Geo. V, chap. 30), que la loi de la \"saisine\" devait s'appliquer nonobstant les dispositions des articles 607 et 891 du code civil. On ne trouve, dans la Loi des Droits sur les Successions, aucun texte de cette nature, et il e\u00fbt cependant \u00e9t\u00e9 bien facile d'y en incorporer un semblable, si v\u00e9ritablement la l\u00e9gislature e\u00fbt voulu donner \u00e0 la Loi des Droits sur les Successions la m\u00eame port\u00e9e qu'elle a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de donner \u00e0 la loi de La Saisine de Certains B\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires.\nLes r\u00e9sultats provoqu\u00e9s par l'admission de la th\u00e9orie de l'intim\u00e9 d\u00e9truiraient l'\u00e9conomie de notre droit et cr\u00e9eraient des situations l\u00e9gales que certainement la loi n'a jamais voulues. O\u00f9 serait l'int\u00e9r\u00eat susceptible d'assurance si les biens du d\u00e9funt sont des res nullius? Comment concilier les lois de la prescription avec la th\u00e9orie que des biens peuvent ne pas avoir de propri\u00e9taires? Qu'advient-il de l'h\u00e9ritier qui d\u00e9c\u00e8de sans payer les droits successoraux? S'il n'h\u00e9rite pas, il ne peut donc pas transmettre ces m\u00eames biens \u00e0 ses propres h\u00e9ritiers. Qui enfin portera la responsabilit\u00e9 du dommage caus\u00e9 par la ruine du b\u00e2timent arriv\u00e9e par d\u00e9faut d'entretien ou par vice de construction, si le propri\u00e9taire que l'article 1055 C.C. tient responsable n'existe pas? Evidemment, comme le dit M. le juge Pr\u00e9vost, la loi n'a jamais song\u00e9 \u00e0 de pareilles absurdit\u00e9s, et il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire d'en arriver l\u00e0 pour assurer l'ex\u00e9cution de la loi. La seule conclusion qui me semble possible est que la transmission de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens, d\u00e8s l'instant de la mort du de cujus, n'est pas conditionn\u00e9e au paiement des droits successoraux. La condition que la loi impose ne fait que suspendre, comme le dit le texte lui-m\u00eame, la transmission des biens, ou, si Ton pr\u00e9f\u00e8re, la possession l\u00e9gale de ces ces biens, ou la saisine.\nEt l'h\u00e9ritier n'a pas en cons\u00e9quence, \"tant que les droits ne sont pas pay\u00e9s\", la pl\u00e9nitude de ses droits, et il ne jouit que d'un titre incomplet. Et \u00e0 cause de l'imperfection de son titre, il ne peut \u00e9videmment, tel que le dit l'article 15, sous-section 7a, faire un transport valide de ce m\u00eame bien \u00e0 un tiers. Il est dans la situation du successeur irr\u00e9gulier qui doit se faire envoyer en possession pour \u00eatre sur le m\u00eame pied que l'h\u00e9ritier l\u00e9gitime. Et si dans ce cas, la saisine agit r\u00e9troactivement \u00e0 la date du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, et si elle r\u00e9troagit avec les m\u00eames effets dans le cas de l'h\u00e9ritier appel\u00e9 comme cons\u00e9quence d'une renonciation \u00e0 une succession, ou pour permettre \u00e0 l'h\u00e9ritier saisi tardivement de continuer sans suspension la prescription acquisitive au profit du d\u00e9funt, pourquoi en serait-il autrement de la saisine conf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 l'h\u00e9ritier par le paiement des droits?\nLe but de la loi n'est que de prot\u00e9ger la cr\u00e9ance de la Couronne. Aussi pour s'assurer que le transport n'est pas valide \"tant que les droits ne sont pas pay\u00e9s\", elle d\u00e9fend au registrateur d'enregistrer les titres, \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cuteur de payer les legs, aux agents de transfert d'ins\u00e9rer \u00e0 leurs livres aucune transmission d'action, aux assureurs de payer les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices de polices d'assurance, aux banquiers de remettre les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts d'argent. Les h\u00e9ritiers qui en sont les propri\u00e9taires d\u00e8s le jour du d\u00e9c\u00e8s n'obtiennent un titre parfait qu'\u00e0 la date du paiement des droits, avec l'effet r\u00e9troactif dont nous avons parl\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment.\nEvidemment, c'est une condition essentielle que les droits soient pay\u00e9s avant qu'un h\u00e9ritier puisse poursuivre pour r\u00e9clamer une cr\u00e9ance faisant partie du patrimoine du d\u00e9funt; s'il instituait semblable action avant d'avoir rempli cette obligation, le d\u00e9biteur pourrait lui r\u00e9pondre que la loi lui d\u00e9fend de remettre au cr\u00e9ancier la possession des argents r\u00e9clam\u00e9s. Au contraire, le paiement pr\u00e9alable des droits n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire si une personne poursuit pour se faire d\u00e9clarer uniquement h\u00e9riti\u00e8re, parce qu'alors elle ne r\u00e9clame que le titre de propri\u00e9taire, et non la possession des biens. (DesRochers et DesRochers[3].)\nQuand l'appelante a vendu \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 le commerce d'assurance de son mari, elle \u00e9tait donc propri\u00e9taire. Il lui manquait la saisine l\u00e9gale subordonn\u00e9e au paiement des droits successoraux. Elle avait un titre incomplet, corrig\u00e9 cependant plus tard par l'obtention du certificat constatant qu'aucun droit n'\u00e9tait exigible, avec effet \u00e0 la date du d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\nJe ne puis voir que les caract\u00e8res de la nullit\u00e9 absolue entachent la transaction \u00e0 laquelle l'appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 partie. Elle a valid\u00e9 le transport fait \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, tout comme la loi valide la vente de la chose qui n'appartient pas au vendeur, quand ce dernier en devient subs\u00e9quemment propri\u00e9taire. (Art. 1488 C.C.)\nLe recours de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait par voie d'une demande en r\u00e9solution du contrat, ou en dommage (art. 1065 C.C.) si on ne lui donnait pas un titre parfait \u00e0 la chose dont il se portait acqu\u00e9reur. Au contrat qui fait l'objet de ce litige, il n'y a pas de clause de r\u00e9solution, mais il existe tout de m\u00eame un pacte commissoire tacite, qui permet \u00e0 Tune des parties d'en demander la r\u00e9solution, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par l'autre d'ex\u00e9cuter ses obligations. Mais cette r\u00e9solution n'op\u00e8re pas de plein droit: elle doit \u00eatre demand\u00e9e et doit \u00e9galement \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e. Comme le dit M. Mignault (vol. 5, page 450):\nLe contrat tient toujours; il reste valable tant que la r\u00e9solution n'en a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sur la demande du vendeur prononc\u00e9e en justice.\nL'appelante pouvait \u00e9viter cette r\u00e9solution en accomplissant son obligation, c'est-\u00e0-dire en compl\u00e9tant son titre de son propre gr\u00e9 ou apr\u00e8s mise en demeure. Et cela, tant que le jugement n'est pas prononc\u00e9 annulant le contrat. C'est l'opinion des auteurs et c'est aussi celle de M. le juge Dorion qui, parlant pour la cour d'appel dans la cause de Gagnon v. La Coop\u00e9rative F\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9e de Qu\u00e9bec[4], s'exprime ainsi:\nL'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 qu'elle n'est pas dans le cas de l'article 1092, et que, admettant qu'il y a lieu \u00e0 l'annulation du contrat par suite de son d\u00e9faut d'en ex\u00e9cuter les obligations en n\u00e9gligeant de donner les garanties promises, cette annulation en vertu du pacte commissoire tacite, n'a pas lieu de plein droit, que par cons\u00e9quent, elle peut, en ex\u00e9cutant son obligation avant que jugement intervienne, emp\u00eacher cette annulation et se pr\u00e9valoir de son droit de payer par anticipation et de d\u00e9duire l'int\u00e9r\u00eat.\nCette distinction est parfaitement juridique et elle est admise par la doctrine fran\u00e7aise cit\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e.\nPlaniol dit aussi (vol. 2, 8e \u00e9d., page 437):\nLa r\u00e9solution, \u00e9tant l'\u0153uvre du juge, et non de la volont\u00e9 des parties, ne se produit qu'au moment du jugement * * * le d\u00e9fendeur peut jusqu'au jugement emp\u00eacher la r\u00e9solution par une offre d'ex\u00e9cuter son engagement.\nBaudry-Lacantinerie (Des Obligations, vol. 2, page 189), s'exprime ainsi:\nAu contraire, lorsque les s\u00fbret\u00e9s promises n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies, ce fait peut \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9 aussi longtemps qu'un jugement n'est pas venu d\u00e9clarer la dette exigible, et, par suite, tant que cette d\u00e9cision n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue, le d\u00e9biteur peut, en ex\u00e9cutant sa promesse, \u00e9viter la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance, etc., etc.\nSur r\u00e9ception de l'action dirig\u00e9e contre elle, et malgr\u00e9 que ce fut une action en d\u00e9claration de nullit\u00e9, et non en r\u00e9solution, l\u2019appelante a obtenu le certificat n\u00e9cessaire du percepteur des droits de succession, Ta offert \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 avec les frais de l'action \u00e0 date, et vu le refus de ce dernier d'accepter, elle a renouvel\u00e9 ses offres avec son plaidoyer. Par cette mise en demeure fait au moyen de l'action qu'il a institu\u00e9e, l'intim\u00e9 a obtenu ce qui lui manquait, et ce \u00e0 quoi il avait droit. C'est \u00e0 tort qu'il a persist\u00e9 dans son action.\nJe suis d'opinion que le pr\u00e9sent appel doit \u00eatre accueilli et que le jugement de M. le juge Pr\u00e9vost, si\u00e9geant en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, doit \u00eatre r\u00e9tabli avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les cours.\nRand J.\u2014The narrow question raised by this appeal is whether a contract for the sale of an insurance business, entered into by the universal legatee and widow of a testator before the issue of a certificate from the Collector of Succession Duties that no duties were payable, is void ab initio. The deceased died on January 28th, 1941, and the contract was entered into on February 13th. The purchaser went into immediate possession and held it until about February 27th when this action was brought for a declaration of nullity and alternatively for annulment on the ground of fraud. On March 19th the certificate was issued and on the next day served on the respondent with a tender of costs up to that time. That tender was continued in the pleading. The issue of fraud was found against the purchaser and it is not in question here. In the Superior Court the action was dismissed but on appeal the Court of King's Bench by a majority decision reversed that judgment and directed the declaration claimed.\nThe nullity is put on the language of section 15, ss. 7 (a) of the Quebec Succession Duties Act, 1941, the material provisions of which are the same as those in force at the time of the sale. The subsection reads as follows:\nSubject to the provisions of section 13, no transmission of any property belonging to any deceased person at the time of his death shall take place, nor shall any transfer thereof be valid, nor shall any title therein or thereto vest in any person, unless and until the duties exigible under this division have been paid in full and unless a certificate, describing the property, to the effect that such duties have been paid or that none are exigible, has been delivered by the proper collector of provincial revenue, or by the collector of succession duties appointed for the Province or for the proper district, or by a revenue officer specially appointed for that purpose by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\nThis language has been construed as an absolute suspension of the transmission and as a prohibition of any contract which purports to deal with the transfer of property of a decedent before the certificate mentioned has been obtained. That construction introduces a new conception into the civil law of Quebec and raises serious questions in the practicable and workable administration of estates of deceased persons: and whether we must accept it in its bald simplicity and implications is what we are called upon to decide.\nAs means of enforcing payment of the duties, the statute has created a personal liability on those to whom the property passes and has placed the restrictions of the subsection quoted as well as others on dealings with the property generally.\nSection 13 provides that\nEvery heir, universal legatee, legatee by general or particular title * * * shall be personally liable for the duties due in respect of his share in the succession, and for no more;\nand that although the notary, executor, trustee or administrator shall not be under that liability,\nnevertheless the executor, the trustee or the administrator may be required to pay such duties out of the property or money in his possession belonging or owing to the beneficiaries, and, if he fail so to do, may be sued for the amount thereof, but only in his representative capacity. The restraints on dealings are in substance a total arrest of title and a fixation of possession of that part of the property in the hands of third persons, including debts or other obligations toward the deceased: but, except as to the delivery or payment of bequests to legatees, nothing in the Act purports to restrict or control the possession of or any dealing with other property by the executor, heirs or legatees.\nIt is important to observe that no charge is created upon any part of the assets to secure the duties. The statute does not, therefore, interfere with any interest or title in the succession otherwise than as it has created specific incapacities to deal with it effectively.\nIt is to be observed also that, notwithstanding the language of ss. 7 (a), the Act assumes rights in the executor or the heirs or legatees to have arisen as a result of the death; and these are rights in or to the property and not merely rights of election to take or accept. If in fact no right or interest of any sort or description is transmitted or created upon the death, how can the statute properly and in the legal sense of the law of Quebec speak of heirs or legatees? It would, therefore, I think, be to misconceive the statute to treat it as not recognizing in some form or to some degree the existence of rights in the property of the estate; and whether these are to be looked upon as a residue of the normal transmission which has escaped the effect of ss. 7 (a) or as rights, arising from a statutory implication, to acquire property the title to which by transmission is suspended pending payment of the duties, is not, I should say, of materiality. The legatee by the Act is not only assumed to be entitled to a legacy mentioned in a will but he is declared to be personally liable for the duty on that particular legacy and nothing more. It cannot be taken that a person named as a legatee would by statute become liable for a tax, involving as to him the transmission of property, before that transmission takes place, without creating or recognizing in him a legal right, subject, it may be, to conditions, to obtain that particular property.\nIn this case, no duties were in fact payable and it is instructive to consider the situation of such an estate if the literal construction of ss. 7 (a) urged by the respondent should be maintained. No part of the property, however insignificant, could, except in violation of the statute, be disposed of before the issue of the certificate. Such an estate might find its sole property ruined because of a necessary delay, quite within the time provided by the statute, in conforming to what at best can only be described as a perfectionist formality. Unless compelled by the language of the statute to do so, we ought not to attribute to the legislature an intention so unnecessary to its purpose and entailing such possible consequences.\nBut does that language bind us to such an interpretation? The statute contemplates not only that those who will become entitled do take possession of property held by the deceased at his death, but that they shall be liable to pay it over to the Crown in discharge of duties. We must also, in my opinion, take it that the executor and legatee may pay debts of the estate out of monies in their hands. It has been suggested in the courts below that such persons would be entitled to take measures to preserve the estate; I quite agree and these might inure not only to the benefit of those ultimately entitled but conceivably of the province itself; they might also call for the disposal of property perishable either physically or in market value. Nor is there anything to indicate that the policy of the Act is against a substitution of money for property in the hands of executors or successors. Although it is forbidden to reduce the funds or property in their possession by payment or delivery of legacies, the conversion of the property into another form such as money is nowhere banned.\nNow, the statute deals in particularity with the restrictions, penalties and obligations to enforce payment of the duties. But as that compulsion is their sole purpose and not to subject the estate to unnecessary loss or interference, I take it to mean that no further injunction is intended upon the property or the persons interested than is specifically provided. The language of ss. 7 (a) does not forbid the execution and delivery of an instrument of transfer, much less does it prohibit a contract the effect of which could not in any manner defeat its purpose. What the subsection does, and in this I take the French version to indicate more clearly the real intent of the language, is to suspend final validity of a transfer so long as the conditions mentioned are not met: it contemplates the accomplishment or execution of assumed rights upon the payment of the duties. To declare that no transfer shall be valid \"while\" duties are unpaid is to assume the possible existence of acts or relations which, upon the payment, become eo instanti of full legal efficacy. Interpreted in conjunction with the implied rights in the heirs or legatees, it becomes in effect a statutory suspensive condition. It negatives any implication that until the duties are paid no binding engagement can be entered into. So construed, the necessities of the practical handling of estates are accommodated and the administrative sanctions of the statute left unimpaired.\nThe validity of the contract between the parties to this appeal depends, therefore, upon the law governing sales. The appellant was, under the community of property, the owner of half of the business sold but the sale undoubtedly was of the business as an entirety. What, then, is the standing of a contract of sale in which the seller transfers to the purchaser an interest in the nature of a right to obtain title to the property upon the happening of a condition which the seller is in a position to bring about, and has given to the purchaser lawful possession; and what is the effect of steps such as those taken by the respondent and the appellant thereafter? As the sale is not within section 1487 of the Civil Code, it presents the ordinary case of an obligation, the performance of some part of which is delayed. The remedy of the buyer, arising from that default, is well settled. It is a case of pacte commissoire tacite and as it is laid down in Mignault, vol. 5, p. 450:\nL'inex\u00e9cution de ses obligations par Tune des parties ne suffit point, \u00e0 elle seule, pour amener la r\u00e9solution du contrat. Ainsi, l'acheteur n'a pas pay\u00e9 son prix \u00e0 l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du terme, bien qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 somm\u00e9 de le payer: le contrat tient toujours; il reste valable, tant que la r\u00e9solution n'en a pas \u00e9t\u00e9, sur la demande du vendeur, prononc\u00e9e en justice.\nAnd where, as here, the default is of such technical nature and there is no rule that excludes the giving of delay for fulfilling the obligation, it is well settled that, until judgment, the seller is entitled to remove the default if he can: Gagnon v. La Cooperative F\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9e de Quebec[5]. This the appellant did before the pleadings were closed and the tender of costs discharged her obligation under the contract. I would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the Superior Court dismissing the action, with costs to the appellant throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Antonio Talbot.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Raoul Gagnon.\n[1] Q.R.

The appellate court had reduced by half the amount of damages granted by the trial judge on the ground that there had been contributory negligence.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, varying the judgment of the Superior Court, S\u00e9vigny C.J., and reducing by half the amount of damages awarded.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nJ. A. Gagn\u00e9 K.C. and W. Desjardins K.C. for the appellant.\nGaston Esnouf K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014In the village of Sillery near Quebec city, a truck belonging to the respondent struck and seriously injured appellant's wife who at the time was attempting to cross the road. The appellant, who is common as to property with his wife, as chief of the community, instituted the present action in which he claims $13,495.68.\nThe trial judge awarded him $6,970.18, but the Court of King's Bench reduced this amount to $3,485.09 on the ground that there was contributory negligence.\nThe liability of the respondent cannot be questioned. The trial judge found that the truck driven by an employee of the Highway Department was going at an unreasonable rate of speed in the village of Sillery, at a time when the traffic was heavy, thus endangering the safety of pedestrians. The Court of King's Bench reached the same conclusion, and this concurrent finding of facts relieves us of the duty of dealing any further with this point.\nBut the Court of King's Bench thought that the imprudence of appellant's wife in crossing the road contributed to the accident in such a way, and to such an extent, that the liability of the respondent should be reduced by fifty per cent.\nWith great respect, I believe that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment at the trial restored. The sole and determining cause of the accident was the speed at which the truck was driven, and the failure of respondent's employee to exercise a proper control over his truck and bring it to a stop in order to avoid hitting appellant's wife.\nThe preponderance of the evidence, and the trial judge so found, is to the effect that when the victim proceeded to cross the street with her friend, there was no obstruction on the highway in the immediate vicinity. In order to cross the road, the victim had to walk approximately twenty feet, and before doing so, she looked to her right and to her left to make sure that the road was clear and that she could go ahead in all safety. Seeing nothing coming, she had the right to assume that no driver, in violation of the law of the road and of the most elementary prudence, in this village of Sillery which has been termed by respondent's driver himself, as a \"dangerous place\". would emerge at such a rate of speed and imperil her life, before she had finished crossing the road. It was her undisputable right to cross where she did, and before doing so, she took the ordinary precautions of a reasonable person. By her conduct, she created no sudden emergency which would strengthen respondent's case, and the evidence reveals nothing that she did that might have in any material way contributed to the accident.\nAlthough I agree with the trial judge in his disposition of this case, I do not wish it to be understood that I also concur in his too sweeping statement that the presumption of fault created by section 53 of the Motor Vehicles Act can be destroyed only\npar la preuve d'un cas fortuit on de force majeure, ou d'une cause \u00e9trang\u00e8re qui ne lui soit pas imputable.\nIt is not a liability defeasible by \"cas fortuit ou force majeure\" which the law has created against the owner or driver of an automobile, but merely a presumption of fault which is rebuttable by the defendant.\nIn the present case, the respondent has entirely failed to rebut this presumption, and therefore the present appeal must be allowed with costs, and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Wilfrid Desjardins.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Gaston Esnouj.\n"}

Respondent delivered to it for movement over its railway a locomotive crane which embodied a car structure on wheels by which it could be moved over railway tracks. Respondent (by its employees who engaged the railway service) had agreed to \"get it ready for shipment\". Appellant's train, in which was the crane-car, had gone only a few miles (on a very curved road), when, at a curve, owing to insecure fastening of the crane body to the frame of its car, the wheels of the crane-car left the rails and it and other cars of the train were derailed. Respondent claimed for damage to its crane, and appellant counter-claimed for expenses of repairing cars and track, clearing the wreck, etc., and for a freight charge for transporting, at respondent's request, the crane-car and its attachments to Vancouver.\nHeld (reversing judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, 58 B.C.R. 420, and of Sidney Smith J., 57 B.C.R. 247): Respondent's claim should be dismissed and appellant's counterclaim allowed (Hudson and Rand JJ. dissenting as to part of the counterclaim).\nPer the Chief Justice and Kerwin J.: There was nothing to indicate that appellant was a common carrier of cranes such as the one in question. The contract was one for haulage of the crane on the terms offered by respondent that it would \"get it ready for shipment\", and in view of those terms and the cause of the accident, the damages arose from respondent's neglect. At common law, while a common carrier of goods was an insurer, it was a condition precedent to its liability that any loss occurring while the goods were in its custody should not arise from the personal neglect or wrong or misconduct of the owner or shipper; and, on principle, that rule should apply to the contract of haulage; and the operation of the condition precedent is not affected by the provisions of s. 242 of the Railway Act (B.C.) against impairment of liability in respect of the carriage of traffic (the crane was within the statutory definition of \"traffic\" as being \"rolling stock\", not as being \"goods\"). On the evidence, the imperfect nature of the preparation of the crane for shipment was not known to appellant, and (despite the rules of the Association of American Railways, of which association appellant was an associate member, but which rules embody \"recommended practice\" only as among, and for the benefit of, the railways themselves) was not something which appellant should have known.\nPer Davis J.: The contract was one of haulage; and therefore appellant became merely a bailee for hire, and liable only for negligence after taking delivery. It did not appear that appellant in any sense undertook any supervision over the preparation of the crane for shipment or that appellant had at the place of shipment any employee competent, as compared with respondent's employees, to judge of the sufficiency of measures taken in such preparation. Respondent undertook to get the crane \"ready for shipment\", and there was no paramount duty on appellant to see that the crane was in proper condition for shipment. The issue of the action should be determined upon the basis of the particular contract and not on the general duty of a common carrier to a shipper of goods or to passengers. As to the counterclaim, appellant's damages were the direct consequence of respondent's negligence and were recoverable.\nPer Hudson and Rand JJ.: The crane was not \"goods\" (it was assumed it could be brought within the expression \"rolling stock\" and was therefore required by the Act to be accepted as traffic by railways) nor was the service one of carriage; it was a form of haulage (not less so because for reward or because it was a movement of the crane as crane) in respect of which appellant was not a common carrier. The matter for determination was the nature, scope and effect of respondent's undertaking to make the crane \"ready for shipment\" (a work which appellant could properly have required to be done by respondent). That undertaking formed a precedent condition to appellant's undertaking and was not an infringement of s. 242 of the Railway Act (B.C.) (which provides against impairment of liability in respect of the carriage of traffic). On the facts and circumstances in evidence, it must be held that respondent did not in fact rely upon appellant to confirm respondent's judgment that the measures taken in preparing the crane for the transportation were sufficient, nor, as a matter of law, should appellant be held to have had such reliance placed upon it, or be held to a knowledge of the best or \"recommended\" practice in such preparation. Respondent took the risk of what it had done in preparation; there was no paramount duty on appellant towards respondent involving responsibility for the mode of security followed. Respondent acted on its own judgment alone, and offered the crane to be transported in the condition to which it had brought it; and it was that act, done in performance of respondent's own duty or engagement, that caused the derailment; and the failure of the means adopted was, therefore, chargeable against it (as to its claim) and its claim must be rejected. As to appellant's counterclaim: Though, no doubt, appellant did in fact rely upon respondent's work as sufficient for the train's safe operation, yet appellant knew the general nature of the hazard presented to the transportation; and, though not all of the safety means taken were disclosed, yet, in the situation and from the standpoint of appellant's own interest, there was sufficient known to place upon appellant the obligation of enquiry if anything further had been required. In such circumstances, the warranty implied in law against dangerous goods, assuming the principle, by analogy, to apply, did not arise. Nor could it be said that there was an undertaking implied in fact that the crane was sufficiently secured for the safety of train operation. There was no evidence to justify the conclusion that respondent took the steps it did otherwise than to protect its own property (semble, if that were not so, if in fact the security of the train had been a controlling purpose in the mind of respondent, it would be liable for all the consequences). Respondent was prepared to accept the risk involved to its own property in the transportation of the crane as it was, but there was no evidence that it was accepting responsibility for that risk to any other property. Respondent, therefore, was not liable for the damage done to appellant's property. But appellant was entitled to recover on its counterclaim to the extent of the freight charge. APPEAL by the defendant (a railway company, subject to the British Columbia Railway Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 241) from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1]dismissing (McDonald C.J.B.C. dissenting) its appeal from the judgment of Sidney Smith J. [2] in favour of the plaintiff for damages and dismissing the defendant's counter-claim. The action was for damages by reason of damage to the plaintiff's locomotive crane while being transported in the defendant's train, the damage being caused by derailment of the train. The defendant's counter-claim was for damages for expenses of repairing cars and track, clearing the wreck, etc., incurred as a result of the derailment, which it claimed was caused by the plaintiff's negligence in not properly preparing and securing the crane for safe travel, in breach of an alleged undertaking, and for a freight charge for transporting, at the plaintiff's request, the crane-car and its attachments to Vancouver. (McDonald C.J.B.C., dissenting in the Court of Appeal, would have dismissed the plaintiff's action; but he would also dismiss the defendant's counter-claim so far as it claimed for damage to its property and for costs of clearing up the wreck; he would have allowed the counter-claim for transportation charges.)\nC. H. Locke K.C. for the appellant.\nJ.W. deB. Farris K.C. and J.L. Farris for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014There is nothing to indicate that the appellant railway company was a common carrier of cranes such as the one in question. The appellant is subject to the British Columbia Railway Act and the first question is as to which of its provisions are applicable to the contract between the parties.\n\"Goods\" and \"traffic\" are defined in the Act as follows:\u2014\n\"Goods\" includes personal property of every description which may be conveyed upon the railway or upon steam-vessels or other vessels connected with the railway.\n\"Traffic\" means the traffic of passengers, goods, and rolling-stock. In my opinion, the crane is not \"goods\" but \"rolling-stock\", and, as such, is covered by the prohibitions relating to the carriage of traffic, contained in section 242:\u2014\n242. (1) No contract, condition, by-law, regulation, declaration, or notice made or given by the company, impairing, restricting, or limiting its liability in respect of the carriage of any traffic, shall, except as hereinafter provided, relieve the company from such liability, unless such class of contract, condition, by-law, regulation, declaration, or notice shall have been first authorized or approved by order or regulation of the Minister by certificate under his hand and seal of office.\n(2) The Minister may, by certificate as aforesaid, determine the extent to which the liability of the company may be so impaired, restricted, or limited.\nThe next question is whether this section is applicable under the circumstances. The appellant's contract with the respondent was one for haulage of the crane from Bridge River to Vancouver on the terms offered by the respondent that the latter would \"get it ready for shipment\". At common law, while a common carrier of goods was an insurer, it was a condition precedent to its liability that any loss occurring while the goods were in its custody should not arise from the personal neglect or wrong or misconduct of the owner or shipper. The rule to this effect laid down in Story on Bailments was adopted by Willes J. in Blower v. Great Western Railway Company [3], and is referred to with approval in subsequent decisions. There is now no dispute that the damages were caused by the insecure fastening of the body of the crane, which means that, in view of the terms of the offer by the respondent, the damages arose from the latter's neglect. On principle, there is no reason that the rule should not apply to the contract of haulage, and the provisions of section 242 do not affect the operation of the condition precedent.\nIt is unnecessary to pursue the question as to whether in a case of carriage of goods a railway company would be absolved by the neglect of the shipper (such as in bad packing), which had been obvious to the carrier when the goods were tendered. In Gould v. South Eastern and Chatham Railway Company [4], Lord Justice Atkin laid it down that in such circumstances the knowledge of the carrier of the improper packing did not make it liable. Lord Justice Younger did not specifically agree with that statement as, on that point, he said the plaintiff's contention was not supported by the facts. In the House of Lords, in London and North Western Railway Company v. Richard Hudson and Sons, Limited [5], Lord Atkinson, at page 340, affirmed the law to be otherwise, or, as stated in the second edition of Leslie's Law of Transport by Railway, at page 40, the traditional view. I am unable to read the judgments in Great Northern Railway Company v. L.E.P. Transport and Depository, Limited [6], as expressing any conclusion upon the point. In that case, the defendants shipped in carboys goods described by them\nas oxygen water, a description of something which is regarded in this country as innocuous. Further, they tendered these goods, which by the description they applied to them they represented as being innocuous, in what was apparently a safely packed condition; because the carboys had wooden plugs or stoppers in them in which there had been vents, but the vents had been closed up by the action of the contents upon the wood, and the stoppers themselves were covered with a wicker cover, so that it was impossible for anybody, by a mere examination of the outside of the carboys, to ascertain whether they were properly stoppered or not. These were the goods which were tendered, [per Lord Justice Bankes at page 760.]\nOn the evidence in this case, I am satisfied that the imperfect nature of the preparation of the crane for shipment was not known to the appellant, and that, despite the rules of the Association of American Railways, the appellant should not have known of the imperfect preparation of the crane for shipment. The appellant was an associate member of this association but the rules embody \"recommended practice\" only as among, and for the benefit of, the railways themselves.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the claim of the respondent dismissed, and the counter-claim of the appellant allowed, with costs throughout.\nDAVIS J.\u2014The question in issue in the action turns upon the contract between the parties. If it is an ordinary contract of carriage of goods by rail, the railway company would be a common carrier and liable as an insurer. But my view of the evidence is that the contract was one of haulage and different considerations prevail than in the case of a contract of carriage of goods. If it is a haulage contract, the railway company became merely a bailee for hire, and liable only for negligence after it took delivery of the crane. See: Watson v. North British Ry. Co [7]; William Barr & Sons v. Caledonian Ry. Co. [8].\nThe locomotive crane, the property of the Power Company, had its own flat car to which it was attached, with wheels of standard gauge so that the unit could be moved about on the ordinary railway tracks. There was a turntable swinging mechanism in the floor of the flat car so that the crane could swing around as desired for any particular operation. The Power Company, having some arrangement for the sale of this locomotive crane, desired to have it conveyed by rail from the Power Company's plant some miles north of Vancouver, to Vancouver. It was obvious, of course, that the crane would have to be fastened or secured in some way for the trip so that it could not swing around in transit. The Power Company employees, who had been operating this crane for some six years and were familiar with it and its mechanism, were the natural persons, I think, to devise ways and means of adequately fastening the crane so that it could not move on the turntable during the journey by rail. At any rate the evidence makes it plain that the Power Company, in arranging with the railway to move the crane, undertook to \"get it ready for shipment\". That was the contract. And I think the employees of the Power Company did what they thought would be adequate and sufficient by way of cables or wiring to put the crane in condition for the purpose. But the fact is that there were not adequate and sufficient measures adopted by the Power Company to hold the machine in place while being conveyed by rail over a somewhat rough and very curved road. It does not appear that the railway company in any sense undertook any supervision over the preparation of the crane for shipment or that it had at the place of shipment any employee competent, as compared with the Power Company's own employees, to judge of the sufficiency of any measures to be taken to prevent the crane moving in transit.\nThe crane was picked up by the railway at the Power Company's siding and, travelling on its own flat car and wheels, became one of several railway cars that made up a freight train. Unfortunately the train had only gone a few miles when, taking one of several curves in the road, the crane broke from its fastenings and the crane car and five other cars of the train were derailed.\nThis action was brought by the Power Company against the railway company for damages to its crane on the ground that there was a paramount duty, over and beyond any undertaking of the Power Company to get the crane ready for shipment, to see that the crane was in proper condition for shipment and to carry it safely. I cannot accept that contention. There was, in my opinion, a contract of haulage between the parties, and the issue of the action falls to be determined upon the basis of the particular contract and not on the general duty of a common carrier to the shipper of goods or to passengers on a train. The learned trial judge found the cause of derailment, which finding is accepted by all the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal, as follows:\u2014\nI accept the opinion of Mr. Bates, the Chief Engineer of the defendant company, as to the cause of the accident. He says in effect that the swinging of the crane car around these curves gradually slackened the wires, and the increased play eventually broke the wires and dislodged the wedge, thus allowing the crane body to swing round at an angle to the car with the ballasted and outboard causing the derailment. I think there can be no doubt that the crane car was the first to leave the rails and that the cause of the derailment was the insecure fastening of the crane body to the frame of its car.\nBut the trial judge gave effect to the argument on the general duty of a railway to a shipper of goods, and held the railway company liable for the damages. The Court of Appeal for British Columbia affirmed the judgment, the Chief Justice dissenting.\nI agree, so far as the claim in the action is concerned, that the appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nI am inclined to think that the error into which the learned trial judge fell in reaching his conclusion on the question of liability was in approaching the solution of the problem as \"a transportation problem\" involving the duty of a railway, instead of a matter of contract between the two parties to the transaction, and by thinking of the train in terms of a ship at sea. In his reasons for judgment he said:\u2014\nThe question before me is whether the onus for securing the crane was on the plaintiff or on the defendant. In other words, whether the owner of the crane or the Railway Company had the duty of seeing that the crane was in proper condition for the journey it was about to undertake. In my opinion this duty is one for the Railway Company. It is a transportation problem. It does not concern the question of whether goods are properly packed. It is a matter of the Railway Company taking into its train something that imperilled the train itself. Adopting a term from the sea, by analogy, the train was \"unrailworthy\". I think there can be no doubt that the duty of securing the crane so as to make the train \"railworthy\" was upon the Railway Company.\nIn Trickett v. Queensland Insurance Co. Ltd. [9], their Lordships, referring to dicta of a judge in a previous case cited in argument in the Trickett case as ground for considering the matter in question in terms of \"roadworthiness\" by analogy to \"seaworthiness\" of a ship at sea, said that they were\nnot able to assimilate, as did the learned judge, the position of a ship at sea with that of a motor-car on land, and rigidly apply the same code of law to both cases. For reasons which are too obvious to be stressed in detail, their Lordships think the analogue imperfect and indeed misleading. They are of opinion that the argument based by the appellant on the identity of the conditions which govern the seaworthiness of a ship at sea and the roadworthiness of a car on land is unsound.\nThe railway company counter-claimed for damages arising out of the derailment to two flat cars and two box cars owned by the railway and one Canadian National Railway box car. The damages were for repairing these cars; clearing the wreck; re-railing, loading and transporting the damaged equipment, repairing the track, etc.; these damages being claimed in the sum of $3,507.48. There was a further and separate item in the counterclaim for the subsequent delivery at the Power Company's request of the crane car and its attachments to the Power Company at Vancouver. That item was claimed at $370.24. The learned Chief Justice of British Columbia, who dissented in the Court of Appeal on the main claim, did not think, however, that the railway company was entitled to its counter-claim except in respect of the item for the return of the crane car to the Power Company. But the cause of the derailment being, as found by the trial judge, \"the insecure fastening of the crane body to the frame of its car\", the damages for which the counterclaim was made were the direct consequence of plaintiff's negligence and are damages recoverable, in my opinion, by the defendant railway company from the plaintiff Power Company.\nI should therefore allow the appeal as to the counterclaim with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Hudson and Rand JJ. was delivered by\nRAND J.\u2014This controversy arises out of a simple transaction in which the respondent delivered to the appellant for movement over its railway from Bridge River to Squamish a locomotive crane. The crane embodied a car structure on wheels by which it could be moved over railway tracks. It also possessed power by which it could propel itself by means of internal gears. There was a boom which, for the purpose of being transported, was partly disconnected from the crane and loaded on a railway flat car, with a second flat car to serve the purpose of what is known as an idler, over which the end of the boom projected. The respondent, by its employees who participated in the engagement of the railway service, agreed to put the crane in proper condition for the transportation, \"to get it ready for shipment\". Before the train had proceeded more than seven or eight miles from Bridge River the fastenings of the crane broke, the revolving superstructure became loose, the wheels of the crane-car left the rails and the train was wrecked.\nThe respondent brought action for damages to the crane and the appellant counter-claimed for the expenses of clearing up the wreck, repairing equipment and track, and repairing and transporting the crane to Vancouver. The judgment at the trial upheld the claim on the ground that, as between the two parties, the duty of determining the sufficiency of the means by which the crane was secured rested upon the appellant and that it was liable for the consequences which followed from their failure; and the counter-claim was dismissed. In the Court of Appeal this judgment was affirmed, with the Chief Justice dissenting as to the claim. On the counter-claim, however, he took the view that, although as between the parties the respondent had undertaken to put the crane in proper condition for conveyance, the appellant, in relation to the train opera- tion, both as to its own property and property in its custody as carrier, assumed the risk of the adequacy of the work done by the respondent.\nSection 202 of the Railway Act of British Columbia places upon railways the obligation to accept as traffic not only passengers and goods, but also \"rolling stock\", and I will assume in what follows that the crane can be brought within that expression. I am unable to agree that it was \"goods\" or that the service was carriage: it was a form of haulage, not less so because for reward or because it was a movement of the crane as crane, in respect of which the appellant was not a common carrier. The controversy reduces itself to a determination of the nature, scope and effect of the undertaking on the part of the respondent to make the crane \"ready for shipment\".\nMr. Locke for the appellant puts it as being one of fact: first, that the respondent, by making the crane safe for conveyance, completes the subject-matter of the haulage, that what is to be conveyed by the railway is the crane so prepared; and secondly, that the respondent not only does the work of making the crane secure, but takes upon itself responsibility in all respects for the sufficiency of that work. The latter lies in an implied warranty of fitness for the purposes of the service. As a further defence to the claim, there is set up an estoppel from the implied representation to the appellant that the crane was so fit.\nMr. Farris interprets the engagement as a qualified obligation: that the respondent will do the actual work needed to bring about security of travelling condition but in reliance upon the appellant's judgment as to its sufficiency for that purpose. As a complement to this and also, as I understand it, independently of it, he invokes above any such obligation or requirement the paramount duty of the railway towards all shippers, including the respondent, to do whatever may be necessary to make its train operation safe. That would entail assumption of responsibility for the mode of security followed here by the respondent.\nThese contentions involve two distinct aspects of the act of preparing goods for shipment or conveyance. Ordinarily that preparation is concerned only to enable them to withstand the incidents of the transportation. It is the interest of the shipper in his property that is primarily regarded and, apart from special circumstances, if the goods are insufficiently packed or otherwise secured, the shipper must bear the resulting loss or damage. That is the first aspect.\nBut there is another, though one not ordinarily met with, and it is that of the interest of the carrier in the safety of his own property or the property of others in his custody. In addition to the obligation placed upon the shipper of making his goods carriageable, the carrier is entitled to require that the transportation of the goods should not involve danger to his operations, or vehicles or their contents. In this aspect, it is now settled that where goods dangerous in fact are presented to a carrier, in the absence of a disclosure of that danger, there is implied a warranty that the goods can be carried with safety; and if damage results from that cause, the shipper is responsible. The warranty does not arise where the carrier is informed or ought to know of the danger: Great Northern Ry. Co. v. L.E.P. Transport and Depository Ltd. [10].\nNow, the preparation of things or articles for conveyance is antecedent to the main undertaking of the carrier. In the argument before us it was admitted that the appellant could have refused to prepare and secure the crane itself and that it could properly require that work to be done by the respondent. This precedent condition, therefore, is not an infringement of section 242 of the provincial Railway Act which forbids the impairment of liability in respect of the carriage of traffic.\nWhat, then, are the terms of the preliminary act of preparing property for conveyance, which go to the conditions under which the obligation to accept on the part of the railway arises? In the absence of statutory provision, I know of nothing to qualify the transaction from being one depending upon its facts, subject, as in other relations between public carriers and shippers, to the general rule of reasonableness. The particular feature which this dispute presents is the element of reliance: and the question is, what of that element have we here in relation to both aspects of the act of making the crane safe for conveyance?\nDid the company in fact rely upon the railway to confirm its judgment that the measures of safety taken were sufficient for the journey? The evidence on examination for discovery of the witnesses Grant and Heinrich would seem to me to be conclusive on that point:\u2014\nGrant:\nQ. What happened then?\nA. Then\u2014I think that was all there was to it. I asked him if everything was O.K. and satisfied and he said yes, it was all right.\nQ. What do you say about being satisfied?\nA. I asked Mr. Newton if everything was O.K. and he said yes, that would be all right.\nQ. When was that ?\nA. That was right then when we finished.\nQ. That was when you finished with the boom?\nA. Finished the boom.\nQ. You were not asking this man for advice as to how to fasten the crane?\nA. No.\nQ. You were the one who knew about the crane?\nA. Yes.\nAnd Heinrich:\nQ. Were you there when that was done?\nA. Part of the time. I didn't superintend the whole thing.\nQ. Do you feel qualified to express an opinion as to whether that was sufficient to keep the crane from turning?\nA. I do.\nQ. And your opinion was what?\nA. It was secure.\nNewton had been stationed at the point, Shalath, a mile or so from Bridge River, for about three years. He had done ordinary work of inspecting shipments such as lumber and was, in general, the medium of communication between the respondent and the appellant. But his functions were well known by the company and it is impossible to suppose, as the evidence quoted concedes, that he had any special qualifications for inspecting such a mechanism as the crane, or that he represented himself to have any.\nThe respondent had owned the crane for about six years. Heinrich was an engineer of forty years' standing who had been with the respondent for thirty-three years. It was not a case of ordinary measures for protecting goods against damage. The work involved some knowledge of the internal workings of a complicated machine. There was nothing external to indicate what adjustments could be or had been made within the apparatus to make it stable and secure. There is no suggestion that any enquiries were made by Newton as to the visible or invisible means of securing it. The cables were, of course, seen but they might easily be taken as extra-precautionary measures. There was in the crane, and so far as the evidence goes, unknown to Newton, a substantial quantity of ballast which served as a counter-weight to the boom. That was in the knowledge of Heinrich and no doubt was a circumstance taken into account when he decided upon driving a wedge between the moveable superstructure of the crane and its base; but it is not suggested that Newton or the conductor knew anything about the wedge or the considerations which led to its being used, or the fact that there was nothing in the apparatus to enable the revolving superstructure to be firmly locked. The conductor states he assumed there was such a mechanism.\nThere is said to be a duty to make train conditions safe for operations. Certainly, liability may be bound up with that circumstance: but the duty runs towards those whose goods are being carried or conveyed. It is implicated in the contractual relations with those persons which. constitute the carrier's undertaking, including the terms of the preparatory transaction. If, then, the shipper has represented or engaged that his property is fit for conveyance, the railway may, as to that shipper, properly assume the condition to be as represented and act in the manner contemplated by both parties.\nA qualification of this may arise in any case in which the insufficiency of the method adopted either is actually known to the carrier or is so manifest or obvious that the carrier must be charged with its knowledge. Then, no doubt, the general obligation of the carrier to exercise care towards goods which he is to take or has taken into his custody, may operate and he may be obliged either to refuse to carry, or to complete or supplement what should have been done by the shipper or thereafter deal with the goods in the light of their actual condition. But that apparency must be to those who are representing the carrier at the time; and, treating the rule as applicable, by analogy, to the case here, it is not seriously suggested that the checker or the conductor actually appreciated the insufficiency here or should have done so.\nThere were introduced in evidence certain rules of The Association of American Railways, an organization in which the appellant held an associate membership, which, among other things, dealt with methods of loading and securing different classes of goods or property, including cranes, which are not moved in closed cars. They are what is termed \"recommended practice\" originated by and formulated primarily for the benefit of railways. They would apply to the movement of such units as cranes by railways for themselves equally as for others. No doubt shippers may be required to conform to them so far as they are reasonable. They probably have particular relation to the interchange of traffic and equipment between member railways, but they are of value as well to the operations of a single railway.\nThe consideration of reasonable care by a carrier does not ordinarily arise in common carriage because of his liability as insurer but, where that relation is not present and the question is solely one of that duty, no doubt the standards so set up would weigh strongly in determining whether the carrier had discharged it in the case of damage to property other than that to which a particular rule applied. But that is not the case here. The question which we must determine is the duty of a carrier towards a shipper in respect of the act of preparation. Although the railway might have insisted upon another mode of preparation, was it bound in the circumstances to do so? If the company had sought information as to the proper method, I have little doubt the appellant would have been under a duty to furnish it; and if, through actual knowledge of the \"recommended practice\" or otherwise, the insufficiency ought to have been apparent to those representing the railway, the same or a similar duty might arise. But the carrier is not, in the circumstances present here, as a matter of law, held to a knowledge of the best or \"recommended\" practice. In such a case, the shipper in effect says: \"I take the risk of what I have done to my own property in the service which I know you are going to give to it\", and the mere existence of such a code could not nullify that assumption as a term of the engagement between the parties. If the crane, by some chance, had been the only unit of the train damaged or derailed, the case would have presented little difficulty. Although advanced in the concept of a duty to furnish a \"train\u2014 worthy\" service, the contention of the respondent reduces itself to the proposition that, in law, the carrier undertakes with the shipper that the act of the shipper will not be a danger to his own property by reason of the effect of that act upon the train operation: but notwithstanding the force with which that view was urged, it is, in my opinion, unfounded in rule or principle.\nThe representatives of the company who dealt with the railway, neither in fact nor in law, then, placed any reliance whatever in Newton as to the sufficiency of the safeguards: it was their judgment, and theirs alone, on which they acted: and they offered the crane to be transported in the condition to which they had brought it. But it was that. act of the company, done in the performance of its own duty or engagement, that caused the derailment. The failure of the means adopted was, therefore, in this respect, chargeable against the respondent and the claim must be rejected: Canadian Westinghouse Co. v. Can. Pac. Rly. Co.[11] : Duff J. (as he then was):\u2014\nIf the derailment and consequent injury to the machinery were drreetly caused, in whole or in part, by negligent loading, the appellant company is not entitled to recover, because, if that be so, the loss is at least a loss caused in part by its negligence, and that circumstance, according to settled and well-known principles, disentitled it to recover any part of the loss.\nThere remains the counter-claim. As already stated, this is placed on an implied warranty that the crane as delivered to the appellant was reasonably fit for all purposes of being hauled to its destination; there is also a count in negligence in creating a condition of danger, the natural and probable consequences of which, if not adequately controlled, might be the serious disruption that took place.\nNow, no doubt the railway did in fact rely upon the work done by the company as sufficient for the safe operation of the train: but was it entitled to do so in the sense that the company should be bound by that reliance and the responsibility which it entailed? The railway knew the general nature of the hazard presented to the transportation. Not all of the safety means taken were disclosed, but in the situation and from the standpoint of the railway's own interest there was sufficient known to place upon the railway the obligation of enquiry if anything further had been required. In these circumstances, the warranty implied in law against dangerous goods, assuming the principle, by analogy, to apply, does not arise.\nWas there an undertaking implied in fact that the crane was sufficiently secured for the safety of train operation? The confusing circumstance is that the security of the crane was intimately bound.up with security for the train. There is nothing in the evidence, however, to justify the conclusion that the respondent took the steps it did otherwise than to protect its own property. If that were not so, if in fact the security of the train had been a controlling purpose in the mind of the respondent, I would feel bound to hold it liable for all the consequences. The respondent was prepared to accept the risk involved to its own property in the transportation of the crane as it was, but there is no evidence that it was accepting responsibility for that risk to any other property.\nI agree, therefore, with the view of the late Chief Justice of British Columbia that the respondent is not liable for the damage done to the property of the appellant. I agree with him, also, that the appellant is entitled to recover for the freight charges for hauling the crane to Vancouver and back to Squamish: this is the only item of damage claimed on the footing of services rendered at the request of the respondent. The appeal should be allowed and judgment entered dismissing the claim and allowing the counterclaim to the extent mentioned, with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

VI, c. 49, amended by 2 Geo. VI, c. 62\u2014The Collective Labour Agreements Act, 3 Geo. VI, c. 61\u2014The Collective Agreement Act, R.S.Q., 1941, c. 163.\nThe appellant brought an action against the respondent, praying inter alia that a collective labour agreement, entered into between the respondent and its employees' association, mise-en-cause, under the provisions of The Professional Syndicates Act, be declared illegal and set aside, and that the respondent be ordered to abstain from denying to the inspectors of the appellant access to its premises to inspect its books, etc., under the authority of a decree made by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council under the Collective Agreement Act. At the same time as the action, the appellant made a demand for an interim injunction, and, later, for an interlocutory injunction which were both granted. The Superior Court maintained the appellant's action, declared illegal, irregular and null that part of the agreement conflicting with the decree, confirmed the interlocutory injunction, ordered the respondent to cease to refuse access to its establishment and further condemned the respondent to pay damages in the amount of $33.80. This judgment was reversed by the appellate court, though its members did not agree on the reasons for their decisions.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the appellate court and restoring the judgment of the trial judge, that the collective labour agreement invoked by the respondent is null and void: such agreement cannot have the effect of withdrawing the respondent from the application of the decree previously passed under the Collective Agreement Act.\nThe legislature, by the imperative and unequivocal text of that Act (sections 2, 9, 11, 12 and 13) intended to bind all employees and employers who are engaged in a similar trade or business. It is as a consequence of the legal extension conferred by the decree, that all those performing work of the same nature or kind become subject to its provisions. It is furthermore a law of public order, which stipulates in clear terms that the provisions of the decree respecting hours of labour and wages, in a given undertaking, are obligatory, thus rendering null and void all agreements violating or coming in conflict with its dispositions.\nUnder The Professional Syndicates Act, any agreement respecting the conditions of labour, not prohibited by law, can form the object of a collective labour agreement, the aim of that law being to enable the working classes to deal collectively with their employers; but such agreement is the law of the parties only and no greater advantages can be derived from these agreements than from those entered into between ordinary corporations or individuals.\u2014A further step was made later with the enactment of The Collective Agreement Act, which recognized labour agreements, and further declared, which was the essential feature of the law, that not only the signators to the agreement would be bound by it but also all those exercising in a given region a similar trade. The scope of the collective agreements was thus considerably extended, and even the dissenting employees and employers were bound by the decree. The agreement, stipulating wages and hours of labour, invoked by the respondent violated the decree passed under The Collective Agreement Act and is therefore null and void.\nBut the judgment of this Court should not be interpreted as meaning that the provisions of The Professional Syndicates Act have been in any way repealed by The Collective Agreement Act. Both laws coexist, and professional syndicates may enter into labour agreements with their employers under the condition, however, that their terms do not conflict with the existing law. The private agreements made under the first Act between employers and employees must necessarily yield to the imperative provisions of the second Act in the territory covered by the decree.\nHeld, also, that the judgment of the trial judge is susceptible of execution, that it is not affected by any vagueness and that the terms of the injunction granted by him are in conformity with the Code of Civil Procedure.\nHeld, also, that, upon the evidence, the respondent is engaged in printing operations and that the contention of the respondent that its employees are not in that trade, but are mere operators requiring very little training because of the perfection of modern machinery, is inadmissible. APPEAL, by leave of appeal granted by this Court[1], from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Bertrand J., which had maintained the appellant's action, had declared illegal, irregular and null a labour agreement passed between the respondent and the mise-en-cause, had confirmed an interlocutory injunction and granted a permanent injunction, enjoying the respondent to cease to refuse access to its establishments and to obstruct the work of the inspectors of the appellant and had condemned the respondent to pay a sum of $33.80, being damages incurred for expenses of these inspectors.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and Laurent B\u00e9langer for the appellant.\nL. E. Beaulieu K.C. and Ivan Sabourin K.C. for the respondent.\nAlcide C\u00f4t\u00e9 for the mise-en-cause.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J:\u2014In 1937, a collective labour agreement relating to the industry of printing (as defined in the decree) was entered into between several professional syndicates and unions of employees, and over 125 employers.\nA few months later, on the 9th of February, 1938, an Order in Council was passed by the Provincial Government of the province of Quebec, and was published in the Official Gazette on the 12th of February. This Order in Council, also called the decree, extended without amendment the provisions of this agreement, to all employees and employers, performing work of the same nature and kind in the city of Montreal, and in all the localities situate in a radius of one hundred miles from the boundaries of the island.\nIn pursuance to the rights and obligations conferred upon them by the law, the parties to the collective agreement formed a joint committee to supervise and ensure the carrying out of the decree, and such committee, which constituted a corporation, had at that time the powers, rights and privileges appertaining to ordinary civil corporations. The committee could further:\n(a) Compel any professional employer to keep a register indicating the surname, Christian names and residence of each employee in his employ, his competency, the regular and extra hours of daily labour and its nature, as well as the wage paid for such labour, with mention of the method and time of payment;\n(b) Examine the aforesaid register and the pay-list;\n(c) Verify, as with any employer and any employee, the rates of wages, the hours of labour, the system of apprenticeship and any other provisions of the decree;\n(d) Require under oath from any employer or from any employee, and even at the place where the latter does his work, such information as it deems necessary;\n(e) Require the professional employer to have a copy of the scale of wages which has been made obligatory, or of any decision or by-law, posted up in a suitable place;\n(f) Levy upon the professional employer alone or upon both the professional employer and the employee, the sums required for the carrying out of the decree; such levying to be made subject to the following conditions * * * etc.\nUnder the agreement, three zones have been established.\nZone (1): Island of Montreal and a radius of ten miles in a straight line from the boundaries of the Island.\nZone (2): The following municipalities and a radius of two miles from their limits: Three-Rivers, Sherbrooke, Sorel, St. Hyacinthe, Valleyfield, Joliette, Granby, St. John d'Iberville, Laprairie, St. J\u00e9rome, Hull; with the exception of establishments which published and printed, as at the 3rd of January, 1938, one or more weekly newspapers.\nZone (3): The whole jurisdiction with the exception of zones (1) and (2) but and comprising all printing establishments possessing, and printing a weekly or bi-weekly newspaper and situated within the limits of zones (1) and (2), with the exception that those situate on the Island of Montreal shall continue to be governed by the provisions of zone (1), with the reserve mentioned in zone (2).\nThe defendant-respondent's establishment is situate at St. John d'Iberville and is therefore included in zone (2).\nFor a certain period of time after the coming into force of the decree, the respondent paid the levies to the appellant, sent monthly reports, etc., always under reserve of its rights and under protest. But, in July, 1939, the respondent refused to allow the appellant's inspectors to enter its establishment, and a complaint was therefore laid before the Magistrate's Court against the respondent, who had to answer to the charge of hindering the exercising of the rights conferred on the appellant by the statute. Instead of contesting, the respondent filed a written confession where it pleaded guilty, but without admitting the jurisdiction of the Court and without acknowledging that it was bound by the decree.\nLater, in November, 1939, and in January, 1940, the respondent again prevented access to its establishment and to its books to the appellant's inspectors. It was then, as it is now, the contention of the respondent, that it did not fall under the jurisdiction of the decree, because it was not a printing establishment, and because also it had' passed with an association of its employees, the mise-en-cause, a special collective labour agreement which prevented the decree from finding any application. The respondent, therefore, ceased to submit to the appellant its monthly reports on wages paid, the hours of labour * * * etc., and ceased also to forward its levies.\nIn September, 1940, the appellant instituted action in which it claimed (a) that the agreement entered into between the respondent and the mise-en-cause on the 26th of September, 1939, be declared illegal, irregular and null, and that it be annulled for all legal purposes; (b) that order be given to the defendant, to all its officers, representatives and employees to cease to refuse access to its establishments, books, and to cease also to put any obstacle to the exercise by the inspectors of the appellant, of their powers, rights and privileges; (c) that the defendant be condemned to pay to the appellant a sum of $105, being damages incurred for expenses of the inspectors of the plaintiff.\nAt the same time as this action was taken, there was also a demand for an interim injunction which was granted on the 9th of February, 1940, by Mr. Justice Louis Cousineau, and, on the 18th of November, 1940, an interlocutory injunction was issued by Mr. Justice Trahan.\nIn the Superior' Court, Mr. Justice Charles-Auguste Bertrand maintained the action, declared illegal, irregular and null that part of the agreement conflicting with the decree, confirmed the interlocutory injunction which had been granted by Mr. Justice Trahan, ordered the defendant to cease to refuse access to its establishment, and further condemned the defendant to pay damages in the amount of $33.80, the whole with costs. The Court of King's Bench reversed this judgment, but, the learned judges did not agree on their reasons, which we will examine later. The parties are now before this Court, the appellant having obtained special leave to appeal. Various issues have been raised, and the first ground of defence of the respondent is that it is not affected by the decree, because on the 26th of September, 1939, it entered into an agreement with the mise-en-cause, an association of its employees, and it alleges that this agreement, which is governed by the Professional Syndicates' Act, determines amongst other things the wages to be paid, the classification of employees and the hours of labour.\nIs this agreement valid, and has it the effect of withdrawing the respondent from the application of the decree under the Collective Labour Agreement Act? The Act is found in 1 Geo. VI, c. 49, amended by 2 Geo. VI, c. 52, and by 3 Geo. VI, c. 61, and also in the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1941, c. 163 (now called The Collector Agreement Act). Under this Act, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council:\nmay order that a collective labour agreement entered into between employers and employees, respecting any trade, industry, commerce or occupation, shall also bind all the employees and employers in a stated region of the Province.\nAnd section 9 says:\nWhenever a decree is passed under section 2, the provisions of the agreement, whether amended or not, which become obligatory, are those respecting wages, hours of labour, apprenticeship and the proportion between the number of skilled workmen and that of apprentices in a given undertaking.\nSection 11 provides that:\nthe provisions of the decree entail a matter of public order, and shall govern and rule any hire of work of the same nature or kind as that contemplated by the agreement, in the region of the Province determined by the decree.\nSection 12 says that:\nwhatever method of remuneration be agreed to between the parties, whether the latter be natural or ideal persons, and whatever be the employer's occupation, it is forbidden to stipulate a remuneration equivalent to a wage below that fixed by the decree.\nSection 13 is to the effect that:\nNotwithstanding the provisions of sections 9, 10, 11 and 12 of this Act, the clauses of an individual hire of work contract, when they are to the advantage of the employee, shall be effective, unless expressly forbidden by the provisions of the decree. It is obvious that by these imperative and unequivocal texts, the legislature intended to bind not only the signators to the agreement, but also all employees and employers who are engaged in a similar trade or business. It is as a consequence of the legal extension conferred by the decree that all those performing work of the same nature or kind become subject to its provisions. It is furthermore a law of public order, which stipulates in clear terms that the provisions of the decree respecting hours of labour and wages, in a given undertaking, are obligatory, thus rendering null and void all agreements violating or coming in conflict with its dispositions.\nThe law invoked by the respondent, and under which a contract was passed on the 26th of September, 1939, with an association of its employees, is found in the Revised Statutes of the province of Quebec, 1941, c. 162, under the heading: An Act Respecting Professional Syndicates. It authorizes twenty persons or more, engaged in the same profession or in similar trades, to form an association or professional syndicate, the incorporation of which may be authorized by the Provincial Secretary, and if so, notice is given in the Official Gazette. These professional syndicates may appear before the courts, and among other powers conferred upon them by law, they may enter into contracts or agreements with all other syndicates, societies, undertakings, respecting the attainment of their objects, and particularly such as relate to the collective conditions of labour.\nThis law defines a collective labour agreement as being a contract respecting labour conditions, made between the representatives of a professional syndicate, or of a union, or of a federation of syndicates, on the one hand, and one or more employers, or representatives of a syndicate, union or federation of syndicates or employers, on the other hand. Any agreement respecting the conditions of labour not prohibited by law, may form the object of a collective labour agreement.\nAre bound by the agreement, the employers and employees who sign it, as well as those who at the time it is signed are members of a syndicate party to the agreement, unless they resign from such syndicate within eight days after the agreement has been deposited with the Minister of Labour. Are also bound, those who are members of a group which later joins in the agreement, and those who, after the deposit of the agreement, join a group which was a party to it.\nThe clear object of this law was undoubtedly to enable the working classes to deal collectively with their employers. Before its enactment, all labour agreements were individual, and the economic inequality existing between the contracting parties did not permit the employees to discuss the conditions of their employment, nor the salary to which they were entitled, on an equal footing. The law now gives the employees an undisputable improved standing, in allowing them to thus deal collectively, and in giving them the right to appear as a legal body before the courts in order to enforce their rights. In addition to these advantages flowing from the right to organize as a syndicate, the law grants no further rights.\nThe agreement becomes the law of the parties only, and no further advantages are derived from these agreements, than from those entered into between ordinary corporations or individuals. The underlying principle of the law is to allow the labour classes to organize so that they may act collectively.\nA further step was made later with the enactment of the Collective Labour Agreement Act, which recognized the labour agreements, and further declared, which was the essential feature of the law, that not only the signators to the agreement would be bound to it, but also all those exercising in a given region a similar trade. The scope of the collective agreements was thus considerably extended, and even the dissenting employees and employers were bound by the decree. Any person violating such decree or any of its regulations made obligatory, or any provisions of the Act, declared to be of public order, committed an unlawful act, and was made liable to fine and imprisonment.\nI do not think that the respondent can escape the application of this law, by invoking its alleged contract with the mise-en-cause. The Collective Labour Agreement Act applies to every one engaged in a similar trade and, specifically forbids to stipulate a wage below that fixed by the decree. Any stipulation to that effect is null and void. At the time this decree became obligatory, only the clauses of an individual hire of work, when to the advantage of the employee, were effective, unless expressly forbidden by the decree, and this case does not arise here. The law was amended in 1940, and now, section 13 of the statutes of 1941 reads:\nUnless expressly forbidden by the provisions of the decree, the clauses of a lease and hire of work shall be valid and lawful, notwithstanding the provisions of the above sections 9, 10, 11 and 12, in so far as they provide in favour of the employee a higher monetary remuneration in currency or more extended compensation or benefits than those fixed by the decree.\nEven if this section applied to the present case, it could not be invoked by the defendant, for an examination of the contract with the mise-en-cause reveals clearly that the conditions of the decree are more advantageous to the employees than those found in the private agreement.\nThe power conferred upon the contracting parties in the Professional Syndicates' Act is to enter into an agreement which is not prohibited by law. I cannot but come to the conclusion, that the parties in stipulating the wages and hours of labour, that appear in the impugned contract, violated the Collective Labour Agreement Act, and such agreement is therefore null and void.\nIt would be to my mind most extraordinary, that the dispositions of the Collective Labour Agreement Act could be eluded under the pretext raised in the present case. If so, the law would be defeated, and this far-reaching social legislation would indeed be a dead letter in the statutes. If an employer, obviously bound by the decree, may withdraw, and by a unilateral act cease to be affected by its dispositions, all the other parties would clearly have the same rights, thus rendering the law inoperative. By enacting this law, the legislature clearly intended that all the employees of a same category would receive a similar monetary remuneration, and be submitted to like labour conditions. It also intended that the employers, respecting the agreement and paying fair wages, be not put in a constant state of financial instability, by being subject to the disloyal competition of other dissenting employers, who refuse to be parties to the agreement, or who withdraw after having been bound by it. Of course, this conclusion must not be interpreted as meaning that the provisions of the Professional Syndicates' Act are in any way repealed. Both laws coexist, and professional syndicates may enter into labour agreements with their employers under the condition, however, that their terms do not conflict with the existing law. The private agreements made under Professional Syndicates' Act between employers and employees, must necessarily yield to the imperative provisions of the Collective Labour Agreement Act, in the territory covered by the decree.\nThe authorization granted to a group of men to act collectively and to deal in a more efficient way with their employers, surely does not include the privilege of violating the dispositions of an existing law. The contracts they are authorized to pass must necessarily comply with the labour laws of the province, and particularly with section 21 of the Professional Syndicates' Act, which says that the conditions of the labour agreement must not be prohibited by law.\nAs to the regions where no decree applies, or where no contract has been entered into under the Professional Syndicates' Act, then, the conditions of labour are determined by a Commission appointed under what was formerly The Fair Wage Act, now known as The Minimum Wage Act. The order of the Commission cannot affect the decree, if one should exist in the locality, but, it does affect the dispositions of a professional syndicate contract, if, the Commission, by a resolution approved by the Minister of Labour, declares that said agreement is less advantageous to the employees than the order itself.\nAs we have seen, in the Court of King's Bench, the appeal of the present respondent was allowed, but for different reasons.\nMr. Justice Galipeault and Mr. Justice St-Germain, held that the special collective labour agreement, between the respondent and the mise-en-cause, was valid and that, therefore, the defendant was not subject to the decree. I have dealt with this point, and I will now examine the reasons given by the other judges of the Court.\nMr. Justice St-Jacques was of the opinion that, if the dispositions of the agreement are null ab initio as contrary to a law of public order, an action does not lie to have a declaration to that effect, and that a judgment would then merely amount to a theorical declaration. He further held that an injunction, being an accessory to a principal action, cannot stand alone, when the action fails.\nWith deference, I have come to the conclusion that, in this case, the plaintiff was entitled to ask and obtain such declaration of nullity. In order to avoid the effect of the decree, the respondent alleged its contract with the mise-en-cause, and claimed that it superseded the general law. This obstacle had obviously to be removed, and nothing but a declaration of the Court, to the effect that this contract was null and void, could serve the purposes of the appellant. All its other claims, injunction and damages were subordinated to the legality or illegality of this contract, and the pronouncement that it is illegal, paved the way for the other remedies that it claimed. How could the injunction be declared permanent, and damages awarded, without this declaration of nullity?\nIt is of frequent occurrence that our courts make such pronouncements, as for instance in cases of nullity of marriage, or nullity of by-laws or resolutions passed by municipal corporations, and which are declared to be ultra vires. And if any authority is needed for this proposition, one may refer to Donohue Bros. v. Corporation de la Malbaie[2], where an action was brought by the appellants to have a valuation roll declared null and void, and to the more recent case of Rodier et al v. Les Cur\u00e9 et Marguilliers de l'Oeuvre et Fabrique de la Paroisse de Ste-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne[3], where the Court of King's Bench declared null an assessment made by trustees.\nMr. Justice Marchand thought that the judgment of the trial judge is not susceptible of execution, and further that the injunction granted is a mandatory injunction, which is unknown to the Code of Civil Procedure. The trial judge said:\nLa Cour d\u00e9clare ill\u00e9gal, irr\u00e9gulier et nul, et elle annule \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit, l'accord de travail intervenu entre la d\u00e9fenderesse et la mise-en-cause le 25 septembre 1939; quant \u00e0 toutes celles de ses stipulations qui sont incompatibles avec les dispositions du d\u00e9cret relatif aux m\u00e9tiers de l'imprimerie.\nThe respondent is not engaged only in the trade of printing, but is interested also in other trades, which are in no way affected by the decree, which covers only printers and other allied industries mentioned in the decree. The judgment of the trial judge amounts merely to a declaration, that the contract entered into between the respondent and the mise-en-cause is severable, and must be considered as inexistent only its dispositions relating to printers. I do not think that it can be said that this judgment lacks the sufficient precision necessary to make it susceptible of execution.\nAs to the objection that the injunction is mandatory, it is I think useful to refer, first of all, to the injunction itself, which says:\nA la requ\u00eate de ladite requ\u00e9rante, le Comit\u00e9 Paritaire de l'Industrie de l'Imprimerie de Montr\u00e9al et du district, nous, soussign\u00e9, juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, si\u00e9geant pour ledit district d'Iberville, commandons et enjoignons sous les peines que de droit \u00e0 vous, dite Dominion Blank Note Book Company Limited, et \u00e0 vos officiers, repr\u00e9sentants et employ\u00e9s, de ne pas commettre, cesser, sous toutes peines que de droit, jusqu'\u00e0 l'expiration du d\u00e9cret relatif aux m\u00e9tiers de l'imprimerie, de refuser l'acc\u00e8s de l'\u00e9tablissement, des livres et des employ\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9e aux inspecteurs de la requ\u00e9rante, et de mettre obstacle, de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit, \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution par les inspecteurs de la requ\u00e9rante des pouvoirs, droits, devoirs et privil\u00e8ges de la requ\u00e9rante, jusqu'\u00e0 ordonnance contraire.\nThe order given to the respondent is \"to cease\" to refuse to the inspectors, access to the establishment, books, etc., and to cease also to prevent in any way whatever the inspectors from fulfilling their duties, and exercising their rights and privileges. Before this injunction was issued, the respondent, through its officers and employees, had clearly refused access to the inspectors in its manufacture. That was the act complained of. The injunction enjoins the respondent to refrain from this specified act, and to suspend all operations which may hinder the fulfilment of the inspectors' duties. This is in accordance with section 964 of the Code of Civil Procedure which reads:\nThe injunction consists of an order enjoining the opposite party, his servants, agents and employees, to refrain from a specified act or to suspend all acts and operations respecting the matters in controversy under pain of all legal penalties.\nAnd any person, against whom such an injunction is directed, who contravenes its commands, is liable to a fine not exceeding $2,000, without prejudice to the right of the party aggrieved, to recover damages. I think, therefore, that this judgment of the learned trial judge is susceptible of execution, that it is not affected by the alleged vagueness, reproached by Mr. Justice Marchand, and that the terms of the injunction are in conformity with the Code of Civil Procedure.\nMr. Justice Barclay came to the conclusion that the agreement was null, and on that point he shared the opinion of the trial judge. He, however, thought that the record should be sent back to the Superior Court for re-adjudication, because one cannot find in the judgment sufficient precision to permit of its execution. What I have said in dealing with Mr. Justice Marchand's reasons need not be repeated here, and are sufficient to show that I cannot share the opinion of the learned judge on this point.\nThe last argument submitted by the respondent is that it is not subject to the decree, because it exercises none of the trades contemplated by it. In the alternative, the respondent claims also that even if it exercised the trades covered by the decree, the latter still would not be applicable for the printing operations of the respondent do not constitute its principal business.\nI unhesitatingly come to the conclusion that the respondent is engaged in printing operations, and that the contention of the respondent that its employees are not in the trade, but are mere operators requiring very little training, because of the perfection of its modern machinery, is inadmissible. I fully agree with Mr. Justice Barclay who expressed his views as follows:\nThe appellant company maintains and attempted to prove that no \"m\u00e9tier d'imprimerie\" is exercised in its plant because its employees work on machinery so modern and so perfect that the operators do not need to be \"hommes de m\u00e9tier\" to do their work, that in fact any person can in practically no time learn to do the work and if they did this work and nothing else for years they would never become \"hommes de m\u00e9tier\". The answer to that contention is that the decree applies to the industry of printing; that is the trade contemplated or vis\u00e9. It is not the manner in which the printing is done nor the qualification of the operator which is contemplated at all; it is the industry as such which is contemplated. In its ordinary sense, the word \"m\u00e9tier\" means \"toute profession manuelle ou m\u00e9canique\", or \"ce que l'on fait habituellement\". When, therefore, the decree refers to \"all persons engaged in the production of printing\", the fact that a person so engaged has not all the qualifications he might have is of no consequence in this particular issue. As a matter of fact, the appellant had in its employ one or more employees who were \"hommes de m\u00e9tier\", within the restricted meaning which it seeks to give to this term. The only question of importance is whether in fact the appellant company is \"engaged in the production of printing\", and the answer to that question is clearly in the affirmative. The learned trial judge so finds, and in his elaborate judgment he gives his reason for so finding and the evidence on which he bases that reason, and I can find no error in his conclusion.\nAs to the other submission that the decree does not apply because printing is not the principal business of the defendant, I find the short answer in paragraph 1 (a) of section 1 of the decree itself which reads as follows:\nAll persons engaged in the production of printing * * * whether in religious institutions, trade plants, private, industrial, commercial or any other establishment, and whether such operations constitute its principal business or are accessory to some other business or enterprise.\nOn the whole, I have reached the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed, and the judgment of the trial judge restored with costs to the appellant against the respondent in the Superior Court and in the Court of King's Bench. The appellant will have its cost of the appeal to' this Court against both the respondent and the mise-en-cause.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Slattery, B\u00e9langer & Par\u00e9.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Ivan Sabourin.\nSolicitor for the mise-en-cause: Alcide C\u00f4t\u00e9.\n[1] [1943] S.C.R. 566.\n[2] [1924] S.C.R. 511.\n[3] Q.R.

Respondent was convicted, on a charge kid under the Foreign Exchange Control Order, P.C. 7378, made on December 13, 1940, under and by virtue of the War Measures Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 206), of having, on December 10, 1942, attempted to export fine gold from Canada without a licence from the Foreign Exchange Control Board, and was fined and paid the fine. An information was then laid against him claiming a declaration that the gold be forfeited to the Crown. Thorson J., [1943] Ex. C.R. 193, dismissed the information, holding that, since the prohibition of the export of gold of the kind an question is dealt with by The Gold Export Act, Dom., 1932, c. 33, and regulations made under it, the principle underlying the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant should be applied; that the general term \"property\" as defined in the Foreign Exchange Control Order should be construed as \"silently excluding\" gold of the kind in question; and therefore the provisions of that Order had no application in the case; and, there being no provision for forfeiture of gold in the governing special Act (The Gold Export Act) and the regulations made under it, there was no legal authority for ordering the forfeiture. The Crown appealed.\nThe Foreign Exchange Control Order provides (inter alia) that \"in the event of any conflict between this Order and any law in force in any part of Canada the provisions of this Order shall prevail\"; that mo person shall, without a licence from the Board, export any property from Canada; that \"property\" means and includes \"every kind of property, real and personal, movable and immovable * * *\"; that every person shall be guilty of an offence who attempts to commit an offence under the Order; and for prosecution; and for forfeiture (in addition to any other penalty imposed) of any property which any person attempts to export contrary to the Order.\nThe Gold Export Act gives power to the Governor in Council to prohibit export of gold, whether in the form of coin or bullion, \"except in such cases as may be deemed desirable by the Minister of Finance and under licences to be issued by him: Provided that no such licence shall be issued to other than a Canadian chartered bank or the Bank of Canada\"; and to make regulations; and the Act provides for prosecution and for penalty (which does not include forfeiture of the gold) against any person who whenever a regulation made under the Act is in force, without a licence from the Minister exports or attempts to export gold. A prohibitory regulation was made in 1932., worded like and in conformity with the power given, which regulation was continued in force by orders in council, the last of which, so far as concerned the present appeal, was P.C. 9131, dated November 26, 1941, whereby the regulations of 1932 were continued until December 31, 1942.\nHeld (Rand J. dissenting): The Crown's appeal should be allowed and it should be declared that the fine gold in question be forfeited.\nPer The Chief Justice, and Kerwin and Taschereau JJ.: Even assuming there is a conflict of legislation, the reason of the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant does not apply: the powers conferred respectively by The Gold Export Act and by the War Measures Act (under which the Foreign Exchange Control Order was made) were for different purposes; also The Gold Export Act and the regulations under it affect every one (including respondent, even though he could not have secured a licence thereunder, since a licence was to be issued only to a bank); further, the Foreign Exchange Control Order states explicitly that, in the event of conflict, its provisions are to prevail. In truth there is no conflict; the provisions can stand together; there is no reason why a licence should not be required under the Foreign Exchange Control Order as well as under The Gold Export Act and its regulations where that Act and its regulations are applicable; nor is the conclusion warranted that it was not the intention to embrace within the prohibition and the subjection to forfeiture of the Order an individual such as respondent who, ex hypothesi, would not be able to secure a licence.\nPer Hudson J.: There is no repugnancy between the enactments in question. Two measures were passed for different purposes and were to be enforced through different organs of the Government. There could not properly be implied, from the existence of The Gold Export Act, an intention to exclude fine gold from the comprehensive terms of the Foreign Exchange Control Order.\nPer Rand J. (dissenting): The argument for appellant proceeds on the assumption that the export of gold is on the basis of leave from both the Minister of Finance (under The Gold Export Act) and the Foreign Exchange Control Board (under the Foreign Exchange Control Order), as distinguished from leave only from the Board for other property; but, in relation to respondent, that assumption is false. What The Gold Export Act does is to enable the Govemor-in-Council to prohibit absolutely the exportation of gold, subject only to exportation by a bank acting under a licence from the Minister; but to no one else is that licence available. It is not, then, a situation of export subject to two licences that can stand together. The Foreign Exchange Control Order necessarily contemplates an exportation which, under existing law, is possible; and there cannot be attributed to that Order the issue of a licence to respondent by the Board for an exportation which rests under an absolute prohibition by the terms of another existing law; such a licence would be wholly futile and abortive, and there should not be ascribed to the scope of the Order a subject-matter that would bring about such a result in its application. S. 24 (1) of the Order (prohibiting export without licence) should be held not applicable to a case in which a licence from the Board could never, in any proper sense, have effect, in which, in fact, the issue of such a licence would be ultra vires of the Board. The absence of a licence from the Board is an essential ingredient of an offence under the Order and that presupposes a power to issue it. The Order's entire prohibition is conditioned in licence. The penalty under The Gold Export Act cannot be considered as supplemented, or the offence thereunder duplicated, by an Order, made under other powers and with a different object, When its language is inappropriate and its assumption inapplicable.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of Thorson J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing the appellant's action for an order declaring that certain fine gold which the respondent attempted to export from Canada on or about December 10, 1942, without a licence from the Foreign Exchange Control Board, contrary (so the appellant contended) to ss. 24 (1) and 40 (1) (h) of the Foreign Exchange Control Order, enacted by Order in Council P.C. 7378, dated December 13, 1940, as amended, be forfeited to the Crown. The proceedings were brought under s. 42 (2) of the said Order. The respondent contended that, as the export of gold is the subject-matter of an Act of Parliament dealing specifically with the export of gold, namely, The Gold Export Act, Statutes of Canada, 1932, c. 33, and the regulations made under it, which were in effect on the date of the alleged offence, the export of gold is governed exclusively by the special Act and that the word \"property\" as used in the Foreign Exchange Control Order does not include gold\u2014that commodity having been specially dealt with by The Gold Export Act (which contains no provision for forfeiture). Thorson J. held that, since the prohibition of the export of gold of the kind in question is dealt with by The Gold Export Act and regulations made under it, the principle underlying the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant should be applied; that the general term \"property\" as defined in the Foreign Exchange Control Order should be construed as \"silently excluding\" gold of the kind in question; and therefore the provisions of that Order had no application in the case; and, therefore, there being no provision for forfeiture of gold in the governing special Act (The Gold Export Act) and the regulations made under it, there was no legal authority for ordering the forfeiture.\nR. Forsyth K.C. and W. R. Jackett for the appellant.\nR. B. Law K.C. and S. S. MacInnes for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court dismissing an information by the Minister of Justice of Canada against Lloyd Cameron Williams claiming a declaration that a certain quantity of fine gold be forfeited to His Majesty the King. The facts are not in dispute. Williams resided in Fort Erie, Ontario, and was an employee of The Williams Gold Refining Company of Canada, Limited, which carried on business there. On or about December 10th, 1942, Williams presented himself at the customs port of Fort Erie and attempted to export from Canada 46 oz., 19 dwt., 10 gr., of fine gold, valued at approximately $1,808, without a licence from the Foreign Exchange Control Board. The gold was seized and detained by an inspector of the Board. Williams was charged under the Foreign Exchange Control Order of December 13th, 1940, with the offence of attempting to export the gold from Canada without a licence from the Board. He was convicted and fined $1,250 and costs, which he paid, and the information followed.\nThe Board was established by the Foreign Exchange Control Order, made and promulgated by an Order in Council P.C. 2716 of September 15th, 1939, under and by virtue of the provisions of the War Measures Act, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 206. That Act was first enacted in 1914. A proclamation was duly issued thereunder as to the existence of the present state of war, and the provisions of sections 3, 4 and 5 thereof came into force in 1939. The Foreign Exchange Control Order of 1939 and amendments were consolidated by Order in Council P.C. 7378 on December 13th, 1940. No question is raised as to this Order or as to the War Measures Act and a mere recital of the applicable provisions of the statute and Order is sufficient to show that, prima facie, the declaration asked by the Minister of Justice should be granted.\nSection 3 of the Act authorizes the Governor in Council to make the Order, paragraph 1 whereof states:\n1. (1) These provisions may be cited as the Foreign Exchange Control Order and shall have effect on and after December 16, 1940. In the event of any conflict between this Order and any law in force in any part of Canada the provisions of this Order shall prevail.\nParagraph (1) of clause 24 provides:\n24. (1) No person shall, without a licence from the Board, export any property from Canada or import any property into Canada.\n\"Property\" is defined by clause 2 (1) (t) as follows:\n(t) \"Property\" means and includes every kind of property, real and personal, movable and immovable, and in the case of any property which, under these regulations, is subject to any restriction as to its use or as to dealing therewith or is subject to forfeiture, the same shall be deemed to include any property into which the property subject to restriction or forfeiture aforesaid has been converted or exchanged and any property acquired by such conversion or exchange whether immediately or otherwise.\nBy clause 40:\n40 (1) Every person shall be guilty of an offence who\n***\n(h) attempts to commit, or does any act preparatory to the commission of, an offence under this Order.\nClause 42 provides for the prosecution of a person charged with an offence under the Order, and also for the forfeiture, inter alia, of any property which any person attempts to export from Canada contrary to the Order.\nSection 4 of the War Measures Act provides that the Governor in Council may prescribe the penalties to be imposed for violations of orders made under the Act, with a limitation as to the maximum fine and imprisonment. It might also be noted in passing that, while section 8 provides for the forfeiture of any goods, wares or merchandise dealt with contrary to any order under the Act, the claim for the declaration of forfeiture in this case is made under the Foreign Exchange Control Order. However, it was not contended on behalf of the respondent that if that Order applied, judgment should not go as asked by the appellant. What was urged, both before the Exchequer Court and this Court, was that a Dominion statute of 1932, known as The Gold Export Act, as amended, and the regulations made under it, were in force at the date of the offence and that, in view of their provisions, the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant applied so as to render inapplicable the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Control Order. The President of the Exchequer Court agreed with that submission and on that ground dismissed the information.\nIn construing statutes and orders in council, the courts have, from time to time, adopted particularized rules and maxims but these must not be used in such a manner as to lose sight of the fundamental object, which is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of Parliament and the Governor in Council. The particular maxim relied upon has been discussed in many judgments, two of which are referred to by the learned President, City of Vancouver v. Bailey[2], and Barker v. Edger[3]. In addition to these, counsel for the respondent referred to the judgment of the House of Lords in Seward v. The Owner of the \"Vera Cruz\"[4]\u2014also cited in the appellant's factum.\nBefore discussing these, an earlier decision of the House of Lords in Garnett v. Bradley[5] should be noted,\u2014not only because of the result arrived at but also because of the reasons of Lord Blackburn, who sat in that case as well as in the subsequent one of the Vera Cruz4. What was decided in Garnett v. Bradley5 was that an Order made under the authority of the Judicature Act of 1875, and which Order was made part of the Act by virtue of a section thereof, repealed the Statute of 21 Jac. I, chapter 16, so far as the action for slander was concerned. By the Judicature Act it was declared that all statutes inconsistent therewith were to be repealed but, as Lord Blackburn pointed out at page 965:\nAn Act saying that all statutes inconsistent with itself shall be repealed, really goes no farther than the general law, but it becomes a question, upon which there is a vast quantity of authority in different ways, as to what shall be the inconsistency which shall cause the repeal of an earlier statute or an existing general rule.\nHe was there dealing with a prior general statute and on that basis concluded that the two provisions, so far as concerned the costs in an action for slander, were absolutely inconsistent. He proceeded to state that he should not entertain any doubt on the point but that there was another rule which he thought was a good rule, if properly applied, and then gave the substance of the maxim at present under consideration. At page 970 he continued:\nThat it should be taken that the object of the Legislature is not, by mere general words, to repeal special laws, is a perfectly true, good, and sound canon of construction, and if this was a case of special laws giving a privilege, or a property, or a right, to a particular class, the canon would be applicable, but it is not applicable when that special law affected every one of Her Majesty's subjects, just in the same way as the general Statute of Gloucester, giving costs to all persons who were Plaintiffs who recovered damages in a real action, applied to all His Majesty's subjects, and not to any particular class. I think, therefore, that the reason of the rule does not apply in this case.\nIn the Seward case[6], the actual decision was that the Admiralty Court Act, 1861, which by section 7 gave the Court of Admiralty \"jurisdiction over any claim for damage done by any ship\", did not give jurisdiction over claims for damage for loss of life under Lord Campbell's Act. It was in the course of coming to such a conclusion that Lord Chancellor Selborne stated at page 68:\nNow if anything be certain it is this, that where there are general words in a later Act capable of reasonable and sensible application without extending them to subjects specially dealt with by earlier legislation, you are not to hold that earlier and special legislation indirectly repealed, altered, or derogated from merely by force of such general words, without any indication of a particular intention to do so.\nand that Lord Blackburn observed, at page 72:\nThe legislature in using such general words as those [damage done by any ship] cannot have had in contemplation all the numerous and important subjects which, had they been considering Lord Campbell's Act, they would have had.\nIn Barker v. Edger[7], the Privy Council found the case\na peculiarly strong one for the application of the general maxim. The Legislature found an area of land comparatively small in extent to be the subject of intricate disputes in which both Europeans and natives took part. Some of those questions fell within the scope of the Native Land Court and others did not. It was for the benefit of all parties that a single tribunal should adjudicate on the whole group of questions. Therefore, as Williams J. has stated, a new authority was given to the Native Land Court as regards both land and matters of account. It would require a very clear expression of the mind of the Legislature before we should impute to it the intention of destroying the foundation of the work which it had initiated some four years before, and to which the Court has ever since been assiduously addressing itself.\nI think it will be found upon examination that the Vancouver case[8] also was \"a peculiarly strong one for the application of the general maxim\".\nA word might be added as to the quotation from the 8th edition of Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes at page 156, the conclusion of which is: \"In the absence of these conditions, the general statute is read as silently excluding from its operation the cases which have been provided for by the special one.\" It should be noted that one of these conditions appears in the last leg of the previous sentence,\u2014\"or (unless) there be something in the nature of the general one making it unlikely that an exception was intended as regards the special Act\". Bearing in mind the considerations to be applied, we might now turn to The Gold Export Act and the regulations thereunder. The Act, as amended in 1935, reads as follows:\nHis Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:\n1. This Act may be cited as The Gold Export Act.\n2. The Governor in Council may prohibit, from time to time and for any period or periods, the export of gold, whether in the form of coin or bullion, from the Dominion of Canada, except in such cases as may be deemed desirable by the Minister of Finance and under licences to be issued by him: Provided that no such licence shall be issued to other than a Canadian chartered bank or the Bank of Canada.\n3. (1) The Governor in Council may make such regulations as he deems necessary or expedient to ensure the carrying out of the provisions and the intent of this Act, and to define from time to time as occasion may require what shall be deemed to be included within the expression \"bullion\" for the purposes of this Act.\n(2) Every regulation made by the Governor in Council in virtue of this Act shall have force and effect only after it has been published in the Canada Gazette.\n4. Whenever a regulation made under the provisions of section three of this Act is in force any person who, without a licence issued by or on behalf of the Minister of Finance, as aforesaid, exports or attempts to export, carries or attempts to carry out of Canada any gold, whether in the form of coin or bullion, shall be liable upon summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or to both fine and imprisonment.\nThe first regulations were adopted by Order in Council P.C. 1150, dated May 17th, 1932, whereby:\n1. The export of gold, whether in the form of coin or bullion, from the Dominion of Canada, is hereby prohibited, except in such cases as may be deemed desirable by the Minister of Finance, and under licences to be issued by him. No such licence shall be issued to other than a Canadian chartered bank.\nProvision was also made for the form of the licences and for instructions to be given to various officers. The regulations were continued in force from year to year by orders in council, the last one of which, so far as concerns this appeal, was P.C. 9131, dated November 26th, 1941, whereby it was provided that the regulations of May 17th, 1932, should be continued in force and effect until December 31st, 1942.\nI think it can make no difference that this last order in council under The Gold Export Act was passed subsequent to the Foreign Exchange Control Order of 1940. What the Order in Council of 1941 was doing was continuing in force the provisions of the 1932 regulations. If there were any conflict between the 1932 regulations and the Foreign Exchange Control Order, I would treat it as one between a general enactment and a prior special enactment. The Gold Export Act and the earlier regulations passed under it were peacetime measures, although it was thought advisable to continue the regulations in time of war. The authority under the War Measures Act may be exercised in time of war only. The powers conferred are for different purposes and that a more serious view is taken of an infraction of the Foreign Exchange Control Order than of the Gold Export Regulations is shown by the fact that the maximum fine and imprisonment imposable under the former are greater than under the latter, and that it is only under the former that a declaration of forfeiture may be made. The Gold Export Act Regulations affect every one, including the respondent, even though he could not have secured a licence thereunder since the latter was by the Act and regulations to be issued only to a bank. If one assumes a conflict, I would say that the reason of the maxim does not apply.\nIn truth there is no conflict. The proper approach to the determination of conflict or no conflict is set forth by Lord Halsbury in Tabernacle Permanent Building Society v. Knight[9], and by Duff and Anglin JJ., as they then were, in Toronto Railway Company v. Paget[10].\nIn the former case Lord Halsbury stated that the two Acts there under review might \"stand together and both operate without either interfering with the other\" and that, therefore, there was no inconsistency or conflict. In the latter case, by section 5 of the Ontario Railway Act of 1906, the provisions of the statute were to apply to every railway company incorporated under a special Act \"but, where the provisions of the special Act and the provisions of this Act are inconsistent, the special Act shall be taken to override the provisions of this Act, so far as is necessary to give effect to such special Act\". By another section of the Railway Act a passenger on a railway train or car who refused to pay his fare might be ejected by the conductor, but by a section of the Toronto Railway Company's Special Act, a passenger, in such circumstances, was liable to a fine only.\nAt page 491 of the report, Duff J. stated:\nThere seem to be two possible views of the effect of section 5 of the \"Railway Act of Ontario\" where you have a provision in that Act and a provision in a prior special Act dealing with the same subject-matter an diverse ways. One possible view is that in such cases the provision in the general Act is to be wholly discarded from consideration; the other is that both provisions are to be read as applicable to the undertaking governed by the special Act so far as they can stand together, and only where there is repugnancy between the two provisions and then only to the extent of such repugnancy the general Act is to be inoperative.\nAt page 499, Anglin J. said:\nIt is not enough to exclude the application of the general Act that it deals somewhat differently with the same subject-matter. It is not \"inconsistent\" unless the two provisions cannot stand together.\nThese two cases are referred to by the present Chief Justice of this Court in City of Ottawa v. Town of Eastview[11].\nI am unable to convince myself that there is any reason why a licence should not be required under the Foreign Exchange Control Order as well as under The Gold Export Act and its regulations where the latter Act and regulations are applicable. Nor can I conclude that it was not the intention of the Governor in Council to embrace within the prohibition and the subjection to forfeiture of the Foreign Exchange Control Order an individual such as the respondent who, ex hypothesi, would not be able to secure a licence under the Order. Paragraph (1) of the Foreign Exchange Control Order has already been quoted but the last sentence might be repeated: \"In the event of any conflict between this Order and any law in force in any part of Canada the provisions of this Order shall prevail.\" I have already expressed the view that no conflict arises but, even if it does, The Gold Export Act and its regulations comprise a law in force in Canada, and the Order states explicitly that its provisions are to prevail.\nThere remains only to be added that it can make no difference even if the Order in Council of November 26th, 1941, under The Gold Export Act, continuing in force and effect until December 31st, 1942, the regulations of May 17th, 1932, be considered as a law enacted subsequent to the Foreign Exchange Control Order of 1940. This is quite different from a provision such as the one to which Lord Blackburn referred, that all statutes inconsistent with an Act shall be repealed, and I can find no reason why the words in the Foreign Exchange Control Order, \"any law in force in any part of Canada\", should be restricted to something anterior.\nI would allow the appeal and grant an order declaring that the 46 oz., 19 dwt., 10 gr., of fine gold which the respondent attempted to export from Canada on or about December 10th, 1942, be forfeited to His Majesty the King, with costs throughout.\nHudson J.\u2014Williams, the respondent, attempted to take a quantity of fine gold out of Canada without having first obtained a licence so to do from the Foreign Exchange Control Board. He was stopped at the border, the gold was seized and he was prosecuted for breach of the order of the Board prohibiting such export. He pleaded guilty, was fined and paid his fine. Thereupon, the Attorney-General for Canada laid an Information in the Exchequer Court, claiming a declaration that the gold above referred to should be forfeited to the Crown. The learned President of the Exchequer Court dismissed this application with costs, and from his decision this appeal is brought.\nThe Foreign Exchange Control Board was created under the War Measures Act and no question arises as to its powers. All that is here involved is the interpretation of the Board's order, that is, whether it extends to gold or not. The material provisions of the order are as follows:\n24. (1) No person, shall, without a licence from the Board, export any property from Canada or import any property into Canada.\n40. (1) Every person shall be guilty of an offence who * * *\n(h) attempts to commit, or does any act preparatory to the commission of, an offence under this Order.\n42. (2) Any currency, securities, foreign exchange, goods or property of any kind which any person exports or attempts to export from Canada or imports or attempts to import into Canada contrary to this Order, or which any person buys or sells or an any way deals with or attempts to buy or sell or in any way deal with contrary to this Order, or which any person fails to declare as required by this Order, may (in addition to any other penalty which may have been imposed on any person, or to which any person may be subject, with relation to such unlawful act or omission, and whether any prosecution in relation thereto has been commenced or not) be seized and detained and shall be liable to forfeiture at the instance of the Minister of Justice upon proceedings in the Exchequer Court of Canada or in any Superior Court subject, however, to a right of compensation on the part of any innocent person interested in such property at the time it became liable to forfeiture or who acquired an interest therein subsequent to such time as a bona fide transferee for value without notice, which right may be enforced in the same manner as any other right against His Majesty.\nClause 2, paragraph (t), defines the word \"property\" as follows:\n(t) \"Property\" means and includes every kind of property, real and personal, movable and immovable, and in the case of any property which, under these regulations, is subject to any restriction as to its use or as to dealing therewith or is subject to forfeiture, the same shall be deemed to include any property into which the property subject to restriction or forfeiture aforesaid has been converted or exchanged and any property acquired by such conversion or exchange whether immediately or otherwise.\nClearly gold would fall within the definition of the word \"property\".\nThe respondent contends, however, that by reason of the provisions of The Gold Export Act and the Order in Council made thereunder dealing with the export of gold coin and bullion, the word \"property\" in the Foreign Exchange Control Order should be read as excluding gold. This contention was upheld by the learned President.\nThe Gold Export Act is chapter 33 of the Statutes of Canada, 1932. It provides:\n2. The Governor in Council may prohibit, from time to time and for any period or periods, the export of gold, whether in the form of coin or bullion, from the Dominion of Canada, except in such cases as may be deemed desirable by the Minister of Finance and under licences to be issued by him: Provided that no such licence shall be issued to other than a Canadian chartered bank [An amendment in 1935 (c. 21) added \"or the Bank of Canada\"].\n3. (1) The Governor in Council may make such regulations as he deems necessary or expedient to ensure the carrying out of the provisions and the intent of this Act, and to define from time to time as occasion may require what shall be deemed to be included within the expression \"bullion\" for the purposes of this Act.\n(2) Every regulation made by the Governor in Council in virtue of this Act shall have force and effect only after it has been published in the Canada Gazette.\n4. Whenever a regulation made under the provisions of section three of this Act is in force any person who, without a licence issued by or on behalf of the Minister of Finance, as aforesaid, exports or attempts to export, carries or attempts to carry out of Canada any gold, whether in the form of coin or bullion, shall be liable upon summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or to both fine and imprisonment. Under the authority of this Act an Order in Council was enacted on the 17th May, 1932, providing that the export of gold in the form of coin or bullion from the Dominion of Canada\nis hereby prohibited, except in such cases as may be deemed desirable by the Minister of Finance and under licences to be issued by him. No such licence shall be issued to other than a Canadian chartered bank.\nBy Order in Council dated 26th November, 1941, the provisions were continued until December 31st, 1942.\nThis Act was passed in peace time with the object of maintaining the status of Canadian currency during the then world-wide financial depression.\nIt appears from the language of the last-mentioned Act and the orders made thereunder that the respondent might have been convicted and punished for an offence thereunder. This does not in itself mean that he might not be convicted on the same facts under some other law. Such a situation arises not infrequently and has been recognized by Parliament and the possibility of the imposition of both penalties guarded against by the Criminal Code, section 15, which follows earlier English legislation to the same effect.\nWhat must be decided here is whether it should be implied from the existence of the provisions of The Gold Export Act that the Governor in Council in passing the Foreign Exchange Control Order intended to exclude fine gold from its provisions. The maxim generalia specialibus non derogant is relied on as a rule which should dispose of the question, but the maxim is not a rule of law but a rule of construction and bows to the intention of the legislature, if such intention can reasonably be gathered from all of the relevant legislation.\nIn 31 Halsbury, at page 526, para. 687, it is stated:\nWhere in the same or a subsequent statute a particular enactment is followed by a general enactment, and the latter, taken in its most comprehensive sense, would overrule the former, the particular enactment is operative, and the general enactment is taken to affect only those other parts of the particular enactment to which it may properly apply; * * * The earlier and the later, whether custom or statute, must be reconciled if possible, though an intention to the contrary, if manifest, is operative.\n688. A statute giving a new remedy does not of itself, and necessarily, destroy previously existing rights and remedies to which it does not refer. It may, however, appear from the statute that Parliament did not intend the two rights to exist together. There is a full discussion of the maxim in the judgments delivered by this Court in the case of Toronto Railway Company v. Paget[12]. It was there held that in the case of two such enactments, only where there is repugnancy between them, and then only to the extent of such repugnancy, is the general Act inoperative.\nIn the present case there is no repugnancy. Two measures were passed for different purposes and are to be enforced through different organs of the Government. The Foreign Exchange Control Order is very comprehensive, covering the whole field of currency, securities and commodities. I do not think that the Court could properly imply an intention to exclude from \"currency\" gold coins and from \"commodities\" fine gold, which nominally determines the value of all currency and monetary obligations.\nIt is difficult to imagine the Foreign Exchange Control Board issuing a licence to export gold but, if by some mischance, such licence were issued, it would not in itself supply a defence to a prosecution under The Gold Export Act.\nI conclude that the Crown is entitled to the relief asked for in the Information and would allow the appeal with costs.\nRand J. (dissenting).\u2014In this case an information was filed in the Exchequer Court by the Attorney-General of Canada against the respondent for a declaration of forfeiture of certain fine gold which the respondent was charged with having attempted to export from Canada without a licence from The Foreign Exchange Control Board. The proceedings were based upon the provisions of an order in council dated December 13th, 1940, section 24 (1) of which provided that:\nNo person shall, without a licence from the Board, export any property from Canada or import any property into Canada.\nBy section 40 (1) an attempt to export likewise became an offence; and under section 42 (2) the property was liable to forfeiture.\nIf this order had stood alone, there would be no question of the validity of the proceedings now before us. There was in effect at the same time, however, an order in council under The Gold Export Act enacted in 1932 by which the export of gold, except by a chartered bank or by The Bank of Canada acting under a licence issued by the Minister of Finance, was prohibited. The original order under this Act was passed on May 17th, 1932, and by subsequent orders, the last of which was published in the Canada Gazette on December 6th, 1941, the prohibition was continued to the end of 1942. The act with which the respondent is charged took place on December 10th, 1942, and was, therefore, within the period of that prohibition.\nThe President of the Exchequer Court held that the rule generalia specialibus non derogant applied, that the Exchange Control order was general legislation and that there was nothing in it to indicate that it was to override or supersede the order under The Gold Export Act. He, therefore, dismissed the information and the Attorney-General now appeals.\nThere is no doubt that the two orders have different objects in view. The Gold Export Act is peace-time legislation which has as its purpose the management of gold in relation to the country's currency and international settlements. The Exchange Control order is a temporary war measure to ensure the receipt in Canada of the value of Canadian products and services and to control, in the interest of Canadian requirements, the export and import of capital in any form. It is, therefore, urged by the Attorney-General that there is no conflict, that in substance the subject-matters are different and that licences under the two orders operate on parallel lines with equal and cumulative validity.\nThis argument in fact proceeds on the assumption that the export of gold is on the basis of leave from both the Minister of Finance under The Gold Export Act and the Exchange Control Board under the Exchange Control order as distinguished from leave only from the Board for other property; but, in relation to the respondent, that assumption is false. What The Gold Export Act does is to enable the Governor-in-Council to prohibit absolutely the exportation of gold, subject only to exportation by a bank acting under a licence from the Minister: but to no one else is that licence available. The question could arise upon an export by a bank under the Minister's licence whether a further licence from the Foreign Exchange Board was necessary; but in no other case would that be so. It is not, then, a situation of export subject to two licences that can stand together.\nFor that reason, I do not think it necessary to resort to the maxim to determine the question presented to us. The order of the Exchange Control Board necessarily contemplates an exportation which, under existing law, is at least possible, or, viewed from another angle, a licence which either absolutely or conditionally is to be effective. It is not suggested that the Exchange Control order has overridden the Gold Export Act order so as to permit, with leave of the Exchange Control Board, the export of gold regardless of the Gold Export Act order, nor would such a position be tenable. But how can we attribute to the Exchange Control order the issue of a licence to the respondent by the Board for an exportation which rests under an absolute prohibition by the terms of another existing law? Such a licence would be wholly futile and abortive and I am unable to ascribe to the scope of the order a subject-matter that would bring about such a result in its application. In my opinion, section 24 (1) of the Exchange Control order does not apply to a case in which a licence from the Board could never, in any proper sense, have effect, in which, in fact, the issue of such a licence would be ultra vires of the Board.\nThe Gold Export Act provides for fine and imprisonment in case of violation but not for forfeiture. The substantial effect of the Exchange Control order would be to add forfeiture to the penalty of that statute. Whether, under the War Measures Act, it might be competent to make that addition, it is unnecessary to determine; for that is neither the purpose nor the purport of the order. If, again, the order by general words prohibited, simpliciter, the export or attempted export of gold under penalty of forfeiture, thus creating a duplication of offence, the question of the applicability of the maxim would arise; but the absence of a licence from the Board is an essential ingredient of an offence under the order and that presupposes a power to issue it. It is not suggested that this information could be supported by an allegation, merely, that the respondent attempted to export gold. The order in no case prohibits export absolutely; its entire prohibition is conditioned in licence. Its general language, therefore, cannot be held to include cases of both absolute and conditional prohibition which might permit us here to treat the reference to the licence as surplusage. We must assume that the penalty provided by the Gold Export Act order was considered ample for the purpose of enforcement but, whether that is so or not, we are not at liberty to treat an order made under other powers and with a different object as either supplementing the penalty or duplicating the offence, when its language is inappropriate and its assumption inapplicable. The appeal, therefore, should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General of Canada: F. P.

So\u2014\"Judicial proceeding\" (ss. 36, 2 (e))\u2014Security on appeal (s. 70)\u2014Not required from Crown in right of a province. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division, [1944] 1 W.W.R. 385, fixing the value of certain property for succession duty purposes at a less sum than the value determined by a commissioner appointed under s. 28 of The Succession Duty Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 57, was held to be a judgment in a \"judicial proceeding\" (within ss. 36 and 2 (e) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 35) ; and a motion to quash an appeal therefrom was dismissed. Sec. 70 of the Supreme Court Act, requiring security on appeal, does not apply to an appeal by or on behalf of the Crown in right of a province; there is no reason to restrict the meaning of the word \"Crown.\" (as used in the excepting provision of s. 70(2)) to the Crown in right of the Dominion.\nMOTION to quash an appeal for want of jurisdiction. The appeal was from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division[1], rendered upon an appeal to it from the report of a commissioner appointed under s. 28 of The Succession Duty Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 57, to determine the value of certain property for succession duty purposes. Under said s. 28 (subss. 8 and 9, and amendment in 1944, c. 29) the Commissioner's report, on being filed in the Supreme Court of Alberta, became a judgment of that Court, and subject to appeal. The commissioner determined the value of the property at $108,300. On appeal, taken by the administrator with will annexed of the estate in question in Alberta, the Appellate Division fixed the value at $65,000 (Harvey C.J.A. and Lunney J.A., dissenting, would have dismissed the appeal). Following this judgment, the Attorney-General of Alberta applied to the Appellate Division for an order for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada and also applied to dispense with security for costs on the ground \"that this is an appeal by or on behalf of the Crown\". The Appellate Division made an order reading as follows:\nUpon the application of counsel for the Attorney-General of the Province of Alberta, and upon hearing read the notice of motion herein, the affidavit of Frederick Claude Blower filed, and upon counsel for the. Respondent admitting that the amount involved in this appeal exceeds the sum of Two thousand dollars, and upon hearing counsel for the Respondent,\nIt is ordered that, in so far as special leave to appeal is necessary and this Court has jurisdiction to grant the Order the Attorney-General of the Province of Alberta do have special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta delivered on the 9th day of February, A.D. 1944, and entered on the 18th day of February, A.D. 1944;\nAnd it is further ordered that the appeal herein of the Attorney-General of the Province of Alberta to the Supreme Court of Canada be allowed without security pursuant to section 70, subsection 2 of the Supreme Court Act, being chapter 35 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927.\nThe respondent now moved to quash the appeal on the grounds that the judgment of the Appellate Division appealed from was not a judgment in a judicial proceeding (within ss. 36 and 2 (e) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 35), and that the appeal was not properly instituted or allowed without the giving of proper security under s. 70 of the Supreme Court Act.\nC. Robinson for the motion.\nE. G. Gowling contra.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The motion to quash for want of jurisdiction should be dismissed with costs. The respondent moved to quash on the following grounds:\n(1) That the judgment of the Appellate Division is not a judgment in a judicial proceeding; and\n(2) That the appeal was not properly allowed without the giving of proper security under section 70 of the Supreme Court Act.\nAs to the first ground. We think the definition of \"judicial proceeding\" in the Supreme Court Act is a sufficient answer. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta did not, in disposing of the appeal, exercise merely a regulative, administrative, or executive jurisdiction, but it determined substantive rights in controversy in the proceeding. (Quebec Railway, Light & Power Co. v. Montcalm Land Co. and the City of Quebec[2].)\nOn the second ground it should be said that there are no words of limitation following the word \"Crown\" in section 70 of the Supreme Court Act. There is no reason to restrict the meaning of that word in section 70 to the Crown in right of the Dominion. We think the appellant is covered and protected by section 70 of the Act.

The appellant claimed that, as between him and the respondent, all of the moneys secured by the said mortgage should be paid by the latter, as administratrix of the estate of the said James Coben Petrie, deceased.\nW. J. Arthur Fair for the appellant.\nJ. W. Pickup K.C. for the respondent. On conclusion of the argument the Court reserved judgment and on a subsequent day delivered judgment dismissing the appeal with costs, Taschereau and Rand JJ. dissenting.\nKerwin J., with whom the Chief Justice concurred, after referring to matters and proceedings in the course of litigation between the parties, including proceedings prior to the judgments now in appeal[3], and after remarking that there was nothing in the mortgage document to indicate the manner in which, as among the mortgagors themselves, the payment was to be made, or whether any one, or more, of them, under any circumstances, would have a right of contribution or indemnity as against any of the others, pointed out as follows:\nThe onus was on the appellant to rebut the presumption that the respondent was entitled to contribution from him. In Boulter v. Peplow[4] Maule J., with whom Williams J. and Talfourd J. agreed, stated that \"prima facie, where one of three joint-contractors who are jointly sued, pays the whole debt, he is entitled to receive contribution from the other two\"; and later: \"There is nothing that I can discover here, to show that these parties did not intend that the ordinary implication should arise in this case\". In the present case, if nothing appeared beyond the fact that Thomas, James and Kenneth executed a mortgage on their respective farms, in which mortgage they jointly and severally covenanted to pay the mortgage moneys, each of the mortgagors should pay one-third. It is true that it is difficult to conceive such a simple case being presented and we find evidence adduced on behalf of the parties to show the relations that existed between them and the circumstances surrounding the giving of the mortgage.\nAfter reviewing and discussing the evidence, he concluded that it had been shown \"that it was never contemplated that James should alone satisfy the mortgage debt but, on the contrary, that as between Thomas and James, the two of them were to pay\" and the appeal should be dismissed.\nHudson J. stated that no question of law was involved; the controversy was upon the facts and the proper inference to be drawn therefrom; the evidence was in some respects inconclusive; the judgments in the two courts below, from which this appeal was taken, had done substantial justice between the parties and the appeal should be dismissed. Rand J., dissenting, with whom Taschereau J. concurred, was of opinion that, on the evidence, a finding that appellant and James, between themselves, actually had in mind that each should bear one-half of the obligation, was quite incompatible with the governing features of the transaction; that an equal distribution of the burden between the two was warranted only on the basis that on the narrow issue of fact there was no preponderance of proof one way or the other; that the trial judge was unduly influenced in his findings by considerations of onus and presumption, and it should not be gathered from his reasons that, if he had taken the question as one purely of fact to be decided as between the deceased James and appellant, he would not have concluded that it was understood that the indebtedness created was, as between them, to be the debt of James only; that, under the circumstances \"that presumption of joint and equal liability, which arises when the weight of fact inclines toward neither of two joint obligors, does not arise, and there was no right in the plaintiff as representing the estate of James to be exonerated from any part of the mortgage\"; and therefore the appeal should be allowed and judgment entered declaring the lands of the defendants to be secondarily liable for the debt secured by the mortgage.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

The plaintiff was a passenger in the said street car. At the trial, the jury found against all the defendants, apportioned the blame, 50 per cent. to the defendants Canadian Breweries Transport Ltd. and Lacey and 50 per cent. to the defendant Toronto Transportation Commission, and assessed the plaintiff\u2019s damages at $2,750; and judgment was given in accordance with those findings, the formal judgment, providing for indemnification as between defendants in case of payment by the Company and Lacey, or by the Commission, of more than one-half of the amount awarded for damages or of the plaintiff\u2019s costs. The defendant Toronto Transportation Commission appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. That Court allowed the appeal (Kellock J.A. dissenting) and ordered that the action as against the Commission be dismissed and that the plaintiff recover against the other defendants the sum of $2,750 and costs. (The jury\u2019s findings and the judgments below are more fully stated in the reasons for judgment infra.) The defendants Canadian Breweries Transport Ltd. and Lacey appealed to this Court, asking that the judgment at trial be restored. Leave to appeal was granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The plaintiff, who was paid his judgment, was not a party to the present appeal.\nF.J. Hughes K.C. and J.W. Thompson K.C. for the appellants.\nI.S. Fairty K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014This is an appeal by special leave of the Court of Appeal for Ontario from a judgment of that Court reversing the judgment of Barlow J., after the trial of the action with a jury. The plaintiff in the action, George Johnson, is not a party to the appeal, as he has been paid the amount of judgment for damages for injuries sustained by him. His action was brought against the Transportation Commission, in one of whose street cars he was a passenger at the time it came into collision with a truck owned by one of the other defendants, Canadian Breweries Transport Limited, and driven by the third defendant, Jack Lacey. No objection is raised to the charge to the jury of the learned trial judge. In answer to questions submitted to them, the jury found that the defendants, the Transport Company and Lacey, had not satisfied them that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were not caused by any negligence on the part of those defendants. This was on the basis of the onus imposed upon these defendants by the Highway Traffic Act. The jury found that the operator of the Commission\u2019s street car was guilty of negligence, causing or contributing to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, in the following respects:\u2014 Being aware of the icy condition of the road and knowing the difficulty of a truck driver to stop owing thereto, the operator was negligent in failing to bring street car to stop before continuing to drive said street car in path of oncoming truck.\nThey also found that the degree of negligence on the part of the defendants was fifty per centum as to the Transport Company and Lacey and fifty per centum as to the Commission. On these findings judgment was rendered in favour of the plaintiff against all defendants for the amount of the damages found by the jury, $2,750, with costs. The judgment also provided that if the Transport Company and Lacey paid more than one-half of this sum, or more than one-half of the plaintiff\u2019s costs, they should be entitled to be indemnified as to such excess by the Commission, with an additional clause in case the excess was paid by the Commission. The only party to appeal from that judgment was the Commission and, as a result, the Court of Appeal varied the judgment by dismissing the action against the Commission, with costs, and giving judgment for the plaintiff against the Transport Company and Lacey for $2,750 with a proviso that the two last named defendants should pay to the plaintiff his costs of the action, including the amount of costs required to be paid by the plaintiff to the Commission. The Court of Appeal further ordered that all the respondents pay to the Commission the latter\u2019s costs of its appeal.\nIn granting leave to the Transport Company and Lacey to appeal to this Court, the Chief Justice of Ontario, speaking for the Court of Appeal, stated that he did not know that the opinion of the majority of the judges who heard the appeal from the judgment of Barlow J., that there was no evidence to establish any cause of action against the Commission, was arrived at on a consideration of the evidence for the plaintiff alone, and that it might be that the whole of the evidence was considered, including that of the driver of the truck. This refers to the fact that at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case a motion for non-suit was made by counsel for the Commission, consideration of which was adjourned until the end of the trial. Evidence was thereafter led on behalf of the Commission. Undoubtedly all of the judges that took part in the hearing of the appeal from Barlow J. were aware of the well-settled rule that in such circumstances the plaintiff is entitled to rely upon any evidence adduced on behalf of the defendant. However, the judgment of Mr. Justice Laidlaw, with whom Mr. Justice Riddell concurred, directs:\u2014\nThe judgment should recite in appropriate form the motion for non-suit made on behalf of the Toronto Transportation Commission, and that no evidence was adduced in support of a finding of negligence on the part of the operator of the street car.\nIt was to these directions that the Chief Justice of Ontario referred when he said that they \u201cseem * * * to approve the adoption of a practice of doubtful propriety in such a case as this\u201d.\nHowever, the question as to \u201cwhether the Transportation Commission could be dismissed from the action until the evidence of the defendant Company had been heard and had been taken into consideration\u201d does not arise in this appeal because the action was not so dismissed. Under these circumstances, this Court is confined to the determination of the question whether there was any evidence in the whole of the case upon which the jury could find as they did with respect to the defendant Commission. Mr. Fairty argued the appeal on that footing and sought to secure a negative answer to the question upon a co-relation of distances and speeds. The result arrived at by such means cannot necessarily prevail against other evidence placed before the jury which they were entitled to consider. I agree with the following passage in the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Kellock:\u2014\nI take the answer of the jury to mean that at or before the motorman passed the point in the intersection, beyond which the street car, if it continued would be in the path of the approaching truck, he should have realized that the truck was not intending to, or could not, stop or slow down sufficiently, in the icy condition then prevailing, to allow the street car to clear in front of it. I am unable to say that it was not open to the jury to take that view.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment at the trial restored. The appellants are entitled to their costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Hughes, Agar, Thompson & Amys.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Irving S. Fairty.\n[1] [1943] O.W.N. 626; [1943] 4 D.L.R. 727.\n"}

By the fourth codicil she bequeathed the amount of money which she might have on deposit in a named bank at her death to her daughter S. \"in full confidence that she will dispose of the same in accordance with the wishes which I have expressed to her\". S. received said amount from the executor of the testatrix and treated it as their own, and died intestate in June, 1940, without having disclosed any \"wishes\" of the testatrix mentioned in the codicil. An action was brought on behalf of the residuary legatees of the testatrix against the administrator of the estate of S., claiming that the bequest to S. was a trust which S. failed to carry out and, in the absence of evidence showing the nature of the trust, the money should go to the residuary legatees.\nHeld: The action failed. The words of the fourth codicil, taken by themselves or read with other provisions of the will and codicils, did not establish a trust; nor did the evidence establish that a trust was created. (Rules as to precatory trusts and secret trusts discussed.) (Judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, [1944] 2 D.L.R, 4, reversed.)\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1] reversing (Doull J. dissenting) the judgment of Archibald J.\nLydia A. Nicoll, late of Clyde River, Nova Scotia, died on or about January 18, 1937. She had made a will and four codicils thereto, all of which were admitted to probate. Her fourth codicil, made in 1936, contained the bequest which gave rise to the present controversy. It read (as follows:\nI give and bequeath the amount of money which I may have on deposit with the Canadian Bank of Commerce at Barrington, Nova Scotia, at the time of my death to my daughter, Ina F. Sutherland, in full confidence that she will dispose of the same in accordance with the wishes which I have expressed to her.\nAt the time of the death of the testatrix there was in the said bank the sum of $2,572.05, which sum was, on the closing of the estate (after the passing of the final accounts) paid by the executor to Mrs. Sutherland. Mrs. Sutherland died intestate on or about June 25, 1940, and administration of her estate was granted to Mr. Hayman, who is the defendant in this action and the present appellant.\nThe action was brought (by the present respondent and another plaintiff who since died) on behalf of the residuary legatees under the will of Lydia A. Nicoll against the administrator of the estate of Mrs. Sutherland, for payment of the said sum to the said residuary legatees, claiming that a trust was imposed upon Mrs. Sutherland in respect of the said sum, that Mrs. Sutherland had refused or neglected to exercise the provisions of the trust and refused to disclose such provisions to the residuary legatees, that Mrs. Sutherland could not take the money for herself, and, in the absence of evidence showing the nature of the trust (it was admitted on behalf of the respondent that the plaintiffs had not succeeded in establishing what were the \"wishes\" mentioned in the codicil), the money fell into the residue of the estate of the testatrix. The defendant (appellant) denied that there was any trust imposed upon Mrs. Sutherland.\nArchibald J. dismissed the action. His judgment was reversed by the Court in banco which held (Doull J. dissenting) that the said sum should go to the residuary legatees. The defendant appealed.\nE. F. Newcombe K.C. for the appellant.\nC. B. Smith K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J. was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014This is an appeal by Gordon Hayman, the administrator of the estate of Ina S. Sutherland, from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, reversing a judgment of Archibald J. The appellant is the defendant in an action brought by Foster Nicoll and Hallet Nicoll on behalf of the residuary legatees of Mrs. Lydia A. Nicoll. Hallet Nicoll died after judgment was given by the trial judge but proceedings were continued by Foster Nicoll in the same representative capacity, and he is now the respondent. The claim is to recover a sum of money on deposit at the Barrington branch of the Canadian Bank of Commerce to the credit of Lydia A. Nicoll at the date of her death.\nMrs. Nicoll died on or about January 18th, 1937, having previously made her last will and testament and four codicils thereto, probate of which will and codicils was duly granted to the Royal Trust Company, the executor named in the will. The fourth codicil is in these terms:\nI give and bequeath the amount of money which I may have on deposit with the Canadian Bank of Commerce at Barrington, Nova Scotia, at the time of my death to my daughter, Ina F. Sutherland, in full confidence that she will dispose of the same in accordance with the wishes which I have expressed to her.\nThe amount in the bank to the credit of Mrs. Nicoll at the time of her death was $2,572.05. The Royal Trust Company passed its accounts as executor on October 14th, 1937, and on that date handed to Mrs. Sutherland a cheque for the amount of the deposit. Mrs. Sutherland treated the money as her own, using a part thereof to purchase an automobile and investing the balance in securities. She died intestate June 25th, 1940, and letters of administration of her estate were granted to the appellant.\nOn behalf of the respondent, Mr. Smith first contended that there was a resulting trust established with reference to the bank account. His argument was that the wording of the fourth codicil shows, at the very least, that Mrs. Nicoll considered that she had disclosed to Mrs. Sutherland the \"wishes\" which she desired Mrs. Sutherland to follow in disposing of the money; that, Mrs. Sutherland having refused or neglected to disclose the terms of the communication to her, it should be assumed against her that she acquiesced in the terms of the wishes so expressed to her; and that, it being impossible now to ascertain the wishes of Mrs. Nicoll, there was a resulting trust in favour of the latter's residuary legatees. The second point made is that, on the construction of the codicil itself, Mrs. Sutherland became a trustee of the money and that, the terms of the trust not being available, the same result follows.\nAs to the second contention, I am of opinion that the terms of the codicil, taken by themselves, do not establish a trust. It is now recognized that the old rule as to precatory trusts no longer prevails and that a gift to A \"in full confidence\" that he will do certain things will not, as a general rule, establish a trust. It does not appear useful to list the many cases that have been cited on this branch of the case since, considering the tendency of the courts in modern times, I have concluded that in this particular case no trust was imposed upon. Mrs. Sutherland by the fourth codicil of Mrs. Nicoll's will. This is made clearer when one looks at the second codicil wherein the testatrix, when intending to establish a trust, does so in unmistakable language:\nI give and bequeath to my son Frank Foster Nicoll the sum of three hundred dollars ($300) in trust for the benefit of St. Matthew's Church, Clyde River.\nAs to the first contention, it is undoubted that in certain circumstances a testator may bequeath a sum of money to an individual upon trust for purposes not appearing in the testamentary document but disclosed by him to the trustee and acquiesced in by the latter either expressedly or tacitly, and that parol evidence is admissible to establish the trust. Blackwell v. Blackwell[2]. This statement, however, begs the question, as it must first be established that there was such a trust and that it was agreed to. It is admitted on behalf of the respondent that the evidence led by him does not show the terms of the alleged trust but it is contended that it shows that Mrs. Sutherland considered she was not herself entitled to the money. Upon that point I agree with the trial judge, as I am not impressed by the evidence in that regard,\u2014given by interested parties and as to which the Trust Company's representative, who was present upon one occasion referred to, was not asked any questions. I also agree that in any event the provisions of section 37 of the Nova Scotia Evidence Act, R.S.N.S. 1923, chapter 225, apply and that there is no corroboration of the evidence. Assuming that as against the construction to be placed upon the words of the fourth codicil, the terms of Mrs. Nicoll's wishes, if known, might create a trust, those terms might, on the other hand, as in McCormick v. Grogan[3], disclose that no trust was created. A sufficient time elapsed between the death of Mrs. Nicoll, January 18th, 1937, and the death of Mrs. Sutherland, June 25th, 1940, to bring matters to a head and, even if those on whose behalf this action is brought were, as they suggest, lulled for a time into a sense of false security by expressions used by Mrs. Sutherland, they were quickly disabused. The cheque for the money on deposit was handed to Mrs. Sutherland on October 14th, 1937, and this action was not commenced until after her death. The onus is upon the respondent, and, in the absence of evidence that a trust was imposed upon Mrs. Sutherland, the basis of the first contention fails.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment at the trial restored, with costs throughout.\nHudson J.\u2014By a codicil to the will of the late Lydia A. Nicoll it was provided:\nI give and bequeath the amount of money which I may have on deposit with the Canadian Bank of Commerce at Barrington, Nova Scotia, at the time of my death to my daughter, Ina F. Sutherland, in-full confidence that she will dispose of the same in accordance with the wishes which I have expressed to her.\nUnder the authority of this provision the executors of the will paid to the late Mrs. Sutherland the sum of $2,572.05 which she used in part for her own purposes during her life time. The remainder is held by the appellant as part of her estate.\nThe plaintiffs in this action claim on behalf of the residuary legatees under the will of Mrs. Nicoll that the bequest to Mrs. Sutherland was a trust, that she during her life time failed to carry out such trust or to disclose its nature and that, consequently, they are entitled to the money.\nAt the trial an attempt was made to establish by evidence that the money bequeathed to Mrs. Sutherland was in a trust to pay the debts of the testatrix and, after payment of some money to a man who had at one time lived at the Nicoll home, to divide what remained among the residuary legatees.\nThe evidence failed to establish any such purpose and counsel for the plaintiffs at the trial very properly abandoned this ground. It was then contended that there was at least sufficient evidence to establish that the bequest was a trust, the nature of which could not now be ascertained, and that, in the absence of objects, the residuary legatees were entitled to the fund.\nIn support of this argument it was alleged, firstly, that the words of the codicil, read in conjunction with the will and prior codicils, imposed a trust, and secondly, that Mrs. Sutherland had in her life time admitted that the money was given to her in trust and not for her own benefit.\nIn respect of the first ground, the learned trial Judge was of the opinion that neither the language of the codicil read by itself, nor read with the other provisions of the will and codicils, gave support to the plaintiffs' position. On the second question, he found that the evidence offered on behalf of plaintiffs was not trustworthy and that it was vague, uncertain and conflicting and did not establish any statement by Mrs. Sutherland that there was any definite obligation imposed upon her.\nOn appeal, this decision was reversed by a majority, Chief Justice Chisholm and Mr. Justice Smiley forming the majority and Mr. Justice Doull dissenting.\nI agree with the views expressed by Mr. Justice Archibald at the trial and Mr. Justice Doull at the Court of Appeal. The word \"confidence\", as stated by Lord Davey in Comiskey v. Bowring-Hanbury[4], is a neutral word. If the will as a whole indicates an intention to create a trust, the court will so construe the will; otherwise it will not.\nThe other testamentary dispositions of the testatrix do not lend support to the contention of the respondent. By the will itself, made in 1930, certain real property was devised to one Jack F. Nicoll. By the first codicil, in 1933, the above devise was revoked and all real property of the testatrix devised to the plaintiff F. Foster Nicoll, one of the respondents. By the will $300 was bequeathed to a church and by a second codicil in 1935 this bequest was altered so that it conveyed to F. Foster Nicoll the sum in question in trust for the church, a trust being definitely defined.\nBy the original will there was no particular disposition of personal property other than a bequest of $2,200 to Jack F. Nicoll, a small sum for a cemetery, and the bequest to the church already mentioned. In 1933 a third codicil was made by which all the deceased's furniture, household effects, etc., were bequeathed to Mrs. Sutherland, upon trust that she should divide the same among the deceased's surviving children in such way as Mrs. Sutherland might wish or decide expressly. In 1936 the fourth codicil containing the provision in question was made.\nIt will be observed through the progress of these dispositions that the testatrix did not have in mind any absolute equality in benefits for her children. On the contrary, she made a specific devise of all of her real property to the respondent F. Foster Nicoll, and it is shown by the preceding codicils that when a trust was intended it was so stated in definite language.\nThe argument most pressed and relied on on behalf of the respondent is that, notwithstanding the language of the codicil, Mrs. Sutherland during her life time neglected and refused to disclose what her mother had said to her. Under some circumstances, such reticence might give rise to an inference that a trust was intended, but the evidence put forward here by the plaintiffs in their abortive attempt to prove a trust for specific purposes suggests to me that Mrs. Sutherland may have had quite good and honest reasons for not disclosing her mother's wishes. In any event, the respondents had ample time to take action during the life time of Mrs. Sutherland to compel disclosure, if they so desired. If the oral evidence of the plaintiff is to be given any credence whatever, it leads me to think that whatever was said by the testatrix to Mrs. Sutherland was vague and indefinite as to objects, and this in itself supplies a reason why the words of the will should not be construed as obligatory.\nTwo old cases are of interest on this point. In the case of Harland v. Trigg[5], the Lord Chancellor said: I have no doubt but a requisition made with a clear object will amount to a trust. In the case of the Duchess of Buckingham's will, the words were very gentle, but had a distinct object. But where the words are not clear, as to their object, they cannot raise a trust. Where this testator had a leasehold estate, which he meant should go to the family, he has used apt words; therefore, where he has not used such words, he had a different intent.\nAnd again in the case of Wynne v. Hawkins[6] in the same volume, the Lord Chancellor said at page 180:\nIf a bill had been filed in the lifetime of the wife, could I have ordered this money to be laid out, and that she should receive the interest for her life, and then it should go over? These are equivocal words, the intent of which is to be gathered from the context. If the intention is clear, what was to be given, and to whom, I should think the words not doubting would be strong enough. But where, in point of context, it is uncertain what property was to be given, and to whom, the words are not sufficient, because it is doubtful what is the confidence which the testator has reposed; and, where that does not appear, the scale leans to the presumption that he meant to give the whole to the first taker.\nIn the case of Briggs v. Penny[7], it was said by Lord Truro at p. 556:\nIt is most important to observe that vagueness in the object will unquestionably furnish reason for holding that no trust was intended, yet this may be countervailed by other considerations which shew that a trust was intended.\nThe words of Lord Bowen in In re Diggles; Gregory v. Edmondson[8], might be appropriately quoted:\nBut just as uncertainty of the property and object are reasons for not construing the will as creating a trust, so also the fact that a trust would cause embarrassment and difficulty is a reason for coming to the same conclusion.\nWith reference to the numerous authorities discussed in the court below, I am content to accept the views of Mr. Justice Archibald and Mr. Justice Doull. I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Rand JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.\u2014This appeal raises the question of the interpretation of a codicil to the will of Lydia A. Nicoll, which reads as follows:\nI give and bequeath the amount of money which I may have on deposit with the Canadian Bank of Commerce at Barrington, Nova Scotia, at the time of my death to my daughter, Ina F. Sutherland, in full confidence that she will dispose of the same in accordance with the wishes which I have expressed to her.\nThe will, subject to three specific dispositions, had left the residue to the children of the deceased. By earlier codicils the testatrix had converted a direct legacy to a church into one in trust for the same church, and had given certain personal effects then in the residue to the daughter Ina in trust for distribution among the residuary legatees and another, in her absolute discretion; and by the last codicil withdrew likewise from the residue the sum of approximately $2,500, the amount standing to the credit of the testatrix at her death. The entire estate was in the neighbourhood of $17,000.\nThe testatrix died in January, 1937. Her will was proved shortly thereafter and the order passing accounts and ordering distribution made in October of that year. The daughter Ina died on June 25th, 1940, and the appellant is the administrator of her estate.\nOn behalf of the respondents it is claimed there is, on the face of the will, an absolute trust, the objects of which have failed, and consequently the benefits result to the residuary legatees: but that, on the other hand, if the words of the codicil are precatory merely, a secret trust has resulted from the communication by the testatrix to the daughter of her wishes and the undertaking by the latter to carry them out, a failure or refusal on her part to do so, and a resulting trust to the residue.\nWhat the wishes of the testatrix, mentioned in the codicil, were is unknown. Archibald J., who tried the issue, came to the conclusion that there was no evidence on which he could make a finding on them or on the fact of any communication of them to the daughter Ina, whether before or after the making of the codicil. In September, 1938, the respondents, by letter, requested the daughter to disclose them but, so far as appears, without result. It is evident that feelings had been aroused and with at least one of her brothers Ina was not on speaking terms.\nMr. Smith for the respondents argued that the first enquiry Should be whether the daughter Ina had in fact so undertaken with the testatrix, and that it was only when that question was decided that the construction of the codicil might become necessary. But so far as it may be considered material, I am unable to agree with him. What is first presented to the court is the testamentary document and any enquiry regarding transactions dehors that instrument must, I should say, follow the conclusions relating to it.\nDo the words of the codicil, then, create a trust or are they merely precatory, expressive of the wish of the testatrix but not intended to impose upon the legatee an imperative direction? During the past fifty years a marked change has taken place in the attitude of the courts toward dispositions of this character. The earlier tendency was to treat such expressions as placing a bond upon the person taking, the performance of which courts of equity would enforce. But this has given way to an opposite leaning and the present rule is that confirmed in the case of In re Atkinson[9]: to give effect to the real intention of the testator, as that is to be gathered from the testamentary instrument as a whole, regardless of any particular words used or of any rule related to them. So construed, I agree with Archibald and Doull JJ., that the words in question were not intended to do more than to indicate the desire rather than to impose the will of the testatrix.\nThere remains the contention that by a communication to the daughter a secret trust arose. The rules of law dealing with this class of transactions are clearly settled. If, on the face of the will, the legal interest is, simpliciter, in the legatee, it can be shown that an agreement outside of the will was made by which the legatee undertook as an absolute obligation the carrying out of wishes of the testator. If, on the other hand, the will expressly creates the fiduciary obligation, then the oral communication must be made either before or at the time of the making of the will. If it is not, the beneficial interest is deemed not to be distributed and a resulting trust at once arises. The present case is intermediate. Although the words are precatory, they look to an oral or a written communication to the legatee for their completion. Where a trust arises outside the will, the transaction may take place at any time during the life of the testator for the reason that the continuance of the legacy is on the footing of the legatee's undertaking. But the rule does not oblige us to say that the mere communication, in such a case as this, of the wishes of the testatrix, would ipso facto create an obligatory trust. If the language of the will, following which the communication is made, is precatory, why should a communication be considered as going beyond its mere fulfilment, and as not being intended to have the same effect as if it had been set out in full in the testamentary document? It would be necessary to show clearly not only the communication but that it was made in circumstances in Which such an obligation was imposed upon and accepted by the legatee: In re Falkiner: Mead v. Smith[10]; Sullivan v. Sullivan[11]; Reid v. Atkinson[12]. That proof here, having as its object the establishment of a claim against an estate, would in addition require corroboration.\nA further difficulty would arise in respect of the question of performance. It is alleged as part of the claim that the daughter Ina had died \"without exercising the provisions of the said trust\". The respondents are suing not as cestuis que trust but as resulting beneficiaries upon a failure of performance and that essential fact is part of their case. The daughter could, if alive, answer it by proving performance and the question is whether we are to presume that the trust must have been incompatible with the conduct of the daughter evidenced to the court.\nThese difficulties are obviated by the findings below that there is no sufficient evidence either of the fact of the communication of the wishes or of what they were; a fortiori there is no evidence of the acceptance by the daughter of an obligation to carry them out; and no ground has been suggested on which a presumption of any of these matters could now be raised against the estate.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial, with costs both in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Donald McInnes.\nSolicitor for the respondent: R.

A contention on behalf of the applicant, that the Court of General Sessions of the Peace for the County of Simcoe had no jurisdiction to try him as the evidence established that the offence of which he was convicted was committed in the County of York and he was neither apprehended nor in custody in the County of Simcoe within the meaning of s. 577 of the Criminal Code, was rejected by the Court of Appeal. It was contended on behalf of the applicant in the present application that the decision of the Court of Appeal conflicted with other judgments, including the judgment in The King v. O\u2019Gorman[2], \u201cin a like case\u201d within said s. 1025.\nG.A. Martin for the application.\nW.B. Common K.C. contra.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The only judgment with which it could be seriously said there might be a conflict with the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the present case, is that of The King v. O\u2019Gorman[3]. The other cases referred to obviously presented no conflict at all and that was practically admitted during the argument by counsel for the appellant.\nAfter having carefully considered the judgment in the O\u2019Gorman case3 and having given the fullest consideration to the very able argument of Mr. Martin, I have come to the conclusion that the O\u2019Gorman case3 was \u201cnot a like case\u201d, within the meaning of section 1025 of the Criminal Code. In the present case, the distinction is made in the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice of Ontario and I fully agree that the two cases are distinguishable and, therefore, there exists no basis for granting leave to appeal in the present case.\nThere is, to my mind, a further reason why the application for leave should not be entertained. Judgment in the case of The King v. O\u2019Gorman3 was rendered by the Court of Appeal for Ontario and the judgment from which it is intended to appeal to this Court was also rendered by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. In the circumstances, it seems to me that it cannot be said this would meet the requirements of section 1025: that leave may be granted \u201cif the judgment appealed from conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal\u201d. I do not think that the section applies.\nThe application should be dismissed.\nApplication dismissed.\n[1] [1944] O.R. 230; [1944] 2 D.L.R. 378.\n[2] (1909) 15 Can. Cr. Cas. 173; 18 Ont.

It manufactured aluminum products at its plant in Toronto and was assessed in Toronto as a manufacturer for business assessment under s. 8 (1) (e) of The Assessment Act, R.S.O, 1937, c. 272. It was also assessed by the City of Toronto, under s. 9 (1) (b) of said Act, in respect of certain income and it disputed its liability to such income assessment. It received said income by way of dividends on shares in, or interest on moneys advanced to, certain other companies, hereinafter called \u201csubsidiaries\u201d, whose operations, all necessary for appellant\u2019s purposes, included, by one or other of the subsidiaries, the mining of bauxite (in British Guiana), water and rail transportation, wharf and dock operation, and production and sale of power. Appellant owned all the issued shares of all the subsidiaries except one and in that it owned over half of the issued shares. There was a degree of connection between appellant and each subsidiary in directorate personnel. The subsidiaries did service for or business with others besides appellant. Appellant contended that the businesses of the subsidiaries were integral parts of appellant\u2019s business in respect of which appellant was assessed under s. 8; that the subsidiaries acted as agents, or under such arrangement as constituted them agents, of appellant in its said business; and were operated in such a way in relation to appellant as made that operation the carrying on of appellant\u2019s said business; and that the income in question was not assessable, having been derived from the business in respect of which appellant was assessed for business assesment.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1944] O.R. 66, that appellant was assessable, under s. 9 (1) (b), in respect of the income in question, as not being derived from the business in respect of which it was assessed under s. 8. The businesses respectively carried on by the subsidiaries were in each case the subsidiary\u2019s own business and not the business or part of the business of appellant in respect of which it was assessable for business assessment. (City of Toronto v. Famous Players\u2019 Canadian Corp. Ltd., [1936] S.C.R. 141, distinguished.)\nAPPEAL by the Aluminum Company of Canada, Limited, from the order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing its appeal from the order of the Ontario Municipal Board[2], which held that the said company should be assessed in the city of Toronto, under s. 9 (1) (b) of The Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 272, for the sum of $1,802,678.82 (in addition to the sum of $9,127, admittedly so assessable), as being income received by it in the year 1939 (assessable in 1940) not derived from the business in respect of which the company was assessable in the city of Toronto for business assessment under s. 8 of said Act. The appellant was assessed in the city of Toronto for business assessment under s. 8 in respect of its plant premises in Toronto as a manufacturer. It received the income in question by way of dividends on shares in, or interest on moneys advanced to, certain other companies, all the issued shares of which the appellant owned except in the case of one company and in that the appellant owned 53\u00bd per cent. of the issued shares. The facts are more fully stated in the reasons for judgment infra, and are also discussed at length in the judgments (cited supra) of the Court of Appeal and the Ontario Municipal Board. The appellant contended that the businesses of the said other companies were integral parts of the appellant\u2019s business in respect of which the appellant was assessed under s. 8; that the said other companies acted as agents, or under such arrangement as constituted them agents, of the appellant in its said business; and were operated in such a way in relation to the appellant as made that operation the carrying on of the appellant\u2019s said business; and that the income in question was not assessable, having been derived from the business in respect of which the appellant was assessed for business assessment under s. 8.\nS.A. Hayden K.C. and R.M. Fowler for the appellant.\nJ.P. Kent K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Rand J. was delivered by\nRAND J.\u2014The appellant is the parent company of an aluminum enterprise which in scope extends from the mining of the raw material through all stages and agencies to the finished products. Its interest in bauxite, the base mineral of aluminum, in British Guiana is through a company organized under the English Companies Act of which it is the owner of all the shares except those qualifying directors. The rail and water transportation facilities from the mine to and down the Demarara River, on the Atlantic and up the river St. Lawrence to Port Alfred, Ha Ha Bay, on the Saguenay River, Quebec, and from that port to the manufacturing plant at Arvida, are likewise controlled by wholly owned subsidiaries. The power furnished at Arvida is produced by a company of which it owns 53 per cent. of the capital stock. The product of the plant at Arvida consists of pig or ingot aluminum. To convert this material into articles of trade, subsidiary plants have been established at Toronto and Kingston, Ontario. The head office is at Toronto. Under that corporate control there has been organized a chain of connecting industrial operations coordinated into a productive unity.\nThe activities of these various units, however, are not confined to the requirements of the main enterprise. Not all of the bauxite produced is sold to the company. The transportation on the Demarara River is not confined to the goods of the company. The rail service to Arvida is by a subsidiary operating under a Quebec charter as a common carrier. The power company sells a substantial part of its product to other persons and for other purposes.\nThe controversy in appeal concerns the assessment of the company by the City of Toronto. The scheme of taxation provided by the Ontario Assessment Act, so far as it is pertinent to this dispute, provides primarily for the assessment of persons occupying or using land for the purposes of specified businesses; and, in addition to that, for an assessment of income other than that arising from the business so assessed.\nIt will be convenient at this point to set forth the relevant sections of the Act:\n8. (1) Irrespective of any assessment of land under this Act, every person occupying or using land for the purpose of any business mentioned or described in this section shall be assessed for a sum to be called \u201cbusiness assessment\u201d to be computed by reference to the assessed value of the land so occupied or used by him, as follows:\n* * *\n(e) Subject to the provisions of clause j every person carrying on the business of a manufacturer for a sum equal to sixty per centum of the assessed value, and a manufacturer shall not be liable to business assessment as a wholesale merchant by reason of his carrying on the business of selling by wholesale the goods of his own manufacture on such land.\n* * *\n(11) Every person assessed for business assessment shall be liable for the payment of the tax thereon and the same shall not constitute a charge upon the land occupied or used.\n* * *\n9. (1) Subject to the exemptions provided for in sections 4 and 8,\u2014\n(a) every corporation not liable to business assessment under section 8 shall be assessed in respect of income;\n(b) every corporation although liable to business assessment under section 8 shall also be assessed in respect of any income not derived from the business in respect of which it is assessable under that section. (2) The income to be assessed shall be the income received during the year ending on the 31st day of December then last past.\n10. Subject to subsection 6 of section 39 the income of a partnership, or of an incorporated company, if assessable, shall be assessed against the partners at their chief place of business, and against the company at its head office, or if the company has no head office in Ontario, at its chief place of business in the municipality.\nThe issue raised is, therefore, this: does the business of the appellant on Sterling Road, Toronto, within the meaning of The Assessment Act, extend to that of the bauxite company or any of the other subsidiaries mentioned?\nBy the decision of this Court in the case of City of Toronto v. Famous Players\u2019 Canadian Corporation Ltd.[3], it is now settled that the business of one company can embrace the apparent or nominal business of another company where the conditions are such that it can be said that the second company is in fact the puppet of the first; when the directing mind and will of the former reaches into and through the corporate fa\u00e7ade of the latter and becomes, itself, the manifesting agency. In such a case it is not accurate to describe the business as being carried on by the puppet for the benefit of the dominant company. The business is in fact that of the latter. This does not mean, however, that for other purposes the subsidiary may not be the legal entity to be dealt with.\nThe question, then, in each case, apart from formal agency which is not present here, is whether or not the parent company is in fact in such an intimate and immediate domination of the motions of the subordinate company that it can be said that the latter has, in the true sense of the expression, no independent functioning of its own. The facts here are not in dispute. There is no doubt of the control of policy generally by the parent company. There is also a degree of connection in directorate personnel, but it is quite impossible to say, for instance, that the bauxite company does not function in its own right as a corporate body exercising discretion, directing its local affairs and generally serving the purpose for which its incorporation was intended. It is not a puppet company and the business which it actually carries on is its own. We have here, then, a condition which in each case effectively delimits and differentiates the corporate activity of the parent company from that of the subsidiary. The appellant has confused the scope of the business properly and legally attributable to the premises on Sterling Road with a totality of co-ordinated operations between self-functioning members of an industrial family. It was only one unit of those operations that was assessed on Sterling Road, and the income received by the appellant and now in question accrued from other units disjunctive in the sense of the statute.\nThe appeal, therefore, should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014This is an appeal by Aluminum Company of Canada, Limited, from the Court of Appeal for Ontario in an assessment dispute between the Company and the City of Toronto. The appellant is incorporated by letters patent issued under the Dominion Companies Act. Its head office is in certain offices in the Canada Life Building on University Avenue in Toronto. It occupied land for the purpose of carrying on the business of a manufacturer at 158 Sterling Road, Toronto, and was assessed for business assessment at that location as a manufacturer under paragraph (e) of subsection 1 of section 8 of the Ontario Assessment Act, R.S.O. (1937), c. 272. It did not occupy land at its head office in the Canada Life Building for the purpose of its business and was not assessed for any business assessment there. It was, however, there assessed in respect of certain income which the City alleged was not derived from the business in respect of which it was assessed for business assessment, and the question before us is whether the Ontario Municipal Board and the Court of Appeal were right in deciding on their construction of paragraph (b) of subsection 1 of section 9 of The Assessment Act that a certain part of that income was not derived from the business in respect of which it was assessed at 158 Sterling Road.\nSubsection 1 of section 9 is as follows:\n9. (1) Subject to the exemptions provided for in sections 4 and 8,\u2014\n(a) every corporation not liable to business assessment under section 8 shall be assessed in respect of income; (b) every corporation although liable to business assessment under section 8 shall also be assessed in respect of any income not derived from the business in respect of which it is assessable under that section.\nThe part of the income now in question arises entirely from dividends or interest received by the appellant from five other incorporated companies which, speaking generally, it controls. It was urged that the present case resembled City of Toronto v. Famous Players\u2019 Canadian Corporation, Limited[4]. There, however, the Municipal Board was of the opinion that the only business of Famous Players\u2019 Canadian Corporation, Limited, could best be described as that of \u201ctheatre controller and operator\u201d, that the assessment roll should be amended to so read, and that all its income was derived from that business. This Court agreed with that conclusion. What that company did, however, is not in any way analogous to the operations of the present appellant. In my view, the principle of our decision in Rogers-Majestic Corporation, Limited v. City of Toronto[5] applies.\nA concise summary of the appellant\u2019s argument before us is found in the statement by the Municipal Board as to the Company\u2019s argument before it. That argument is based on the fact that the appellant had been incorporated with very wide powers and on the contention that its business was the production of aluminum goods from the mining of bauxite to the manufacture of aluminum products, including all the intermediary steps, and, that being its business, all income derived from that business is exempt under section 9, subsection 1 (b), of the Act.\nThe powers of the appellant, conferred by its charter, which are particularly relied upon by it are summarized in its factum as follows:\n(a) To construct or acquire by purchase or otherwise all buildings, water and electrical works necessary for the business of the Company.\n(b) To manufacture and deal in aluminum and all other metals from the ores to the finished products thereof.\n(c) To construct, acquire, maintain, operate, use and manage works, machinery and appliances for the production of electricity, etc.\n(d) To mine, quarry or otherwise extract or remove ores.\nUndoubtedly the appellant is interested in controlling in one way or another every step from the mining of the bauxite to the manufacturing of aluminum products. The bauxite is mined in British Guiana by a company incorporated under the laws of that country, the shares of which are wholly owned by the appellant, which company carries the bauxite to a river\u2019s mouth where it is loaded into larger boats. Not all of that company\u2019s business comes from the appellant, although undoubtedly most of it does. It should be further noted that that company operates a short line of railway and, while the appellant may carry on business not only in Canada but in all parts of the world, its charter specifically prohibits it from constructing or working railways.\nThe bauxite is brought by a third company (all of whose shares are owned by the appellant) from British Guiana to Port Alfred, Quebec, where it owns certain water lots and a wharf. This company carries other freight as well as the appellant\u2019s bauxite. A fourth company operates a railway from Port Alfred to Arvida. The appellant owns all the shares of that company which, however, transports not only the appellant\u2019s goods but is obliged to carry other freight as well. The prohibition in the appellant\u2019s charter against operating railways applies, of course, to this undertaking. The fifth company concerned is a power company which produces and sells power as well to the appellant as to others. The respondent owns the majority of the issued shares thereof.\nEven if the appellant were correct in its objections to some of the details as stated by the Chief Justice of Ontario with reference to the mining company, I think the latter\u2019s conclusion is inevitable that the mining business in British Guiana, under the agreements and leases referred to by him, is the business of the company incorporated for that purpose and is not the business of the appellant Company. As to the other four companies, in view of the fact that they do business with and for other people or corporations, the argument that they are the agents of the appellant, so as to make their business part of the appellant\u2019s manufacturing business, cannot be substantiated.\nThis disposes of the only income in question before us. The City originally advanced a claim for the income derived by the appellant from its manufacturing operations at Arvida. There the bauxite is turned into aluminum ingots, ninety-five per cent. of which are sold in that J form by the appellant. The remainder is shipped to the appellant\u2019s factories at Kingston, Ontario, and at 158 Sterling Road, Toronto. There the ingots are manufactured into aluminum sheet, foil, pistons, etc. This part of the City\u2019s claim was disallowed by the Municipal Board and no appeal as to it was taken and we are not concerned with that problem. On the only issues which are before us, the appellant fails and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McCarthy & McCarthy.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.G.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Surveyer J., and dismissing the appellant's declinatory exception.\nThe appellant, by his action, claimed from the respondent the sum of $9,956.27 for professional services and disbursements, including a demand for an accounting of the various business transactions which passed during the time the appellant acted as legal adviser to the Polish Consulate and represented the various nationals of Poland who had been referred to him. He seeks also to have declared valid and binding an agreement entered into by correspondence between himself and the then Consul General of the appellant state. An account already tendered by the appellant was submitted for approval and a declaration asked that the balance therein shown is exact and due to him. Subsidiarily, the appellant asked that the sums received by him from successions or claims in his hands be declared to have been compensated by the advances, disbursements and fees due to him. As against the mis-en-cause, the appellant sought the annulment of proceedings taken before its Council and prayed for the suspension of further action upon said complaint until judgment upon the action. The appellant described the respondent in the pleadings as follows: \"La R\u00e9publique de Pologne, \u00e9tat souverain ayant ci-devant sa capitale dans la ville de Varsovie dans ladite R\u00e9publique, maintenant en un endroit inconnu\". The respondent pleaded to said action in law, by way of declinatory exception, setting forth that the respondent, being a sovereign state, is not subject, as such, to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, and prayed by the conclusions of the exception that the action be dismissed, there being no other court competent to hear the issue. In answer to such declinatory exception, the appellant contended that the proceedings instituted against him before the mis-en-cause, the council of the Bar, upon the instigation of the Polish Consul, constituted an acceptance of, and submission to, the jurisdiction of the Superior Court and justified him in urging by way of compensation or otherwise such claims as he may possess against the respondent. The declinatory exception was dismissed by the Superior Court; but that judgment was reversed by the appellate court.\nCasimir Dessaulles in person for the appellant.\nGregory Charlap for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014Il ne fait pas de doute qu'un \u00e9tat souverain ne peut \u00eatre poursuivi devant les tribunaux \u00e9trangers. Ce principe est fond\u00e9 sur Pind\u00e9pendance et la dignit\u00e9 des \u00e9tats, et la courtoisie internationale Pa toujours respect\u00e9. La jurisprudence Pa aussi adopt\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant la loi domestique de tous les pays civilis\u00e9s.\nL'exception d\u00e9clinatoire de la d\u00e9fenderesse, dans laquelle il \u00e9tait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure du district de Montr\u00e9al n'avait pas juridiction pour entendre une action dirig\u00e9e contre elle, est donc bien fond\u00e9e, et c'est avec raison que la Cour du Banc du Roi Pa maintenue, et a rejet\u00e9 l'action.\nL'appelant soumet cependant que, dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, le principe d'immunit\u00e9 dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient les \u00e9tats souverains ne s'applique pas, parce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e y a renonc\u00e9 en acceptant la juridiction des tribunaux canadiens. Il semble bien inutile d'examiner les divers aspects de cet argument, ni d'en d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e, car les faits r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s par la preuve ne nous justifient pas de le prendre en consid\u00e9ration.\nEn effet, les proc\u00e9dures institu\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9e contre l'appelant, devant le conseil du Barreau du District de Montr\u00e9al, ne peuvent pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme une renonciation par l\u2019intim\u00e9e au privil\u00e8ge d'immunit\u00e9 que lui conf\u00e8re son \u00e9tat d'ind\u00e9pendance. Des auteurs nombreux, ainsi que la jurisprudence, font sur ce point les distinctions n\u00e9cessaires, et pr\u00e9cisent les cas o\u00f9 cette renonciation peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e. Je suis bien convaincu que nous ne sommes en pr\u00e9sence d'aucun d'eux. (Vide: Dicey's Conflict of Laws, 5th ed., page 200.)\nL'action \u00e9tait dirig\u00e9e \u00e0 la fois contre la R\u00e9publique de Pologne, et aussi contre le Barreau de Montr\u00e9al qui \u00e9tait mis-en-cause. Contre la premi\u00e8re on demandait une condamnation p\u00e9cuniaire pour services professionnels, et contre le second, une injonction lui enjoignant de ne pas proc\u00e9der davantage \u00e0 entendre les plaintes port\u00e9es contre l'appelant pour d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 l'honneur professionnel. La Cour du Banc du Roi a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action in toto, malgr\u00e9 que le Barreau de Montr\u00e9al n'e\u00fbt pas produit, comme la R\u00e9publique de Pologne, d'exception d\u00e9clinatoire. L'appelant pr\u00e9tend que la Cour du Banc du Roi a outrepass\u00e9 ses pouvoirs.\nSi tel \u00e9tait le cas, l'appelant aurait d\u00fb signifier son inscription en appel devant cette Cour au Barreau de Montr\u00e9al. Mais il n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de le faire, et ce n'est que lorsque les d\u00e9lais \u00e9taient expir\u00e9s qu'il a fait motion pour le mettre en cause. Cette motion a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e parce qu'il ne s'agissait pas d'un cas o\u00f9 cette Cour pouvait accorder une pareille demande, comme elle Ta fait d\u00e9j\u00e0, et en particulier dans la cause de Christin vs. Piette et Pelletier (1).\nIl s'ensuit que cette Cour ne peut pas intervenir, et que l'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nCasimir Dessaulles, Solicitor for the appellant.\nGregory Charlap, Solicitor for the respondent.\n[1] Q.R. 1943, K.B. 224.\n"}

The defendant appealed to this Court; and a motion was made to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction because, so it was contended, the judgment appealed from was not a final judgment.\nHeld: This Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal; the judgment appealed from was a \"final judgment\" as defined in the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 35, s. 2 (b)).

It means \"any judgment, rule, order or decision which determines in whole or in part any substantive right of any of the parties in controversy in any judicial proceeding.\" We think the judgment appealed from comes within that definition. So far as the issue of res judicata is concerned, the right of the parties is finally determined and will remain so unless the appellant succeeds in his present appeal.\nThe motion to quash should be dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n"}

In this case, the creditor was entitled to exercise that right on behalf of the company, even assuming the forfeiture of its charter.\nIt is not the duty of the secretary-treasurer of a municipal corporation to investigate as to who may be the real owner of an immoveable offered for sale. He is concerned only with what appears on the valuation roll, and, in this case, the company appeared in the roll as owner of the immoveable sold. APPEAL, by special leave to appeal granted by this court, from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Surveyer J., and dismissing the appellant's action \"en passation de titre\".\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nJohn T. Hackett K.C. for the appellant.\nBenoit Marchessault for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014In March, 1940, the secretary-treasurer for the corporation of the county of Shefford sold at a tax sale to appellant Clough, an immoveable standing in the name of S.S. Copper Mines Ltd. The purchase price was paid, but notary Bachand, the secretary-treasurer of the county corporation and one of the respondents in the present case, did not deliver to appellant a certificate of adjudication, setting forth the particulars of the sale.\nIn December, 1941, Bachand filed in the Registry Office of Shefford a notice to the registrar that the immoveable had been redeemed by Elton W. Martin, also one of the defendants, for and in the name of S.S. Copper Mines Ltd.\nIt is submitted by the appellant that this redemption was null and void, because at the time of this redemption, S.S. Copper Mines Ltd. had ceased to exist, its charter being extinct, having been forfeited de jure by non-user during three consecutive years. At the expiration of two years, appellant requested the secretary-treasurer to execute in his favour, in the name of the county corporation, a definite deed of sale of the immoveable, and, upon his refusal, he instituted the present action. In his conclusions he prayed that the redemption by defendant Martin be declared null and void and set aside, and the registration thereof be cancelled and that plaintiff be declared the owner of the said property and entitled to a deed. He also claimed that defendant Bachand in his quality of secretary-treasurer be condemned to produce in court a duplicate of the certificate of adjudication required by law to be issued to plaintiff, and that a deed of sale of the said property be ordered executed in favour of plaintiff by the defendant secretary-treasurer, and that, upon default, the judgment to be rendered avail to all legal purposes, and have the same effect, as a deed executed by the defendant county corporation.\nThis action was dismissed by Mr. Justice Surveyer sitting in the Superior Court and that judgment was unanimously confirmed by the Court of King's Bench[2].\nIn view of the conclusions which I have reached, it is unnecessary to examine if at the time the redemption was made, the charter of the company was still in force or not. The fate of this case must be determined solely in the light of the provisions of the Municipal Code of the province of Quebec.\nWhen Clough purchased the immoveable at the tax sale, he obtained only a precarious title, subject to its redemption during a period of two years. The owner, or any person on behalf of the owner, had, during that period of two years, the right to redeem this immoveable by reimbursing to the secretary-treasurer of the Corporation, the price of adjudication with costs and interests. This procedure is authorized by sections 754 and 755 of the Municipal Code which read as follows:\n754. The owner of any immoveable sold under the provisions of the first chapter of this title (art. 726-753), may, within two years after the date of the adjudication, redeem the same, by reimbursing to the secretary-treasurer of the corporation of the county in which such immoveable is situated the amount laid out for the purchase of such immoveable, including the cost of the certificate of purchase and the notice to the registrar, with interest at ten per cent per annum, every fraction of a year being reckoned as a year.\n755. Any person, whether authorized or not, may, unless a deed of sale has been granted under the second paragraph of article 741, redeem such immoveable in the same manner, but only in the name and for the benefit of the person who was the owner thereof at the time of the adjudication.\nWhen this right of redemption is exercised, the original purchaser to whom the immoveable has been adjudicated has no more rights, except to receive back the money paid plus interest. In the present case, did E. W. Martin have the right to exercise this right on behalf of S.S. Copper Mines Ltd., even assuming the forfeiture of the charter? I have no doubt that this question must be answered in the affirmative.\nThe recourse of a municipality when taxes are not paid is to have the immoveables sold. The secretary-treasurer has no option but to follow the imperative rules of the Code, and the sales must be effected in the way provided for by the law. It is not the duty of the secretary-treasurer of the local corporation to investigate as to who may be the real owner of the immoveable offered for sale. He is concerned only with what appears on the valuation roll, and in the course of the month of November of each year, he must prepare a statement showing (Municipal Code, section 726):\nthe name and style of every person indebted to the corporation for municipal taxes, as set forth in the valuation roll * * *\nBefore the 20th day of December in each year, he must transmit to the office of the county corporation an extract of such statement (Municipal Code, section 727), and it is also the duty of the secretary-treasurer of the county corporation to sell these immoveables on the second Thursday of the month of March following, after having, before the 8th of January, given public notice, that the immoveables (with the names of the owners as mentioned in the valuation roll) will be sold at public auction if the taxes are not paid.\nIn the present case, the name of the S.S. Copper Mines Ltd. appeared on the valuation roll as owner of the immoveable in question, and the secretary-treasurer of the county corporation had no alternative but to proceed the way he did.\nAssuming, as I did before, the forfeiture of the charter of the S.S. Copper Mines Ltd., for the benefit of which the redemption has been made, the legal situation cannot be altered.\nUnder our system of law, property can never be \"res nullius\". A company is dissolved by the forfeiture of its charter legally incurred (C.C., art. 368), but the law provides for the liquidation of its affairs. It is in the same position as a vacant succession (C.C., art. 371), and the creditors and others interested have the same recourse against the property which belong to it, as may be exercised against vacant successions and the property belonging to them.\nSection 372 of the Civil Code says:\n372. In order to facilitate such recourse, a curator, who represents such corporation and is seized of the property which belonged to it, is appointed by the proper court, with the formalities observed in the case of vacant estates.\nThese sections are applicable in the present case, and are the answer to the objection raised by the appellant, that no redemption can be made on behalf of a company when its charter is forfeited. The legislator has provided for the necessary means to make such a redemption possible.\nIt follows that the action \"en passation de titre\" was rightly dismissed by the trial judge, and the present appeal, therefore, should also be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hackett, Mulvena & Hackett.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Benoit Marchessault.\n[1] Q.R.

In 1937, he there married the respondent without a marriage contract and, therefore, by the law of that state, the spouses were separate as to property. In 1939, they returned to the province of Quebec, where they reacquired domicile. The respondent's husband, on June 26th of that year, made his last will, and he died on April 18th, 1940. He bequeathed $1,000 to the respondent, out of an estate of about $15,000. The only immoveable was situated in Quebec; and the balance of his estate were moveables situate some in Quebec and some in New Hampshire. The respondent, in order to claim a greater share of her husband's estate under a statute of New Hampshire, executed a renunciation of the benefits conferred upon her by the will; and she brought an action against the appellants, the residuary legatees under the will, in order to recover the benefits which she alleged were conferred upon her under the New Hampshire statute which contained provisions for a certain share of the property of a deceased husband or wife to go to the survivor whether the deceased dies testate or intestate.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, that under Quebec law the terms of the New Hampshire statute are not applicable to the circumstances of this case; and, therefore, the respondent's action ought to be dismissed.\nPer The Chief Justice and Kerwin and Taschereau JJ.\u2014In the absence of a contract, either actual or implied, by which proprietary rights are acquired, the law of the domicile at the time of death should determine whether any limitation was imposed upon the disposing power of a testator as to moveables. The same result follows as to immoveables, as those in this case are situate in Quebec.\nPer Hudson and Rand.\u2014The New Hampshire statute is one that has to do not with the fact of marriage but with married people; and it is, at most, a law of distribution or succession of property in New Hampshire which is owned at the time of his or her death by a married person. The provisions of that statute are in no sense predicated on marriage within the state nor are they referable only to such a marriage. It is not, therefore, a law creating \"a conjugal association\" as to property to which the law of Quebec will give effect upon the death of one of the consorts.\nDe Nicols v. Curlier ([1900] A.C. 21), Stephens v. Falchi ([1938] S.C.R. 354), and Berthiaume v.

E. Beaulieu K.C. and Arthur B\u00e9langer K.C. for the appellants. Guy Hudon K.C., Ross Drouin and Paul Lebel for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014This litigation gave rise to several questions with which the Court of King's Bench and the Superior Court of the province of Quebec found it necessary to deal but which now are not in issue. This narrows the compass of the present appeal and permits the relevant facts to be shortly stated.\nAlphonse Pouliot was born in the province of Quebec but, in 1926, removed to the State of New Hampshire in the United States of America where he established his domicile. In 1937 he there married Alma Cloutier of Quebec, so that New Hampshire was the matrimonial domicile. No marriage contract was entered into and, therefore, by the law of the State the spouses were separate as to property. In 1939 the spouses returned to Quebec where, on June 26th of that year, the husband made his last will and testament in notarial form and died on April 18th. 1940. At the time of the making of his will, and therefore at the time of his death, he had reacquired a Quebec domicile. By his will he bequeathed one thousand dollars to his wife, various sums of money to relatives, and devised and bequeathed the residue of his estate to his four brothers. The value of the estate left by him was about fifteen thousand dollars. The only immoveable is situate in Quebec and is valued at $2,500. The balance of his estate consisted of moveables, some of which were in Quebec and some in New Hampshire.\nIn this situation there would ordinarily be no question that the law of Quebec would regulate the succession. However, relying upon a statute of New Hampshire and in order to become entitled to the share of her husband's estate according to the terms thereof, the widow executed a renunciation on February 20th, 1941, by which she waived the provisions of her husband's will in her favour and released her right of dower and homestead in his real estate. This renunciation was filed in one of the Probate Courts of New Hampshire. On March 18th, 1941, she executed before a notary public in Quebec another renunciation of the benefits conferred upon her by the will.\nThe statute law referred to is chapter 118 of the 1933 laws of New Hampshire by which sections 10 and 11 of chapter 306, \"The Rights of Surviving Husband or Wife\", of the Public Laws of New Hampshire were enacted as follows:\n10. Widow, Personalty. The widow of a person deceased, testate or intestate, by waiving the provisions of his will in her favour, if any, shall be entitled, in addition to her dower and homestead right, as her distributive share, to the following portion of his personal estate, remaining after the payment of debts and expenses of administration:\nI. One-third part thereof, if he leaves issue surviving him.\nII. If testate, and he leaves no issue surviving him, five thousand dollars of the value thereof, and also one-half in value of the remainder above said five thousand dollars.\nIII. If intestate, and he leaves no issue surviving him, seven thousand five hundred dollars of the value thereof, and also one-half in value of the remainder above said seven thousand five hundred dollars.\n11. Real Estate. The widow of a person deceased, testate or intestate, by waiving the provisions of his will in her favour, if any, and by releasing her dower and homestead right, shall be entitled instead thereof, in fee, to the following portion of all the real estate of which he died seized, after the payment of debts and expenses of administration:\nI. One-third part thereof, if he leaves issue surviving him.\nII. If testate and he leaves no issue surviving him five thousand dollars of the value thereof, and also one-half in value of the remainder above said five thousand dollars; and the same shall be assigned to her in the same manner as dower is assigned. But where the inventory value of all his real estate does not exceed five thousand dollars, she shall be entitled to the whole of said remainder and no assignment of the same to her shall be required unless some party in interest shall petition the probate court therefor.\nIII. If intestate and he leaves no issue surviving him seven thousand five hundred dollars of the value thereof, and also one-half in value of the remainder above said seven thousand five hundred dollars; and the same shall be assigned to her in the same manner as dower is assigned. But where the inventory value of all his real estate does not exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars, she shall be entitled to the whole of said remainder, and no assignment of the same to her shall be required unless some party in interest shall petition the probate court therefor.\nThe law of 1933 was thus in force in New Hampshire from a date prior to the marriage down to the trial of the action. It was to recover the benefits mentioned therein that this action was brought by the widow against her husband's four brothers, the residuary legatees under his will. The terms of the statute are plain. The question is whether by Quebec law they are applicable to the circumstances of the present case. It seems clear that according to Quebec law the domicile of the spouses at the time of marriage fixes their matrimonial status, and they are deemed, in the absence of a marriage contract, to have adopted the law of that domicile for the determination of their property rights. In this respect I think it does not differ materially from the common law. In each system the question is as to what is covered by property rights. The decision of the House of Lords in De Nicols v. Curlier[1], greatly relied on by the respondent, is quite distinguishable and is no authority for the respondent's contention that she acquired property rights at the time of her marriage in New Hampshire. What happened in the House of Lords' case was that two French people were married in France without any matrimonial contract so that according to French law their rights as to property were subject to the law of community of goods. They came to England and were permanently domiciled there. The husband died in England, leaving his wife surviving and having made an English will by which he disposed of all his property. It was held by the House of Lords that as to moveable goods, the wife, under French law, acquired a real proprietary right to one-half, just the same as if a contract had been entered into accomplishing the same result. In the present case the wife acquired no proprietary rights whatever but only the hope of a certain distribution upon the husband's death in case he was then domiciled in New Hampshire.\nIn my opinion the true view of the New Hampshire statute, as well by Quebec law as by the common law, is expressed by J. D. Falconbridge in 12 Canadian Bar Review, 133. Referring to the Dependents' Relief Acts or Family Protection Acts in force in some of the common law provinces, by which a court may give to a testator's dependents a larger share of his estate than he has given them by his will, the author states:\nThe prevailing view would seem to be that a statute of this kind, in the absence of any clear indication of the legislature's intention, is to be characterized as being in effect a limitation on the testator's disposing power, and therefore as being testamentary law, applicable to immoveable property situated within the territory of the enacting legislature and to moveable property wherever situated of a testator domiciled in that territory.\nThis, I think, not only correctly expresses the law but is a practicable rule that in the absence of a contract, either actual or implied, by which proprietary rights are acquired, the law of the domicile at the time of death should determine whether any limitation was imposed upon the disposing power of a testator as to moveables. In the present case the immoveables are situate in Quebec and the same result follows.\nThe decision of this Court in Stephens v. Falchi[2] was also relied upon by the respondent. In that case there had been a putative marriage in Italy, which, it was found, had been entered into in good faith. The putative husband was domiciled in Italy and the putative wife acquired an Italian domicile in fact. The marriage being bigamous, the wife returned to her domicile of origin in Quebec and, as it was found, reacquired a domicile there in fact. Both by Italian law and Quebec law, a putative marriage produces \"civil effects\" if contracted in good faith. Following the decision of the Privy Council in Berthiaume v. Dastous[3], it was held that the civil effects quoad property would be those rights which were consistent with the real marriage not existing. That is, although the woman had in fact acquired a Quebec domicile at the time of her death, if the putative marriage had been a real one, she would not have been able to do this and it would therefore result that her domicile would be in Italy under the laws of which country the putative husband was entitled to a certain share in her estate. This case has no bearing on the matters under discussion.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed, with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Hudson and Rand JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.\u2014This appeal raises a question of the right to real and personal property in the province of Quebec arising upon the death of the husband of the respondent. The parties were married in 1937 in the State of New Hampshire, United States of America, while domiciled there: but later they took up their home and domicile in Levis, Quebec, where the husband died in 1940.\nThe will of the deceased is challenged on the ground that, under their matrimonial law, such rights were acquired by the respondent widow as call for a distribution of the property in Quebec according to the terms of a statute of New Hampshire passed in 1933. That act provides for a certain share of the property of a deceased husband or wife to go to the survivor whether the deceased dies testate or intestate and it is admitted that, if the law so invoked is, within the contemplation of the law of Quebec, a law forming part of the matrimonial regime, the contention of the respondent is sound. In other words, the law of Quebec, in the distribution of its own property, moveable or immoveable, has regard to property rights between husband and wife annexed to the marriage by the law of the matrimonial domicile.\nIt becomes necessary, therefore, to examine the statute to see if it possesses those characteristics which attach its provisions to marriage within New Hampshire, or whether it provides merely rules of succession which would be irrelevant to the law of Quebec.\nThe evidence makes it clear to me that the Act is one that has to dp not with the fact of marriage but with married persons. The condition of its application seems to be that the deceased person should have been domiciled in New Hampshire at the time of his death, but even if that is not so, it is clearly of no significance where or when he was married. It does not affect or restrict any mode of alienation inter vivos. It is, therefore, at most, a law of distribution or succession of property in New Hampshire which is owned at the time of his or her death by a married person.\nThe decision of the House of Lords in the case of De Nichols v. Curlier[4] indicates the essential nature of the matrimonial law to which recognition is to be given in such a case as the present. It must be a law defining and declaring property rights conceived as terms of the marriage itself, following it through all changes of domicile and susceptible of dissolution or modification only in the events or by the means stipulated; in short, it must be a statutory equivalent to a marriage contract.\nBut the statute of New Hampshire bears no such characteristic. Its provisions are in no sense predicated on marriage within the state nor are they referable only to such a marriage. It is not, therefore, a law creating \"a conjugal association\" as to property to which the law of Quebec will give effect upon the death of one of the consorts.\nIt is contended that the controversy is concluded by the decision of this court in the case of Stephens v. Falchi[5], but the facts there were wholly different. The putative marriage had taken place in Italy where the husband was domiciled. A marriage contract specifically submitted the matrimonial affairs to the law of that country and the civil rights enforced were those given by that law. Here there is neither contract nor statutory equivalent to annex to the marriage vinculum rights of property in the terms of the New Hampshire statute.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Arthur B\u00e9langer.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Drouin, Drouin & Lebel.\n[1] [1900] A.C. 21.\n[2] [1938] S.C.R. 354.\n[3] [1930] A.C. 79.\n[4] [1900] A.C. 21.\n[5] [1938] S.C.R. 354.\n"}

One of the automobiles belonging to one Gignac and driven by his employee Pelchat was going in a northerly direction, and the other automobile owned by the respondent Alexander Wise, and in charge of his brother, the other respondent, was proceeding towards the west on Sherbrooke street. At that intersection, the traffic is governed by light signals; and, at the moment of the impact, the respondent's automobile, as well as the appellant's son, had the right of way, the green light being in their favour. It was also proven that Gignac's automobile was hit on the right side, a few inches behind the rear axle. After the collision, the appellant's son was found under a tramway facing a southerly direction, but which had stopped in obedience to the red signal. On behalf of his son, the appellant brought an action for damages against the owners and drivers of both automobiles. The trial judge condemned the respondents and Pelchat jointly and severally to $17,447.20, but dismissed the action against Gignac on the ground that, at the moment of the accident, Pelchat was not in the performance of his employment. The appellate court, allowing the respondents' appeal, dismissed the action as to them. The appeal against Gignac before that court is still pending, Pelchat having filed no appeal.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from, that, upon the evidence, the respondents have committed no fault; and, also, that any presumption of fault, if such presumption did exist, has been rebutted by them.\nSubsection 2 of section 53 of the Motor Vehicles Act (R.S.Q., 1925, c. 35) provides that \"Whenever loss or damage is sustained by any person by reason of a motor vehicle on a public highway, the burden of proof that such loss or damage did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver of such motor vehicle shall be upon such owner or driver\".\nPer the Chief Justice and Taschereau J.: The presumption which the law thus creates is not a presumption that the driver of an automobile has caused damage. It is a presumption that he is liable when it is proven that he has caused damage, and he has therefore the onus of showing that he committed no fault which contributed to the accident. But, before such presumption of liability may arise, it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to establish that it is the person, from whom the damage is claimed, that is the author of such damage. There must necessarily exist a relation between the driver of the automobile, and the damage suffered by the victim. And in order to establish such a connection between the driver and the damage suffered, it is not of course necessary in all cases, for the plaintiff, to show that he was struck by defendant's (automobile. It may very well happen, as it does often, that the damage' may be attributed to a driver who does not actually hit the victim', but acts in such a way that he causes another one to run over a pedestrian. But it is only when such or similar facts are shown to exist that the presumption created by section 53 of the Motor Vehicles Act starts to operate, because then only the driver is linked in some way to the mishap. In the present case, nothing of the kind is revealed by the evidence. But, even if such a presumption would exist, it has been rebutted by the respondents.\nPer Kerwin J.: There is no question, as to the person at fault, involved in the construction of section 53 (Maitland v. McKenzie, 28 O.L.R. 506): that is, while the appellant must prove that loss or damage was sustained by reason of respondent's automobile, the tribunal of fact need not determine, so far as the onus is concerned, whether the driver operated the car in a negligent manner or not. There is no evidence that the appellant's son would have been struck by Pelchat's car, even if respondent's car had not been on the highway, and no such inference may properly be drawn. The victim was struck after the collision between the two cars occurred; and the respondents, in view of the evidence on that point, were bound to displace the onus that rested upon them under section 53. But, upon the evidence, the respondents have satisfied such onus.\nPer Hudson J.: The plain meaning of section 53 is that a plaintiff must first satisfy the court that the loss or damage was sustained by reason of the motor vehicle; and, once the court is so satisfied, then the onus is on the defendant (owner or driver) to prove if he can that the loss or damage did not arise through his improper conduct.\nPer Rand J.: Assuming there was such evidence of a nexus in fact between the collision and the injury as to give rise to the statutory presumption against the respondents, and also that their automobile was proceeding through the intersection at a speed greater than that permitted by the civic by-laws or the motor law of the province, there was no evidence of a dangerous speed nor that the driver was negligent after he became aware of the other car. Upon the evidence, the respondents have exculpated themselves from the presumed responsibility enacted by section 53.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Bertrand J. and dismissing the appellant's action against the respondents for damages resulting from injuries sustained by appellant's minor son as a result of a collision between two automobiles, one of them owned by one of the respondents and driven by the other.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nMarcus M. Sperber K.C., Louis Fitch K.C., R. Pinard and C. R. Gross for the appellant.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C., P. Meyerovitch K.C. and N. Charbonneau K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Taschereau J. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014The present case arises out of an automobile accident which occurred on the 5th of December, 1938, at the intersection of Sherbrooke street and St. Lawrence boulevard, in the city of Montreal.\nAppellant's minor son was crossing St. Lawrence boulevard, on the north pedestrian lane, when he was struck and severely injured, after two automobiles had collided at the intersection. One of the automobiles belonging to one Gignac, and driven by his employee Emile Pelchat, was going in a northerly direction, and the other automobile owned by Alexander Wise, and in charge of his brother I. Wise, was proceeding towards the west on Sherbrooke street.\nAt this intersection, the traffic is governed by light signals, and it cannot be disputed that at the moment of the impact, Wise's automobile on Sherbrooke street had the right of way, the green light being in its favour. It is also abundantly proven that Gignac's automobile was hit on the right side, a few inches behind the rear axle. After the collision, appellant's son was found under a tramway facing a southerly direction, but which had stopped in obedience to the red signal.\nIn the Superior Court, Mr. Justice Bertrand condemned Issie Wise, Alex. Wise and Emile Pelchat jointly and severally to $17,447.20, but dismissed the action against Phydime Gignac, on the ground that at the moment of the accident Pelchat, his employee, was not in the performance of his duties.\nThe Court of King's Bench allowed the appeal of Issie Wise and Alex. Wise, and dismissed the action as to them. Pelchat filed no appeal, and the appeal against Gignac is still pending before the Court of King's Bench. We have, therefore, before this Court, to deal only with the liability of Issie and Alexander Wise.\nA very important question raised in this case is whether the legal presumption of article 53 of the Motor Vehicle Act applies against both drivers. This article is as follows:\n(53) (2): Whenever loss or damage is sustained by any person by reason of a motor vehicle on a public highway, the burden of proof that such loss or damage did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver of such motor vehicle, shall be upon such owner or driver.\nThis presumption which the law creates is not a presumption that the driver of an automobile has caused damage. It is a presumption that he is liable when it is proven that he has caused damage, and he has therefore the onus of showing that he committed no fault which contributed to the accident. But before such presumption of liability may arise, it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to establish that it is the person, from whom the damage is claimed, that is the author of such damage.\nThere must necessarily exist a relation between the driver of the automobile, and the damage suffered by the victim. And in order to establish such a connection between the driver and the damage suffered, it is not of course necessary in all cases, for the plaintiff, to show that he was struck by defendant's automobile. It may very well happen, as it does often, that the damage may be attributed to a driver who does not actually hit the victim, but acts in such a way that he causes another one to run over a pedestrian.\nBut it is only when such or similar facts are shown to exist, that the presumption created by article 53 of the Motor Vehicles Act starts to operate, because then only the driver is linked in some way to the mishap. In the present case, nothing of the kind is revealed by the evidence. Before reaching the intersection Wise was invited to cross St. Lawrence boulevard, having the green light in his favour. He was proceeding on the right side of Sherbrooke street, and oncoming traffic prevented him from seeing any car coming on his left. He was also entitled to assume that he had the right of way, and that no one would be imprudent enough to proceed in defiance of the red light. He was acting within his rights, and his assumption was one which would occur to the mind of a reasonable person. It was in complete disregard of the traffic laws, that Gignac's automobile crossed Sherbrooke street. The red signal was against it, and its speed was excessive. I have no doubt, and I agree fully with Mr. Justice Barclay, that it was Gignac's automobile that struck the boy, as a result of this double imprudence. Any other suggestion is untenable.\nGignac's automobile was proceeding north astride the railway tracks, and the boy was right in its path, while Wise's automobile never reached the point where he was walking. It is quite true, that both vehicles came in contact, the front of Wise's automobile hitting the rear end of Gignac's, but this fact did not contribute in any way to the damage done, which has not been suffered by reason of the operation of Wise's automobile. It follows that no presumption of liability lies against the respondents.\nBut even if such a presumption did exist, without hesitation, I come to the conclusion that it has been rebutted by the respondents.\nWise reached the intersection at a very reasonable rate of speed. Seeing the green light, which in certain judgments has been termed \"a command to go ahead\" in heavy traffic, he committed no fault by slightly accelerating his speed. As it has been held in Joseph Eva, Limited v. Reeves[1]:\nWhen therefore a driver entered the cross-roads with the green light in his favour and accelerated to pass, * * * until it was too late to avoid a collision with a vehicle which had entered the crossroads from the left against the red light, he was not guilty of contributory negligence. The respondents have clearly shown that they have committed no fault, and that the sole determining cause of the accident was the imprudent and, I dare say, reckless way in which Gignac's automobile was driven.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nKerwin J.\u2014About half-past four in the afternoon of December 5th, 1938, Jack Boxenbaum was returning home from school, walking on the north side of Sherbrooke street, in the city of Montreal, proceeding easterly. In due course he reached the northwest corner of Sherbrooke street and St. Lawrence boulevard. At the intersection of the street and boulevard, traffic lights had been installed. The one facing Jack was green and he proceeded to cross St. Lawrence boulevard on the north pedestrian lane. There are double street car tracks on Sherbrooke street and St. Lawrence boulevard and on the south-bound, that is westerly, tracks on the boulevard a street car was standing at the northwest corner. Jack walked in front of this street car. It is uncertain how far he had travelled beyond it but one thing is certain and that is that he was struck and flung in front of the standing street car, sustaining severe injuries. On his behalf his father brought an action for damages against the owners and drivers of two automobiles, claiming that under subsection 2 of section 53 of the Quebec Motor Vehicles Act, R.S.Q. 1925, chapter 35, such damages had been sustained by reason of the two motor vehicles on a public highway. One motor vehicle, owned by the respondent Alexander Wise and driven by the respondent Izzy Wise, was proceeding westerly on the north part of Sherbrooke street. While it was crossing the intersection of St. Lawrence boulevard a collision occurred between that car and the other automobile, owned by the defendant Gignac and driven by the defendant Pelchat, which was proceeding northerly in the easterly half of St. Lawrence boulevard.\nIt is convenient at this stage to quote the words of subsection 2 of section 53 of the Motor Vehicles Act as well in the French as in the English version:\n2. Whenever loss or damage is sustained by any person by reason of a motor vehicle on a public highway, the burden of proof that such loss or damage did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver of such motor vehicle shall be upon such owner or driver.\n2. Quand un v\u00e9hicle automobile cause une perte ou un dommage \u00e0 quelque personne dans un chemin public, le fardeau de la preuve que cette perte ou ce dommage n'est pas d\u00fb \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence ou \u00e0 la conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible du propri\u00e9taire Ou de la personne qui conduit ce v\u00e9hicule automobile, incombe au propri\u00e9taire ou \u00e0 la personne qui conduit le v\u00e9hicule automobile.\nIn addition to relying on this enactment, the plaintiff claimed that Jack Boxenbaum was struck by the Pelchat car and alleged specific acts of negligence against the driver of that car as well as the driver of the Wise oar.\nThe trial took place before Mr. Justice Bertrand who determined that the onus section applied; that it was quite clear that Pelchat was negligent and that Izzy Wise had failed to satisfy the onus placed upon him. He also found the latter to be negligent in several respects, which will be adverted to later. Judgment was given for $17,447.20 against Pelchat and Alexander and Izzy Wise but the action was dismissed against Gignac. The plaintiff appealed as to this dismissal and that appeal is still pending before the Court of King's Bench. Pelchat did not appeal but Alexander and Izzy Wise did, and the Court of King's Bench dismissed the action as against them on the ground that the onus section did not apply and that the plaintiff had failed to prove any negligence on their part. Mr. Justice St. Jacques was the only one who stated that even if it did apply the onus had been satisfied.\nFrom that judgment the plaintiff now appeals. While the trial judge made no finding on the point, it must be found on the evidence that the Gignac car, driven by Pelchat, was the one that actually struck the boy. That, however, does not dispose of the point as to whether the loss or damage was also sustained by reason of the Wise motor vehicle on a public highway. Sir William Meredith, speaking on behalf of the Ontario Court of Appeal, in Maitland v. McKenzie[2], with reference to a similar Ontario enactment, stated as to this point at page 510:\nI do not understand that any question as to the person at fault is involved in the determination of it. No different construction should be placed on the Quebec statute because the wording of the French version is \"cause une perte\" while in the English version it is \"by reason of a motor vehicle\". That is, while the plaintiff in this case must prove that loss or damage was sustained by reason of the Wise automobile, the tribunal of fact need not determine, so far as the onus is concerned, whether Izzy Wise operated the car in a negligent manner or not. I never understood that there was ever any question about this proposition. In Juraitis v. Arsenault[3], Mr. Justice MacKinnon referred to the Maitland case (1) and also to a decision of Mr. Justice Mercier in Lalumi\u00e8re v. Durocher[4]. In Carter v. Van Camp[5], Chief Justice Anglin referring to the driver of an automobile which had been in a collision but which had not actually struck a pedestrian on a sidewalk, stated that\na like onus would have rested on Carter as to his responsibility for the collision had it been in issue.\nNot only can I not find any evidence in the record that Jack Boxenbaum would have been struck by the Pelchat car, even if the Wise car had not been on the highway, but in my view no such inference may properly be drawn. The boy was struck after the collision between the two cars occurred, and in my view of the evidence on this point, the respondents were charged with the duty of displacing the onus.\nThe evidence discloses that while Jack Boxenbaum was crossing St. Lawrence boulevard from west to east with the green light, Izzy Wise was crossing the boulevard from east to west. That is, Wise had the right to cross, and with respect to the trial judge who found otherwise, there was no negligence on Wise's part in not anticipating that Pelchat would attempt to cross from south to north with the red light showing against him, or in not seeing Pelchat's car sooner than he did. The only other negligence on the part of Izzy Wise, found by the trial judge, was that he was crossing the intersection at a speed greater than that allowed by subsection 1 of section 41 of the Quebec Motor Vehicles Act as it stood at the time. This provided that\non a curve or steep descent, or at the intersection of roads, or when crossing a bridge, the speed of the motor vehicle shall not exceed eight miles an hour. As judges we are not permitted to consider as unreasonable a limitation of eight miles per hour on a certain street where traffic is heavy and where a motorist is crossing with the green light in his favour, when such limitation has been enacted by competent legislative authority, any more than we could, at some time in the future, consider unreasonable the present limitation of twenty miles per hour as provided by an amendment to the statute enacted since the date of this accident. All that we can do is to apply the law as we find it. The question is, however, whether the speed of the Wise car, in excess of the existing statutory limit, caused or contributed to Jack Boxenbaum's injuries. This is not the same inquiry as to whether they were sustained by reason of the presence of the Wise car on the street. A careful examination of the record has satisfied me that the question should be answered in the negative.\nIn my opinion the respondents have satisfied the onus that rested upon them and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nHudson J.\u2014I have had an opportunity of reading the judgments prepared by my brothers Kerwin and Taschereau and agree with them that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSome question has arisen about the interpretation to be placed upon subsection 2 of section 53 of the Motor Vehicles Act which reads as follows:\nWhenever loss or damage is sustained by any person by reason of a motor vehicle on a public highway, the burden of proof that such loss or damage did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver of such motor vehicle, shall be upon such owner or driver.\nIt seems to me that the plain meaning of this provision is that the plaintiff must first satisfy the court that the loss or damage was sustained by reason of the motor vehicle. Once the court is so satisfied, then the onus is on the defendant (owner or driver) to prove if he can that the loss or damage did not arise through his improper conduct.\nThe first question is a clear question of fact and, in the present case, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff established that the loss or damage was sustained by reason of the defendant's motor vehicle but, even if I am wrong in this, I am of the opinion that on the evidence it has been established that the injuries to the plaintiff's son did not arise through any improper conduct of the defendant Wise.\nRand J.\u2014For the purposes of this appeal I assume there is such evidence of a nexus in fact between the collision and the injury as gives rise to the statutory presumption against the respondents; and also that their automobile was proceeding through the intersection at a speed greater than that permitted by the by-law of the city or the motor law of the province. There is no evidence of a dangerous speed nor that the driver was negligent after he became aware of the other car. The question then is whether the respondents have exculpated themselves from that presumed responsibility.\nThe westbound oar was running on a green light and the driver was under no duty to anticipate one coming from a cross direction. The sudden and illegal incursion of the northbound car proceeding in the face of a red signal can be taken only as la new and intervening agency. The consequences chargeable to it are those naturally and directly resulting from its impact on the conditions present on Sherbrooke street. In other words, the Pelchat car undertook to cut across a stream of traffic; the only part played by the westbound car was to deflect its course; and the mere fact that the speed of the westbound car exceeded eight miles per hour was quite insufficient to convert it from a circumstance to be expected by Pelchat to a new force of culpability. Treating the speed restriction as a measure of safety toward the son of the appellant, its contravention carried no casual connection with the son's injury. The sole legal cause of the accident remained the intrusion of the Pelchat car upon ordinary street conditions, producing the injury and bringing upon itself liability. The appeal, therefore, should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Sperber & Godine.\nSolicitors for the respondents: P. Meyerovitch, N.

Savard (Defendant in Warranty and Plaintiff in Sub-Warranty).\n1944: March 21, 22; 1944: June 22.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Hudson, Taschereau and Rand JJ.\nNegligence\u2014Injury to pedestrian\u2014Icy sidewalk\u2014Action against owner of building fronting it\u2014Intervention by contractor who undertook to keep sidewalk in good condition\u2014Liability of owner and contractor either under article 1053 C.C. or under city charter and by-laws\u2014Admission by intervenant that care and maintenance of sidewalk under responsibility of defendant\u2014Effect to be given to such admission.\nThe respondent, having suffered injuries through falling on an icy sidewalk in the city of Quebec, brought action against the owner of the premises in front of which she had fallen. The owner called in warranty his tenant who by the terms of the lease engaged himself to the maintenance of, and the removal of snow from, the sidewalk. The tenant in turn called in sub-warranty the appellant who had contracted with him to keep the sidewalk in proper condition and to protect him from claims for damages arising from sidewalk conditions. The owner, defendant, did not put any plea; but the appellant in his place intervened and contested the claim on its merits. The principal grounds urged by the appellant was that neither under the provisions of the city charter nor the by-laws passed under it was there a duty on the owner, defendant, to keep the sidewalk free from the danger of ice and snow, and, in its absence, there was no liability either under the charter or under articles 1053 or 1054 of the Civil Code. But the appellant admitted a paragraph of the statement of claim, where it was alleged that the sidewalk was the property of the defendant and that both the defendant and his lessee engaged themselves to provide for its care and maintenance. The respondent's action was dismissed by the trial judge; and the appellate court reversed that judgment, assessing the damages suffered by the respondent at the sum of $1,882.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from, that the injury to the respondent was caused by the dangerous state of the sidewalk for which the defendant, the proprietor of the abutting land, must be held responsible. Under the circumstances of the case, the respondent's action was rightly brought against the owner of the building fronting the sidewalk, under the provisions of the city charter and of the by-laws' passed under it.\nHeld, further, that this Court must give effect to the explicit admission made by the appellant; and from the admitted fact that the care and the maintenance of the sidewalk were under the responsibility of the defendant results necessarily the appellant's liability in case of negligence or fault on his part in the execution of his obligation, so admitted, under his contract with defendant, thus giving rise to the application of article 1052 C.C.\u2014Rand J. expressing no opinion.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Gibsone J., and maintaining the respondent's action for damages resulting from injuries suffered through falling on an icy sidewalk in the city of Quebec.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nAndr\u00e9 Taschereau K.C. and Wilfrid Desjardins K.C. for the appellant.\nAlphonse Pouliot K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of The Chief Justice and of Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014L'appelant dans son intervention a admis\nque le trottoir sur lequel l'accident a eu lieu \u00e9tait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du d\u00e9fendeur sous la garde et l'entretien non seulement du d\u00e9fendeur, mais aussi sous la garde et l'entretien du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 et locataire du d\u00e9fendeur.\nC'\u00e9tait l\u00e0 une des all\u00e9gations de la d\u00e9claration et l'appelant, en intervenant \u00e0 la suite de l'action en arri\u00e8re garantie, a formellement admis cette all\u00e9gation.\nIl y a peut-\u00eatre dans cette admission certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de droit, mais elle comporte au moins trois faits: que le trottoir \u00e9tait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du d\u00e9fendeur, qu'il \u00e9tait sous sa garde et qu'il en avait l'entretien.\nSi l'admission a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par erreur, l'intervenant aurait pu demander d'\u00eatre autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9tracter. Il ne l'a pas fait. Cette admission est rest\u00e9e intacte jusqu'\u00e0 maintenant.\nLa demanderesse-intim\u00e9e avait indiscutablement le droit de l'invoquer et de conduire son enqu\u00eate en cons\u00e9quence. Cela lui permettait d'omettre la preuve de circonstances et d'autres faits qu'elle aurait pu autrement \u00e9tablir, ou de faire valoir des arguments qui auraient autrement \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 sa disposition. La Cour ne saurait maintenant \u00e9viter de tenir compte de cette admission. Or, du fait de la garde et de l'obligation d'entretenir le trottoir r\u00e9sulte n\u00e9cessairement la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'appelant au cas de n\u00e9gligence ou de faute de sa part dans l'ex\u00e9cution de l'obligation ainsi admise. Cela donne ouverture \u00e0 l'application de l'article 1053 du Code civil.\nMais en plus, l'on ne saurait dire que l'admission de l'intervenant va \u00e0 rencontre de la loi ou des r\u00e8glements qui r\u00e9gissent la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec.\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 l'article 417 de la charte de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, 1929 (Statuts de Qu\u00e9bec, 19 Geo. V, chap. 95), d\u00e9cr\u00e9tait que\ndans toutes les rues de la cit\u00e9, les trottoirs doivent \u00eatre faits, entretenus et r\u00e9par\u00e9s par le propri\u00e9taire de chaque immeuble ou terrain vis-\u00e0-vis duquel ils doivent \u00eatre.\nEt si le propri\u00e9taire n\u00e9glige de faire, refaire, entretenir ou r\u00e9parer les trottoirs, alors, \u00e0 la suite de l'accomplissement de certaines formalit\u00e9s, la cit\u00e9 peut faire les travaux et en recouvrer le co\u00fbt du propri\u00e9taire.\nPuis, l'article 437 de la charte, tel qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9 par le statut 1 Geo. VI, chap. 102, \u00e9dicte ce qui suit:\n437. A compter du moment o\u00f9 les chemins et rues dans la cit\u00e9 sont couverts de neige, les propri\u00e9taires, locataires ou occupants de maisons, emplacements ou terrains vacants dans la cit\u00e9, sont tenus de r\u00e9parer et entretenir leurs chemins et rues bornant, de quelque c\u00f4t\u00e9 que ce soit, leur terrain, maison, b\u00e2tisse, conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8glements alors en vigueur, et ce, tant et aussi longtemps que lesdits chemins, mes et ruelles publiques seront ainsi recouverts de neige en tout ou en partie.\nL'intim\u00e9e a de plus attir\u00e9 notre attention sur le r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 227 concernant l'entretien des rues pendant l'hiver. Ce r\u00e8glement n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9 que le 23 d\u00e9cembre 1942 et \u00e9tait donc en vigueur au moment de l'accident, Il se lit comme suit:\nTout propri\u00e9taire, locataire, occupant, ou toute personne ayant la garde, le soin, ou l'administration, d'aucune maison, d'aucun b\u00e2timent, terrain, ou de partie d'iceux, dans les limites de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, born\u00e9 par ou joignant de quelque c\u00f4t\u00e9 que ce soit une rue, ruelle, place publique, ou par un passage, sera tenu:\nD'enlever toute neige ou glace exc\u00e9dant quatre pouces de hauteur sur la moiti\u00e9 de la largeur de la rue, ruelle, ou du passage, bornant ou joignant telle maison ou tel b\u00e2timent, ou terrain, ou partie d'iceux, dans les quarante-huit heures qui suivront chaque chute de neige. De niveler la neige ou la glace, au cas o\u00f9 elle n'exc\u00e9dera pas quatre pouces de hauteur sur la moiti\u00e9 de la largeur de telle rue, ruelle, ou de tel passage.\nDe faire couper ou piocher, abattre ou dispara\u00eetre tout trou, cavit\u00e9, cahot, ou toute pente sur telle moiti\u00e9 de rue comme susdit, dans les vingt-quatre heures apr\u00e8s la formation de tel trou, cavit\u00e9, cahot ou pente.\nA notre avis, ce r\u00e8glement a pour effet de mettre les trottoirs \u00e0 la charge et \u00e0 l'entretien du propri\u00e9taire riverain. Sans doute le r\u00e8glement sp\u00e9cifie certains d\u00e9tails auxquels le propri\u00e9taire sera astreint, mais d'une fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale il stipule que pendant l'hiver le propri\u00e9taire aura l'entretien du trottoir. Il est du m\u00eame ordre que l'article 437 que nous venons de citer.\nLa cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, en vertu de sa charte, a, en plus, le pouvoir d'obliger le propri\u00e9taire ou occupant de tout immeuble \u00e0 tenir les trottoirs en front de cet immeuble libre d'obstruction et \u00e0 imposer une contribution fonci\u00e8re afin de d\u00e9frayer le co\u00fbt de l'entretien des trottoirs durant l'hiver \"sur toutes les ou certaines sections de la cit\u00e9\". Pour pr\u00e9venir les accidents en hiver, r\u00e9sultant de l'accumulation de la neige ou de la glace, elle peut d\u00e9terminer la mani\u00e8re dont les trottoirs seront entretenus.\nEt la cit\u00e9 peut d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter qu'elle se chargera de l'enl\u00e8vement de la neige ou de la glace dans les rues ou dans quelques-unes, ou dans certaines parties de ses rues, ainsi que sur les trottoirs de ses rues ou parties de rues. C'est le paragraphe 154 de l'article 336 de la charte.\nLa cit\u00e9 s'est pr\u00e9value de l'autorisation qui lui \u00e9tait ainsi donn\u00e9e et elle a adopt\u00e9 les r\u00e8glements nos 285 et 388. En vertu du premier, elle a pris \u00e0 sa charge l'enl\u00e8vement de la neige et de la glace dans certaines rues qui y sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es; la rue o\u00f9 l'accident est arriv\u00e9 n'est pas comprise dans cette \u00e9num\u00e9ration.\nAu surplus, le r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 388 d\u00e9cr\u00e8te:\n(4) Le grattage des trottoirs sera fait par les propri\u00e9taires et non par la cit\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment aux prescriptions de la charte et des r\u00e8glements de la cit\u00e9;\n(5) Le service du soufflage de la neige, lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 par un r\u00e8glement de ce conseil, comporte le grattage de la neige tel que ci-dessus, et son enl\u00e8vement en la soufflant sur des terrains vacants;\n(6) En pareil cas, les propri\u00e9taires ne sont plus soumis \u00e0 l'obligation de charroyer la neige, mais ils n'en sont pas moins tenus \u00e0 l'entretien de leurs trottoirs, ainsi qu'au coupage de la neige ou de la glace lorsqu'elle exc\u00e8de le niveau de quatre pouces pr\u00e9vu par les r\u00e8glements de la cit\u00e9. Malgr\u00e9 que ce r\u00e8glement ne s'applique qu'aux rues dont la cit\u00e9 a pris charge, le paragraphe 6 vient confirmer que les propri\u00e9taires riverains \"sont tenus \u00e0 l'entretien de leurs trottoirs\" et que ce r\u00e9gime est bien celui qui a force et vigueur dans la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec. Cela, d'ailleurs, nous para\u00eet conforme \u00e0 la jurisprudence constante.\nSans doute, les textes pourraient \u00eatre plus pr\u00e9cis. Ils gagneraient \u00e0 \u00eatre \u00e9claircis, mais il r\u00e9sulte quand m\u00eame que, sur la question qui nous occupe, tout ce que l'on peut trouver dans les r\u00e8glements sur lesquels on a attir\u00e9 notre attention et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits favorise la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9e et que rien ne vient \u00e0 l'appui de la version de l'appelant.\nSur les faits de n\u00e9gligence ou sur le quantum des dommages, il n'y a pas lieu d'intervenir en l'esp\u00e8ce.\nDans les circonstances, tant en vertu de l'admission de l'appelant qu'en vertu de la charte et des r\u00e8glements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9s au dossier, nous croyons que le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 et que l'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nRand J.\u2014The respondent suffered injuries through falling on an icy sidewalk in the city of Quebec. She brought action against the owner of the premises in front of which she had fallen. The owner called in warranty his tenant who by the terms of the lease engaged himself to the maintenance of and the removal of snow from the sidewalk. The tenant in turn called in sub-warranty the appellant Caron who had contracted with him to keep the sidewalk in proper condition and to protect him from claims for damages arising from sidewalk conditions. The owner did not defend but the appellant in his place intervened and contested the claim on its merits. The Superior Court dismissed the action but on appeal this was reversed.\nThe principal ground urged before us was that neither under the provisions of the city charter nor the by-laws was there a duty on the defendant to keep the sidewalk free from the danger of ice and snow, and in its absence there was no liability either under the charter or under sections 1053 or 1054 of the Civil Code.\nI entertain no doubt that any duty of the defendant must be found in the charter. No provision of the Code has been suggested which raises it. By a statute passed by the legislature of the province of Lower Canada in 1799 certain responsibilities were imposed on the inhabitants of what were then the towns of Montreal and Quebec, at that time not incorporated, in relation to the repair and upkeep of highways in winter: but this enactment was superseded in 1850 by Vic. 13-14, province of Canada, chapter 15, which, for the purpose of removing all doubt with regard to roads and highways within the limits of the cities and towns of the province, provided that the right to the use of the public highways should be vested in the municipal corporations, that the highways should be maintained and kept in proper repair by them, and that they should be under a civil liability for all damages arising from default in that duty.\nThe sections of the city charter, which deal with the making and upkeep of streets and sidewalks, exhibit a patchwork of provisions but, taken together, they do not appear to leave much doubt as to their meaning or effect. Section 417 is as follows:\nThe sidewalks in all the streets of the city shall be made, kept up and repaired by the proprietor of each immoveable or property fronting on such sidewalk. If such proprietor neglects to make, keep up, repair or renew such sidewalks, as the case may be, the chief of police shall give him notice in writing to do what is necessary to such sidewalks. This notice shall be addressed to or left at the domicile of such proprietor, if he is a resident of the city, or at the house of the occupant of the said immoveable, if the proprietor does not reside in the city; if the immoveable has no occupant, then the notice is not necessary.\nIf, within eight days following the notice, the works required to be done to the said sidewalks have not been done, then such works shall be done by the corporation, which may compel the proprietor to reimburse the cost thereof. This sum is recoverable as a tax, and in the same manner, and with the same privileges as all other taxes imposed upon real estate in the city; but the proprietor, except in cases of express agreement to the contrary, has no right to oblige his tenant to reimburse him any portion whatever of the same.\nThat language is undoubtedly broad enough to apply to maintenance in respect of snow or ice on the sidewalk: The City of Sydney v. Slaney[1], where Duff J. (as he then was), used the following language:\nIt has repeatedly been decided that natural accumulations of snow and ice on a highway may amount to disrepair within the meaning of statutes requiring municipalities to keep highways in repair. There, as here, the injured person had fallen on a sidewalk in a slippery condition and the language of the statute imposing the duty of repair on the city was in substance the same as section 417. Under that section, therefore, the responsibility of the abutting proprietors for the maintenance and repair of the sidewalks in front of their lands extends to conditions of danger brought about by snow and ice, and it is unconditional.\nIts scope, however, is simply that steps and measures reasonable under the circumstances be taken to keep the sidewalks, in a practical sense, safe for use. Matters of time, weather, and of feasibility may properly be taken into account in determining whether the duty has been met, and evidence of that mature was adduced here. From a consideration of it, however, I am not prepared to differ with the court below in the finding that the injury to the plaintiff was caused by the dangerous state of the sidewalk for which the proprietor of the abutting land must be held responsible.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Wilfrid Desjardins.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Pouliot & Bourget.\n[1] (1919) 59 Can, S.C.R. 232, at 235.\n"}

The debtors being unable to meet their obligations, the appellant company (made with them a settlement called \"assignment and transfer of assets\". The debtors, by that agreement, transferred to the appellant all their assets, including a bottling machine as described in a contract of conditional sale passed between the debtors and the vendor. In consideration of the transfer, the appelant company undertook to pay their debts; and the debtors bound themselves to pay off a lien still existing on the machinery amounting to $1,917.70, at the rate of $60 per month and to reimburse the appellant company the monies paid by it to clear off their debts. Later on, the appellant company took proceedings against the defendant and the mis-en-cause and asked for the cancellation of the agreement on the ground that they had failed to fulfill their obligations under it. The defendant alone contested the appellant's action, alleging mainly that it was the latter that had not fulfilled its obligations by not paying the respondent's debts. The trial judge maintained the appellant company's action, which judgment was reversed by the appellate court. The mis-en-cause filed an appearance but did not plead to the action, so that judgment was rendered against him ex-parte; and he did not appeal, although made a mis-en-cause by the defendant before the appellate court. The notice of appeal before this Court was served only upon the defendant's attorneys. The defendant urged, as a ground of appeal before this Court, that the judgment of the appellate court refusing to annul the contract constituted res judicata as to the mis-en-cause and that, as to the defendant, the contract could no be annulled because his co-signer has not been served with a notice of appeal before this Court. But, before the hearing of the appeal, this Court granted a motion by the appellant company that Pelletier be put into the case as third party.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from and restoring the judgment of the trial judge, that, upon the facts of the case, an action for annulment of the agreement was the proper remedy to be exercised by the appellant, that the defendant and the mis-en-cause were the first who failed to fulfill their obligations and that consequently the appellant company was justified in discontinuing to pay their debts: the appellant company was not bound to fulfill its own obligations when the defendant and the mis-en-cause were refusing or neglecting to fulfill theirs.\nHeld, also, that the mis-en-cause Pelletier was regularly before this Court and that a judgment annulling the contract between the appellant company and the two defendants before the trial court could validly be rendered by this Court. The appellant company, by being granted its demand to put Pelletier as mis-en-cause in the appeal before this Court, has been relieved of any forfeiture which it may have incurred by not serving to Pelletier a notice of appeal to this Court. Moreover, a statement signed by Pelletier that he did not intend to appear nor to plead was produced by him before this Court, and, nevertheless, he filed a factum and was represented by counsel at the hearing. The decision of this Court in La Corporation de la Paroisse de St-Gervais v. Goulet ([1931] S.C.R. 437) does not apply, as the facts in that appeal were totally different from those in the present appeal.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Cousineau Louis J. and dismissing the appellant's action in annulment of an agreement passed between the appellant and the defendants.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nEug\u00e8ne Simard for the appellant.\nUbald Boisvert for the respondent.\nLucien B\u00e9liveau K.C. for the mis-en-cause.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014L'appelante, manufacturi\u00e8re d'eaux gazeuses, \u00e9tait cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re du d\u00e9fendeur et du mis en cause, les distributeurs de ses produits dans la r\u00e9gion de Sherbrooke, en une somme de $2,966.52. Vu l'incapacit\u00e9 des d\u00e9biteurs de rencontrer cette obligation, les parties en sont venues \u00e0 un compromis et ont sign\u00e9 une entente dont les termes ne sont pas tr\u00e8s clairs.\nLe premier paragraphe de ce contrat que l\u00e9s parties ont appel\u00e9 une \"cession et transport de valeurs\" stipule qu'\nen consid\u00e9ration d'une dette globale de $2,966.52, due \u00e0 J.

Antonio Piette.\nEn consid\u00e9ration de ce transport qui lui \u00e9tait fait, l'appelante s'est oblig\u00e9e de payer les dettes de l'intim\u00e9 et du mis en cause, au montant de $744.54. Cependant, il existait un lien sur les machineries en faveur du vendeur Brown's Bottle Exchange Inc. au montant de $1,917.70, mais Piette et Pelletier ont convenu \u00e0 l'\u00e9crit de payer cette dette \u00e0 raison de $60 par mois, et ils ont en outre contract\u00e9 l'obligation de rembourser \u00e0 l'appelante tous les paiements que celle-ci ferait pour acquitter les dettes dues \u00e0 leurs cr\u00e9anciers. Enfin, en vertu de r\u00e9crit, un territoire dans la r\u00e9gion de Montr\u00e9al a \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9s afin de leur permettre de continuer la vente et la distribution des eaux gazeuses de l'appelante.\nLe 20 mars 1941, l'appelante a institu\u00e9 action contre Piette et Pelletier, et a demand\u00e9 l'annulation du contrat ci-dessus parce que les d\u00e9fendeurs n'auraient pas rempli les obligations qu'ils avaient contract\u00e9es. Seul, le d\u00e9fendeur Piette a contest\u00e9. L'honorable juge Cousineau de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu cette action, a en cons\u00e9quence r\u00e9sili\u00e9 le contrat et a donn\u00e9 acte \u00e0 la demanderesse de son offre de remettre le truck et la marchandise qu'elle avait re\u00e7us. Devant la Cour du Banc du Roi, l'appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenu et l'action rejet\u00e9e. C'est de ce jugement qu'il y a appel devant cette Cour.\nIl ne peut y avoir de doute qu'imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s la signature du contrat intervenu, chacune des parties a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 remplir ses obligations. Les intim\u00e9s ont remis la marchandise ainsi que le truck \u00e0 l'appelante, tel que convenu, et ont \u00e9galement remis la clef de l'endroit o\u00f9 se trouvait la machinerie n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'embouteillage. L'appelante, suivant les obligations qu'elle avait contract\u00e9es, a pay\u00e9 une partie des dettes des intim\u00e9s.\nElle a ainsi pay\u00e9 une somme de $316.96, mais, depuis le 23 juillet 1940 \u00e0 octobre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, les intim\u00e9s n'ont pay\u00e9 \u00e0 Brown's Bottle Exchange Inc., pour lib\u00e9rer le lien qui affectait la machinerie, qu'une somme de $14.45, au lieu de $60 par mois, tel que convenu \u00e0 la convention intervenue. Et comme cons\u00e9quence, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9s de remettre \u00e0 Brown's Bottle Exchange Inc. les machineries en question, en dation en paiement. L'appelante a alors discontinu\u00e9 de payer les dettes des intim\u00e9s et c'est alors qu'elle a institu\u00e9 l'action en r\u00e9siliation de contrat.\nCette convention intervenue entre les parties a un caract\u00e8re particulier, et il semble impossible de la ranger au nombre des contrats nomm\u00e9s. Certains ont cru voir dans le transport de la marchandise, du truck et de la machinerie, par les intim\u00e9s \u00e0 l'appelante, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la vente, et ont invoqu\u00e9 l'article 1512 C.C. pour conclure que le recours de l'appelante n'est pas une demande en rescision du contrat, mais se limite \u00e0 exiger le remboursement du prix de la machinerie, dont l'appelante aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vinc\u00e9e.\nJe ne puis accepter cette pr\u00e9tention. Pour' obtenir ce transport qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, l'appelante a assum\u00e9 certaines obligations, et a peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 sa cr\u00e9ance, ce qui cependant n'est pas du tout certain.\nEn admettant la pr\u00e9tention des intim\u00e9s, c'est le prix que l'appelant aurait pay\u00e9. Pour obtenir le remboursement de ce prix, il faut de toute n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qu'elle se fasse lib\u00e9rer par le tribunal de l'obligation de remplir ses engagements, et aussi qu'elle obtienne que sa cr\u00e9ance contre les intim\u00e9s revive. Ce r\u00e9sultat ne peut \u00eatre atteint que par une action en annulation du contrat.\nLes obligations diverses, toutes li\u00e9es les unes aux autres, que fait na\u00eetre cette entente, portent \u00e0 croire qu'il s'agit plut\u00f4t d'un contrat innomm\u00e9, sui generis, qui doit \u00eatre r\u00e9gi par les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux des obligations. Les parties ont assum\u00e9 des obligations r\u00e9ciproques, comprises dans un tout qui ne peut \u00eatre divis\u00e9, et qui doit \u00eatre maintenu ou annul\u00e9 dans son ensemble. Un semblable contrat contient un pacte commissoire, une clause tacite de r\u00e9solution. L'article 1184 du Code Napol\u00e9on a sur ce sujet une disposition expresse que notre Code ne contient pas, mais il est bien admis chez nous, que si l'une des parties n'ex\u00e9cute point son obligation, l'autre n'est pas tenu d'ex\u00e9cuter la sienne, et la r\u00e9solution peut \u00eatre demand\u00e9e et prononc\u00e9e par le tribunal.\nDans la cause qui nous est soumise, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que l'appelante, et c'est d'ailleurs la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle le juge de premi\u00e8re instance en est arriv\u00e9, a rempli toutes ses obligations. Elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 payer les dettes des intim\u00e9s s'\u00e9levant \u00e0 $744.54, jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de $316.96. Ce n'est que lorsqu'elle a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 que les intim\u00e9s ne remplissaient pas leurs propres obligations qu'elle a discontinu\u00e9 de faire les paiements, comme elle avait convenu, et avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je suis d'opinion qu'elle avait raison d'agir ainsi. En effet, les intim\u00e9s, comme nous l'avons vu, avaient transport\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelante la machinerie n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'embouteillage, laquelle machinerie avait une valeur de $3,000, mais sur laquelle il existait en faveur de Brown's Bottle Exchange Inc. un lien au montant de $1,917.70, qui permettait au vendeur de la reprendre \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de paiement. L'appelante croyait sans doute que lorsque les intim\u00e9s auraient rempli leur obligation de payer $60 par mois, cette machinerie, libre de tout lien, lui servirait \u00e0 se payer de sa cr\u00e9ance. Au lieu d'agir ainsi, les intim\u00e9s, du 23 juillet 1940 \u00e0 octobre 1940, n'ont pay\u00e9 que la somme de $14.45, avec le r\u00e9sultat que la Brown's Bottle Exchange Inc. a repris la machinerie.\nPiette et Pelletier pr\u00e9tendent que cette dation en paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 la connaissance de l'appelante. Il est certain que celle-ci le savait, mais ceci ne peut pas affecter le r\u00e9sultat du litige. Comment en effet pouvait-elle emp\u00eacher le cr\u00e9ancier de reprendre son bien, s'il n'\u00e9tait pas pay\u00e9? La seule fa\u00e7on e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 pour l'appelante de payer elle-m\u00eame la dette due \u00e0 Brown's Bottle Exchange Inc., mais l'appelante n'avait pas contract\u00e9 cette obligation qui, au contraire, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 assum\u00e9e par le d\u00e9fendeur et le mis-en-cause.\nLes intim\u00e9s ont aussi soutenu qu'en consentant en faveur de Brown's Bottle Exchange Inc. cette dation en paiement, leur obligation vis-\u00e0-vis de l'appelante \u00e9tait remplie, vu que Brown's Bottle Exchange Inc. n'avait plus de r\u00e9clamation contre eux.\nJe ne puis partager cette mani\u00e8re de voir. L'obligation des intim\u00e9s \u00e9tait de payer $60 par mois, afin de faire dispara\u00eetre le lien sur cette machinerie. En faisant cette dation en paiement, ou cette remise \u00e0 Brown's Bottle Exchange Inc., les intim\u00e9s ont sans doute ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 l'obligation assum\u00e9e vis-\u00e0-vis de leur cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re, mais, certes, pas celle \u00e0 laquelle ils \u00e9taient tenus envers l'appelante.\nIl me semble clair que les intim\u00e9s ont failli \u00e0 leur obligation les premiers, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence l'appelante \u00e9tait justifiable de discontinuer de payer leurs dettes. Elle n'\u00e9tait pas tenue d'ex\u00e9cuter ses propres obligations quand les intim\u00e9s refusaient ou n\u00e9gligeaient de remplir les leurs.\nC'est avec raison que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a r\u00e9sili\u00e9 le contrat et a donn\u00e9 acte \u00e0 l'appelante de son offre de remettre la marchandise, ainsi que le truck.\nLes intim\u00e9s invoquent un second moyen pour faire rejeter le pr\u00e9sent appel. L'action de l'appelante-demanderesse a \u00e9t\u00e9 dirig\u00e9e \u00e0 la fois contre Piette et Pelletier. Piette a comparu par ses procureurs, et Pelletier a aussi comparu par l'interm\u00e9diaire des siens, mais seul le premier a produit un plaidoyer \u00e0 l'action, et le jugement contre le dernier a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu ex parte. Piette a appel\u00e9 en Cour du Banc du Roi du jugement qui a ainsi annul\u00e9 le contrat, et son inscription a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 MM. Trudel, Simard et Beaudet, avocats de J. Christin & Cie Lt\u00e9e, ainsi qu'\u00e0 Mtres Leblanc et Filion qui, en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, avaient comparu pour Philippe Pelletier. Ce dernier n'a pas produit d'inscription en appel, mais \u00e9tait mis-en-cause en Cour du Banc du Roi.\nComme r\u00e9sultat du jugement rendu par la Cour du Banc du Roi, l'appel de Piette fut maintenu, et ce jugement a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 non seulement \u00e0 Piette mais aussi \u00e0 Pelletier. Devant cette Cour, l'avis d'appel de Christin n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 qu'aux procureurs de Piette.\nOn pr\u00e9tend que le jugement de la Cour du Banc de Roi, refusant de r\u00e9silier le contrat, constitue chose jug\u00e9e quant \u00e0 Pelletier, et que quant \u00e0 Piette le contrat ne peut pas \u00eatre annul\u00e9, vu que son cosignataire n'a pas re\u00e7u signification de l'avis d'appel.\nA l'appui de cette pr\u00e9tention, on a cit\u00e9 la cause de La Corporation de la Paroisse de St-Gervais vs Goulet[1]. Je ne crois pas que cette cause puisse avoir d'application, car les faits en cette affaire \u00e9taient diff\u00e9rents. Le demandeur Goulet avait pris une action contre la corporation de la paroisse de St-Gervais et contre certains entrepreneurs, pour faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 un r\u00e8glement adopt\u00e9 par la corporation municipale de St-Gervais, ainsi qu'un contrat intervenu entre ladite corporation et les entrepreneurs. En Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, l'action du demandeur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. Le demandeur Goulet interjeta appel de ce jugement, mais contre la corporation de la paroisse d\u00e9 St-Gervais seulement, de sorte que, devant la Cour du Banc du Roi, les entrepreneurs n'\u00e9taient pas parties au litige. La Cour du Banc du Roi a renvers\u00e9 le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance et a annul\u00e9 le contrat. Cette Cour a alors d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la Cour du Banc du Roi ne pouvait pas annuler ce contrat entre la corporation de la paroisse de St-Gervais et les entrepreneurs, parce que ces derniers n'\u00e9taient pas parties devant la cour d'appel. Et M. le juge Rinfret, parlant pour cette Cour, a dit:\nOr, dans l'esp\u00e8ce, les entrepreneurs n'\u00e9taient pas devant la Cour du Banc du Roi, et il n'est plus possible de les mettre en cause parce que, en ce qui les concerne, nonobstant l'appel contre la corporation municipale, la premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision conserve toute sa force et a acquis l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e. Ils ne peuvent plus \u00eatre appel\u00e9s \u00e0 venir d\u00e9fendre des contrats qui, \u00e0 leur profit, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finitivement jug\u00e9s valides.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause, la situation est enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rente. Les d\u00e9fendeurs n'ont pas entre eux un contrat qu'un tiers veut faire d\u00e9clarer ill\u00e9gal et nul, mais ils sont tous deux signataires, conjoints et solidaires, \u00e0 un contrat avec J. Christin & Cie Lt\u00e9e. Il y a de leur part, unit\u00e9 d'obligation, et des moyens de d\u00e9fense communs.\nIl est vrai que Pelletier n'a pas re\u00e7u signification de l'avis d'appel en Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, mais ceci n'emp\u00eache pas, je crois, cette Cour d'annuler le contrat intervenu.\nLa r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est \u00e0 l'effet que lorsqu'une d\u00e9cision est frapp\u00e9e d'appel par quelques parties seulement qui figuraient au proc\u00e8s, la d\u00e9cision d'une cour d'appel n'a d'effet qu'\u00e0 leur \u00e9gard. Le jugement concernant les parties qui n'ont pas appel\u00e9, se trouve \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e. L'inverse est \u00e9galement vrai, et l'appel interjet\u00e9 contre l'une des parties, comme dans le cas qui nous occupe, n'emp\u00eache pas la d\u00e9cision d'avoir l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e au profit des parties qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 intim\u00e9es.\nTelle est l'opinion \u00e9mise par plusieurs auteurs, entre autres par Glasson & Tissier (Trait\u00e9 de proc\u00e9dure civile, vol. 3, page 298), mais ils disent aussi que la jurisprudence en France admet une premi\u00e8re exception \u00e0 ce principe, lorsque le litige est indivisible, c'est-\u00e0-dire lorsque l'indivisibilit\u00e9 absolue de l'objet litigieux rendrait impossible l'ex\u00e9cution simultan\u00e9e des deux d\u00e9cisions. En ce cas, l'appel interjet\u00e9 par le cr\u00e9ancier \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une des parties vaut \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de toutes.\nC'est aussi l'opinion de Japiot (Proc\u00e9dure civile et commerciale, page 638). Voici ce que dit cet auteur:\nLe principe est toujours constitu\u00e9 par la relativit\u00e9 de l'effet de l'appel: l'appel n'a d'effet, ne permettra de conclure devant la Cour et de faire r\u00e9former par celle-ci le jugement au profit de l'appelant, que contre celles des parties adverses contre lesquelles l'appel aura \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9. Pour le cas d'invisibilit\u00e9, la jurisprudence apporte la m\u00eame exception au principe de la relativit\u00e9 et d\u00e9cide que l'appel form\u00e9 contre un des copropri\u00e9taire, par exemple, permettra la r\u00e9formation du jugement m\u00eame au d\u00e9triment de l'autre.\nDans une cause de Montreal Agencies Ltd. vs. Kimpton[2], M. le juge Rinfret, parlant pour la Cour, a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 cette th\u00e9orie de Japiot qu'il semble accepter implicitement.\nGlasson & Tissier ajoutent, \u00e0 la page 301, que l\u2019on doit consid\u00e9rer comme indivisible (et ils citent \u00e0 l'appui une jurisprudence constante), entre autres, la demande en nullit\u00e9 d'une vente ou d'un testament, de m\u00eame que l'action possessoire dirig\u00e9e contre plusieurs copropri\u00e9taires indivis.\nMais, il ne faudrait pas croire, parce que la mati\u00e8re est indivisible, que le cr\u00e9ancier, dont' l'action dirig\u00e9e contre plusieurs d\u00e9biteurs a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e, puisse se dispenser de mettre en cause tous les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s. Les m\u00eames auteurs expliquent en effet, \u00e0 la page 300:\nLa jurisprudence doit donc \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e en ce sens qu'en cas d'indivisibilit\u00e9, l'appel r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement interjet\u00e9 contre l'une des parties rel\u00e8ve l'appelant de la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance qu'il aurait encourue vis-\u00e0-vis des autres, en n'interjetant pas r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement appel contre ces derni\u00e8res dans les d\u00e9lais, mais il n'en est pas moins n\u00e9cessaire que toutes les parties soient mises-en-cause avant l'arr\u00eat, \u00e0 peine d'irrecevabilit\u00e9 de l'appel.\nC'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, et avant l'audition, l'appelante a fait motion pour que Pelletier f\u00fbt mis-en-cause, et cette Cour, s'autorisant de la R\u00e8gle 50, a accord\u00e9 la demande. Cette R\u00e8gle dit en effet:\nDans chaque cas non d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9vu par la loi o\u00f9 il devient n\u00e9cessaire d'ajouter, comme appelante ou intim\u00e9e, une partie additionnelle \u00e0 l'appel, que cette proc\u00e9dure s'impose par suite du d\u00e9c\u00e8s ou de l'insolvabilit\u00e9 d'une partie d\u00e9j\u00e0 inscrite, ou pour toute autre cause, cette partie additionnelle peut \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appel par la production d'une d\u00e9claration qui peut \u00eatre selon la Formule C de l'Annexe des pr\u00e9sentes R\u00e8gles.\n2. Dans tout appel, la cour peut, sur ou sans la requ\u00eate de l'une des parties, ordonner qu'il soit ajout\u00e9 une partie ou des parties intim\u00e9es, lorsque, de l'avis de la cour, une telle ordonnance est juste, opportune et n\u00e9cessaire pour lui permettre de juger et r\u00e9gler efficacement et compl\u00e8tement la question en jeu dans l'appel, et lorsque, d'apr\u00e8s les faits produits devant elle, la cour est d'avis que ladite partie ou lesdites parties intim\u00e9es auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre ajout\u00e9es par le tribunal dont la d\u00e9cision fait l'objet de l'appel. En obtenant ainsi que Pelletier f\u00fbt mis-en-cause, l'appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi relev\u00e9e de toute d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance qu'elle aurait pu encourir, en ne signifiant pas \u00e0 toutes les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es son avis d'appel.\nDe plus, lors de l'audition de cette demande, la Cour a pris connaissance d'un document sign\u00e9 par Pelletier, \u00e0 l'effet qu'il n'avait pas l'intention de compara\u00eetre ni de plaider devant la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada dans le pr\u00e9sent appel, et qu'il s'en rapportait \u00e0 la justice; et cependant, malgr\u00e9 cette d\u00e9claration, il a tout de m\u00eame produit un factum, et a \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par procureurs.\nJe ne puis faire autrement que de conclure que Pelletier, le mis-en-cause, \u00e9tait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement devant cette Cour, et qu'un jugement annulant le contrat intervenu entre l'appelante et les deux d\u00e9fendeurs originaires en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, peut \u00eatre validement prononc\u00e9.\nLe pr\u00e9sent appel doit donc \u00eatre maintenu, et le jugement du juge de premi\u00e8re instance doit \u00eatre r\u00e9tabli avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les cours.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Trudel & Simard.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Ubald Boisvert.\nSolicitor for the mis-en-cause: Lucien B\u00e9liveau.\n[1] (1931) S.C.R. 437.\n[2] (1927) S.C.R. 598, at 602.\n"}

McAnulty (Defendant) Respondent.\n1944: March 2, 3; 1944: June 22.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Hudson, Taschereau and Rand JJ. and Thorson J. ad hoc.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nInternational law\u2014Husband and wife\u2014Negligence\u2014Automobile accident\u2014Injury to wife\u2014Action for damages by husband\u2014Husband suing as head of community\u2014Consorts married in Quebec without contract, but domiciled in the state of Massachusetts, U.S.A.\u2014Separation as to property being the rule under law of that state\u2014Right of husband to recover damages\u2014Hospital and out-of-pocket expenses made by him recoverable under both laws\u2014Damages for loss of companionship (consortium) or for loss of wife's services (servitium) not recoverable under Quebec law\u2014Damages for probable future expenses recoverable under Quebec law, such as payment of help necessitated through wife's disability.\nWhere a husband, purporting to act as head of the community of property, brings an action for damages resulting from bodily injuries suffered by his wife following an automobile accident in the province of Quebec, and it appears that the consorts, though married in Quebec, without a marriage contract, had their domicile in the state of Massachusetts, in the United States of America, where separation as to property is the rule in such a case,\nHeld that the husband is governed, being domiciled in Massachusetts, by the laws of that state as to his status and capacity and all his other rights are to be determined by the laws of Quebec. The laws of Massachusetts and Quebec are both applicable, one in respect of some of the damages claimed by the husband and the other in connection with other kind of damages.\nHeld, also, that the husband was entitled under both laws to recover hospital and other out-of-pocket expenses made by him as a result of the accident.\nHeld, by a majority of the Court, that the husband was not entitled to the item of damages covering the loss of his wife's companionship (consortium). Hudson and Rand JJ. would have allowed an additional sum of $1,000 in compensation of such loss.\nHeld, further, reversing the judgment appealed from on that point, that damages for probable future expenses were recoverable by the husband under Quebec law. These expenses were alleged by the husband to have to be incurred by him for the payment of a maid, housekeeper or other kind of help that will be necessitated to help or replace appellant's wife owing to her permanent disability resulting from the accident.\nPer The Chief Justice, Taschereau J. and Thorson J. ad hoc: These future expenses are distinguishable from damages resulting from loss of wife's services (servitium), which services are not recoverable under Quebec law.\nJudgment appealed from (Q.R. (1943) K.B. 184) reversed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming a judgment of the Superior Court, Errol M. McDougall[2]. The appellant brought an action for damages resulting from injuries suffered by his wife following an automobile accident. The Superior Court held that the appellant had made good his demand to an amount not exceeding a tender and deposit made by the respondent and that the respondent has made good his defence as to the remainder of the appellant's claim, and consequently dismissed the appellant's action for the surplus. The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nL. E. Beaulieu K.C. and J. Barcelo for the appellant.\nWm. F. MacKlaier K.C. and Gordon Henderson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of The Chief Justice and of Taschereau J. and of Thorson J. ad hoc was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014During the summer of 1938, while a passenger in an automobile owned and driven by the defendant, appellant's wife was seriously injured. She was made a complete cripple for many months, and a partial invalid for the rest of her life. The accident happened near Coaticook in the province of Quebec, and the liability of the respondent is not an issue before this Court. The question raised is purely a matter of private international law; and if decided in favour of appellant, he will be entitled to a substantially increased amount.\nThe appellant-plaintiff took action in the city of Montreal, and claimed the sum of $18,250.34 and, in the writ of summons he describes himself as\nJohn Robert Lister, manager, husband common as to property of Isabella Teresa McAnulty, both of Leominster, in the State of Massachusetts, one of the United States of America, in his capacity of head of the community existing between himself and his wife, as well as personally.\nIn his declaration as amended he claimed:\n(a) Bills for all expenses incurred for transport and treatment and also for help in the house up to the 22nd day of July, $750.34.\n(b) For sufferings endured and to be endured in the future by his wife, $2,500.\n(c) Permanent disability of the wife, covering the payment of a maid, housekeeper or any kind of help that will be necessary to help or replace plaintiff's wife, $15,000.\nTotal, $18,250.34.\nPlaintiff was ordered by judgment to furnish details as to the amount of $15,000 and the particulars furnished were as follows:\n(1) Damages suffered by plaintiff to secure a maid, housekeeper or any kind of help that will be necessary to help or replace his said wife, $10,181.\n(2) Companionship and assistance, $2,000.\n(3) For wife's permanent disability, $2,819.\nTotal, $15,000. After having denied his liability, the defendant alleged in his plea, that plaintiff and his wife were married without a marriage contract, that the husband's domicile, at the time of his marriage in Montreal, was not in the province of Quebec, but in the State of Massachusetts, and that, according to the laws of that state which determined the matrimonial status of appellant and his wife, they were not common, but separate as to property, and that plaintiff has no right or title to assert or recover any damages which are personal to his wife.\nIt is further alleged, that plaintiff and his wife at the time of the accident were, and are still domiciled in the State of Massachusetts, and that, therefore, he and his wife are governed as to their status and capacity by the laws and statutes of the State of Massachusetts.\nIt would follow, if the defendant is right, that the husband could not claim on behalf of his wife the sum of $2,819 for permanent disability nor the sum of $2,500 for sufferings endured and to be endured in the future by his wife. It would also follow that plaintiff has no right to claim or recover other than the damages, if any, actually and directly suffered by him from the said accident.\nDefendant also strongly denied plaintiff any right to claim or recover $2,000 for loss of companionship and assistance, and $10,181 for damages personally suffered\nto secure a maid or housekeeper or any kind of help, that would be necessary to help or replace his said wife\nbecause such items are not recoverable, under the laws of Massachusetts, which, it is alleged, must govern this case.\nWithout prejudice, but in order to purchase his peace, defendant tendered to plaintiff and deposited in court an amount of $1,250 and costs, in full of all claims of the plaintiff. This amount of $1,250, it is said, substantially exceeds the damages actually and directly suffered by plaintiff, and the amount which would be legally recoverable if defendant were under any legal liability to him, which liability, however, despite the tender was clearly denied.\nIn the Superior Court, Mr. Justice Errol M. McDougall declared the tender and deposit made by defendant good and sufficient, and dismissed plaintiff's action for the surplus, with costs. He reached the conclusion that plaintiff was entitled only to his out-of-pocket expenses, $750.34, but that must be excluded from the amount of damages to be paid, the sum of $2,500 for pains and sufferings, and the item of $15,000 which could be claimed only by the wife.\nWithout accepting all the reasons given by Mr. Justice McDougall, the court of appeal came to the conclusion that there was no error in the \"dispositif\" of the judgment appealed from, and dismissed the appeal with costs against the appellant.\nThere can be no doubt in my mind that appellant's domicile was in the State of Massachusetts. He was born in Scotland, and then came to Montreal where he lived during seven years. He afterwards left that city saying that he was \"tired of living there\", and went to Leominster, Massachusetts, but, four years later, he came back to Montreal for the sole purpose of getting married, and immediately after returned with his wife to Massachusetts, where he has lived since for over forty years. It seems clear that the appellant had an actual residence in the State of Massachusetts, and that this fact was coupled with his intention of making that place the seat of his principal establishment. These are the legal requirements under (article 80 of the Civil Code to operate a change of domicile, and I fully agree with the courts below, which have come to the conclusion that the domicile of the appellant was in the State of Massachusetts.\nIt is true, that in Montreal, when he married, the appellant did not go through the formalities of a marriage contract, and that under the laws of the province of Quebec, he would be common as to property with his wife and thus entitled, if domiciled in Montreal, to institute the present action, the way he did. But, under the laws of his domicile, this system of community is unknown, and separation of property exists, when there is no marriage contract. The wife is on an equal footing with her husband as to the exercise of her civil rights, and any action for personal injury must therefore be instituted by her. As a result of this, the sum of $2,500 for sufferings endured and to be endured in the future by the wife, and the sum of $2,819 for her permanent disability cannot be claimed by the husband, and were rightly abandoned in the court of appeal by appellant. These items are personal to the wife, and cannot belong to a community which does not exist.\nThe plaintiff, however, claims that he is entitled to the sum of $2,000 for loss of companionship (consortium) and of his wife's services (servitium), and that he is also entitled to claim $10,181 being the damages suffered by him to secure for the future, a maid, housekeeper or any kind of help that will be necessary to help or replace his wife. These, he says, are personal items, which were wrongly denied by the courts below, and which, even if refused by the laws of Massachusetts which have no application, are recoverable under the laws of Quebec.\nThe last paragraph of article 6 of the Civil Code reads as follows:\nAn inhabitant of Lower Canada, so long as he retains his domicile therein, is governed, even when absent, by its laws respecting the status and capacity of persons; but these laws do not apply to persons domiciled out of Lower Canada, who, as to their status and capacity, remain subject to the laws of their country.\nThe plaintiff, therefore, is governed, being domiciled in Massachusetts, by the laws of that State but only as to his status and capacity. All his other rights are to be determined by the laws of the province of Quebec. If the latter laws apply, appellant is clearly entitled to more than what the courts have allowed him, but if the laws of Massachusetts are to govern this case, the amount awarded seems sufficient.\nThe laws of Massachusetts have been explained and discussed at the trial. Mr. John E. Hannigan, of Boston, Massachusetts, a lawyer of some fifty years of practice at the Massachusetts Bar, and lecturer on damages, contracts and torts at the Law School of Boston University, has been heard as an expert on foreign law, on behalf of the respondent. The reading of his evidence leaves no doubt in one's mind, that the conception of marriage, and the reciprocal obligations arising therefrom are entirely different in Massachusetts from what they are here. He explained in a very elaborate testimony the status of married persons in the State of Massachusetts, and concluded, that if the present action had been instituted in the state where he lives, only the out-of-pocket expenses, made prior to the trial ($750.34), would be allowed. In view of the legal rights and obligations of husband and wife, towards each other, he says that plaintiff could not claim for loss of consortium or servitium, nor for future expenses to be incurred by him for the care of his invalid wife.\nThe wife, since she has been emancipated, has no obligations towards her husband; she has the right to live with him, to be his companion, to enjoy his society, to share his home, but is not bound to do so. The same rule applies as to servitium. She is free to be a housewife or not, and to fulfill these ordinary duties, which are fulfilled in some other countries, and which flow necessarily from the status of married persons. The husband is not as of right entitled to this companionship, and to the services and assistance of his wife.\nThe logical legal consequence is that, whenever she suffers personal injuries, as a result of a delict or quasi-delict, of which a third party is the author, and made crippled, the husband cannot claim for loss of servitium and consortium. He has lost nothing to which he was entitled. There has been no invasion of his rights.\nAs to the husband's right to claim damages for future expenses, it is, according to the learned expert's views, denied in the State of Massachusetts. Although the husband, as a result of his status, is bound to care for his wife, even if he is poor and she is rich, he may claim personally only for out-of-pocket expenses, up to the time of the trial. It is practical justice, says Mr. Hannigan, that this claim should belong to the wife personally. If the husband did obtain damages on that ground, he would not hold the money in trust for his wife, but it would be his personally. The fact cannot be ignored that there are frequent divorces and terminations of marriages, which leave the wife alone, and unprotected. In support of these propositions, Mr. Hannigan has cited many authorities. It is of course within the powers of this Court to examine these authorities and to construe them, because, having been cited by the expert, they become part of his evidence. As it has been said by Sir Lyman Duff, in Allen v. Hay[3], 64 S.C.R. at page 81:\nThese experts may, however, refer to codes and precedents in support of their evidence and the passages and references cited by them will be treated as part of their testimony; and it is settled law that if the evidence of such witnesses is conflicting or obscure the Court may go a step further and examine and construe the passages cited for itself in order to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion.\nVide also: Halsbury Laws of England, 2nd Ed., Vol. 13, at page 615:\nIf, however, the witness produces any text book, decision, code, or other legal document, as stating or representing the foreign law, the court, on looking at or dealing with these books and documents, is entitled to construe them and form its own conclusion thereon. The court, in deciding on foreign law as a fact, is not bound to accept the construction put upon it by the expert, even if uncontradicted, nor is it bound to accept the decision of foreign courts as correctly setting\" out the daw of the foreign state.\nI have read with interest and care all the authorities cited, and I have reached the conclusion that a fundamental difference exists between the claim of the appellant for loss of consortium and servitium, and his claim for future expenses to be incurred by him for the care of his wife.\nI have cited previously article 6 of the Civil Code. It must not be forgotten that persons domiciled outside the province of Quebec, when in the province, are governed by its laws. They remain subject to the laws of their country only as to their status and capacity.\nThe status of an individual is the whole of his juridical qualities, which the law takes into consideration to attach thereto legal effects. Capacity, very often the consequence of a person's status, is merely the aptitude to have and exercise rights, and accomplish juridical acts. Thus, the quality of Canadian, of major or infant, of husband or wife, of legitimate or illegitimate son, is a question of juridical status, reserved by law to the person. This is what has to be taken into account for the determination of this case. All evidence adduced beyond what is necessary to determine the status of the plaintiff, as a husband, is quite irrelevant.\nAs it has been said by Earl of Halsbury speaking for the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in De Nicols v. Curlier[4].\nThere is no real conflict between the learned persons who have given evidence on this question. One of them indeed, besides giving evidence as to what the French law is, upon which he is an authority entitled to respect, has also gone on to express an opinion upon how that law should be treated in this country, upon which subject he is no authority at all; and indeed such a question is not the subject of evidence at all, but pure matter of English law for English courts to decide.\nMr. Hannigan, in answer to questions put to him by respondent's solicitor, dealt not only with the status of the plaintiff as a consequence of his marriage, and his reciprocal rights and obligations as such towards his wife, but went further, and gave a very interesting but irrelevant lecture on the law of torts and damages.\nThe law in the province of Quebec is as stated by the Judicial Committee in De Nicols v. Curlier[5]. A foreigner who is a plaintiff before our courts and prays for a relief as a result of a quasi-delict committed in Quebec, and causing injury to his wife, has to prove his status; and then, the question is not: what would he get in Massachusetts with this proven status? But rather what amount is he entitled to under the Quebec laws relating to torts and damages? Obviously, the same situation would arise in the case of a minor, domiciled in the United States, suing in damages before our courts, to claim compensation for a breach of contract executed in the province of Quebec. He would have to show that in the country of his domicile, he has the capacity to enter into a contract and to institute legal proceedings. But his right of action, and the extent of his damages would undoubtedly be determined by the laws of Quebec, and not under the laws of his domicile, which have no application whatever.\nThe present case must be governed by the same rules. We know the status of the plaintiff, and what are his rights and obligations towards his wife. Underlying his status of husband there is no right to the consortium of his wife, nor to servitium. This is the principle, I think, that may be found flowing from the evidence of Mr. Hannigan, and from the authorities cited by him, and which he has fully explained. What the appellant claims he has lost, is not due him under the laws of his domicile as naturally attaching to his status. He has suffered no invasion of his rights, which is a fundamental condition to give rise to an action in damages.\nThe question of the right of the appellant to damages for future expenses is quite different. The evidence is clear that a husband is obliged to provide for his wife, and pay all expenses that are necessary to satisfy this obligation. And this obligation exists whatever the means of the husband are, and is inherent to the quality of husband. It is truly an incident of the status of the plaintiff.\nThrough the injury sustained by his wife, plaintiff's rights have been affected, and an obligation has arisen for him to provide for the necessaries that are required by the condition in which his wife is now. On this point, appellant is entitled to succeed.\nI do not forget that such damages are not recoverable under the laws of Massachusetts, but this Court ought not to be concerned with the views that may take other courts on the subject. The plaintiff has shown what his status is, and what are the obligations towards his wife, as a result of his quality of husband. He has satisfied the provisions of section 6 of the Civil Code, and it is now for the Quebec courts to determine what rights he has with this imported status, under the laws of Quebec. To hold otherwise would be a violation of article 6 C.C. for it would mean that a foreigner suing in Quebec, for damages that occurred in Quebec, is governed by the laws of his domicile, not only as to his status and capacity, but also as to the law of torts and damages.\nThis being the case, the appellant is personally entitled to damages for future expenses. The evidence is sufficient to allow this Court to assess them as the trial judge would have done, if he had come to the conclusion that plaintiff was entitled to any.\nI think, taking into consideration the severity of the injury suffered by appellant's wife, the permanent incacity that will make her an invalid for life, her age, and the probable future expenses that will be incurred by appellant, that a sum of $3,000 would be fair and equitable.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed with costs throughout, and the tender of $1,250 made by defendant should be declared insufficient. There should be judgment for $3,750.34 with interest since the date of the judgment of the Superior Court, less interest on the amount of $1,250 already paid. Hudson J.\u2014The facts giving rise to the questions still in controversy between these parties are few and simple.\nA husband and wife married in Quebec were domiciled in Massachusetts. The wife came to Quebec on a visit and while there was injured in an automobile accident arising through the defendant's negligence. This action for consequent damages was brought by the husband alone in a Quebec court.\nAt the trial the husband was awarded damages for expenses incurred for doctors' fees, nursing and so forth, but was denied his claim in respect of two other matters: (1) the loss of his wife's services; (2) the loss of consortium. This judgment was upheld on appeal.\nWe have here to consider only the quantum of damages and the two items last above mentioned.\nThe plaintiff's claim to damages is based on article 1053 of the Civil Code which reads as follows:\nEvery person capable of discerning right from wrong is responsible far the damage caused by his fault to another, whether by positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of skill.\nThe plaintiff himself suffered no physical injury in the accident. His loss was indirect. At one time the application of article 1053 C.C. to such a person was open to question. However, by a majority decision of this Court in the case of Regent Taxi and Transport Co. v. La Congr\u00e9gation des Petits Fr\u00e8res de Marie[6], this was settled in the plaintiff's favour.\nWhere, as here, the wrong is committed in Quebec and the action is taken in a Quebec court, article 1053 C.C. applies irrespective of the domicile of the parties (except as provided in article 6 of the Code). It is said in Lafleur's Conflict of Laws, p. 198:\nWhen an offence or quasi-offence is committed within the Province of Quebec and the action for damages is brought before our Courts, there is no conflict, the lex fori and the lex loci delicti commissi being the same. Such a case appears to come within the meaning of art. 6 of the Civil Code, which enacts that the laws of Lower Canada relative to persons apply to all persons being therein, even to those not domiciled there (saving the exception as to laws governing status and capacity). Accordingly, if a delict is committed in this province by natives or foreigners, the law to be applied by our courts is undoubtedly our own law, and whether the Jaw of the offending or injured party does not create civil liability in such case is immaterial. and in Johnson's Conflict of Laws, vol. III, p. 340:\nThe purpose of the law of delictual responsibility is to protect individuals against wrongful acts by which they suffer loss or prejudice; to indemnify them in money damages. Article 1053 C.C. makes every person who is capable of discerning right from wrong, responsible for damage caused by his fault to another, whether by positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of skill. This is a general rule, applicable by first intention to delicts committed within the province whatever their nationality or domicile. In that sense, it is a rule designed for public safety, and is a rule of public policy.\nThese statements accord with the generally recognized rule of private international law.\nIt must be kept clearly in mind that what we must consider now is the damage to the husband, and only such damage as arises by reason of his relationship with his wife who was the immediate victim of the accident.\nI have had an opportunity of reading the judgment prepared by my brother Taschereau in this case and agree with what he says as to the expenses incurred and to be incurred by the plaintiff.\nIt is in evidence that the plaintiff and his wife were married in Quebec and thereafter lived together in amity and mutual helpfulness for many years and with a reasonable expectation of a continuance of this happy state, until disturbed by the accident due to the fault of the defendant. As stated by Mr. Justice Pr\u00e9vost in the court below:\nDevant cette Cour, l'appelant reconna\u00eet que son r\u00e9gime matrimonial est la s\u00e9paration de biens, en vertu des lois de l'Etat du Massachusetts, o\u00f9 il a son domicile depuis plus de quarante ans; et il renonce \u00e0 deux chefs de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans son action, savoir: ceux qui se rapportent aux souffrances physiques de sa femme, et \u00e0 l'incapacit\u00e9 permanente de celle-ci. Mais il insiste sur les deux derniers. Il dit et il a prouv\u00e9 que sa femme jusqu'\u00e0 la date de l'accident tenait seule sa maison, o\u00f9 elle excellait \u00e0 tous les travaux du m\u00e9nage. D\u00e9sormais il lui faudra une m\u00e9nag\u00e8re qui lui co\u00fbtera $18.00 \u00e0 $20.00 par semaine; ce qui justifie une indemnit\u00e9 de $10,000.00.\nIl dit et il a prouv\u00e9 que sa femme \u00e9tait une charmante compagne et une \u00e9pouse mod\u00e8le; mais que depuis l'accident, elle est sourde, ne voit que d'un \u0153il, souffre constamment, doit coucher sur des planches; et que pour cela elle est devenue nerveuse, irritable, taciturne, intol\u00e9rante; ce qui g\u00e2te irr\u00e9m\u00e9diablement sa vie conjugale, et justifie une indemnit\u00e9 de $2,000.00.\nSi l'on applique la loi du Qu\u00e9bec, o\u00f9 le quasi-d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis, l'appelant a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9; si on applique la loi du domicile de l'appelant, il n'a droit \u00e0 rien. It is hardly open to dispute that the facts here would justify an award of damages under the law of Quebec. The mutual obligations of husband and wife are set forth in articles 173, 174 and 175 C.C. as follows:\n173. Husband and wife mutually owe each other fidelity, succor and assistance.\n174. A husband owes protection to this wife; a wife obedience to her husband.\n175. A wife is obliged to live with her husband, and to follow him wherever he thinks fit to reside. The husband is obliged to receive her and to supply her with all the necessities of life, according to his means and conditions.\nAny wrongful interference by a third person with the enjoyment of the rights and privileges of either husband or wife would in my opinion be a proper subject for relief under article 1053 C.C. Recognition by law of such a right by the husband and a remedy for its breach is common throughout most of the civilized world. Under the common law in England from medieval times onwards a writ of trespass might be issued for injury done to a servant per quod servitium amisit, and by analogy an action lay in trespass or case for injury done to a wife or child per quod consortium or servitium amisit. At the present time such a right of action is recognized. See Salmond on Torts at p. 391:\nIt is a tort actionable at the suit of a husband to take away, imprison, or do physical harm to his wife, if (a) the act is wrongful as against the wife, and (b) the husband is thereby deprived of her society or services. A husband has a right as against third persons to the consortium et servitium of his wife, just as a master has a similar right to the servitium of his servant. Any tortious act, therefore, committed against the wife is actionable at the suit of her husband, if he can prove that he was thereby deprived for any period of her society or services.\nIt should be observed here that this remains the law, notwithstanding the so-called emancipation of women where under legislation they have been given, in both England and elsewhere, approximately equal rights with men as to property and otherwise before the law.\nThe common law on this subject was introduced in the United States and is still generally recognized in principle. As stated in 30 Corpus Juris at p. 961:\nA personal injury to a married woman caused by the tort of a third person gives rise to two causes of action; one for her personal pain and suffering, and the other for the husband's consequential loss of her society and services and for expense incurred for medical attention and nursing. This statement is supported by reference to decisions of the courts of many states. In the case of Fink v. Campbell[7], a United States Circuit Court consisting of Taft (afterwards Chief Justice Taft), Lurton and Hammond JJ. stated the law to be as follows:\nTwo entirely separate causes of action may arise from an injury to the person of a wife during the disability of coverture, one for injury to her, and the other for the damages resulting to the husband from the loss of her services and society as a consequence of the injury. Though these rights of action have their origin in the same injuries, the damages are distinct and cannot be recovered in one action.\nSimilar decisions were given in a number of the Canadian provinces.\nIt is inconceivable that the rights of a husband in Quebec are more restricted than those in common law jurisdiction.\nIt is claimed, however, on behalf of defendant, and it has been held by the courts below, that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover because the matrimonial domicile was in the State of Massachusetts, that the law of that state governs and no such right of action for a husband is there recognized.\nIn support of this view, reliance is placed upon the final paragraphs of article 6 of the Civil Code:\nAn inhabitant of Lower Canada, so long as he retains his domicile therein, is governed, even when absent, by its laws respecting the status and capacity of persons; but these laws do not apply to persons domiciled out of Lower Canada, who, as to their status and capacity, remain subject to the laws of their country.\nIt will be noted, however, that the preceding paragraph in article 6 C.C. provides:\nThe laws of Lower Canada relative to persons apply to all persons being therein, even to those not domiciled there; subject, as to the latter, to the exception mentioned at the end of the present article.\nWith respect, I am of opinion that the question here involved is not one of status within the meaning of this article. The marriage has not been dissolved or annulled. The parties are still husband and wife. The husband is still the head of the matrimonial regime and with obligations incidental thereto; for example, the maintenance of the wife and family. There is' no suggestion that either husband or wife has repudiated or intends to repudiate the mutual obligations entered into by them when they were married in Quebec. What the plaintiff claims is damages for the loss he has sustained through the defendant's negligence which deprives him of the services and companionship of his wife.\nThe defendant called as witness on his behalf an attorney with very wide experience in the practice of law in Massachusetts. This witness stated in effect that up until the year 1909 the husband had a right of action to recover damages for loss of servitium and consortium in that State, but after that date the courts there have constantly refused to make any such allowance. In support of his opinion he referred to a number of cases decided by the Massachusetts courts. We are justified in examining the precedents cited in support of his evidence. This was expressly stated in the case of Allen v. Hay[8]. For the present law, he largely relied upon a decision of the Supreme Court of that State reported as Feneff v. New York Central & Hudson River Railroad Co.[9], which was decided in 1909. The head-note of the report is as follows:\nThe right of consortium is a right growing out of the marital relation which the husband and wife respectively have to enjoy the society, companionship and affection of each other in their life together.\nA married woman cannot maintain an action for a loss of consortium occasioned by physical and mental injuries of her husband, which were caused by the negligence of a person from whom her husband has recovered compensation in damages. It seems that the same rule would apply in an action by a husband for a loss of consortium from an injury to his wife through the negligence of one from whom she has recovered damages, and that anything to the contrary is overruled.\nIn the course of delivering the opinion of the Court the Chief Justice stated that (p. 279):\nAt the common law, the husband had a right to the labour and services of his wife, and in suing for the damages which are personal to the husband for an injury to his wife, he was permitted to recover, not only for the expenses of her care and cure, but for his loss of her labour and services and the loss of consortium.\nAnd at p. 280:\nThe right to the consortium of the other spouse seems to belong to husband and wife alike, and to rest upon the same reasons in favour of each. Since the removal of the wife's disability to sue, this is now settled in most courts by a great weight of authority.\nAgain on the same page:\nThe wrong which may be redressed through such suits (i.e. those for alienation of affection, etc., of husband and wife) is one which has a direct tendency to deprive the husband or wife of the consortium of the other spouse. No case has been brought to our attention, and after an extended examination we have found none, in which an action for a loss of consortium alone has been maintained merely because of an injury to the person of the other spouse, for which the other has recovered, or is entitled to recover, full compensation in his own name, when the only effect upon the plaintiff's right of consortium is that, through the physical or mental, disability of the other, the companionship is Jess satisfactory and valuable than before the injury.\nAgain at page 281:\nIt is enough for the present case that persons whose relations to the injured party are purely domestic should not be permitted to share the compensation to which he is entitled for the impairment of his powers by the tort of another person, nor to receive an additional sum beyond the full compensation to which the injured person is entitled. Their damages are too remote to be made the subject of an action.\nAnd in conclusion at page 282 he says:\nWe are of opinion that in this class of cases there should be no recovery for loss of consortium, when the impairment of the powers and faculties of the plaintiff's spouse has been fully paid for in money. Indirectly, the plaintiff in such a case reasonably may be expected, through the same marital relation which gives a right of consortium, to be somewhat benefited by such a payment.\nIn passing, it should be noted that the view that the enactment of laws empowering the wife to take action in her own name altered the common law right to a separate action by the husband is in direct conflict with the accepted law in England and in Canada. In Winfield on Torts at p. 248 it is stated:\nThe same wrongful act may deprive her husband of her consortium and do bodily harm to her. And there are two separate remedies for these two separate torts. In cases like Brockbank v. Whitehaven Ry[10], the wife can nowadays maintain an action on her own behalf. Before 1883 the law was the same except that her husband must sue for her benefit, and this action which he brought merely as her representative was entirely independent of the action which he had, and still has, for the loss of consortium.\nSee Brawley v. Toronto Ry. Co.[11] and the remarks of Chief Justice Meredith at the conclusion of his judgment at p. 36. Also Swan v. Canadian Northern Railway Co.[12], the remarks of Mr. Justice Stuart at p. 431.\nHowever, the witness said that since the decision an the Feneff case[13] it had been universally accepted as law in Massachusetts that a husband could not get damages there in such an action. It should be noted, however, that, in any reports of decisions brought to the attention of this Court, there already had been another action in which the injured spouse had in the first instance secured damages. There is throughout all of these judgments a recognition of a right in the husband to the services of his wife in keeping the house and in giving companionship to her husband. What is denied is damages for a breach of this right, which are considered too remote. Now, with all respect to what has been said by others in this case, it seems to me that the remoteness of damages is not a question of status within the meaning of article 6 of the Civil Code.\nIn the case of Machado v. Fontes[14], it was decided by the Court of Appeal of England that\nAn action will lie in this country in respect of an act committed outside the jurisdiction if the act is wrongful both in this country and in the country where it was committed, but it is not necessary that the act should be the subject of civil proceedings in the foreign country.\nThis case is relied upon by Dicey in his book on Conflict of Laws at pages 722 and 723 to support one of the rules he has there enunciated. It is further stated by Dicey at pages 797, 800 and 801 that the lex fori governs in respect of remedies.\nWhen the husband proved a valid subsisting marriage and a right to consortium by the laws of Massachusetts he established his status. It then remains for the Court to decide what remedy should be awarded for a wrongful interference with this right by a third party. This should in my opinion, be decided by a Quebec Court in accordance with Quebec Laws.\nI would allow the appeal and award the plaintiff for past and probable future expenses a sum of $3,000 and a further sum of $1,000 in respect of the loss of consortium, the amount of $1,250 already received by the plaintiff to be credited on the amount awarded and the plaintiff also to receive interest.\nRand J.\u2014The appellant is a domiciled resident of the State of Massachusetts, U.S.A. His wife while on a visit to Quebec was, on September 9th, 1938, injured in an automobile accident through the negligence of the respondent. On September 2nd, 1939, the husband brought action in the courts of that province in which he claimed damages for: (a) medical, nursing, hospital and housekeeping disbursements up to July 22nd, 1939, the commencement of the action, (b) loss of consortium, (c) subsequent expenses including maid or housekeeper services necessary to help or replace his wife, (d) his wife's permanent injury and disability. Liability for the first item was admitted and no question of the right of the plaintiff under article 1053 of the Civil Code to bring the action is raised. Admittedly also, the last item, which is personal to the wife, is not recoverable. The items brought in the appeal are (b) and (c), and as can be seen, they include claims founded on both consortium and the duty of the husband to care for and support the wife.\nThe challenge to these claims is put on the ground that by the law of Massachusetts the husband has no right to recover damages for loss of consortium resulting from personal injury to the wife through negligence nor for expenses for medical or like services, or aid necessary to her care and comfort subsequent to the trial; he is limited to such out-of-pocket expenses incurred up to the trial: and not being recoverable under the law of the domicile, they are not by the law of Quebec proper items of damages there. Evidence of these provisions of the law of Massachusetts was given by a member of the bar of that state. The courts below upheld this contention, allowed recovery for the disbursements to July 22nd, 1939, but denied all other relief. The remedial right of the husband arising in Quebec and claimed in the courts of Quebec was treated as depending upon the law of his domicile and the question in the appeal is whether that view of the law is sound.\nIt is beyond controversy that, in the courts of the same jurisdiction, rights of action arising from personal wrongs are the creation of the law of the place where the tortious acts are committed. This is expressly declared by article 6 of the Civil Code. Whatever consequences are to be attached to those acts must arise by force of that territorial law. It may be, in the determination of those consequences, that resort becomes necessary to some other law for the purpose of ascertaining status or primary rights arising from it, but such a resort is only for the purpose of furnishing the basis upon which rights of action in the jurisdiction of the act may depend. By article 1053 of the Civil Code,\nEvery person capable of discerning right from wrong is responsible for the damage caused by this fault to another whether by positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of skill.\nUnder that language, not only the immediate victim of a wrongful act, but third persons upon whose legal rights that act, through the direct injury, has trespassed, are entitled to redress. The claim here is by a third party and in order to bring himself within the article he must show that some right of his has been invaded and that damage has resulted. He is the husband and whatever primary rights he has in relation to his wife are those which arise from the marriage status; and to ascertain them we must go to the law of the domicile. Once they are ascertained there has been presented the jural material on which the law of the place must operate to create or withhold a right of action against the person whose act has brought about the damaging consequences.\nWe look, then, to the law of Massachusetts to discover those incidents of the marriage status which are relevant to article 1053 of the Civil Code. It is clear from the evidence that the common law right of the husband to the earnings of his wife has been abrogated. It is also clear that in an action similar to this in Massachusetts the husband would be limited in his recovery to his actual disbursements in medical care and other attention to his wife up to the time of the trial. This involves the absence of any right on the husband's part to claim damages for loss of consortium and all involved in that fundamental incident of marriage. But it does not mean that the husband has lost his right to consortium. One of the authorities upon which the evidence is supported, Nolin v. Pearson[15], distinctly holds that the wife is entitled to damages for the loss of consortium brought about by the wrongful enticement from home and affection of the husband and it assumes the converse right in the husband; and the existence of that right is not affected by the fact that injury to it is not always attended by compensating sanctions. In the language of the judgment:\nBut he retains the unmodified right to her conjugal society, even if her refusal to recognize this right affords him no ground for an absolute divorce. The limitation of recovery established by the decisions cited shows beyond doubt that it results from the conflict between rights of action given to the wife under the various married women's property acts and the common law rights of the husband; but it is in fact a limiting rule of damages. As the wife under those statutes has the right to recover in one sum for the total effect upon her of the injury, there is in the view adopted nothing left for any claim of the husband. One complete recovery is permitted and on grounds of policy that recovery has been attributed to the wife. Otherwise the equivalent of her physical and mental impairment would become the property of her husband in contradiction to the provisions that she shall be entitled as if she were femme sole; and it is conceived that any damage beyond the perimeter of her own loss or injury, even an injury to the husband's interest, is too remote to be taken into account: Feneff v. New York Central & Hudson River Railroad Co.[16].\nWhen there is no intentional wrong the ordinary rule of damages goes no further in this respect than to allow pecuniary compensation for the impairment or injury directly done. When the injury is to the person of another, the impairment of ability to work and be helpful and render services of any kind is paid for in full to the person injured. Ordinarily the relation between him and others whereby they will be detrimentally affected by the impairment of his physical or mental ability makes the damage to them only remote and consequential and not a ground of recovery against the wrongdoer.\n***\nIt is enough for the present case that persons whose relations to the injured party are purely domestic should not be permitted to share the compensation of which he (the husband) is entitled for the impairment of his powers by the tort of another person, nor to receive an additional sum beyond the full compensation' to which the injured person is entitled. Their damages are too remote to be the subject of an action.\nThe recovery of the wife, therefore, exhausts the total liability of the wrongdoer. The only exception to this is in respect of disbursements up to the trial. In the absence of evidence to the contrary it is presumed that such outlays have been made by the husband and he is allowed to recover them; but even that is a question of fact and, if it is shown that the obligation for them was taken on by the wife, then she alone becomes entitled to recover them.\nAlthough under Massachusetts law the common law right of the husband to the services of his wife has been seriously encroached on to the extent that he cannot claim her earnings, nevertheless, as he remains under a duty to care for and support her and as that duty is complementary to his rights under the consortium, the incidental services arising from that home association cannot be separated from the other elements of consortium. That concept embodies all of the characteristics of the conjugal cohabitation which is the fundus of marriage: and a disturbance of the consortium must include an interruption of those ordinary acts by which the necessary supports to the home life are given, which, whether companionship, comfort or services, are inseparable from the body of relations of which they form a part. It may be that, for the purpose of defining the scope of a wife's recovery of damages, her capacity to work in its entirety may be segregated to her own exclusive right: but that fact is irrelevant to the content of consortium.\nFor the purposes of the law of Quebec, then, we have a claim on the part of a husband who possesses the right of consortium and who is under a legal duty to care for and support his wife while the marriage continues. These are the rights which in Quebec the husband complains have been violated by the wrongful act of the respondent. It is the law of Quebec and that only to which we must look for the legal consequence from those facts. It will arise from the law of personal wrongs in that province, and part of that law is the delimitation of the damages attributed to the impairment of right suffered. It was, therefore, in my opinion, a misconception of the law to be applied to import from Massachusetts the law of tort including the rule of damages to determine the rights of the appellant in Quebec.\nThe latter has suffered an injuria from the wrongful act by which his wife was injured. His right to the consortium and to be protected against an aggravation of his duty towards her have been violated. Under section 1053 of the Civil Code, those violations give rise to a right to damages that will reasonably compensate him for the loss he has sustained.\nIt is suggested by McDougall (E. M.) J., at the trial, that to hold the husband entitled to such damages in Quebec would expose the respondent to a like claim on the part of the wife in Massachusetts but that, with the greatest respect, involves, I think, a confusion of the law of status and rights flowing from it with the law of private wrongs. It is to the law of Quebec in the latter respects to which Massachusetts would refer to ascertain the rights of action given to both husband and wife as a result of the tortious act there and as those rights limit the wife, separate as to property, to her personal injuries and suffering and do not include expenses of medical or other care, or encroach upon any loss of enjoyment of the consortium, which are exclusively matters of injury to the husband, a like limitation on the scope of the wife's recovery would be made by the law of Massachusetts. But whether or not Massachusetts would follow such a rule in allowing recovery for a wrong committed in another jurisdiction, we must apply in Quebec the rule which her law dictates. The only question that might arise is whether or not the claim for future expenses, of aid and assistance for the proper care of the wife, is sufficiently alleged. Item (1) of the particulars specifies the necessity of securing\na maid, housekeeper or any kind of help that will be necessary to help or replace his said wife.\nThat, I think, is a sufficient allegation of that part of the claim. All of the evidence offered on the rejected items was admitted and is now before this court, which is in as good a position as a trial judge to assess the quantum. I would fallow, on the claim for care and aid, including expenses from July 22nd, 1939, the sum of $3,000 and for loss of consortium the sum of $1,000, together with interest from the date of the judgment at trial with proper allowance for the tender made with the defence. The appeal should, therefore, be allowed with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cartier, Barcelo, Rivard & Pelletier.\nSolicitors for the respondent: MacDougall, McFarlane, Scott & Hugessen.\n[1] Q.R.

Ry. Co., a company incorporated by special Act of the Parliament of Canada. B. was a citizen of and resident in the United States. The Government of the United States, at war with Germany from April 6, 1917, granted on July 14, 1919, a general licence (subject to exceptions) to trade with the enemy. B. went to Germany in September, 1919, and in October, 1919, purchased there the shares in question, receiving 48 certificates of shares, all in the same form and dated between 1894 and 1913, and being in the name of one or the other of two German banking houses as registered holders, which were at all relevant times enemy alien corporations. Each certificate was countersigned by the company's transfer agent and registrar of transfers in New York (U.S.A.) and on each was endorsed a transfer in blank signed by the registered holder. These certificates formed part of a group of certificates issued by the company to the said two banking houses covering a total of about 140,000 shares. They were so issued in order that the shares might be traded in on the stock exchanges in Germany and certain other European countries as bearer securities without being presented for transfer at a transfer office maintained by the company upon each transfer of ownership. The certificates covering the said 140,000 shares were registered in the company's transfer office which it had been authorized to establish and had established in New York and transfers were registrable on the books of that office and nowhere else. Dividends on shares so transferable were payable at New York in United States funds.\nOn April 23, 1919, the shares standing in the name of the said two banking houses (as well as other shares) had been the subject of an order of the Superior Court of Quebec made under the Consolidated Orders Respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1916 (enacted under the authority of the War Measures Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 206); which court order in its terms vested the shares in the Custodian; and when B., in November, 1919, presented his certificates for transfer and registration in his own name at the company's New York office, that office (having received a copy of the order, with instructions) refused acceptance of the transfers. The certificattes have since remained in the possession of B or the claimant.\nHeld: The shares in question were vested in the Custodian, and did not at any time belong to B. or the claimant. (Judgment of Thorson J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, [1944] Ex. C.R. 30, affirmed).\nThe Consolidated Orders Respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1916 (particularly ss. 6 (1) (2), 1 (1) (d)). The Treaty of Versailles (signed on June 28, 1919) (particularly paragraphs (b) and (d) of Article 297, and paragraphs 1, 3, of the Annex to Article 297), The Treaties of Peace Act, 1919 (Dom., 1919, 2nd Sess., c. 30), The Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920 (particularly ss. 33, 34), referred to. The court order of April 23, 1919, vested the shares in the Custodian, and that order was confirmed, and all subsequent dealings with the shares by the Custodian were authorized, by the Treaty of Versailles and by The Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920.\nWhile the Governor in Council (enacting the said Consolidated Orders Respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1916, and The Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920) could not prevent the share certificates from being physically endorsed by the holder and handed over to a purchaser, he could provide that no transfer should confer on the transferee any rights or remedies in respect of such securities. The situs of the shares, as distinguished from that of the certificates, was in Canada; and the conditions under which title to the company's shares might be acquired was exclusively matter for the law-making authority of Canada. The fact that the company was authorized to, and did in fact, establish a transfer office in the State of New York where, only, transfers of the shares in question were registrable, could not make any difference; this was a mere matter of convenience and did not detract from the power of Canada to deal with the title to the shares of the Canadian company. (Spitz v. Secretary of State of Canada, [1939] Ex. C.R. 162, approved. The King v. Cutting (dealing with a different problem'), [1932] S.C.R. 410, at 414, 418, referred to. The considerations which applied in Rex. v. Williams, [1942] A.C. 541, cannot affect the matter for consideration in the present case). Even assuming that a transfer of the certificates to B. (in Germany) was valid by German law, yet such transfer did not, in the language of s. 6 (1) of said Consolidated Orders of 1916, \"confer on the transferee any rights or remedies in respect thereof\".\nAPPEAL by the claimant from the judgment of Thorson J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing her action, in which action (brought by consent of the Custodian under s. 41 (2) of The Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920) she claimed a declaration that she, as the administratrix of the estate of Jacob G. Braun, deceased, was (as against the Custodian, respondent) the owner of certain shares of the common stock of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, and for further relief.\nThe material facts, and relevant enactments, are stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported and in the reasons for judgment in the Exchequer Court (above cited).\nThorson J. dismissed the action, holding that the shares in dispute never at any time belonged to the late Jacob G. Braun or the claimant but as at January 10, 1920, and since that date belonged to Canada and were vested in the Custodian.\nD. L. McCarthy K.C. and W. B. Wadsworth K.C. for the appellant.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and C. Robinson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014The circumstances giving rise to the present dispute are set forth in a statement of facts agreed to by the parties. The appellant is the administratrix of the estate of Jacob G. Braun, and the respondent is charged with the administration of enemy property under the Canadian Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order (P.C. 755 of 1920) and amendments thereto. Braun, born a German subject, was naturalized in the United States of America in 1886 and was thereafter until his death a citizen thereof. The United States was at war with Germany from April 6th, 1917, and until July 14th, 1919, United States citizens were forbidden by statute to enter into any business relations with residents in Germany. On that date the government of the United States granted to its citizens general licences to trade with the enemy, subject to certain immaterial exceptions.\nOn September 5th, 1919, Braun went to Germany where he purchased, between the sixth and seventeenth days of October, 1919, 470 shares of common stock of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, a company incorporated by special Act of the Parliament of Canada. In consideration of this payment Braun received 48 certificates of shares of the common stock of the Company, all in the same form and dated between 1894 and 1913. Four of them were in the name of C. Schlessinger-Trier & Co. as registered holders and the remainder in the name of the National-bank fur Deutschland. Both registered holders were German banking houses and at all relevant times enemy alien corporations. Each of the certificates was countersigned by the Bank of Montreal as the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's transfer agent in New York and by the Central Trust Company of New York as its Registrar of Transfers, and on each there was endorsed a transfer in blank signed by the registered holder.\nThese certificates formed part of a group of certificates issued by the Railway Company to the two banking houses mentioned covering a total of about 140,000 shares. They were so issued in order that the shares might be traded in on the stock exchanges in Germany and certain other European countries as bearer securities without being presented for transfer at a transfer office maintained by the company under each transfer of ownership. The certificates covering the 140,000 shares issued to the two banking houses were registered in the company's transfer office which it had been authorized to establish and had in fact established in New York City and transfers were registrable on the books of that office and nowhere else. Dividends on shares so transferable were payable at New York in United States funds.\nBraun brought the 48 certificates with him from Germany to the United States and in November, 1919, presented them for transfer and registration in his own name at the office of the Central Trust Company of New York. The acceptance of the transfers was refused on the ground that they could not be accepted having regard to the Canadian Consolidated Orders Respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1916, and an order of the Superior Court of Quebec made thereunder. The certificates have since remained in the possession of Braun or the claimant.\nOn April 23rd, 1919, the shares standing in the name of C. Schlessinger-Trier & Company and the Nationalbank fur Deutschland as well as other shares had been the subject of the order of the Superior Court of Quebec referred to. A copy of this order had been furnished to the Central Trust Company of New York on October 9th, 1919, with instructions from the Minister of Finance, who was then Custodian of Enemy Property, to make appropriate notations on the records, and between October 9th and October 24th the transfer agents placed against the accounts in the share register of each of the shareholders named in the order a note in the following terms:\nVested in the custodian appointed under Consolidated Orders respecting Trading with the Enemy by virtue of the judgment of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, Canada, made in the matter of Consolidated Orders respecting Trading with the Enemy, and the Secretary of State of Canada, Petitioner, and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, Respondent, and dated April 23rd, 1919.\nIn view of the result of this appeal, we are not concerned with various agreements made between the respondent and the Railway Company or with what was done by the Custodian with the shares standing in the name of the two banking houses. The claim advanced by Braun, and by the appellant after his death, was always disputed by the Custodian and after certain litigation in the United States had been allowed to lapse, this action, by the consent of the respondent under section 41 (2) of The Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920, was brought by the appellant in the Exchequer Court of Canada. The relief sought is a declaration that the claimant is the owner of the certificates of shares obtained by Braun and of the shares themselves; judgment against the respondent for the amount of the quarterly dividends declared upon the said shares in United States funds with interest from the respective due dates of the dividends; and for a certain sum in United States funds stated to have been received by the respondent in respect of the sale by him of \"rights\" declared to attach to the shares with interest.\nThe question submitted by the parties for the decision of the Court by the agreed statement of facts was as to what remedy or relief, if any, the claimant was entitled. The President of the Exchequer Court decided that the shares in question never at any time belonged to Braun or the claimant but as at January 10th, 1920, and since that date belonged to Canada and were vested in the respondent, and that the claimant was not entitled to the declaration of ownership asked by her statement of claim. The action was accordingly dismissed.\nThe crux of the matter is the proper interpretation of subsections 1 and 2 of section 6 of the Consolidated Orders Respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1916, enacted by the Governor General in Council under the authority of the War Measures Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 206, These subsections read as follows:\u2014\n6. (1) No transfer made after the publication of these orders and regulations in the Canada Gazette (unless upon licence duly granted exempting the particular transaction from the provisions of this subsection), by or on behalf of an enemy of any securities shall confer on the transferee any rights or remedies in respect thereof' and no company or municipal authority or other body by whom the securities were issued or are managed shall, except as hereinafter appears, take any cognizance of or otherwise act upon any notice of such a transfer.\n(2) No entry shall hereafter, during the continuance of the present war, be made in any register or branch register or other book kept within Canada of any transfer of any securities therein registered, inscribed or standing in the name of an enemy, except by leave of a court of competent jurisdiction or of the Secretary of State.\nWith these should be read clause (d) of subsection 1 of section 1 whereby:\u2014\n(1) For the purposes of these orders and regulations, the following expressions shall be construed so that\u2014\n***\n(d) \"Securities\" shall extend to and include stock, shares, annuities, bonds, debentures or debenture stock or other obligations issued by or on behalf of any government, municipal or other authority, or any corporation or company whether within or without Canada.\nThe appellant contends that these provisions apply only to persons, property and transactions within the territorial boundaries of Canada and have neither authority nor effect to restrain persons, property or transactions of foreigners in foreign countries. So far as the Exchequer Court is concerned that argument was disposed of by the decision of the late President in Spitz v. Secretary of State of Canada[2]. I may say at once that I approve that judgment and the reasons therefor but add the following to emphasize some of the matters dealt with therein and to cover any new arguments that have been adduced. While undoubtedly the Governor in Council could not prevent the share certificates from being physically endorsed by the holder and handed over to a purchaser, he could provide that no transfer should confer on the transferee any rights or remedies in respect of such securities. Such a power was necessary to attain the desired object of preventing any material aid being secured by the enemy. While ordinarily (in the present instance) the law of Germany would determine the effect of the contract to transfer the certificates, \"the distinction\", as Professor Beale points out in volume 1 of his Conflict of Laws, page 446, \"between the certificate of stock and the stock itself is an important one. The latter has its situs at the domicile of the corporation and there only\".\nWe are not concerned with disputes between the Custodians of Enemy Property of allied countries as was this Court in Secretary of State of Canada v. Alien Property Custodian (U.S.)[3], and the Supreme Court of the United States in Disconto-Gesellschaft v. U.S. Steel Co.[4]. Nor is the problem the same as that considered in The King v. Cutting[5], but in the opinions delivered in that case are two statements that are not without significance and bearing upon the present appeal. The first appears at page 414 in the judgments of Duff and Smith JJ., delivered by the former:\u2014\nBut there is nothing in the Bank Act to prevent a purchaser or creditor acquiring by contract a right legal and equitable to require the vendor or debtor to do whatever is necessary in order to effect a legal transfer of such share; and the question whether such is the effect of the contract will depend upon the law of the place where the contract is made\u2014Colonial Bank v. Cady[6], nor I apprehend\u2014is there any doubt that the conditions under which title to its shares may be acquired is exclusively matter for the law making authority of the jurisdiction where the Corporation has its proper domicile.\nThe present Chief Justice of this Court agreed with that judgment and also with the judgments of Lamont and Cannon JJ., delivered by the former. At page 418, Lamont J. said something to the same effect:\u2014\nThe effect of a contract to transfer shares made in another country must depend upon the laws of that country. But, subject to that law, it is within the competence of the Parliament of Canada in legislating on the subject of banks and banking\u2014a matter over which it is given exclusive jurisdiction by section 91 of the British North America Act, 1867,\u2014to compel a bank, its own creature, to recognize as valid a lawful transfer made outside of Canada, when made in the manner prescribed by the Act. Secretary of State of Canada v. Alien Property Custodian (U.S.)[7].\nHere the situs of the shares, as distinguished from that of the certificates, was in Canada and the New York Uniform Stock Transfer Law, relied upon by the appellant, has no bearing upon the question. The fact that the Railway Company was authorized to, and did in fact, establish a transfer office in the State of New York where, only, transfers of the shares in question were registrable, cannot make any difference. This was a mere matter of convenience and did not detract from the power of Canada to deal with the title to the shares of the Canadian company.\nThe appellant also relied on the decision of the Privy Council in Rex v. Williams[8]. There the Province of Ontario attempted to collect succession duty upon shares of a mining company incorporated by letters patent under the Ontario Companies Act and which had two transfer offices, one in Toronto and the other in Buffalo, New York, at either of which shareholders might have their shares registered and transferred in the books of the company. The shares in question were those of a testator who died domiciled in New York and the share certificates themselves were physically located there. Viscount Maughan pointed out that \"One or other of the two possible places where the shares can be effectively transferred must therefore be selected on a rational ground\" (p. 559); and further: \"In a business sense the shares at the date of the death could effectively be dealt with in Buffalo and not in Ontario\" (p. 560). The considerations which apply to a discussion as to the situs of shares for provincial succession duty purposes where a provincial legislature is restricted to direct taxation within the province cannot affect the matter at present under review.\nThe respondent contended that at the relevant time the law of Germany, so far as it could be ascertained, prohibited in that country the transfer of the certificates and of any interest in the shares. It is unnecessary to deal with this contention because, assuming a transfer to Braun of the certificates valid by German law, such transfer did hot, in the language of subsection 1 of section 6 of the Consolidated Orders Respecting Trading with the Enemy \"confer on the transferee any rights or remedies in respect thereof\"; and furthermore \"no company * * * shall * * * take any cognizance of or otherwise act upon any notice of such a transfer\". Subsection 1 by itself is sufficient to justify the conclusion that when Braun bought the certificates, he actually secured nothing that would enable him to claim title to the shares. Clause (d) of subsection 1 of section 1 and subsection 2 of section 6 may be considered as having been included for extra precaution or to cover cases with which we are not concerned.\nThe Treaty of Versailles was signed on June 28th, 1919, and by para. (d) of Article 297 (contained in Section IV), as between the Allied and Associated Powers or their nationals, on the one hand, and Germany or her nationals, on the other hand, all the exceptional war measures or measures of transfer, or acts done or to be done in execution of such measures shall be considered as final and binding upon all persons. The definition of these measures in paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Annex to Article 297 is wide enough to include Consolidated Orders Respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1916, and the order of the Superior Court of Quebec of April 23rd, 1919. Furthermore, by paragraph (b) of Article 297 of the Treaty, the Allied and Associated Powers reserve the right to retain and liquidate all the property, rights and interests belonging at the date of the coming into force of the Treaty to German nationals. By The Treaties of Peace Act, 1919, being chapter 30 of the Dominion statutes of that year (2nd Sess.), the Governor in Council was authorized to make such appointments, establish such offices, make such Orders in Council and do such things as would appear to him to be necessary for carrying out the Treaty of Versailles and for giving effect to any of the provisions thereof.\nThe Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920, was accordingly enacted by the Governor in Council and subsequently amended. By this Order\u2014\"During the war\" means \"at any time between six o'clock (eastern standard time) in the afternoon of the fourth day of August, 1914, and midnight (eastern standard time) of the tenth-eleventh day of January, 1920\". Section 33 provides that all property, rights and interests in Canada belonging on the tenth day of January, 1920, to enemies or heretofore belonging to enemies and in the possession or control of the Custodian at the date of the Order are vested in and subject to the control of the Custodian, and notwithstanding anything in any order heretofore made vesting in the Custodian any property, right or interest formerly belonging to an enemy, such property, right or interest shall be vested in and subject to the control of the Custodian who shall hold the same on the same terms and with the same powers and duties in respect thereof as the property, rights and interests vested in him by this Order. By section 34, all vesting orders made or given or purporting to be made or given in pursuance of the Consolidated Orders Respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1916, and all actions taken with regard to any property, business or company, whether as regards its investigation, sequestration, compulsory administration, use, requisition, supervision or winding up, the sale or management of property, rights or interests, the collection or discharge of debts, the payment of costs, charges or expenses, or any other matter whatsoever in pursuance of any such order, direction, decision or instruction, and in general all exceptional war measures or measures of transfer or acts done or to be done in the execution of any such measures, are hereby validated and confirmed and shall be considered as final and binding upon all persons.\nThe order of the Superior Court of Quebec of April 23rd, 1919, was such an order and it is not necessary to refer further to it except to state that it vested the shares in question in the Minister of Finance and Receiver-General of Canada as the Custodian appointed by the Consolidated Orders Respecting Trading with the Enemy. The shares were subsequently dealt with by the Minister of Finance or his successor as Custodian. The order of the Superior Court was confirmed, and all such dealings were authorized, by the Treaty of Versailles and by The Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920. The appeal should be dismissed. In accordance with the terms of the consent of the Custodian to the bringing of this action, such dismissal is without costs.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. R.

(Plaintiff)\n1944: May 29, 30, 31; 1944: June 1; 1944: October 3.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Hudson, Taschereau and Rand JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nIndustry and Labour\u2014Constitutional Law\u2014The Industrial Standards Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 191\u2014Constitutional validity of the Act and of regulations made thereunder\u2014Sufficiency, for compliance with the Act and regulations, of proceedings taken for creation of a schedule under the Act\u2014Validity of the schedule.\nAppellants called in question the constitutional validity of The Industrial Standards Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 191, and regulations made pursuant thereto, and claimed that, in any event, a certain schedule, purporting to have been established pursuant to the Act, and which was approved by the Minister of Labour and on his recommendation declared to be in force by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, of wages and hours and days of labour for the Men\u2019s and Boys\u2019 Clothing Industry for the Province of Ontario, and which purported to confer upon the Advisory Committee appointed pursuant to the provisions of said Act and schedule, inter alia, the power to collect certain assessments of money from appellants and other manufacturers engaged in the industry and to administer and enforce the schedule, was illegal, void and ultra vires, because (so it was alleged) certain proceedings and conditions required for the creation of the schedule were not properly taken or observed.\nHeld: The said Act and regulations were not ultra vires; and they were sufficiently complied with in the creation of the schedule in question. Judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1943] O.R. 526, affirming judgment of Mackay J., [1942] CR. 518, dismissing appellants\u2019 action, affirmed.\nDealing specifically with questions raised, this Court held as follows:\nThe giving to the Industry and Labour Board of its powers under s. 5 (c) and (e) of the Act is not ultra vires the provincial legislature.\nThe said Board in exercising its powers under the Act is not a court of justice analogous to a superior, district or county court; it would seem to be merely an administrative body, but, in any event, it does not come within the intendment of s. 96 of the B.N.A. Act.\nClause (l) of s. 7 of the Act (as to assessment of and collection from employers and employees) and clauses 16 and 17 of the regulations (as to collection of assessments from employees by, and remittance by, employers) cannot be said to authorize the imposition of an indirect tax. If the assessment be a tax, it is a direct tax. Assessment may be justified as a fee for services rendered by the Province or by its authorized instrumentalities under the powers given to provincial legislatures by s. 92 (13) and (16) of the B.N.A. Act (Shannon v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board, [1938] A.C. 708).\nThe Act, regulations and schedule are not ultra vires as encroaching upon a field occupied by the Dominion in the Combines Investigation Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 26, as amended); the legislature would have authority to enact anything which is found in the schedule; and such legislation (and therefore the combined effect of the Act, regulations and schedule) cannot be said to be a \u201ccombine\u201d within the meaning, of the Dominion Act.\nThe notice in the present case (described in the judgment) convening the conference of the employers and employees in the industry for the purpose mentioned in s. 6 of the Act, was sufficient in point of form; and the extent and manner of notification (publication of the notice in three Toronto newspapers and notification, giving date of the conference and calling attention to the newspaper advertisements, to employers named in a list on file in the Department of Labour, and to various union representatives) was, in the circumstances (set out in the judgment), sufficient. As long as the Minister of Labour and his officers act in good faith, all such matters must be left to their discretion, They were justified in proceeding upon notice to those employers whose names appeared on the departmental list and to the officials of various unions who, in the industrial standards officer\u2019s opinion, represented the great majority of the employees engaged in the industry. The Minister and his officers were also justified in omitting custom tailors from the conference. It was quite apparent that in the view of the industrial standards officer (and in the view of the trade) custom tailors did not come within the industry as designated and defined. Even if that were not so, under clause f of s. 7 of the Act the schedule could and did classify employers by omitting custom tailors from the industry.\nAs to objection to the procedure taken in the carrying on of the conference: By the first branch of s. 8 of the Act, it was the prerogative of the Minister, and his alone, to determine whether a schedule was agreed to by a proper and sufficient representation of employers and employees; and such a determination is not reviewable by the courts.\nThe fixing by the schedule of different minimum rates of wages in two areas or sections of the province (the schedule providing that minimum rates fixed to apply in certain counties might be 12\u00bd% less in the rest of the province) was not unauthorized. By s. 4 (2) of the Act, the zone designated by the Minister (in this case the whole of the province) could be divided into separate zones by the conference. This was done and, within the meaning of said s. 4 (2), the Minister, by his approval of the schedule submitted to him, approved such division, whereupon the area as divided was \u201cdeemed to be the designated * * * zones for the industry affected\u201d.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing the present appellants\u2019 appeal from the judgment of Mackay J.[2] dismissing their action, in which action they claimed: that The Industrial Standards Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 191 (as amended in 1939, c. 21) and regulations made pursuant thereto, were ultra vires, and that, in any event, a certain schedule, purporting to have been established pursuant to the Act, and which was approved by the Minister of Labour and on his recommendation declared to be in force by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council on or about April 1, 1939, of wages and hours and days of labour for the Men\u2019s and Boys\u2019 Clothing Industry for the Province of Ontario, and which purported to confer upon the defendant (the respondent the Advisory Committee appointed pursuant to the provisions of the said Act and schedule), inter alia, the power to collect certain assessments of money from appellants and other manufacturers engaged in the industry and to administer and enforce the schedule, was illegal, void and ultra vires, because (so it was alleged) certain proceedings and conditions required for the creation of the schedule were not properly taken or observed; an injunction to restrain the defendant (the said Advisory Committee), its servants, etc., from proceeding with certain prosecutions brought under the Act and from attempting to collect from appellants any sums of money whatever alleged to be owing under the said schedule and from enforcing or attempting to enforce the said Act, regulations and schedule against appellants; and damages for legal expenses incurred in defending the prosecutions and for loss of time and travelling expenses incurred.\nThe questions involved and the facts from which they arise are stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported and in the judgments at trial and on appeal above cited.\nLeave to appeal to this Court was granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nBy an order of Mackay J. in the Supreme Court of Ontario, the Attorney-General for Ontario was added as a party defendant (reserving to him \u201call just exceptions and rights\u201d).\nA. G. Slaght K.C. and C. H. Howard for the appellants.\nJ. L. Cohen K.C. for the respondent The Advisory Committee.\nC. R. Magone K.C. for the respondent The Attorney-General for Ontario.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014Originally this was an action against the Advisory Committee appointed pursuant to the provisions of The Industrial Standards Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 191, and of what is known as the Schedule for the Men\u2019s and Boys\u2019 Clothing Industry for the Province of Ontario. The action, as framed, was an attack on the Act as being ultra vires the provincial legislature. It was tried before Mr. Justice Roach and dismissed[3]. The Tolton Manufacturing Co. Limited, one of the plaintiffs, then withdrew from the action by filing a notice of discontinuance. The remaining plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario who gave them leave to amend their statement of claim as they might be advised in order to raise specifically the claim that the regulations und schedule were invalid as not being in conformity with the Act[4]. Amendments were duly made and at the second trial the Attorney-General for Ontario, by his consent and at his instance, was added as a party defendant. After a lengthy hearing, the action was dismissed by Mr. Justice Mackay[5] and an appeal from that judgment was dismissed[6]. It is from such dismissal that the present appeal is taken.\nAt the conclusion of Mr. Slaght\u2019s argument, the Court intimated that it would be unnecessary to hear counsel for the respondents upon any of the questions raised as to The Industrial Standards Act being beyond the competence of the Ontario Legislature. These and the other questions raised will appear as the Act and regulations are examined and a statement made as to what was done thereunder.\nBy subsection 1 of section 4 of the Act, the Minister of Labour may from time to time designate the whole of the province, or any part or parts thereof, as a zone or zones for any business, calling, trade, undertaking and work of any nature whatsoever and any branch thereof and any combination of the same which he may designate or define as an industry for the purposes of the Act.\nSubsection 2 provides:\u2014\n(2) Any area so designated as a zone may be enlarged or reduced or divided into separate zones by the representatives of employers and employees in any conferences to be held as hereinafter provided and upon the approval of the Minister, the area as enlarged, reduced or divided, shall be deemed to be the designated zone or zones for the industry affected.\nThe effect of section 6 is that if, under section 4, the Minister shall have designated a zone, he may, upon the petition of representatives of employers or employees in any industry within that zone, authorize an industrial standards officer (for the appointment of whom provision is earlier made) to convene a conference of the employers and employees in such industry for the purpose of investi- gating and considering the conditions of labour and the practices prevailing in such industry and for negotiating in respect to any of the matters enumerated in section 7.\nBy section 7, this conference may submit to the Minister in writing a schedule of wages and hours and days of labour for the industry affected. This schedule may deal with a number of matters listed in the section. All of these matters need not be detailed, but, because of the argument addressed to the Court on behalf of the appellants, it is important to notice that by clause (f) the schedule may \u201cclassify the employees and employers and separately provide for each classification with respect to any of the matters which may be dealt with in such schedule\u201d, and that by clause (l) the schedule may, subject to the approval of The Industry and Labour Board (hereafter called the Board) \u201cand with respect only to an interprovincially competitive industry\u201d assess employers only or employers and employees in any such industry to provide revenue for the enforcement of the schedule. Provision is made for the appointment of the Board by another statute known as The Department of Labour Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 69, as amended.\nBy section 8 of The Industrial Standards Act, if, in the opinion of the Minister, the schedule of wages and hours and days of labour submitted by the conference is agreed to by a proper and sufficient representation of employers and employees, he may approve thereof; and upon his recommendation the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may declare such schedule to be in force. By section 13, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may make such regulations not inconsistent with the Act as he may deem necessary for carrying out the provisions of the Act and for the efficient administration thereof. Certain powers are given throughout the Act to Advisory Committees whose appointment by the Minister for every zone or group of zones to which any schedule applies is provided for by section 14. A right of appeal to the Board is given any employer or employee aggrieved by the decision of an Advisory Committee. Penalties are provided for violation by any employer or any employee of the provisions of any relevant schedule. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council duly promulgated regulations. Under clause 9 thereof the Board may require any employer to pay it the arrears of wages owing to any employee or employees according to the provisions of any schedule, and the Board may, at its discretion, direct that the whole, or any part, of such wages be either forfeited to the Crown or paid out to the employees entitled thereto. By clause 16, whenever any schedule requires the employees in any industry to pay an assessment on their wages to the Advisory Committee appointed to administer such schedule, every employer of any such employees, as the agent of such Advisory Committee, shall collect by deduction or retention of wages the amount of such assessment. Clause 17 provides that every such employer shall remit the amount so collected to the Advisory Committee.\nPursuant to subsection 1 of section 4 of the Act, the Minister, on November 7th, 1938, designated and defined as the Men\u2019s and Boys\u2019 Clothing Industry, for the purposes of the Act, all work performed in connection with the entire or partial manufacture or production anywhere in the Province of Ontario of all men\u2019s, boys\u2019 and youths\u2019 pants, coats, vests or suits of every type and description, manufactured from cross-bred serges, flannels of all kinds, worsted and cotton and wool mixtures,\u2014with certain exceptions. The only exception relevant to the argument presented to us is \u201cthe manufacture of clothing by merchant tailors employing or giving employment to no more than four workmen (including any working employer, his partner or partners) manufacturing clothing to order for individual customers according to individual sizes, measurements or specifications\u201d. At the same time the Minister designated the whole of the Province of Ontario as a zone for the said industry.\nAll objections to the sufficiency of the petition to the Minister, referred to in section 6 of the Act, to authorize an industrial standards officer to convene a conference of the employers and employees in the industry, were abandoned and we therefore need not examine the steps leading to the presentation of the petition to the Minister. In pursuance of such petition, the Minister, on November 17th, 1938, authorized Mr. Louis Fine, an industrial standards officer, to convene such a conference. Sometime in December, 1938, or early in January, 1939, the Board designated the industry an interprovincially competitive industry. Mr. Fine, in the name of the Minister, caused to be published on January 6th, 1939, in three Toronto newspapers, a notice that a conference of the employers and employees engaged in the industry (describing it fully) within a zone described as the whole of the province, was summoned to meet at 10 a.m. on Monday, January 16th, 1939, in Committee Room No. 1, Parliament Buildings, Toronto, for the purpose of investigating and considering the conditions of labour and the practices prevailing in the industry and for negotiating and submitting to the Minister a schedule of wages and hours and days of labour. Notice was further given that such schedule might contain provisions for the levying of an assessment upon the employers and employees for the purpose of administering the schedule and that, subject to the approval of the Board and Minister, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council might declare that such schedule should be binding upon all employers and employees. This is a very complete and very comprehensive notice and I can find no substance in the somewhat general complaint that it was not sufficient in point of form.\nIt should here be explained that the Act and its forerunner had been in force for some time and that the industrial standards officer had throughout the intervening years been in touch with employers in the men\u2019s and boys\u2019 clothing industry and with representatives of union employees engaged therein. There was on file in the Department a list of a great number of such employers. Notices of the date of the conference and calling attention to the advertisements were sent to these employers and to various union representatives. It was strenuously argued that these notices were not sufficient because not every employer was notified and only some representatives of employees. While, as pointed out above, counsel withdrew his objection to the sufficiency of the petition to the Minister, which by the first part of section 6 of the Act may be made by representatives of employers or employees, he pointed out that when, by the next part of section 6 the Minister may authorize an industrial standards officer to convene a con- ference, it is to be a conference \u201cof the employers and employees in such industry\u201d. From this, he argued, employers and employees must be notified, if not individually, at least in a more comprehensive manner than was done.\nSuch, however, is not the proper construction of the section. As long as the Minister and his officers act in good faith (and that is not questioned), all such matters must be left to their discretion. The Minister and his officers were justified in proceeding upon notice to those employers whose names appeared on the departmental list and to the officials of various unions who, in Mr. Fine\u2019s opinion, represented the great majority of the employees engaged in the industry. Furthermore, as to the employees, it appears that the matter of a, proposed schedule had been the subject of keen interest and discussion at the meetings of the union locals and that those in attendance thereat authorized the union officials to appear at the conference on their behalf.\nThe Minister and his officers were also justified in omitting custom tailors from the conference. It is quite apparent that in the view of the officer (and, it may be said, in the view of the trade), custom tailors in whose establishments a garment is made by one person do not fall within the description of merchant tailors who \u201cmanufacture\u201d clothing by their employees doing only one or more particular operations on a garment. Even if that were not so, under clause (f) of section 7, the schedule could and did classify employers by omitting custom tailors from the industry.\nOn January 16th a number of persons attended at the designated committee room and the meeting was adjourned to January 19th. On that day a committee was selected with full power to consider the matters mentioned in the notice. The general meeting adjourned without any definite date being fixed. The committee met on various dates until on February 7th its members decided that a plenary session of the conference would be held on February 8th and informed the parties they represented to that effect. On February 8th the conference reconvened and agreed to a schedule. Strenuous objection was raised to this method of procedure. but by the first branch of section 8 of the Act it was the prerogative of the Minister, and his alone, to determine whether a schedule was agreed to by a proper and sufficient representation of employers and employees. Such a determination is not reviewable by the courts, as has been held in many cases, a recent example of which is The King v. Noxzema Chemical Company of Canada Ltd.[7]. The Minister exercised that prerogative, approved the agreed schedule (which was also approved by the Board), and, upon his recommendation, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council declared it to be in force.\nThe schedule fixes the number of hours for a regular working week. It also fixes minimum rates of wages which are to apply in the Counties of Ontario, York, Peel, Halton and Wentworth, and provides that in the rest of the province the minimum rates might be 12\u00bd per centum less. The fixing of different rates in these two areas or sections of the province was objected to as unauthorized. The Chief Justice of Ontario states that this matter was not made the subject of special argument before the Court of Appeal, but before this Court the point was pressed and we have had the benefit of a complete argument. The Minister designated the whole of the province as a zone, but by subsection 2 of section 4 of the Act that zone could be divided into separate zones by the conference. This was done and, within the meaning of the same subsection, the Minister, by his approval of the schedule submitted to him, approved such division, whereupon the area as divided was \u201cdeemed to be the designated * * * zones for the industry affected\u201d. The objection fails.\nHaving reached the conclusion that the Act and regulations were complied with, there remains but to deal with the arguments as to constitutionality. Under section 5 (c) of the Act, the Board may, with the concurrence of the proper Advisory Committee, make an order amending the provisions of any schedule and, under section 5 (e), the Board may, with reference to any industry declared by it to be interprovincially competitive, approve or withhold approval of the provisions in a schedule with reference to the collection of revenue from employers and employees in the industry. The authorities are clear that there is nothing in the British North America Act to prohibit what is described by the appellants to be a delegation by the legislature of jurisdiction and authority to the Board to override and nullify many of the things previously done by the conference, the Minister and Order in Council.\nAs to the objection that, to quote appellants\u2019 factum:\u2014\nThe Board (constituted by Provincial authority) is given the same powers as a Court, being power to exercise judicial functions. This is ultra vires. (City of Toronto v. Township of York, [1937] O.R. 177, at 180, and in the Privy Council at [1938]. A.C. 415.),\nit is sufficient to point out that the Board, whatever it may be, is certainly not a court of justice analogous to a superior, district or county court. In my view it is merely an administrative body, but, in any event, it does not \u201ccome within the intendment of section 96 of the British North America Act\u201d. Reference re Adoption Act, etc. [8].\nNor can the contention prevail that section 7 (l) of the Act and clauses 16 and 17 of the regulations authorize the imposition of an indirect tax. If the assessment be a tax, it is a direct tax within the meaning of the decisions of the Judicial Committee and of this Court; and, in any event, it may be justified as a fee for services rendered by the Province or by its authorized instrumentalities under the powers given provincial legislatures by section 92 (13) and 92 (16) of the British North America Act. Shannon v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board [9].\nThe last argument of the appellants on this branch of the case is that \u201cThe Statute, regulations and schedule are also ultra vires because they encroach upon a field occupied by the Dominion in the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 26, as amended\u201d. As Kellock, J.A., points out, the legislature would undoubtedly have authority to enact anything which is found in the schedule and I agree with him that such legislation (and therefore the combined effect of the Act, regulations and schedule) cannot be said to be a \u201ccombine\u201d within the meaning of the Dominion Act. These conclusions render it unnecessary to consider the question as to whether or not the Advisory Committee was a proper party defendant. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: German, Howard & Rapoport.\nSolicitor for the respondent The Advisory Committee: J.L.

(Judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1943] O.W.N. 463, affirming judgment of McFarland J., [1943] O.W.N. 116, dismissing the action, reversed.) APPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing their appeal from the judgment of McFarland J.[2] dismissing their action and allowing the defendants\u2019 counterclaim.\nOn June 16, 1941, Robert Milner (now deceased, of whose will the defendants are executors) and the plaintiff Fleming entered into an agreement by the terms of which Milner agreed to sell to Fleming certain land in Chatham, Ontario. The agreement, inter alia, provided that on any breach of covenant by the purchaser he was to give up possession and the agreement was to be (at the vendor\u2019s option) void, and declared that time was \u201cto be the very essence of this agreement\u201d.\nAt various times prior to the said agreement there had been transactions between one and another or among all, of Milner, Fleming and Adams (co-plaintiff of Fleming), which, as well as the circumstances of the agreement in question, are set out in the reasons for judgment in this Court infra.\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the said agreement was entered into by way of securing Milner for a loan to Fleming, that by inadvertence Fleming failed to make a certain payment when it was due under the agreement but later tendered it with interest and had always been and was still ready, able and willing to make it.\nThe plaintiff Fleming claimed an order directing the defendants to receive payment, an order relieving against forfeiture and allowing redemption. The plaintiff Adams, to whom Fleming had assigned the said agreement (which assignment the defendants claimed was in breach of the agreement), claimed an order allowing him to redeem the property and for relief against forfeiture.\nThe defendants counterclaimed for judgment declaring the agreement void and declaring the defendants entitled to possession, freed and discharged from every claim whatsoever of the plaintiffs or either of them in and to the land. McFarland J. dismissed the action and gave judgment for the defendants on their counterclaim[3]. An appeal by the plaintiffs to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed[4]. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nJ.R. Cartwright K.C. and J.A. McNevin K.C. for the appellants.\nC.F.H. Carson K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nHUDSON J.\u2014The late Robert Milner became the legal owner in fee simple of a parcel of land in the City of Chatham on the 3rd day of March, 1936. On the following day, he entered into an agreement to sell this land to the appellant Fleming, who was then in occupation thereof.\nOn the 4th of August, 1938, there was a readjustment of the subsisting arrangement between Milner and Fleming and a new agreement was entered into by which Milner agreed to sell the land to Fleming for $11,000, payable, $1,000 on the 15th of December, 1938, and the balance in instalments, the last of which was $5,000 to be paid on the 15th of June, 1941. There was also a provision for the payment of interest on the amount of principal remaining due from time to time at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, not payable, however, until the 15th of June, 1941.\nWithin a few months after the last agreement was entered into, Fleming fell into financial difficulties and sought the assistance of his co-plaintiff, Adams, who made him some advances. On the 8th of December, 1938, Fleming, with the consent of Milner, assigned all his interest under the last-mentioned agreement to Adams. Shortly thereafter, Fleming ceased to occupy the premises and they were let by Adams to a man named Todgham who continued in occupation at least until the commencement of this suit.\nIn the month of June, 1941, there was owing to Milner under the agreement of the 4th of August, 1938, a principal sum of $5,000 and interest amounting to $1,440. Milner advanced $5,000 for the purpose of paying off Adams and received from the latter a quit claim deed. Further sums were advanced to pay taxes, etc. At this point the agreement now in question was entered into. It is dated the 16th of June, 1941, between Milner and Fleming. It recites that Milner is the owner and provides that he, as vendor, agrees to sell to Fleming, as purchaser, the land in question for the sum of $12,000, to be paid as follows: $1,000 on the principal on the 16th of June, 1942; $1,000 on the principal on the 16th of June, 1943, and the balance of the principal in the amount of $10,000 and interest on the 16th of June, 1944. The money advanced in the sum of $12,000 was to bear interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum.\nThere are covenants by Fleming, (1) to pay taxes; (2) not to assign without leave; (3) that in case of the breach of any covenant the whole purchase money should become due; (4) that in case of any such breach the agreement should at the option of the vendor be void. Time was made of the essence of the agreement.\nOn the 16th of August, 1941, Mr. Milner died at the advanced age of 92 years.\nOn the 16th of June, 1942, the payment of $1,000 fell due and was not paid. On the 6th of July, 1942, the solicitor for the respondents wrote to the appellant Fleming notifying him that by reason of breaches of covenants the executors were treating the agreement as void under the terms of the default clause.\nThe breaches assigned were that the instalment of $1,000 had not been paid, that taxes were not paid as they became due and that there was a violation of the covenant not to assign without leave.\nThe plaintiffs thereupon commenced this action, which was dismissed at the trial and the decision of the trial Judge affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nBriefly stated, the appellants\u2019 contentions are, firstly, that the agreement in question was in the nature of a mortgage and that they were entitled to redeem, and secondly, that if not a mortgage, yet the circumstances were such as to entitle them to relief from any forfeiture. In form the transaction is a sale by Milner of the land which he owned to Fleming for $12,000 to be paid in the future, but it is necessary for the court to determine its true nature and effect.\nUnfortunately, Mr. Milner was dead long before the trial and we are without knowledge of what his attitude would have been. It appears that when the agreement was under negotiation Mr. Milner insisted on the form which was adopted. There is no suggestion of fraud or deceit on his part.\nAt the time the agreement was entered into, Milner held the legal title but Fleming had an equitable interest which had not been extinguished or surrendered. Adams\u2019 position was analogous to that of a second mortgagee and his quit claim deed to Milner to a discharge of that mortgage. Fleming had been in possession of the land directly or through a tenant for many years. Substantial improvements had been added by him and the value of the property at this time was placed at from $20,000 to $25,000, as against $12,000 named as the purchase price in the agreement.\nThere is in the agreement no direct surrender by Fleming of his existing interest. Upon these facts, I find it difficult to believe that there was any intention on Milner\u2019s part to purchase Fleming\u2019s existing interest, or on the latter\u2019s part to sell. The facts are more consistent with a further advance to enable Fleming to clear off his debts and make a new start in life. It was in essence a borrowing transaction.\nHaving come to this conclusion on the facts, the right to redeem is clear. The law is succinctly stated in Falcon-bridge on Mortgages (3rd Ed.) at page 36:\u2014\nWhen the right of redemption after default became established, the Court of Chancery, in order to prevent its evasion, was obliged to hold that a mortgagor could not, by any agreement entered into at the time of the mortgage and as part of the mortgage transaction, contract away his right of redemption or fetter it in any way by confining it to a particular time or to a particular class of persons * * *. The equity judges looked not at what was technically the form, but at what was really the substance of transactions, and confined the application of their rules to cases in which they thought that in its substance the transaction was oppressive. and again at page 54 as follows:\u2014\nFurthermore a mortgagor may, by a separate and independent transaction subsequent to the making of the mortgage, sell or release his equity of redemption to the mortgagee, or give the mortgagee the option of purchasing the mortgaged property and thus in effect deprive himself of his right to redeem * * *. The relation of the parties is that of vendor and purchaser and the onus of justifying the transaction is not upon the mortgagee.\nMilner had a right to buy Fleming\u2019s equity, but the fact that here all was done in what was essentially one transaction leads to an inference of a further loan rather than of a purchase.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment at the trial reversed. The appellants having declared their readiness and ability to pay the total amount due, the judgment should run to the following effect: It should declare that the agreement of sale between Robert Milner and Andrew J. Fleming, dated June 16th, 1941, is in reality a mortgage from Fleming to Milner, and that all necessary inquiries be made, accounts taken, costs taxed and proceedings had for the redemption of the premises in question, and that for this purpose the cause be referred to the Local Master of the Supreme Court of Ontario at Chatham. The judgment should contain the usual clauses in a judgment for redemption. Since the respondents failed on the main issue requiring a trial, they should only be entitled to their costs of the action down to the close of the pleadings but must pay the costs thereafter. The costs of the reference will be dealt with by the Local Master in the usual way. The counterclaim is dismissed with costs and the appellants are entitled to their costs in the Court of Appeal and this Court.\nRAND J.\u2014The facts in this controversy will be better appreciated by setting them forth chronologically. In the year 1934 the appellant Fleming entered into a contract to buy, for the sum of $7,000, a lot on the east side of William Street in Chatham, Ontario. It was contiguous on the south to a lot on the corner of William and Wellington Streets, then owned by the deceased, Robert Milner, represented by the respondents. It will be convenient to call the former the Watts lot and the latter the Milner lot. By 1936 Fleming had paid something in the neighbourhood of $3,500 on the purchase price. There was on the land at this time a mortgage to a loan company apparently for $3,500 or thereabouts. This contract, if in writing, was not placed in evidence.\nIn 1936 Milner, an elderly man who had been a friend of Fleming\u2019s father, agreed to sell to Fleming the Milner lot for $6,000. At least $1,500 was paid at the time on account of this price. At the same time or shortly afterwards, he agreed to assist Fleming in financing by paying off the balance of the purchase price owing on the Watts lot, taking a conveyance from the owner to himself and consolidating the two transactions. Under date of March 4th, 1936, there was executed what purports to be a contract of sale to Fleming of the Watts lot for the sum of $8,000, payable in four annual instalments of $1,000 each and the balance of $4,000 on June 10th, 1940. The agreement contains a statement to the effect that\npart of the consideration for this agreement is the balance of the purchase price owing by the Purchaser herein to the Vendor herein on the purchase of the property adjoining immediately to the south of the property herein described, and that payments on this agreement shall be also payments on the sale agreement between the above parties covering the lands immediately to the south of the above described property.\nFleming was now in possession of both lots. The building on the Milner lot was torn down and a new one erected which, with the remodelled structure on the Watts lot, made a garage running across the back portions of both lots and fronting on Wellington Street. On December 16th, 1938, the premises were leased by the appellant Adams to one Todgham at a rent of $2,580 per annum.\nIn 1938 Milner made a further advance of $4,050 to assist Fleming in financing the garage business he was then carrying on. The arrangement is evidenced by an agreement dated July 30th, 1938, and its recital is to this effect:\u2014\nWhereas the Vendor has agreed to sell and the Purchaser has agreed to purchase, upon the terms and conditions thereinafter mentioned all and singular that certain parcel or tract of land and premises [etc., describing the Watts lot].\nThat land was, of course, already the subject-matter of the written document of the 4th of March, 1936, by which the purchase price was expressed to be $8,000. In the later agreement also it is stated that Fleming was in default in his payments under the agreement of March 4th, 1936, and that the principal sum at that time outstanding was $6,500. Provision was then made to pay this latter sum in four instalments as set forth. It was declared also that part of the consideration for the agreement was\nthe balance of the purchase price owing by the Purchaser herein to the Vendor herein on the purchase of the property adjoining immediately to the south of the property herein described, and that payments on this agreement shall also be payments on the sale agreement between the above parties covering the lands immediately to the south of the above described property.\nA like provision, it will be recalled, was contained in the document of March 4th, 1936.\nOn the 4th of August, 1938, a further document was executed by Milner and Fleming. It purported to provide for the sale by Milner as vendor to Fleming as purchaser of the Watts lot for the sum of $11,000, payable by instalments, the last of which for the sum of $5,000 was to become due on June 15th, 1941. It was agreed\nthat this agreement is in lieu of and substituted for the hereinbefore agreements dated the 4th day of March, 1936, and the 30th day of July, 1938, and that this agreement dated the 4th day of August, 1938, shall be the only agreement affecting the hereinafter described property.\nThere is no reference in this document, as there was in those it superseded, to the purchase of the corner or Milner lot.\nWhen the final instalment under this arrangement became due in June, 1941, Adams, the assignee of the interest of Fleming, was ready to pay the $5,000 with interest to Milner but the latter \u201csaid he would like to put more money into the garage\u201d; the reply to Milner was: \u201cIf you want to put money in it at 5 per cent. it is all right with me. You can do whatever you wish. Otherwise your money is there for you.\u201d At this time the only sum outstanding between Milner and Fleming was the $5,000 instalment and the interest. By a document dated June 16th, 1941, Milner purported to sell anew to Fleming the same land, the Watts lot, for the sum of $12,000. The preamble recited:\u2014\nWhereas the party of the first part, Robert Milner, is the owner of the hereinafter described premises in the City of Chatham in the County of Kent. And whereas the party of the first part, Robert Milner, is desirous of selling the said hereinafter described premises to Andrew J. Fleming, upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set out in this agreement.\nA clause provided that \u201cthe money advanced in the sum of $12,000 is to bear interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum\u201d. There were terms covering adjustments of taxes, insurance premiums and rentals to the 16th day of June, 1941; exempting the vendor from furnishing an abstract of title; providing that on any breach the purchaser was to give up possession, the agreement to be void and the purchaser to have no recourse to recover any monies paid thereunder. As in the previous instruments it stipulated that time was \u201cto be the very essence of this agreement\u201d. On August 16th, 1941, Milner died.\nIt is on the last agreement that this action has been brought by Fleming and Adams for relief from forfeiture and to redeem. They are ready to pay the balance of the monies owing with all interest and other charges, and on those terms the relief is asked.\nThe grounds upon which the claim is contested are the breach by Fleming of a covenant against assignment without leave and the failure to pay the first instalment of $1,000 when it became due on June 16th, 1942. The questions raised for decision are whether the real arrangement between the parties was a mortgage or a sale, and whether, in either case, the appellants have lost their rights by reason of default in the respects mentioned.\nThe point of assignment, as a matter of fact, can be dealt with shortly. In December, 1938, with Milner\u2019s consent, Fleming had assigned his interest in the agreement of August 4th, 1938, to Adams as security for money owed. Before the agreement of June 16th, 1941, was executed Milner required a quit claim from Adams but his purpose is clear: he was entering into a new arrangement with Fleming to cover a new advance of approximately $5,600 for which he wanted an unencumbered title to the security. On June 17th, following the agreement, a new assignment was executed by Fleming, but this was not registered until after the death of Milner. In the month of September, 1941, the respondents became aware of it and through their solicitor notified Adams they would not recognize him in the transaction. By a letter on May 27th, 1942, likewise through the solicitor, they requested the city Tax Collector to collect the taxes from the tenant of the property, basing their action on the term of the agreement by which the taxes were to be paid by Fleming. This communication unequivocally recognized the agreement as then subsisting. On July 6th, 1942, a formal repudiation by letter was sent to Fleming based on the breaches of the covenants against assignment, to pay taxes, and to pay the instalment of $1,000 on June 16th, 1942. This letter confirms the inference from the conduct of the respondents from the autumn of 1941 until after June 16th, 1942, that they did not intend to act upon the breach to which the assignment is said to have given rise. The fact that the formal notification asserts the failure of payment of the instalment of June 16th, 1942, as a default, is conclusive of that waiver.\nWhat, then, was the real nature of the agreement between the parties and what the effect of the default in payment on June 16th, 1942? When the 1936 agreement between Milner and Fleming was entered into, the latter was already the equitable owner of the land; there was nothing in the agreement which destroyed that interest; nor has that interest, in any of the succeeding transactions, been released or surrendered. The contract failed in the essential function of executing in the purchaser the equitable estate: on the contrary, the purchaser agreed to encumber his existing estate with a consolidated charge, which involved a discharge of the contractual obligation to pay the balance of price for the Milner lot. I find no difficulty in the circumstance that Mrs. Watts conveyed the land direct to Milner. Milner was advancing to Fleming the balance of the purchase price. The usual step would have been a conveyance from Mrs. Watts to Fleming and a mortgage from Fleming to Milner. But Milner evidently desired to combine his dealings with Fleming under a single arrangement, and the mode adopted was one, though a somewhat clumsy, way of doing that.\nWhen we come to the transaction of July 30th, 1938, the real nature of these documents is put beyond doubt. There was made at this time an advance by Milner to Fleming of $4,050. It was pure loan, and yet, for the purpose of securing it, what purports to be a formal contract for the sale of land already covered by the 1936 agreement and in terms expressly maintaining both is drawn up. This form, according to the solicitor, was the \u201cidea\u201d of Milner; and that circumstance confirms Fleming\u2019s statement that the various transactions took the same form because \u201che (Milner) wanted it that way\u201d.\nThe instrument of 1941 carried similar stigmata. By that transaction he agreed to advance as a loan to Fleming about $5,600 which, with the interest and the balance owing, brought the total to $12,000; and it is that amount which purports and is claimed to be the price of the lot originally sold for $7,000, all of which had long since been paid to the real vendor.\nIt is significant, too, that that instrument should carry the language, \u201cthe money advanced in the sum of $12,000 is to bear interest\u201d. A vendor does not stipulate for interest on money advanced. That language unconsciously reveals the mind of Milner and it confirms the inference from the documents and the underlying facts that the money had not the character of sale price.\nThe transaction being, then, a mortgage, the case is the ordinary one of relief from forfeiture through default in payment of the money secured, and the right to redeem claimed should, in my opinion, have been granted to the appellants.\nIn this view it is unnecessary to consider the ground upon which the judgments below proceeded, that is, that the clause as of an agreement for the sale of land declaring time to be of the essence was conclusive and excluded relief from the resulting forfeiture. In the light of the decision in the case of In re Dagenham (Thames) Dock Co.[5], followed in Kilmer v. British Columbia Orchard Lands Limited[6], the point would appear to present more aspects for consideration than were apparently dealt with either on the trial or the appeal: and I do not express any opinion upon it. I would, therefore, allow the appeal on the terms proposed by my brother Hudson.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Kerr, McNevin, Gee & O\u2019Connor.\nSolicitor for the respondents: A.L.

CANADA\nRevenue\u2014Sales tax\u2014Contract of sale of machinery\u2014Purchase price to be paid by monthly progress instalments during period of construction\u2014Purchaser becoming insolvent before completion and delivery of machine\u2014Claim by the Crown for sales tax on remaining instalments then not collected\u2014The Special War Revenue Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 179, s. 86\nThe respondent company entered into a contract, on June 5th, 1937, for the sale of a pulp-drying machine to the Lake Sulphite Pulp Company for the price of $488,335 payable in nine monthly progress instalments of $48,800) each commencing July 5th, 1937, and the balance of $49,135 when the machine would be in operation, title to pass on payment in full of the price. Six instalments were paid to the respondent and the sales tax on them was paid by the latter to the appellant. On February 5th, 1938, a petition in bankruptcy was filed against the Pulp Company; and on the 11th of February, all work on the machine was stopped. On February 22nd, an order was made for winding up under the Dominion Winding Up Act and a liquidator was appointed. The Crown brought an action for the recovery from the respondent of the sum of $10,844.46 for sales tax and penalties on the instalments payable on the 5th days of January, February and March, 1938, the tax being claimed under section 86 of the Special War Revenue Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 179. The first proviso of that section enacts inter alia that \"the tax shall be payable pro tanto at the time each of such instalments falls due and becomes payable in accordance with the terms of the contract, and all such transactions shall, for the purpose of the section, be regarded as sales and deliveries\"; and the second proviso further enacts that \"in any case where there is no physical delivery of the goods by the manufacturer or producer, the said tax shall be payable when the property in the said goods passes to the purchaser thereof\". The contention of the Crown is that the case is within the first proviso and that, as the agreement formally provided for instalments on specified dates, when these dates arrived the tax eo instanti became an absolute obligation to the Crown divorced wholly from the contract.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, [1943] Ex. C.R. 49), that there was no liability on the respondent for sales tax as claimed by the Crown.\nPer The Chief Justice and Kerwin, Taschereau and Rand JJ.\u2014The language of the first proviso, appropriate to a contract performed according to its original terms, presents difficulties in its application to one which has been modified or disrupted; and, therefore, such language is subject to interpretation. If, for instance, after some instalments and the related taxes had been paid, the parties had altered the agreement by either increasing or reducing the price, the incidence of the tax must thereafter vary accordingly. And, in case of disruption of the contract, to sustain the right to the tax, the instalment become payable must remain an obligation of an executory contract. In the present case, the fact of bankruptcy intervening is a circumstance fatal to the right of the Crown to maintain the information. When, on February 22nd, 1938, the liquidation order was made, the instalments for the balance of purchase price ceased to be \"due\" and \"payable\" within the meaning of the statute; the respondent could not have enforced payment of the remaining instalments and the essential condition of the tax that they should continue as effective obligations of a contract of sale was not existing when the information was issued.\nPer Hudson J.\u2014The sales price, under the contract, was to be paid in instalments in the nature of progress payments although there was no provision that these instalments should be made in accordance with any particular rate of progress, but it must be assumed that it was the intention of the parties that the payments should not become payable until the respondent was making fair progress in its work. Therefore, it is doubtful, upon evidence of delays by the respondent, whether or not the instalments in respect of which the Crown claims ever fell \"due\" and \"payable\" in order to bring them within the terms of the first proviso. But, even if it were so, the second proviso must prevail, as the property in the goods never passed to the purchaser: the machinery was never completed, and thus was never capable of physical delivery in fulfilment of the contract. Forbes v. Git ([1922] A.C. 256) applied.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Angers J.[1], dismissing an information exhibited by the Attorney-General of Canada to recover from the respondent sales tax and penalties alleged due the Crown under the provisions of the Special War Revenue Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 179. The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C., Roger Ouimet and W. R. Jackett for the appellant.\nHazen Hansard for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin, Taschereau and Rand JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.\u2014This is an information brought to recover sales taxes claimed in respect of a contract of sale between the respondent as seller and the Lake Sulphite Pulp Company Limited as purchaser of an apparatus known as a pulp-drying machine. The machine was to be built according to plans and specifications, and delivery was to be made on or about March 5th, 1938, f.o.b. cars at Lachine, Quebec, with freight prepaid to the plant of the purchaser at Nipigon, Ontario. The erection of the machine was to be done by the purchaser. The proposal was under date of June 5th, 1937, and the acceptance by the purchaser made on August 3rd, 1937.\nThe price was $488,335 payable in nine monthly progress instalments of $48,800 each commencing July 5th, 1937, and the balance of $49,135 when the machine was in operation but in no event later than six months from the date of final shipment or offer of shipment from the respondent's works at Lachine. Title was to pass on payment in full of the price.\nAlthough the acceptance was not made until August 3rd, work was actually commenced on June 15th and at the outset consisted of the preparation of plans, ordering of materials and parts, making of moulds, castings, machinery, etc. The instalments due on July 5th and August 5th were paid on August 27th, that for September 5th on the 30th of that month, for October on the 7th and for November on the 13th. Some time in December it was made known that the purchasers were under the necessity of raising funds to carry on the completion of their plant by an issue of treasury notes. A subscription of $50,000 by the respondent was made on terms that the instalment due on December 5th should be paid out of the funds realized, and that instalment was paid on January 11th, 1938. On February 5th, 1938, a petition in bankruptcy was filed against the Lake Sulphite Pulp Company and on the 11th of February all work on the machine was stopped. On February 22nd an order was made for winding up under the Dominion Winding Up Act and a liquidator was appointed.\nOn the 11th of February the purchaser had paid on account the sum of $292,800. There remained of the price a balance of $195,335. On the 6th day of April, 1938, the respondent by letter communicated to the liquidator the details of the contract, adding certain extras, sales tax and freight amounting to $1,66.2.80 and stating that the \"work under the contract\" was approximately 75 per cent completed. With that was submitted a statutory proof of claim for the sum of $202,820.76. The difference of $5,622.96 was for three small additional contracts. There is no evidence of what, if anything, took place thereafter between the liquidator and the respondent. The information was filed on the 25th day of April, 1940.\nThe tax is claimed under section 86 of The Special War Revenue Act, c. 179 R.S.C., 1927, as amended. Subsection (1) is as follows:\n1. There shall be imposed, levied and collected a consumption or sales tax of eight per cent, on the sale price of all goods,\u2014\n(a) produced or manufactured in Canada, payable by the producer or manufacturer at the time of the delivery of such goods to the purchaser thereof.\nProvided that in the case of any contract for the sale of goods wherein it is provided that the sale price shall be paid to the manufacturer or producer by instalments as the work progresses, or under any form of conditional sales agreement, contract of hire-purchase or any form of contract whereby the property in the goods sold does not pass to the purchaser thereof until a future date, notwithstanding partial payment by instalments, the said tax shall be payable pro tanto at the time each of such instalments falls due and becomes payable in accordance with the terms of the contract, and all such transactions shall for the purposes of this section, be regarded as sales and deliveries.\nProvided further that in any case where there is no physical delivery of the goods by the manufacturer or producer, the said tax shall be payable when the property in the said goods passes to the purchaser thereof.\nIt is contended by the Crown that the case is within the first proviso and that, as the agreement formally provided for instalments on the 5th days of January, February and March, 1938, when these times arrived the tax eo instanti became an absolute obligation to the Crown divorced wholly from the contract. It was conceded that,] as the remaining balance was payable only after delivery or its equivalent, it could not be said to be due and payable and the tax had not arisen.\nThe transaction is undoubtedly within the first part of the proviso. It is a contract for the sale of goods\nwherein it is provided that the sale price shall be paid to the manufacturer or producer by instalments as the work progresses.\nIt contemplates the machine to be built or assembled by the respondent and the monthly payments are distributed evenly over the time allowed for construction. But there is nothing in the contract to indicate that the course of the work, whether as to plans or material or the production or assembly of parts, should follow any particular order or schedule or observe any uniformity of progress. That lay quite within the main obligation of the seller to furnish the apparatus at the time fixed.\nBy the proviso,\nthe tax shall be payable pro tanto at the time each of such instalments falls due and becomes payable in accordance with the terms of the contract, and all such transactions shall, for the purposes of this section, be regarded as sales and deliveries.\nThe words \"such transactions\" refer either to the contracts themselves or to the successive liabilities for instalments. But in either sense the expression \"becomes payable\" is not to be limited solely to the event of the day named for the payment of the instalment. What is contemplated is an obligation to pay arising from the legal effectiveness of the contract.\nThe language of the proviso, appropriate to a contract performed according to its original terms, presents difficulties in its application to one which has been modified or disrupted. If, for instance, after the first two instalments and the related taxes had been paid, the parties had altered the agreement by either increasing or reducing the price, there can be no doubt that the incidence of the tax would thereafter have varied accordingly. But what is the effect on unpaid taxes of a subsequent disturbance of the contract which affects the instalment obligations from which the taxes arose?\nAlthough the section declares the \"transaction\" to be a constructive sale and delivery, the fundamental support of the tax is an executory contract leading to the transfer of title and possession. That contract is conceived as a potential sale to which in turn is related a potential total tax: \"the tax shall be payable\". Pro tanto portions of the tax are related to instalments of price and, when the latter become payable as parts of a whole, the right to the tax takes on the same character: but throughout, the tax depends for its efficacy upon the maturing contract. For the total tax there is only an inchoate liability created by the making of the agreement: and to sustain the right to the tax, the instalment become payable must remain an obligation of an executory contract.\nThe legal liability at any time for any portion of the tax in no degree restricts the parties in good faith from modifying the contract as they see fit, and a fortiori it does not prevent a modification by operation of law. If, in the legal result, the actual transaction ceases to be one of sale, then the necessary support for the tax disappears. That result, at least where the termination of the contract does not effect a total rescission, will not affect the right to taxes on any portion of the price paid to the seller nor does it touch those that have been collected or reduced to judgment by the Crown.\nIt is contended that, on the dates mentioned, the work was so far behind any schedule as to constitute a breach sufficient to give rise to a suspensive defence by the purchaser. To prove that state of things a graph was introduced showing lines of normal progress and actual progress in the shop work, and indicating that completion by March 5th was impossible. It may be that on December 31st, 1937, the work was at such a stage that, even with the capacity available to the respondent, the machine could not have been finished on time. The evidence does not clearly indicate that. It is admitted that there was a quick as well as an average schedule for the work at the Lachine plant, the former of six months and the latter of nine. But assuming such a defence to be available under the Civil Code and on the footing that the contract was six weeks behind in its progress at the end of 1937, on January 11th, 1938, the instalment due on December 5th, 1937, was paid and the delay up to that time waived. It is not suggested that from then on until the insolvency appeared, a satisfactorily high rate of performance was not maintained.\nBut whether under the Act such a defence could have been interposed against the claim for the taxes, it is not necessary to decide. The fact of bankruptcy intervening is, in my opinion, a circumstance fatal to the right of the Crown to maintain this information. When, on February 22nd, the liquidation order was made, the instalments for the balance of purchase price ceased to be \"due\" and \"payable\" within the meaning of the statute. What remained to the respondent was to prove for unliquidated damages subject to the right of the liquidator to elect to complete the contract. It is not suggested there was any such election prior to the commencement of this proceeding. But the respondent could not have enforced payment of the remaining instalments and the essential condition of the tax that they should continue as effective obligations of a contract of sale was not existing when the information was issued. A right of election by the liquidator even then continuing could not affect the present proceeding.\nThis interpretation of the Act does not mean that either price or instalment of price in such a contract must be received before the tax is exigible but it does mean that where the obligation of such an executory contract is by operation of law destroyed, then unpaid taxes related to its terms, themselves suffer a corresponding effect. If that were no so, sellers with unsold property on their hands would be liable for taxes in respect of purchase price not only unpaid but the legal right to which had been annulled: and on the other hand a resale of the same property would attach to itself a new tax unrelated in any sense to that attributed to the first sale. What is created is a tax liability running parallel to executory commercial transactions which, before their completion, is exposed to the effect of contractual changes or fundamental legal infirmities to which they may become subjected.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nHudson J.\u2014This appeal concerns a claim on behalf of the Crown against the respondent in the sum of $10,844.46 as sales tax, and for a penalty for non-payment thereof.\nThe claim arises out of a contract in writing concluded on 3rd August, 1937, whereby the respondent company agreed to manufacture and deliver to the Lake Sulphite Pulp Company Limited a pulp-drying machine with accessories and spare parts for a price of $488,335, this amount to be paid in nine monthly progress payments of $48,800 each, commencing on the 5th of July, 1937, and continuing until a total of $439,800 should have been paid, and the balance of $49,135 when the machine was placed in operation, but in no event later than six months from the date of final shipment or offer of shipment. It was further stipulated that the property in the goods should remain the personal property of the respondents until the price had been fully paid for in cash.\nThe machine to be constructed was very large and complicated. It required much planning and a great variety of materials and skilled workmanship in construction over a considerable period of time.\nThe work of construction had actually been commenced prior to the conclusion of the written contract, and thereafter was carried on but not at the rate expected by the parties, owing to various causes which need not be considered. However, five progress payments totalling $244,000 had been paid by the Lake Sulphite Pulp Company by November 13th, 1937. Thereafter another instalment of $48,800 was made in January, 1938, in respect of the sum falling due in December, 1937, but no instalments were paid in the months of January, February and March of 1938, and it is for the amount of these three payments that the present proceedings are taken.\nIt appears that the Lake Sulphite Pulp Company found difficulty in paying its obligations about the end of 1937 and eventually a winding-up order was made against it on the 22nd of February, 1938. The respondent's manager learning of the Lake Sulphite Pulp Company's financial difficulties ceased work on the machinery entirely on February 11th, before the formal assignment.\nThe respondents paid sales tax to the Crown in respect of the payments actually made and the claim of the Crown is in brief that under section 86 (1) (a) of the Special War Revenue Act the respondents are liable for the tax in respect of the three payments above mentioned because these payments\nfell due and became payable in accordance with the terms of the contract during the months of January, February and March.\nThere is no dispute as to any material facts and the whole question is as to the interpretation of the section in relation to the facts. It must be kept in mind that the machinery was being sold as a unit, that it was never completely manufactured, and that physical delivery had not been made of any, except a small part of the value of $1,200 and that the property in such part of the machine as had been manufactured did not pass to the purchaser.\nSection 86 is as follows:\n86. 1. There shall be imposed, levied and collected a consumption or sales tax of eight per cent, on the sale price of all goods,\u2014\n(a) produced or manufactured in Canada, payable by the producer or manufacturer at the time of the delivery of such goods to the purchaser thereof.\nProvided that in the case of any contract for the sale of goods wherein it is provided that the sale price shall be paid to the manufacturer or producer by instalments as the work progresses, or under any form of conditional sales agreement, contract of hire-purchase or any form of contract whereby the property in the goods sold does not pass to the purchaser thereof until a future date, notwithstanding partial payment by instalments, the said tax shall be payable pro tanto at the time each of such instalments falls due and becomes payable in accordance with the terms of the contract, and all such transactions shall for the purposes of this section be regarded as sales and deliveries.\nProvided further that in any case where there is no physical delivery of the goods by the manufacturer or producer, the said tax shall be payable when the property in the said goods passes to the purchaser thereof.\nThis section requires careful analysis.\nUnder (a) the tax is payable on delivery of the goods.\nIn the first proviso, provision is made for earlier payments in cases where the contract calls for payment by instalments. In most of the cases falling within this proviso there would be an actual physical delivery of the goods agreed to be sold. For example, in cases of conditional sales and hire-purchase, this is almost invariably the case. In some, however, there would not be physical delivery and for such it is provided that a constructive or notional delivery should be assumed.\nThe second proviso does not apply to cases where there is an actual physical delivery, but in any other cases makes the tax payable when the property in the goods passes to the purchaser.\nThe facts in the present case may bring it within the language of the first proviso. By the contract the sales price was to be paid in instalments in the nature of progress payments although, there was no provision that these instalments should be made in accordance with any particular rate of progress. I think, however, that it must be assumed that it was the intention of the parties that the payments should not become payable until the respondent was making fair progress in its work. This was the interpretation of the Lake Sulphite Pulp Company officials because it appears from the evidence that that Company's manager protested against the delays of the respondent, and in fact held up the December payment for some time on that account.\nIt is a question whether or not the instalments in respect of which the Crown claims ever fell due and became payable but, even if this were so, I am of the opinion that the second proviso must prevail. The language is unqualified and it is clear that the property in the goods never passed to the purchaser. The second proviso does not destroy altogether the first but applies only to cases where there is no physical delivery. I think for that reason that the rule of construction approved of in Forbes v. Git[2] is applicable. The machinery was never completed and thus was never capable of physical delivery in fulfilment of the contract.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Roger Ouimet.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Montgomery, McMichael, Common & Howard.\n[1] [1943] Ex.

Respondent.\n1944: October 3; 1944: October 10.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Hudson, Taschereau and Rand JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nAppeal\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Motion to quash\u2014Claim of $2,000 under contract of lease\u2014Trial judge holding lease void, but granting $1,066.66 as reasonable value for use and occupation of premises\u2014Appellate court holding lease valid and awarding amount claimed, i.e., $2,000, with interest from date of service of action\u2014Appeal to Supreme Court of Canada\u2014Amount or value of matter in controversy\u2014Whether same is the difference between sums granted by the appellate and trial courts or whether it is the sum of $2,000, plus interest, granted by the appellate court\u2014Section 39, Supreme Court Act.\nThe respondent claimed from the appellant a sum of $2,000 for five unpaid rental instalments under the terms of a lease of water rights and property rights. The trial judge held that such instrument, being a lease in perpetuity, was void and of no effect; but he gave judgment in favour of the respondent for $1,066.66, amount representing a reasonable value for the use and occupation of the leased property for a certain period of time. On appeal by the respondent, the appellate court held that a valid subsisting lease terminating in 1956 was in effect and binding upon the parties and maintained the action as brought, condemning the present appellant to pay the sum of $2,000, with interest from the date of the service of the action. The appellant having appealed to this Court, the respondent moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction, on the ground that the amount of the matter in controversy was merely the difference between the sum of $2,000, claimed in the action and awarded by the appellate court and the sum of $1,066.66 awarded by the trial judge, i.e., a sum of $933.34, which would be insufficient to clothe this Court with jurisdiction. (Supreme Court Act, s. 39).\nHeld that an appeal lies to this Court from the judgment appealed from. The decision of the trial court, having been set aside, is no longer in controversy in the appeal before this Court. The matter upon which this Court will have to pronounce is whether at the time of the action the lease in question was still subsisting, and the true controversy in the appeal before this Court is the full amount of the condemnation pronounced by the appellate court. Therefore, the amount of the matter in controversy is more than $2,000, since the appellant is entitled to add to the amount of $2,000 granted by the appellate court the interest from the date of the service of the action up to the date of the judgment of the appellate court. This case is not similar to the one where the plaintiff only recovers part of the amount claimed for in the trial court and succeeds in having the amount increased in the appellate court. Berthiaume v. Laurier [1934] 2 D.L.R. 797 dist.\nMOTION on behalf of the respondent for an order quashing the appeal to this Court, which was brought from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Greenshields CJ. and granting to the respondent the sum of $2,000 with interest as claimed by the action.\nR. C. Holden K.C. for the motion.\nA. H. Elder K.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The respondent, who was the plaintiff in the Superior Court of the province of Quebec, moved to quash the appeal to this Court from the Court of King's Bench on the ground that the amount, or value, of the matter in controversy in the appeal does not exceed the sum of $2,000, as provided in section 39 of the Supreme Court Act.\nBy its action the respondent claimed from the appellant the sum of $2,000 for five unpaid rental instalments under the terms of a lease of water rights and property rights.\nThe trial judge held that the instrument in question was a lease in perpetuity and, as such, a violation of the law, and that in consequence the instrument was void and of no effect. However, he held that the appellant was in peaceable possession of the leased property up to the 1st of March, 1940, and that it must pay reasonable value for that use and occupation and he, therefore, gave judgment in favour of the respondent for $1,066.66, with interest from the date of the institution of the action and costs.\nThe present appellant did not appeal from this judgment, but the respondent appealed from it to the Court of King's Bench and the latter Court reversed the judgment of the Superior Court, holding that\nat the time of the institution of the action a valid subsisting lease terminating in February, 1956, was in effect and binding upon the parties. As a consequence, the court of appeal maintained the action as brought and condemned the present appellant' to pay to the respondent the sum of $2,000, with interest from the date of the service of the action.\nThe appellant then appealed to this Court and the respondent now moves to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction. He argues that the amount of the matter in controversy is merely the difference between the sum of $2,000, claimed in the action and awarded by the judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side), and the sum of $1,066.66 awarded by the judgment of the Superior Court, or altogether $933.34, which would be insufficient to clothe this Court with jurisdiction.\nWe cannot agree with such a view of the appeal. The judgment appealed from, and which will have to be considered by this Court, is the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, which held that the lease subsisted until 1956 and, on account of that holding, condemned the appellant to pay the sum of $2,000, with interest from the date of the service of the action. By that judgment the decision of the Superior Court was set aside and is no longer in controversy in the appeal before this Court. The matter upon which we will have to pronounce is whether at the time of the action the lease in question was still subsisting and the amount claimed for in the declaration was due by the appellant to the respondent. The amount of that matter is more than $2,000, since the appellant is entitled to add the interest from the date of the service of the action up to the date of the judgment in the Court of King's Bench.\nThis is not similar to a case where the plaintiff only recovers part of the amount claimed for in the Superior Court and succeeds in having the amount increased in the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side). In those cases the amount in controversy is only the amount of the increase, but in the present instance the respondent succeeded on an entirely different ground from that on which the Superior Court judgment was rendered, and we think that the true controversy in the appeal before this Court is the full amount of the condemnation pronounced by the Court of King's Bench. This case must be distinguished from that of Berthiaume v. Laurier[2], where, as a result of the judgment of the court of appeal, the only amount of the matter in controversy on the appeal to this Court was the sum of $1,000 awarded by way of credit, or set-off, by the court of appeal.\nFor these reasons, the motion to quash should be dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wainwright, Elder & Laidley.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Heward, Holden, Hutchison, Cliff, Meredith & Collins.\n[1] Q.R.

Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario on an undertaking by the defendant, the terms of which undertaking are set out in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported, the effect of which terms is expressed in said reasons in this Court as being \u201cthat no further lis exists between the parties and that they leave nothing for the respondent to fight over\u201d; and it is to that situation that the judgment now reported is directed.\nC.W.R. Bowlby K.C. for the appellant.\nA.M. Lewis K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014In this case the respondent claimed damages from the appellant for injuries and sickness suffered as a result of circumstances for which it held the appellant responsible.\nThe case came before the Judge of the County Court of the County of Wentworth, who dismissed the action with costs.\nUpon appeal, the Court of Appeal for Ontario set aside the judgment of the County Court and directed that the respondent do recover from the appellant the sum of $350, with costs of the action and of the appeal.\nThen, upon motion by the present appellant, the Court of Appeal granted leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada upon the following terms:\u2014\nThe [appellant] through its counsel undertaking to pay to the [respondent] in any event of the cause the amount of the judgment which she now has in the sum of $350, together with her party and party costs of the trial, the appeal to this Court [the Court of Appeal for Ontario] and the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, all to be taxed.\nThe result is that the terms put on the appellant are such that no further lis exists between the parties and that they leave nothing for the respondent to fight over.\nAs was said by Lord Loreburn, L.C., in Glasgow Navigation Co. v. Iron Ore Co.[2]:\u2014\nIt is not the function of a Court of law to advise parties as to what would be their rights under a hypothetical state of facts.\nThe appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada is from a judgment pronounced in a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d (Supreme Court Act, section 36); and the words \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d mean and include any action, suit, cause, matter or other proceeding in disposing of which the court appealed from has not exercised merely a regulative, administrative, or executive jurisdiction (section 2 (e)). It will be apparent that if this Court were to entertain the appeal, under the conditions stated in the order granting leave, it would not be called upon to decide, as between the parties, the issue presented in the judicial proceeding which was before the Court of Appeal. It would not have to decide whether the respondent is entitled to recover the damages for which she has brought action. It would have to merely express its view upon a legal question on which the appellant would hope to get a favourable opinion from the Court without in any way affecting the position between the parties.\nThe Courts have been instituted to decide cases or litigious matters, but not to entertain applications for advice upon legal questions, except, of course, in certain special procedures which are provided for under special statutes.\nThis is not the first time that this question comes before this Court. In Moir v. Huntingdon[3], the head-note is as follows:\u2014\nSince the rendering of the judgment by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench refusing to quash a by-law passed by the corporation of the village of Huntingdon, the by-law in question was repealed. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\u2014\nHeld, that the only matter in dispute between the parties being a mere question of costs, the court would not entertain the appeal.\nIn McKay v. Hinchinbrooke[4], it was disclosed that the only matter in dispute between the parties was a mere question of costs and the Court decided that it would not entertain the appeal.\nA fortiori in this case, where, as a result of the order granting leave, there is not even a question of costs left between the parties.\nIn Commissioner of Provincial Police v. The King on the prosecution of Pascal Dumont[5], Dumont had launched mandamus proceedings directed against the Commissioner of Police to compel him to return certain motor licences. The mandamus was granted by the Court of Appeal. After the judgment of the Appellate Court, the Commissioner of Police complied with the order and delivered up the licences and number plates to Dumont. The Commissioner of Police then appealed to this Court. Chief Justice Duff, delivering the judgment of the Court, said (at p. 320):\u2014\nFrom that point of view the appeal had no practical object. Even if the appellant\u2019s technical objection to the proceeding by way of mandamus had been well founded, the licences and number plates would still remain in the hands of the respondent; the purported suspension would still remain a void act and the only question for discussion on the appeal would be the academic technical question with regard to the propriety of proceeding by mandamus and the question of costs.\nAgain in the recent judgment of this Court in The King ex rel. Tolfree v. Clark et al.[6], an application was made to this Court for special leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the striking out by Hope J. of notice of motion in the nature of quo warranto for an order that the respondents show cause why they, as was alleged, did each unlawfully exercise or usurp the office, functions and liberties of a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario during and since the month of February, 1943, contrary to the provisions of the B.N A. Act (s. 85), whether or not the same were lawfully amended by The Legislative Assembly Act (R.S.O. 1937, c. 12, s. 3), notwithstanding The Legislative Assembly Extension Act, 1942 (Ont., 6 Geo. VI, c. 24), which, it was alleged, was ultra vires. Since the date of the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the \u201cthen present\u201d Legislative Assembly was dissolved. The application for leave came before the full Court and was refused. In the course of the judgment delivered for the Court by the Chief Justice, it was said (p. 72):\u2014\nAdmittedly the application by way of quo warranto was for the purpose of obtaining a judicial pronouncement upon the validity of the statute of 1942 extending the life of the Legislative Assembly, as well as section 3 of The Legislative Assembly Act. Nevertheless, the direct and immediate object of the proceeding was to obtain a judgment forejudging and excluding the respondents from sitting and exercising the functions of members of the \u201cthen present\u201d Legislative Assembly; and obviously, the Legislative Assembly having been dissolved since the delivery of the judgment of the Court of Appeal, such a judgment could not now be executed and could have no direct and immediate practical effect as between the parties, except as to costs. It is one of those cases where, the state of facts to which the proceedings in the lower Courts related and upon which they were founded having ceased to exist, the sub\u2011stratum of the litigation has disappeared. In accordance with well-settled principle, therefore, the appeal could not properly be entertained. The fact that some important question of law of public interest was or might be pertinent to the consideration of the issue directly and immediately raised by the proceedings does not affect the application of the principle. Archibald v. Delisle[7]; Delta v. Vancouver Rly. Co.[8]\nIt may now, therefore, be regarded as well-settled that this Court will not decide abstract propositions of law, even if to determine the liability as to costs, which is not the case in the present instance. Moreover, this situation may not be affected by the fact that the provincial Court of Appeal has granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nIn Harris v. Harris[9], notwithstanding that the Court of Appeal for Ontario had granted leave, this Court, having come to the conclusion that it had no jurisdiction, refused to entertain the appeal. See also the decision of this Court in The Corporation of the City of Toronto v. Thompson et al.[10]\nWe do not wish to mean that a provincial Court of Appeal in giving leave to appeal, and in suitable cases, may not impose terms upon the appellant as a condition of his being permitted to appeal to this Court. The appellants may be asked to undertake to pray for no costs in this Court, or even to meet the costs of both sides in any event, or to be put on terms of a similar character, provided the terms for leave to appeal are not \u201cso framed as to take away from the respondent any interest in the result of the appeal whatever\u201d. These are the words of the Lord Chancellor in the decision of the House of Lords in Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada v. Jervis[11]. In that case the Court of Appeal had given leave to the appellants to appeal to the House of Lords on the following terms:\u2014\nOn the defendants undertaking to pay the costs, as between solicitor and client, in the House of Lords in any event, and not to ask for the return of any money directed to be paid by this order, it is ordered that the defendants be at liberty to lodge a petition of appeal to the House of Lords. It was held that, as the terms placed on the appellants by the Court of Appeal in giving leave were such as to have made it a matter of complete indifference to the respondent whether the appellants won or lost, the respondent in either event remaining in exactly the same position, the House would not hear such an appeal, as it would only be deciding an academic question and not an existing lis between the parties.\nLikewise, in the Privy Council in Attorney-General for Ontario v. The Hamilton Street Railway Co.[12], certain questions had been referred to the Court of Appeal by the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario and the Court of Appeal\u2019s answers were brought before the Privy Council. Their Lordships\u2019 opinion on the first question rendered it unnecessary to answer the second; but with regard to the remaining questions they stated that it was not the practice of the Board to give speculative opinions on hypothetical questions and that the questions must arise in concrete cases and involve private rights.\nAgain, in Attorney-General for Alberta v. Attorney-General for Canada[13], their Lordships held that:\u2014\nInasmuch as the Social Credit Board and the Provincial Credit Commission, as constituted under the Alberta Social Credit Act, 1937, no longer existed, that Act having been repealed since the order of the Supreme Court on the reference in this case, those bodies could not perform the powers proposed to be conferred upon them in respect of the Press Bill and the Credit Regulation Bill, which Bills, therefore, could not now be brought into operation, and their Lordships, in accordance with the established practice of the Board in such circumstances, declined to hear arguments on this appeal so far as it related to those two Bills.\nIn view of these reasons, we are unanimously of the opinion that this Court should decline to hear this appeal on the ground that there is no issue before the Court to be decided between the parties.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.W.R. Bowlby.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.M. Lewis.\n[1] [1944] O.R. 207; [1944] 2 D.L.R. 355.\n[2] [1910] A.C. 293, at 294.\n[3] (1891) 19 Can. S.C.R. 363.\n[4] (1894) 24 Can.

In order to enable the Superior Court to exercise its power under that article, it is not sufficient that these persons or bodies have failed to perform some duties imposed upon them by law, but it is necessary that their conduct will give rise to an illegality or a denial of justice which would be equivalent to fraud. Otherwise, as in the present case, the proper remedy of a ratepayer, if the school commissioners refuse or neglect to perform any of the duties imposed upon them by the School Code, is by way of an appeal to the Circuit Court or the Magistrate's Court under section 508 of the code.\nHeld, also, that school commissioners, when passing a resolution authorizing a contract of work for construction or improvement, have the right, with the approval of the Quebec Municipal Commission, to provide for the appropriation of the moneys required for paying the whole costs of the work by way of a loan secured by promissory notes, notwithstanding the provisions of article 248 of the School Code, such section merely limiting the borrowing power of the commissioners to \"temporary loans\" by means of notes pending the collection of school taxes.\nThe resolution of the school commissioners stipulated that, in order to provide for the payment of the notes and interest as they become due, a special annual tax will be imposed and levied on all taxable properties of the municipality. The respondents contended that no tax had been imposed by the resolution as the future sense had been employed in the wording of the resolution and that, consequently, when the contract had been awarded, and the loan effected, no tax was then in existence.\nHeld that the contract of work was illegally awarded by the school commissioners, as the terms of the resolution were not sufficient to create a tax. The exigencies of the law go further: it is necessary that a tax, which will be levied in the future, should actually be imposed by the resolution, there being a radical difference between the imposition of a tax and its levy. The awarding of the contract was in contravention of the non-ambiguous provisions of articles 237 and 244 of the School Code and the formalities therein prescribed must be strictly followed. But the contract alone is void, and the resolution itself is not illegal, as an incomplete resolution can always be amended. Goulet v. La Corporation de la Paroisse de St-Gervais (Q.R. 50 K.B. 513) approved.\nHeld, further, that school commissioners have the right, under article 236 of the School Code, to acquire immoveable property by means of an emphyteutic lease.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. [1943] K.B. 504) varied.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Marchand J., and maintaining the respondents' action, by which they asked that certain resolutions passed by the School Commissioners be declared illegal, irregular and void and that certain contracts entered into between the latter and the mis-en-cause be set aside. Fortunat Lord K.C. and Elie Beauregard K.C. for the appellants.\nAld\u00e9ric Laurendeau K.C. and J. M. Bureau K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014Il s'agit dans la pr\u00e9sente cause d'une action institu\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9s contre les appelant pour faire d\u00e9clarer ill\u00e9gales, irr\u00e9guli\u00e8res et nulles certaines r\u00e9solutions adoptees par la commission scolaire, et pour faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 certains contrats intervenus entre les appelants et les mis-en-cause.\nA une reunion de la commission scolaire tenue le 30 juillet 1941, une resolution a \u00e9t\u00e9 adoptee unanimement d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant (a) la construction \u00e0 un prix maximum de $7,000 d'une \u00e9cole pour gar\u00e7ons suivant les plans et sp\u00e9cifications approuv\u00e9s par le Surintendant de l'Instruction Publique, (b) l'acquisition par bail emphyt\u00e9otique d'un morceau de terre offert par la Fabrique, (c) un emprunt d'une somme de $7,000 par billet, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de 5 pour 100 par ann\u00e9e pour payer le co\u00fbt de la construction, (d) imposition d'une taxe sp\u00e9ciale affectant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re de la municipalit\u00e9.\nSubs\u00e9quemment, la commission scolaire a adopt\u00e9, le 27 septembre 1941, une autre r\u00e9solution accordant \u00e0 Patrick Douville, mis-en-cause, le contrat pour la construction de cette \u00e9cole, et le m\u00eame jour un contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 entre la commission scolaire et ledit Patrick Douville. A cette m\u00eame date, la commission scolaire a autoris\u00e9 son Pr\u00e9sident et son Secr\u00e9taire a signer un bail emphyt\u00e9otique avec l'\u0152uvre et Fabrique de la paroisse de St-Adelphe, pourvoyant \u00e0 l'acquisition du terrain sur lequel devait \u00eatre construite la maison d'\u00e9cole en question, et le 29 septembre, le Pr\u00e9sident et le Secr\u00e9taire ont sign\u00e9 ce bail emphyt\u00e9otique.\nPatrick Douville a imm\u00e9diatement commenc\u00e9 la construction de cette maison d'\u00e9cole sur le terrain acquis de l'\u0152uvre et Fabrique de la paroisse de St-Adelphe.\nLes intim\u00e9s ont institu\u00e9 leur action le 13 septembre 1941, et ils ont demand\u00e9 la nullit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9solution du 30 juillet 1941, et dans le cours du mois d'octobre, ils ont produit une demande incidente pour demander la nullit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9solution du 27 septembre accordant le contrat \u00e0 Patrick Douville, ainsi que la nullit\u00e9 de ce contrat. Ils demandaient \u00e9galement dans leur demande incidente la nullit\u00e9 du bail emphyt\u00e9otique intervenu avec les cur\u00e9 et marguilliers de l'\u0152uvre et Fabrique de la paroisse de St-Adelphe. Le tout \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9 d'une demande d'injonction.\nLe 14 ao\u00fbt 1942, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a donn\u00e9 raison aux intim\u00e9s tant sur l'action que sur la demande incidente, mais l'injonction n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue que quant aux frais. La Cour du Banc du Roi a confirm\u00e9 ce jugement et cette Cour a donc \u00e0 se prononcer sur trois points, soit la demande principale, la demande incidente et l'injonction.\nLes intim\u00e9s soutiennent que toutes les proc\u00e9dures faites par les commissaires d'\u00e9coles sont nulles, et ils all\u00e8guent diverses raisons \u00e0 l'appui de leurs pr\u00e9tentions. En premier lieu, ils soutiennent que les ordonnances vis\u00e9es leur causent une injustice grave \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 fraude et qu'elles sont en cons\u00e9quence ultra vires. Ils soumettent \u00e9galement que les ordonnances outrepassent les pouvoirs des appelants relatifs aux emprunts scolaires, et \u00e0 l'octroi du contrat d'entreprise.\nA l'appui de leurs premi\u00e8res pr\u00e9tentions, les intim\u00e9s disent que la municipalit\u00e9 scolaire de St-Adelphe est endett\u00e9e, que les revenus ordinaires de la municipalit\u00e9 ne sont pas suffisants pour rencontrer les d\u00e9penses ordinaires, que les maisons d'\u00e9coles dans la municipalit\u00e9 sont vieilles et offrent un danger constant pour la sant\u00e9 des enfants, que d'autres \u00e9coles auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre construites dans d'autres districts scolaires avant de construire celle autoris\u00e9e par la r\u00e9solution du 30 juillet 1941, que depuis quinze ans des enfants d'autres districts n'ont pas joui des facilit\u00e9s scolaires auxquelles ils avaient droit, que toutes les r\u00e9solutions et contrats pass\u00e9s font partie d'une conspiration, au d\u00e9triment d'une partie de la population, qui fait que leurs actes sont entach\u00e9s de mauvaise foi, et m\u00eame de fraude suffisante pour autoriser la Cour \u00e0 intervenir et \u00e0 renverser la d\u00e9cision des commissaires d'\u00e9coles.\nIl est bon de rappeler que dans cette paroisse de St-Adelphe il existait en 1941 un couvent dirig\u00e9 par les S\u0153urs de J\u00e9sus, et situ\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de l'\u00e9glise sur une terre appartenant \u00e0 la Fabrique. Comme il n'y avait pas d'\u00e9cole pour les enfants du sexe masculin dans ce district, les commissaires d'\u00e9coles, appelants dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, ont r\u00e9serv\u00e9 pour ces enfants deux classes dans le couvent. Ces classes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9es au Fr\u00e8re St-Gabriel, mais des plaintes se sont fait entendre \u00e0 ce sujet, et l'inspecteur r\u00e9gional a recommand\u00e9, en cons\u00e9quence, la construction d'une \u00e9cole pour les gar\u00e7ons.\nLe 26 mai 1941, le D\u00e9partement de l'Instruction Publique a promis un octroi de $4,500 pour la construction de cette \u00e9cole si elle \u00e9tait b\u00e2tie suivant les recommandations de l'inspecteur. De plus, la Fabrique, avec l'approbation de l'Ordinaire, a offert presque gratuitement un morceau de terrain pr\u00e8s de l'\u00e9glise pour servir de site \u00e0 cette nouvelle \u00e9cole.\nA la r\u00e9union de la commission scolaire du 30 juillet 1941, les intim\u00e9s ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aux appelants une requ\u00eate demandant la tenue d'un referendum sur l'opportunit\u00e9 d'adopter la r\u00e9solution inscrite \u00e0 l'ordre du jour, dont avis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 le 21 juillet pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, et d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant la construction de cette \u00e9cole pour gar\u00e7ons, l'acquisition de la pi\u00e8ce de terre de la Fabrique, et un emprunt de $7,000 pour rencontrer les d\u00e9penses \u00e0 \u00eatre encourues. A cette assembl\u00e9e, chacun a eu la libert\u00e9 d'\u00e9mettre ses opinions, mais la requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finitivement rejet\u00e9e. La r\u00e9solution a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e sur-le-champ Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e par la Commission Municipale le 19 ao\u00fbt 1941, et le 26 septembre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, le Secr\u00e9taire Provincial et le Ministre des Affaires Municipales ont aussi donn\u00e9 l'approbation requise par la loi.\nLa pr\u00e9sente action est institu\u00e9e sous l'empire de l'article 50 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile qui accorde \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure un droit de surveillance et de r\u00e9forme sur les corps politiques et les corporations dans la province, et cette Cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure n'est pas un tribunal d'appel des d\u00e9cisions des commissaires d'\u00e9coles. Le pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure par l'article 50 C.P.C. est un pouvoir de contr\u00f4le et de surveillance qui diff\u00e8re des pouvoirs que poss\u00e8de une cour d'appel.\nComme le dit M. le juge Brodeur dans la cause de H\u00e9bert vs Les Commissaires d'Ecoles de St-F\u00e9licien[2]: Une cour d'appel substitue son opinion sur les m\u00e9rites de la cause et l'opinion de la cour qui a rendu le jugement originaire, tandis que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, sous l'autorit\u00e9 de l'article 50 C.P.C. n'a pas le droit d'empi\u00e9ter sur les attributions qui appartiennent exclusivement aux autorit\u00e9s scolaires et de substituer son opinion \u00e0 celle des autorit\u00e9s sur le m\u00e9rite de leurs ordonnances pass\u00e9es r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et dans les limites de leurs attributions.\nAinsi, dans le cas actuel, la Cour de Circuit aurait eu pleine et enti\u00e8re juridiction pour s'enqu\u00e9rir de l'injustice de la r\u00e9solution attaqu\u00e9e, mais la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure peut tout au plus rechercher si la corporation scolaire a agi au del\u00e0 de ses pouvoirs, si elle a commis une ill\u00e9galit\u00e9, ou bien si la r\u00e9solution attaqu\u00e9e constitue un d\u00e9ni absolu de justice.\nC'est \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce principe qu'il s'agit de d\u00e9terminer si les tribunaux dans le cas qui nous est soumis peuvent et doivent intervenir et se substituer \u00e0 l'opinion des commissaires d'\u00e9coles qui, en vertu du Code Scolaire, voient \u00e0 l'administration des affaires scolaires des paroisses.\nLes tribunaux, \u00e9videmment, n'interviendront pas lorsque, dans l'exercice des pouvoirs que la loi leur conf\u00e8re, les commissaires d'\u00e9coles prennent des d\u00e9cisions qu'ils croient \u00eatre dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la population et que, cependant, d'autres personnes peuvent ne pas approuver. Ce serait, comme le dit M. le juge Brodeur, dans la cause cit\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment[3] substituer leur opinion \u00e0 celle des commissaires, empi\u00e9ter sur leurs attributions, et faire jouer \u00e0 la Cour un r\u00f4le que la loi attribue aux membres de la commission scolaire.\nD'ailleurs, si les commissaires refusent ou n\u00e9gligent d'exercer quelques-uns des devoirs ou des attributions mentionn\u00e9es au Code Scolaire, tout contribuable de la municipalit\u00e9 peut appeler \u00e0 la Cour de Magistrat dans les trente jours qui suivent l'expiration d'un d\u00e9lai de trente jours \u00e0 compter de la mise en demeure donn\u00e9e par un contribuable aux commissaires et aux syndics d'\u00e9coles de les exercer. L'article 508 se lit comme suit:\nIl y a appel ou recours \u00e0 la Cour de Circuit ou \u00e0 la Cour de Magistrat lorsque les commissaires ou les syndicts d'\u00e9coles ont\n(1) choisi l'emplacement ou d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la construction ou la reconstruction d'une \u00e9cole;\n(2) \u00e9tabli un nouvel arrondissement;\n(3) chang\u00e9 les limites d'un arrondissement d\u00e9j\u00e0 existant;\n(4) r\u00e9uni ou s\u00e9par\u00e9 deux ou plusieurs arrondissements;\n(5) impos\u00e9 une cotisation sp\u00e9ciale en vertu des dispositions de l'article 265; (6) refus\u00e9 ou n\u00e9glig\u00e9 d'exercer quelques-unes des attributions qu'ils peuvent ou doivent exercer en vertu des articles 88, 93, 236, 264, 265 ou 266.\nLes articles mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe (6) indiquent quelles sont les obligations des commissaires d'\u00e9coles. Ainsi, ils doivent partager les municipalit\u00e9s en arrondissements d'\u00e9coles qu'ils d\u00e9signent par des num\u00e9ros. Ils doivent en outre, en vertu de l'article 93, autant que possible, maintenir une \u00e9cole dans chaque arrondissement, mais ils peuvent n\u00e9anmoins, s'ils le jugent n\u00e9cessaire, r\u00e9unir deux ou plusieurs arrondissements pour une \u00e9cole et les s\u00e9parer de nouveau. Il est de leur devoir, en vertu de l'article 236, d'administrer les biens meubles et immeubles appartenant \u00e0 la commission scolaire, de choisir et d'acqu\u00e9rir les terrains n\u00e9cessaires pour les emplacements de leurs \u00e9coles. L'article 264 impose aux commissaires l'obligation de construire les \u00e9coles conform\u00e9ment aux plans et devis approuv\u00e9s par le Surintendant, et, enfin, l'article 265 dit que s'il devient n\u00e9cessaire d'acqu\u00e9rir ou d'agrandir l'emplacement d'une maison d'\u00e9cole, de construire, de reconstruire, d'agrandir ou de r\u00e9parer une ou plusieurs maisons d'\u00e9coles ou leurs d\u00e9pendances, ils peuvent imposer pour cette fin soit l'arrondissement en particulier, soit la municipalit\u00e9 enti\u00e8re. Et c'est lorsque les commissaires d'\u00e9coles ne remplissent pas les devoirs qui leur sont impos\u00e9s en vertu de ces articles que l'appel est donn\u00e9 \u00e0 tout contribuable \u00e0 la Cour de Magistrat qui agit v\u00e9ritablement comme une cour d'appel et qui a le pouvoir de renverser les d\u00e9cisions prises par les commissaires d'\u00e9coles.\nLes intim\u00e9s semblent avoir bien compris la port\u00e9e de ces articles du Code Scolaire, car ils ont institu\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures devant la Cour de Magistrat qu'ils ont cependant presque imm\u00e9diatement abandonn\u00e9es. Pour que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure puisse intervenir, et pour qu'il lui soit permis d'exercer ce droit de contr\u00f4le et de r\u00e9forme dont l'investit l'article 50 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile, il ne faut pas seulement que les commissaires aient n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de remplir quelqu'un des devoirs qui leur sont impos\u00e9s dans les articles que nous venons de citer, mais il faut, comme l'ont dit les tribunaux d\u00e9j\u00e0, que leur conduite soit telle qu'elle cause une injustice qui soit \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 la fraude. De quoi se plaignent les intim\u00e9s, et quels actes auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9s par les commissaires d'\u00e9coles qui seraient de nature \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure d'intervenir? On dit que les \u00e9coles des autres arrondissements sont en mauvais ordre et qu'elles ne sont pas entretenues, et que m\u00eame dans certains arrondissements il n'y a pas de facilit\u00e9s scolaires pour la jeunesse \u00e9tudiante. On pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement qu'il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 une \u00e9cole dans l'arrondissement n\u00b0 1, et que le fait d'en construire une nouvelle constitue une injustice pour les habitants des autres arrondissements qui n'en ont pas. Mais ces questions sont \u00e9videmment du ressort du magistrat que le l\u00e9gislateur a investi du pouvoir de reviser les d\u00e9cisions des commissaires d'\u00e9coles, en vertu des dispositions de l'article 508 du Code Scolaire. Ce magistrat aurait pu prendre la d\u00e9cision que la commission aurait d\u00fb rendre si v\u00e9ritablement il y avait eu injustice.\nOn pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement que la situation financi\u00e8re de St-Adelphe est pr\u00e9caire et que la construction de cette \u00e9cole cr\u00e9era un fardeau trop lourd pour les contribuables. Je doute fort que la d\u00e9cision de cette question rel\u00e8ve de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. La Commission Municipale exerce un contr\u00f4le sur les d\u00e9penses des commissions scolaires, et d'ailleurs, le gouvernement provincial s'est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 payer une somme de $4,500, de sorte que durant une p\u00e9riode de cinq ans la commission scolaire n'aura qu'\u00e0 payer une somme de $2,475.\nOn accuse clairement les membres de la commission scolaire d'avoir conspir\u00e9 pour priver une partie de la population de son droit \u00e0 une \u00e9cole. Tout semble au contraire avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fait tr\u00e8s ouvertement. Avis de la r\u00e9solution a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 le 21 juillet, et la r\u00e9solution elle-m\u00eame a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e le 30 du m\u00eame mois apr\u00e8s une r\u00e9union de la commission o\u00f9 le public \u00e9tait admis et o\u00f9 on a discut\u00e9 de l'opportunit\u00e9 de tenir un referendum. Les inspecteurs du gouvernement ont visit\u00e9 les lieux, et apr\u00e8s que la r\u00e9solution eut \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e par la Commission Municipale, par l'honorable Secr\u00e9taire de la province, de m\u00eame que par le Ministre des Affaires Municipales, de l'Industrie et du Commerce.\nJe ne puis trouver aucun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de fraude que l'on reproche aux appelants. Peut-\u00eatre ont-ils commis une erreur de jugement; peut-\u00eatre e\u00fbt-il \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable que l'\u00e9cole f\u00fbt construite dans l'arrondissement n\u00b0 5 (a) au lieu de l'arrondissement n\u00b0 1. Mais les commissaires ont exerc\u00e9 leur discr\u00e9tion. La Cour de Magistrat, si\u00e9geant comme cour d'appel de cette d\u00e9cision, aurait certes pu intervenir en vertu des pouvoirs qui lui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le Code Scolaire, mais je suis fermement convaincu, dans un cas comme celui qui nous occupe, qu'il n'appartient pas \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de s'\u00e9riger en tribunal d'appel et de remplir le r\u00f4le qui est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux commissaires eux-m\u00eames.\nOn pr\u00e9tend aussi que la r\u00e9solution d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant un emprunt au moyen de billet promissoire est ill\u00e9gale, car le Code Scolaire n'autorise ce mode d'emprunt que dans un seul cas, c'est-\u00e0-dire en attendant la perception des taxes scolaires. En effet, l'article 248 du Code Scolaire prescrit que la p\u00e9riode de tel emprunt ne doit pas exc\u00e9der six mois, et que la somme emprunt\u00e9e ne doit en aucun temps exc\u00e9der le huiti\u00e8me du revenu de la municipalit\u00e9, alors d\u00fb et exigible.\nLorsqu'une commission scolaire donne \u00e0 l'entreprise des travaux de construction ou d'am\u00e9lioration, la r\u00e9solution qui autorise le contrat ou ordonne les travaux doit pourvoir \u00e0 l'appropriation des deniers n\u00e9cessaires pour en payer le co\u00fbt. C'est l'article 237 du Code Scolaire qui impose cette obligation \u00e0 la commission, et si elle n'a pas dans ses fonds g\u00e9n\u00e9raux les sommes n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 cette fin, la r\u00e9solution doit pourvoir \u00e0 l'imposition d'une taxe sp\u00e9ciale, ou d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter un emprunt. Mais lorsque tel emprunt est d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9, la r\u00e9solution doit remplir les conditions et formalit\u00e9s requises par la loi relative aux emprunts.\nL'on voit donc qu'une corporation scolaire peut, lorsqu'elle donne un contrat d'entreprise, payer de plusieurs fa\u00e7ons. Il est possible qu'elle ait dans ses fonds g\u00e9n\u00e9raux non autrement appropri\u00e9s les sommes n\u00e9cessaires, alors aucune taxe n'est impos\u00e9e et aucun emprunt n'est n\u00e9cessaire. Il est \u00e9galement possible qu'elle impose une taxe imm\u00e9diate suffisante pour payer le co\u00fbt total des travaux, ou, enfin, il est loisible \u00e0 la commission scolaire de faire un emprunt.\nLes emprunts que la commission scolaire peut contracter sont par \u00e9missions d'obligations ou par d'autres formes d'emprunts qui, en certains cas, sont appel\u00e9s emprunts temporaires. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, il n'y a pas eu d'\u00e9missions d'obligations, mais la r\u00e9solution d\u00e9cr\u00e8te bien un emprunt au moyen de billets, et c'est ce qui doit \u00eatre fait afin de rencontrer les prescriptions imp\u00e9ratives de l'article 237. La question qui se pose est donc de savoir si, lorsque les appelants ont d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 cet emprunt au moyen de billets, ils ont suivi toutes les conditions et formalit\u00e9s requises par la loi relative aux emprunts scolaires. Les intim\u00e9s invoquent l'article 248 pour pr\u00e9tendre que les appelants ont exc\u00e9d\u00e9 leur juridiction dans le choix du mode d'emprunt, vu que l'article 248 dit que la p\u00e9riode de l'emprunt temporaire ne doit pas exc\u00e9der six mois, et que la somme emprunt\u00e9e ne doit en aucun temps exc\u00e9der le huiti\u00e8me du revenu de la municipalit\u00e9, alors d\u00fb et exigible.\nOn semble prendre pour acquis qu'une corporation scolaire ne peut pas contracter d'emprunts par billets autrement que par emprunts temporaires suivant les dispositions de cet article 248. Mais l'article 244 du Code Scolaire permet \u00e0 une corporation scolaire de faire des emprunts autrement que par \u00e9missions d'obligations ou par billets \u00e0 court terme, qu'on appelle emprunts temporaires. \"Aucune \u00e9mission d'obligations ne peut \u00eatre faite, et aucun emprunt ne peut \u00eatre contract\u00e9\", dit cet article, \"\u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit impos\u00e9\", etc., etc. Cette r\u00e9daction d\u00e9montre bien qu'une corporation scolaire peut emprunter pour payer le co\u00fbt d'un contrat d'entreprise non seulement par obligations, mais aussi par billets, ind\u00e9pendamment de l'autorisation qui lui est donn\u00e9e de contracter des emprunts temporaires en vertu de l'article 248.\nIl est bien possible que ce ne soit pas un emprunt temporaire qui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9 par les appelants dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, mais ceci, je crois, ne peut pas affecter l'issue du proc\u00e8s.\nEn effet, si l'emprunt peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \"un emprunt temporaire\", l'argument des intim\u00e9s \u00e0 l'effet que l'emprunt temporaire ne doit pas exc\u00e9der six mois, et que la somme emprunt\u00e9e ne doit en aucun temps exc\u00e9der le huiti\u00e8me du revenu de la municipalit\u00e9, alors d\u00fb et exigible, aurait une certaine valeur, mais la l\u00e9gislature a fait davantage, et l'on trouve dans la Loi de la Commission Municipale l'article 34 qui se lit de la fa\u00e7on suivante: La Commission peut autoriser une municipalit\u00e9, sur demande qui lui est faite par simple r\u00e9solution du conseil, \u00e0 contracter un ou des emprunts temporaires aux conditions et pour la p\u00e9riode de temps qu'elle d\u00e9termine.\nLes conditions ainsi d\u00e9termin\u00e9es par la Commission r\u00e9gissent ces emprunts nonobstant toute disposition contraire ou incompatible d'une loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ou sp\u00e9ciale, limitant le montant des emprunts temporaires et d\u00e9terminant l'\u00e9poque de leur remboursement.\nEt si l\u2019on r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 l'article 2 de la m\u00eame loi qui est le chapitre 207 des Statuts Refondus de 1941, Ton voit que le mot \"municipalit\u00e9\" signifie toute \"corporation de commissaires d'\u00e9coles\". Cet article permet donc aux appelants, avec l'approbation de la Commission Municipale qui, d'ailleurs, leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e, d'\u00e9tendre les d\u00e9lais limit\u00e9s par l'article 248, et d'emprunter pour des montants plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s que ne le permet le m\u00eame article.\nQu'il s'agisse donc d'un emprunt temporaire dont le terme a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tendu en vertu de la Loi de la Commission Municipale, ou d'un emprunt ordinaire par billets, autoris\u00e9 par l'article 244, je suis d'opinion que les formalit\u00e9s l\u00e9gales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies, et que sur ce point, l'argument des intim\u00e9s ne peut pas pr\u00e9valoir.\nMais c'est aussi la pr\u00e9tention des intim\u00e9s que les appelants n'ont pas suivi les prescriptions de la loi, en particulier les prescriptions des articles 237 et 244 du Code Scolaire, qui se lisent comme suit:\nArt. 237: Nulle corporation scolaire, sauf les corporations scolaires comprises en tout ou en partie dans la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec ou dans celle de Montr\u00e9al, ne peut donner \u00e0 l'entreprise des travaux de construction ou d'am\u00e9lioration et passer un contrat \u00e0 cette fin, \u00e0 moins que la r\u00e9solution qui autorise le contrat ou ordonne les travaux n'ait pourvu \u00e0 l'appropriation des deniers n\u00e9cessaires pour en payer le co\u00fbt.\nSi la corporation n'a pas dans ses fonds g\u00e9n\u00e9raux non autrement appropri\u00e9s, les sommes n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 cette fin, la r\u00e9solution doit pourvoir \u00e0 l'imposition d'une taxe sp\u00e9ciale sur toute la municipalit\u00e9 ou sur les propri\u00e9taires oblig\u00e9s au co\u00fbt des travaux, selon le cas, ou d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter un emprunt, et, dans ce cas la r\u00e9solution doit remplir toutes les conditions et formalit\u00e9s requises par la loi relative aux emprunts scolaires.\nLes contrats pass\u00e9s contrairement aux dispositions qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent sont nuls et ne lient pas la corporation, et tout contribuable peut obtenir un bref d'injonction contre la corporation et l'entrepreneur pour emp\u00eacher l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux.\nL'article 244 dit ce qui suit:\nArt. 244: Aucune \u00e9mission d'obligations ne peut \u00eatre faite, et aucun emprunt ne peut \u00eatre contract\u00e9 \u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit impos\u00e9 par la r\u00e9solution qui les autorise, sur les biens imposables affect\u00e9s au paiement de telles obligations ou de tel emprunt, une taxe annuelle suffisante pour payer l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de chaque ann\u00e9e, etc., etc. Or, la r\u00e9solution dit:\nDe fa\u00e7on \u00e0 pourvoir au paiement des int\u00e9r\u00eats et afin de couvrir les \u00e9ch\u00e9ances de chaque ann\u00e9e ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9es, il sera impos\u00e9 et pr\u00e9lev\u00e9 par la commission scolaire une taxe sp\u00e9ciale annuelle suffisante sur toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s taxables de la municipalit\u00e9.\nL'argument invoqu\u00e9 par les demandeurs-intim\u00e9s est qu'aucune taxe n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e, vu qu'on a employ\u00e9 le futur dans la r\u00e9daction de la r\u00e9solution, et en cons\u00e9quence, \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 le contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 et l'emprunt contract\u00e9, cette taxe n'existait pas, et n'affectait pas les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s imposables de la municipalit\u00e9.\nA l'argument on a cit\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi[4] et de cette Cour[5] dans Goulet vs La Corporation de la paroisse de St-Gervais. Dans cette cause, des faits \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s identiques se pr\u00e9sentaient. La corporation de la paroisse de St-Gervais avait consenti trois contrats diff\u00e9rents pour la construction de certains ponts situ\u00e9s dans les limites de la municipalit\u00e9. Les contrats avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s apr\u00e8s que la r\u00e9solution suivante eut \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par le conseil:\nIl est aussi statu\u00e9 et ordonn\u00e9 qu'une taxe sp\u00e9ciale sera pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e sur tous les bien imposables des contribuables oblig\u00e9s auxdits ponts afin d'en faire le paiement dans un seul versement au comptant.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi en est venue \u00e0 la conclusion que le r\u00e8glement n'\u00e9tait pas nul, cas ce n'est pas le r\u00e8glement, lorsque la taxe n'est pas impos\u00e9e, que la loi frappe de nullit\u00e9; et, comme le disait le juge en chef, sir Mathias Tellier:\nTout r\u00e8glement peut \u00eatre amend\u00e9 par un autre r\u00e8glement. Rien n'emp\u00eachait Ta d\u00e9fenderesse, apr\u00e8s qu'elle e\u00fbt re\u00e7u des soumissions, d'accepter conditionnellement celle des mis-en-cause et d'adopter un second r\u00e8glement pour compl\u00e9ter le premier.\nMais il s'ensuit du jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi qu'un r\u00e8glement semblable, malgr\u00e9 qu'il p\u00fbt \u00eatre compl\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e9tait tout de m\u00eame insuffisant. Et, quant au contrat consenti, comme cons\u00e9quence d'un semblable r\u00e8glement, il devrait \u00eatre annul\u00e9, parce qu'en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, il se trouvait \u00e0 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 avant que la taxe ne f\u00fbt impos\u00e9e.\nSir Mathias Tellier dit, \u00e0 la page 520:\nLe demandeur a raison, lorsqu'il dit que par la disposition ci-dessus du r\u00e8glement la taxe ne se trouve pas actuellement impos\u00e9e, mais je crois qu'il a tort de pr\u00e9tendre que cela rend la r\u00e8glement nul. L'article 627a sur lequel il se base ne va pas si loin que cela. Il frappe de nullit\u00e9 tout contrat d'entreprise donn\u00e9 par une corporation municipale qui n'a pas pourvu \u00e0 ses voies et moyens; mais il ne d\u00e9clare pas invalide le r\u00e8glement lui-m\u00eame en ex\u00e9cution duquel elle a agi.\nEt \u00e0 la page 521, le juge en chef s'exprime enfin de la fa\u00e7on suivante, apr\u00e8s avoir cit\u00e9 le r\u00e8glement imposant la taxe:\nCette clause est claire: La d\u00e9fenderesse se procurera les fonds requis pour son entreprise, en imposant une taxe sp\u00e9ciale sur les contribuables oblig\u00e9s aux ponts. Voil\u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision. Cette taxe a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e? Elle ne l'avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 la date des trois contrats attaqu\u00e9s, ni m\u00eame \u00e0 la date de la pr\u00e9sente poursuite. Dans ces conditions, il me para\u00eet clair que lesdits contrats \u00e9taient invalides, et que, partant, le demandeur, qui est un des contribuables, avait droit \u00e0 l'action en nullit\u00e9 qu'il a intent\u00e9e.\nDevant cette Cour, cette question n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9e. Mais l'appel de la corporation de la paroisse de St-Gervais a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenu parce que l'intim\u00e9 Goulet, en inscrivant sa cause en appel, n'avait pas signifi\u00e9 son avis d'appel aux contracteurs, et cette Cour en est venue \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il \u00e9tait impossible d'annuler les contrats, \u00e0 moins que lesdits contracteurs ne soient en cause.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause, les faits sont pratiquement identiques. La taxe n'est s\u00fbrement pas impos\u00e9e. On dit que dans l'avenir ou imposera une taxe, mais ceci n'est pas suffisant pour la cr\u00e9er. Il me semble clair que l'article 237 du Code Scolaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9, car le contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 avant que la taxe ne f\u00fbt impos\u00e9e sur les biens de la municipalit\u00e9 affect\u00e9s au paiement de l'obligation contract\u00e9e. Ce que le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu, et il Ta dit en termes non \u00e9quivoques, c'est qu'aucun contrat d'entreprise ne soit donn\u00e9, \u00e0 moins que la corporation scolaire n'ait pr\u00e9alablement pourvu \u00e0 s'assurer la disponibilit\u00e9 des fonds n\u00e9cessaires pour payer le co\u00fbt des travaux. Et on con\u00e7oit facilement la sagesse d'une semblable l\u00e9gislation dont le but \u00e9vident est de mettre un frein aux d\u00e9penses exag\u00e9r\u00e9es, et de prot\u00e9ger le contribuable contre les extravagances des administrateurs. C'est une erreur de pr\u00e9tendre qu'en employant les expressions \"sera impos\u00e9e et pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e\", on a pourvu \u00e0 ses voies et moyens, et qu'on s'est assur\u00e9 une source de revenus pour payer le co\u00fbt de l'entreprise. La loi exige davantage. Il faut que la taxe qui sera pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e plus tard soit impos\u00e9e par la r\u00e9solution. Il y a une diff\u00e9rence essentielle entre l'imposition de la taxe et son pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement. L'imposition est l'acte des commissaires, et le pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement, l'acte du secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier. Comme le dit M. le juge Rinfret (Canadian Allis Chalmers Limited vs City of Lachine[6]\nle r\u00f4le de perception est surtout un m\u00e9canisme de recouvrement n\u00e9cessairement bas\u00e9 sur le r\u00e8glement. Il est avant tout une op\u00e9ration math\u00e9matique.\nTelle est l'opinion \u00e9mise par la Cour du Banc du Roi dans la cause de Goulet vs La Corporation de la paroisse de St-Gervais[7], et je partage cette mani\u00e8re de voir.\nLes formalit\u00e9s impos\u00e9es par cet article sont de rigueur, et si la taxe n'est pas impos\u00e9e, le contrat est nul et ne lie pas la corporation, et tout contribuable peut obtenir un bref d'injonction contre la corporation et l'entrepreneur pour emp\u00eacher l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux. Malgr\u00e9 les inconv\u00e9nients que cela puisse pr\u00e9senter, je ne puis mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le texte imp\u00e9ratif de cet article du Code Scolaire, et je suis d'avis, en cons\u00e9quence, que sur ce point, les intim\u00e9s ont raison, et que le contrat d'entreprise a \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement consenti.\nLes principes \u00e9mis par la Cour du Banc du Roi r\u00e9f\u00e8rent, il est vrai, aux dispositions du Code Municipal, mais ils sont \u00e9galement applicables dans la pr\u00e9sente cause parce que le Code Municipal de Qu\u00e9bec contient des dispositions identiques au Code Scolaire de la province. Ainsi, l'article 237 du Code Scolaire correspond \u00e0 l'article 627a du Code Municipal. En vertu de ces articles du Code Scolaire et du Code Municipal, le contrat n'est pas valide, \u00e0 moins que la r\u00e9solution ou le r\u00e8glement, suivant le cas, n'ait impos\u00e9 la taxe. Cependant, seul le contrat peut \u00eatre frapp\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9 si la taxe n'est pas impos\u00e9e. Il n'est pas ill\u00e9gal en effet pour une municipalit\u00e9 de d\u00e9clarer par r\u00e9solution qu'elle a l'intention de construire une \u00e9cole au co\u00fbt de $7,000. Ce qui est ill\u00e9gal, dit le Code Scolaire, c'est de consentir un contrat d'entreprise avant que la taxe ne soit impos\u00e9e. Or, comme la r\u00e9solution incompl\u00e8te peut \u00eatre amend\u00e9e, il s'ensuit que seul le contrat est nul, mais la r\u00e9solution du 30 juillet 1941, d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant la construction d'une \u00e9cole pour gar\u00e7ons au prix de $7,000, n'est pas nulle. Il en est autrement, cependant, de cette autre r\u00e9solution en date du 27 septembre 1941, accordant le contrat d'entreprise \u00e0 M. J. Patrick Douville, parce que cette r\u00e9solution est intimement li\u00e9e au contrat d'entreprise qui, pour les raisons que nous venons de mentionner, doit \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ill\u00e9gal.\nLes intim\u00e9s invoquent un autre grief. C'est que la r\u00e9solution qui autorise l'emprunt est ill\u00e9gale, en premier lieu parce qu'elle ne serait pas conforme aux dispositions de l'article 244 du Code Scolaire, et aussi parce qu'elle conf\u00e8re des pouvoirs discr\u00e9tionnaires au pr\u00e9sident et au secr\u00e9taire de la commission.\nNous avons cit\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 l'article 244. L'on sait que cet article dit qu'aucun emprunt ne peut \u00eatre contract\u00e9, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit impos\u00e9 par la r\u00e9solution qui l'autorise une taxe annuelle suffisante pour payer l'int\u00e9r\u00eat, etc., etc.\nOr, le m\u00eame argument se r\u00e9p\u00e8te ici: c'est le futur, dit-on, qui est employ\u00e9, et il s'ensuit qu'aucune taxe n'est impos\u00e9e sur les biens de la municipalit\u00e9. Mais c'est aussi la m\u00eame r\u00e9ponse qui doit \u00eatre faite que celle faite pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment lorsque nous avons examin\u00e9 la question de savoir si la r\u00e9solution accordant le contrat d'entreprise \u00e9tait nulle. La conclusion n\u00e9gative \u00e0 laquelle nous sommes arriv\u00e9s nous am\u00e8ne n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 conclure de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on. La r\u00e9solution n'est pas nulle. Elle est s\u00fbrement incompl\u00e8te, et tant qu'elle n'aura pas \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9e, l'emprunt ne peut pas \u00eatre l\u00e9galement contract\u00e9.\nIl n'y a pas lieu de d\u00e9clarer cette r\u00e9solution nulle. Peut-\u00eatre l'emprunt lui-m\u00eame est-il ill\u00e9gal. Mais il n'appartient pas \u00e0 cette Cour de se prononcer sur ce point parce qu'il semble qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9 encore. De plus, on n'en demande pas l'annulation, et le pr\u00eateur, s'il existe, partie \u00e0 ce contrat de pr\u00eat, n'est pas mis en cause. (Goulet vs La Corporation de la paroisse de St-Gervais[8].\nQuant au second moyen invoqu\u00e9 pour faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 cette r\u00e9solution, je crois qu'il doit \u00eatre \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9.\nLe 31 juillet 1941, la commission scolaire a adopt\u00e9 une r\u00e9solution qui se lit ainsi:\nQue ladite commission scolaire emprunte, vu que la commission scolaire ne peut entreprendre cette construction sans recourir \u00e0 un emprunt, un montant n'exc\u00e9dant pas $7,000 \u00e0 un int\u00e9r\u00eat n'exc\u00e9dant pas 5 pour 100 l'an, lequel emprunt sera fait au moyen de billets promissoires remboursables comme suit:\n1er avril 1942, $1,700.\n1er avril 1943, $1,800.\n1er avril 1944, $1,900.\n1er avril 1945, $ 800.\n1er avril 1946, $ 800.\nA une autre s\u00e9ance de la commission scolaire, tenue le vingt-septi\u00e8me jour du mois de septembre 1941, une autre r\u00e9solution a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e qui se lit de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nQue le pr\u00e9sident et le secr\u00e9taire de cette commission scolaire soient autoris\u00e9s de signer un ou des billets promissoires \u00e0 l'ordre d'une banque ou d'une caisse populaire ou des particuliers pour un montant n'exc\u00e9dant pas $7,000 en totalit\u00e9, au taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat n'exc\u00e9dant pas 4 pour 100 avec \u00e9ch\u00e9ances conformes \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution de cette commission scolaire en date du 30 juillet 1941, et ce pour servir \u00e0 acquitter le co\u00fbt de la construction de la maison d'\u00e9cole pour gar\u00e7ons dans l'arrondissement scolaire n\u00b0 1, le tout autoris\u00e9 par le Surintendant de l'Instruction Publique, le Secr\u00e9taire de la province et de l'honorable Ministre des Affaires Municipales.\nOn pr\u00e9tend que les commissaires ne pouvaient autoriser ainsi leur pr\u00e9sident et leur secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier \u00e0 signer un ou des billets promissoires \u00e0 Tordre d'une banque ou d'une caisse populaire ou des particuliers, et que ce mode de proc\u00e9der a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi comme ill\u00e9gal et ultra vires, dans la cause des Commissaires d'Ecoles de St-Augustin vs Qu\u00e9zel[9].\nDans cette cause, voici ce que disait le juge en chef, sir Mathias Tellier, \u00e0 la page 211:\nAvant donc de conclure un emprunt en vertu de l'article 248, les commissaires doivent d'abord se trouver ou se faire trouver un pr\u00eateur, et apr\u00e8s cela adopter une r\u00e9solution d\u00e9terminant ce pr\u00eateur, et indiquant en outre, avec pr\u00e9cision, le montant de l'emprunt et tous les d\u00e9tails ou particularit\u00e9s les concernant, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ne rien laisser \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion ou volont\u00e9 du mandataire choisi pour signer l'acte.\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, il est clair que le montant de l'emprunt est d\u00e9termin\u00e9, que l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de chaque billet l'est \u00e9galement, et que le taux de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat maximum fix\u00e9 \u00e0 5 pour cent par la r\u00e9solution du 31 juillet 1941, subs\u00e9quemment r\u00e9duit \u00e0 4 p. 100 lors de l'adoption de la r\u00e9solution du 27 septembre 1941, est suffisamment pr\u00e9cis pour satisfaire les exigences de la loi. Il reste que seul le nom du pr\u00eateur n'est pas d\u00e9termin\u00e9. Mais je ne puis me convaincre que cette omission soit suffisante pour invalider la r\u00e9solution. Il est certain que le montant de l'emprunt, le taux de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat, la date de l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance doivent \u00eatre mentionn\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9solution, parce qu'on ne pourrait pas laisser ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion des officiers de la corporation. Mais il n'en est pas ainsi du nom du pr\u00eateur. Il est totalement indiff\u00e9rent que la corporation emprunteuse re\u00e7oive le produit du pr\u00eat d'une personne plut\u00f4t que d'une autre. Aucune question de solvabilit\u00e9, ou autre, ne se pr\u00e9sente, et la responsabilit\u00e9 de la commission ne peut en aucune fa\u00e7on \u00eatre affect\u00e9e, diminu\u00e9e ou augment\u00e9e par le choix du pr\u00eateur que les officiers peuvent faire.\nEnfin, on pr\u00e9tend que les commissaires d'\u00e9coles n'avaient pas le droit d'acqu\u00e9rir par bail emphyt\u00e9otique le terrain sur lequel l'\u00e9cole a \u00e9t\u00e9 construite. La r\u00e9solution du 31 juillet 1941 se lit ainsi:\nD\u00e9signation:\nUn terrain situ\u00e9 en la paroisse de St-Adelphe, connu et d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme faisant partie du lot num\u00e9ro sept cent vingt-quatre (p. 724) du cadastre de St-Stanislas, contenant un arpent de largeur sur trois arpents de profondeur, et sis comme suit: \u00e0 deux cent cinquante pieds \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re du couvent, et cinquante pieds \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re de l'\u00e9glise, lequel terrain est born\u00e9 au nord par Florien Baillargeon (p. 725) \u00e0 l'est, \u00e0 l'ouest et au sud par l'\u0152uvre et Fabrique de la paroisse de St-Adelphe;\n(c) Que la commission scolaire de St-Adelphe acqui\u00e8re de la Fabrique St-Adelphe le susdit terrain suivant bail emphyt\u00e9otique, et conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution de ladite Fabrique adopt\u00e9e le vingt juillet mil neuf cent quarante et un, et plus particuli\u00e8rement pour la consid\u00e9ration d'un dollar par ann\u00e9e ($1) ainsi qu'en consid\u00e9ration de l'engagement devant \u00eatre pris par ladite commission scolaire pour le droit de passage et l'entretien du chemin.\nEt, \u00e0 l'assembl\u00e9e subs\u00e9quente du 25 septembre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, une nouvelle r\u00e9solution a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dont les termes sont les suivants:\n(a) Un contrat notari\u00e9 pour acqu\u00e9rir, par bail \u00e0 rente fonci\u00e8re ou bail emphyt\u00e9otique, de l'\u0152uvre et Fabrique de la paroisse de St-Adelphe l'emplacement tel que pr\u00e9vu par la commission scolaire en date du trente juillet mil neuf cent quarante et un, et aux conditions y pos\u00e9es pour y asseoir la maison d'\u00e9cole pour gar\u00e7ons.\nComme on le voit, lors de cette premi\u00e8re r\u00e9solution, on mentionne\nque la commission scolaire de St-Adelphe acqui\u00e8re de la Fabrique de St-Adelphe le susdit terrain suivant bail emphyt\u00e9otique, et conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution de ladite Fabrique adopt\u00e9e le 20 juillet. Et, lors de la seconde r\u00e9solution, on mentionne que le pr\u00e9sident et le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier sont autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 signer pour et au nom de la commission scolaire\nun contrat notari\u00e9 pour acqu\u00e9rir par bail \u00e0 rente fonci\u00e8re, etc., etc., aux conditions y pos\u00e9es.\nLe 20 juillet 1941, la Fabrique de St-Adelphe avait adopt\u00e9 une r\u00e9solution \u00e0 l'effet que le terrain en question\nsoit mis \u00e0 l'usage par constitut \u00e0 la commission scolaire de St-Adelphe aux conditions \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es pour 99 ans.\nJe suis d'opinion que le contrat doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9, car il contient des clauses qui vont bien au del\u00e0 de la r\u00e9solution de la commission scolaire, qui autorise ses officiers \u00e0 le signer. Le pr\u00e9sident et le secr\u00e9taire ont consenti, en effet, \u00e0 des clauses on\u00e9reuses, r\u00e9solutoires et forfaitaires que la r\u00e9solution n'autorise pas. Ils ont m\u00eame hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 le terrain acquis, et le contrat, tel que sign\u00e9, n'a donc jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par la commission scolaire.\nQuant \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 ce contrat, je la crois l\u00e9gale. Je suis d'opinion en effet qu'une corporation scolaire peut, comme la chose d'ailleurs se fait depuis un temps imm\u00e9morial, acqu\u00e9rir par bail emphyt\u00e9otique. L'emphyt\u00e9ose est en effet un mode d'acquisition de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et en vertu de l'article 236 du Code Scolaire, le l\u00e9gislateur a autoris\u00e9 les commissaires d'\u00e9coles \u00e0 \"acqu\u00e9rir et \u00e0 poss\u00e9der pour le compte de leur corporation des biens meubles ou immeubles\". Il serait \u00e0 mon avis bien \u00e9trange, qu'une corporation scolaire ait le droit, comme lui conf\u00e8re \u00e9galement l'article 236, de louer une maison d'\u00e9cole pour un temps limit\u00e9, et n'ait pas le pouvoir d'acqu\u00e9rir par bail emphyt\u00e9otique pour 99 ans, le terrain sur lequel elle veut construire cette \u00e9cole.\nIl r\u00e9sulte de tout ceci que l'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu en partie. Le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance doit \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 en ce sens que seulement le contrat d'entreprise consenti par les appelants \u00e0 Patrick Douville, mis en cause, ainsi que la r\u00e9solution qui le lui accorde, doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9s nuls et annul\u00e9s \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit, de m\u00eame que le contrat par bail emphyt\u00e9otique intervenu entre les appelants et la Fabrique de St-Adelphe. Quant aux autres r\u00e9solutions attaqu\u00e9es, elles doivent \u00eatre tenues pour l\u00e9gales.\nEn Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, les intim\u00e9s auront droit \u00e0 leurs frais de l\u2019action, de demande incidente, ainsi qu'aux frais de l'injonction. Quant aux frais de st\u00e9nographie, ils seront payables un quart par les appelants et les trois quarts par les intim\u00e9s. Ces derniers paieront les frais en appel et devant cette Cour.\nAppeal allowed with costs:\nSolicitor for the appelants: Fortunat Lord.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Jean-Marie Bureau.\n[1] Q.R.

VII, c. 49\u2014Imperial Shipping Act, 1894, 57-58 Vict., c. 60, s. 502.\nThe owners of the Anglo Indian having agreed by a time charter to let the ship to a transport company, the latter entered into a charter party, on May 11th, 1938, with the owners of about 1,700 tons of mineral concentrates for their transport in bags under deck from the city of Quebec to Tacoma, in the state of Washington. On the 18th of the same month, at Montreal, the transport company accepted a consignment from the appellant company of 2,402 packages of glassware, owned by it, for carriage and delivery to itself at Vancouver, via the Panama canal. After the ship had passed through the canal, certain concentrates commenced to heat, the ship caught fire and she put in to a harbour on the coast of California where the fire was extinguished. It is admitted that the appellant's goods became a total loss, amounting to $4,235.13. The appellant company then brought an action against the ship and her owners to recover these damages. The bill of lading contained a number of conditions, all of which were agreed to by the appellant. Clause 24 of those conditions stated that the bill when issued from a port in Canada was subject to all the terms and conditions of, and all the exemptions from liability contained in, The Water Carriage of Goods Act of Canada, clause 25 referred to bills of lading from a port in the United States of America and clause 26 stipulated that, subject to clauses 24 and 25, the bill of lading, no matter where issued, shall be construed and governed by English law. Also, at the foot of the face of the bill, appeared in heavy black type the following: \"This bill of lading is subject to provisions of The Canadian Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1936. The trial judge held that this Act was not in force in May, 1938, but that, in view of the foot clause, the provisions of the Act and of the Rules scheduled thereto were incorporated into and formed part of the bill of lading; he also held that the concentrates were a dangerous cargo which rendered the ship unseaworthy and that the loss was directly attributable to such unseaworthiness. But the trial judge, holding that the owners of the ship and the charterer, the transport company, had exercised due diligence to make her seaworthy, dismissed the appellant's action. The appellant company contended that, the loss being attributable to the unseaworthiness of the ship, the respondents were responsible in damages to it, and it also challenged the finding of due diligence; while the respondents contended that, even if this Court should find that due diligence had not been exercised, the appellant company must fail.\nHeld that the finding of the trial judge, that the concentrates were a dangerous cargo which rendered the ship unseaworthy and that the loss of the appellant's goods was directly attributable to such unseaworthiness, should be upheld; but\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Quebec Admiralty District, Taschereau and Rand JJ. dissenting, that the respondents have shown that before and at the beginning of the voyage they exercised due diligence to make the ship seaworthy; and that, therefore, notwithstanding the unseaworthiness of the ship, the respondents were not liable for loss of the cargo.\nHeld that the Canadian Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1936 was in force at the time of shipment, i.e., in May, 1938.\nPer the Chief Justice and Hudson and Kerwin JJ.:\u2014Therefore, it is unnecessary to express any opinion as to whether, in view of the foot clause of the bill of lading, the provisions of that Act should be considered as having been incorporated into and forming part of the bill.\nPer Taschereau and Rand JJ:\u2014Whether the foot clause is looked upon as a conformity with the requirement of section 4 or a contractual reference, the effect of it is to incorporate the rules as part of the Act and to carry the intention of overriding any contrary provision of the bill of lading.\nAs to the contention of the respondents that, even if the finding that due diligence has been used by them to make the ship seaworthy was wrong, they were still entitled to succeed, such contention being based \"on clause 2 (b) of article IV of the Rules which provides that \"neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from * * * (b) fire, unless caused by the actual fault or privity of the carrier\", and the respondents relying on the decision of the House of Lords in Louis Dreyfus and Company v. Tempus Shipping Company ([1931] A.C. 726), where effect was given to the provisions of section 502 of this Imperial Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.\nHeld, per The Chief Justice and Kerwin and Hudson JJ., that the respondents' contention is not well founded.\u2014The law of Canada must be applied in this case, notwithstanding clause 26 of the bill of lading. Considering the purpose of the Water Carriage of Goods Act, if the direct cause of a loss is the unseaworthiness of the ship, even though fire was the proximate cause, the loss is not one arising or resulting from fire within the meaning of clause 2 (b) of article IV, even though it is proven that the unseaworthiness was mused without the actual fault or privity of the carrier; that still leaves the clause free to operate where a loss is the direct result of fire only.\u2014Dreyfus case (supra) not applicable.\nPer Taschereau and Rand JJ.:\u2014Section 502 of the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, does not apply, as such provision, so far as it was in force in Canada, was repealed by the 13th schedule of the Canada Shipping Act, 1934.\u2014Notwithstanding the express stipulation in the bill of lading that the contract was to be governed by English law, whatever effect might be given to it in a court outside of Canada, the Canadian courts are bound by the provisions of the Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1936, and section 502, if relied on as having been incorporated in the contract under that stipulation, dashes with section 8 of article III of the Rules and must in this court be deemed to be excluded from the bill of lading.\u2014Moreover, the respondents have not brought themselves within the exception of section 2 (b) of article IV of the Rules.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Quebec Admiralty District, Cannon J., dismissing the appellant's action with costs.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nC. Russell McKenzie K.C. for the appellant.\nR. C. Holden K.C. and Lucien Beauregard K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin and Hudson J. J. was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014This is an appeal by Dominion Glass Company Limited from a decision of Cannon J., District Judge in Admiralty for Quebec, whereby the appellant's action was dismissed. That action was brought in the Exchequer Court of Canada against the ship Anglo Indian and her owners, The Nitrate Producers Steamship Company, Limited, a corporation duly incorporated under the law of England and having its head office and chief place of business in the city of London in England.\nThe appellant is a manufacturer of glass-ware, carrying on business at Montreal and throughout Canada. Its claim is to recover damages for the destruction of a consignment of 2,402 packages of glass-ware, owned by it and shipped on the Anglo Indian for carriage and delivery to itself at Vancouver, British Columbia, via the Panama canal. The goods were shipped from Montreal and, after the Anglo Indian had passed through the Panama canal and was off the coast of California, certain concentrates, which were also in the ship, commenced to heat, the ship caught fire, and on June 14th, 1938, she put into San Pedro (Los Angeles) where the fire was extinguished. It is admitted that the appellant's goods were destroyed and became a total loss by reason of the fire and that such loss amounted to $4,235.13.\nThe Anglo Indian was a new ship, built to the order of The Nitrate Producers Steamship Company, Limited, and delivered to them in January, 1938. Previously, by a time charter, the owners had agreed to let the ship from the time of delivery for about twelve to fourteen months to Canadian Transport Company Limited. Under this charter, the owners were to provide and pay for all the provisions and wages of the captain, officers and crew and no question has been raised as to the authority of the master of the Anglo Indian to sign bills of lading on behalf of the owners or to permit others to sign for him. The appellant's goods were shipped under two bills of lading dated May 18th, 1938. Except for the number of packages, the two bills are the same and it will be convenient hereafter to proceed as if only one had been issued covering the total shipment. The bill of lading was signed by A. Rees for and on behalf of the master and Rees had authority from the master so to sign.\nCanadian Transport Company Limited entered into a charter party with Derby and Company, Limited, for the transport by the Anglo Indian from the city of Quebec to Tacoma, in the state of Washington, of about seventeen hundred tons\nof lead and\/or zinc and\/or copper concentrates and\/or other ore concentrates of similar physical characteristics and stowage, in bags, under deck.\nBecause of what will be stated later, it should be noted that the clause of the charter party describing the cargo continued:\nit is understood that concentrates shipped are safe, non-injurious and lawful merchandise.\nOn or about May 11th, 1938, 23,072 bags of concentrates were received at Quebec on board the ship, which then proceeded to Montreal where she loaded general cargo, including the appellant's glass-ware.\nBy the written admission of the parties, it was agreed that the glass-ware was \"destroyed and became a total loss by reason of fire on board the said ship Anglo Indian.\" The trial judge gave effect to this admission but found that the fire was caused by the spontaneous combustion of the concentrates; that these concentrates were a dangerous cargo which rendered the ship unseaworthy; and that the loss was naturally and directly attributable to such unseaworthiness. That finding was attacked by the respondents but I am satisfied that on that point the trial judge came to the right conclusion. However, he also held that the respondents and their agents, servants and employees, and the charterers, Canadian Transport Company Limited, exercised due diligence to make the ship seaworthy and to secure that she was properly manned, equipped and supplied and to make the holds fit and safe for the reception, carriage and preservation of the appellant's goods. It was on this ground that he dismissed the action although he held further that there was no actual fault or privity on the part of the charterers, agents or master of the ship and no fault or neglect of the owners or of their agents, servants or employees.\nThe appellant contends that, the loss being attributable to the unseaworthiness of the ship, the respondents are responsible in damages to it. The appellant also challenges the finding of due diligence; while the respondents contend that, even if the Court should find that due diligence was not exercised, the appellant must fail. It therefore becomes necessary to determine the rights and obligations of the parties.\nThe bill of lading contained a number of conditions, all of which were agreed to by the appellant. Clause 24 of those conditions states:\nThis bill of lading when issued covering goods from a port in Canada is subject to all the terms and conditions of and all the exemptions from liability contained in The Water Carriage of Goods Act of Canada, section 4 of which is as follows:\nand then follows what, except for a minor error, was section 4 of chapter 207 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927,\u2014since repealed. Clause 25 refers to bills of lading from a port in the United States, and then comes clause 26:\nSubject to clauses 24 and 25 this bill of lading no matter where issued shall be construed and governed by English law.\nThese clauses commence on the face of the bill of lading and are continued on the back. At the foot of the face appears in heavy black type the following:\nThis bill of lading is subject to provisions of The Canadian Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1936.\nThe trial judge decided that The Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1936, which is chapter 49 of the Dominion statutes of that year, was not in force in May, 1938, but he held, in view of the clause at the foot of the face of the bill of lading, that the provisions of the Act and of the Rules scheduled thereto were incorporated into and formed part of the bill. It is unnecessary to express any opinion as to the last point because, with deference, I have concluded that the 1936 Act was in force.\nThat Act was assented to on June 23rd, 1936, and it consists of nine sections and a schedule containing the nine articles of the Hague Rules relating to bills of lading. Section 1 of the Act contains the short title. Section 2 provides that subject to the provisions of the Act, the Rules in the schedule shall have effect in relation to and in connection with the carriage of goods by water in ships carrying goods from any port in Canada to any other port, whether in or outside Canada. By section 3, there is not to be implied in any contract for the carriage of goods by water, to which the Rules apply, any absolute undertaking by the carrier of the goods to provide a seaworthy ship. Section 4 provides:\nEvery bill of lading, or similar document of title issued in Canada which contains or is evidence of any contract to which the Rules apply shall contain an express statement that it is to have effect subject to the provisions of the Rules as applied by this Act.\nSection 5 states:\nArticle VI of the Rules shall, in relation to the carriage of goods by water in ships carrying goods from any port or place in Canada to any other port or place in Canada, have effect as though the said article referred to goods of any class instead of to particular goods and as though the proviso to the second paragraph of the said article were omitted.\nSection 6 contains certain provisions dealing with the weight of bulk cargo. Subsection 1 of section 7 provides that nothing in the Act shall affect the operation of certain sections of the Canada Shipping Act, 1934, as amended, or the operation of any other enactment for the time being in force limiting the liability of owners of vessels. Subsection 2 of section 7 is the one that causes the difficulty on the point under consideration and is as follows:\nThe Rules shall not by virtue of this Act apply to any contract for the carriage of goods by water made before such day, not being earlier than the first day of August, nineteen hundred and thirty-six, as the Governor General may by Order in Council direct, nor to any bill of lading or similar document of title issued, whether before or after such day as aforesaid, in pursuance of any such contract as aforesaid.\nBy section 8, The Water Carriage of Goods Act, chapter 207, R.S.C. 1927, is repealed, and by section 9,\nThis Act shall come into force on a date to be fixed by proclamation of the Governor in Council published in the Canada Gazette.\nOn July 2nd, 1936, an Order in Council was passed in the following terms:\nThe Committee of the Privy Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Marine, advise that the Water Carriage of Goods Act, Chapter 49 of the Statutes of 1936, be proclaimed effective the 1st August, 1936, and that a proclamation do forthwith issue accordingly.\nA proclamation was issued on the same day, proclaiming and directing that the Act should come into force and have effect upon, from and after August 1st, 1936. This proclamation was published in the Canada Gazette on July 18th, 1936. Apparently this was not considered sufficient in view of the terms of subsection 2 of section 7, and on February 14th, 1939, an Order in Council was passed in the following terms:\nWhereas, under the provisions of Order in Council P.C. 1623 of July 2nd, 1936, authority was given for the proclamation of The Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1936, effective as of August 1st, 1936;\nAnd whereas section 7, subsection (2), of the said Act, reads as fallows:\n\"7. (2) The Rules shall not by virtue of this Act apply to any contract for the carriage of goods by water made before such day, not being earlier than the first day of August, nineteen hundred and thirty-six, as the Governor General may by Order in Council direct, nor to any bill of lading or similar document of title issued, whether before or after such day as aforesaid, in pursuance of any such contract as aforesaid.\"\nAnd whereas it is deemed expedient to determine pursuant to section 7, subsection (2) of the said Act, that the Rules contained in the Schedule to the said Act shall apply to any contract for the carriage of goods by water made after February 15th, 1939, and to any bill of lading or similar document of title issued in pursuance of any such contract;\nNow, therefore, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, is pleased to direct and doth hereby order and direct that the Rules contained in the Schedule to The Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1936, shall apply to any contract for the carriage of goods by water made after February 15th, 1939, and to any bill of lading or similar document of title issued, whether before or after February 15th, 1939, in pursuance of any such contract.\nNor can it be said that it was the intention of Parliament to have two different dates fixed by Order in Council. I do not think so. The schedule which contains the Rules is part of the Act and in my view it was never intended that sections 1 to 9 should be brought into force at one time and the Rules at a different time. Furthermore, section 8 repealed the previous Water Carriage of Goods Act and it could not have been intended that there should be an inter regnum during which resort might have to be had to the common law. While no doubt it would have been better had the first Order in Council referred in terms to subsection 2 of section 7, it would defeat the object of Parliament to hold that that was necessary.\nThe Act (including therein the Rules) being in force in May, 1938, those Rules relating to bills of lading in accordance with section 2, had effect in relation to and in connection with the carriage of glassware in the Anglo Indian from the port of Montreal in Canada. It was held by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Vita Food Products v. Unus Shipping Co. Ltd.[1], that a similar section of the Newfoundland Act was the dominant section, and that the words therein. \"Subject to the provisions of this Act\" mean merely that the Rules were to apply but subject to the modifications contained in the other sections in the Act. It was also held that section 4 was merely directory. The objection, therefore, that the wording at the foot of the face of the bill of lading in this action,\nThis bill of lading is subject to the provisions of the Canadian Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1936.\ndid not comply with section 4, even if it were valid, cannot affect the matter, as the Act, by virtue of section 2, applies.\nThis being an action in Canada with reference to a bill of lading issued in Canada, the law of Canada must be applied notwithstanding the inclusion in the bill of lading of clause 26. The question dealt with by Lord Wright in the Vita Food case1 as to the effect of a somewhat similar clause in a bill of lading issued in Newfoundland but action upon which was brought in Nova Scotia, does not arise. For the same reason the respondents can find no comfort in subsection 1 of section 7 of the Act:\nNothing in this Act shall affect * * * the operation of any other enactment for the time being in force limiting the liability of the owners of vessels.\nThere is no such enactment in force in Canada.\nUnder the Canadian Act there was no absolute undertaking in this case to provide a seaworthy ship but by clause 1 of Article III of the Rules, the respondents were bound to exercise due diligence to make the ship seaworthy. It has already been stated that the appellant contends that the trial judge was in error in finding that such due diligence had been exercised but that the respondents argue, even if that finding is wrong, they are still entitled to succeed. It seems advisable, therefore, to examine that argument immediately.\nIt is based on clause 2, paragraph (b) of Article IV of the Rules, which provides: Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from,\n***\n(b) fire, unless caused by the actual fault or privity of the carrier;\nThe respondents rely on the decision in the House of Lords in Louis Dreyfus and Company v. Tempus Shipping Company[2], that under section 502 of the British Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, the owner of a British sea-going ship is freed from liability for any damage caused by fire on board his ship even though that fire resulted from actual unseaworthiness, if he could prove that the fire occurred without his actual fault or privity. That section provides:\n502. The owner of a British sea-going ship, or any share therein, shall not be liable to make good to any extent whatever any loss or damage happening without his actual fault or privity in the following cases; namely,\u2014\n(i) Where any goods, merchandise, or other things whatsoever taken in or put on board his ship are lost or damaged by reason of fire on board the ship; or\nIn the Dreyfus case2, the House of Lords approved of two decisions of the Court of Appeal, Virginia Carolina Chemical Co. v. Norfolk and North American Steam Shipping Co.[3], and Ingram & Royle Ltd. v. Services Maritimes du Tr\u00e9port[4]. At page 732, Viscount Dunedin stated that where there was an exception in the bill of lading of fire on board, it had been held that that did not protect the ship when the fire was due to unseaworthiness but what the Court of Appeal decided was that the statutory exception against fire was not elided by proving that the fire was due to unseaworthiness. The point, he continues, was arguable but what had turned the scale in the earlier Court of Appeal case was that to come to the result opposite to that of the decision would be, as Vaughan Williams L.J., put it\nto change the words of a section from \"a British sea-going ship\" into \"a British sea-going seaworthy ship\".\nThat is, what the courts in those cases were construing were the words of an enactment creating an exception against fire.\nHere we have to deal with a statute wherein appears not only the obligation on the part of the ship and carrier to exercise due diligence to make the ship seaworthy but also the immunity from loss or damage arising or resulting from fire unless caused by the actual fault or privity of the carrier. How is that accomplished? Under Article II of the Rules the carrier is subject to the responsibilities and liabilities and entitled to the rights and immunities thereinafter set forth in the Rules, subject only to the provisions of Article VI, with which we are not concerned. Clause 1 of Article III then imposes the duty of exercising due diligence before and at the beginning of the voyage to make the ship seaworthy, and it is to be noted that this obligation is not stated to be subject to any of the rights or immunities granted by Article IV. Compare with this the provisions of clause 2 of Article III:\n2. Subject to the provisions of Article IV, the carrier shall properly and carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for and discharge the goods carried.\nThere, Parliament, while imposing upon the carrier the obligation to load, handle, stow, etc., provides that it is subject to the provisions of Article IV, but no such proviso appears in clause 1 of Article III.\nWhat is the effect of these Rules and how are they to be construed? In the House of Lords in Stag Line, Limited v. Foscolo, Mango and Company, Limited[5], appear two statements on the matter. Lord Atkin at page 342 says:\nIn approaching the construction of these rules it appears to me important to bear in mind that one has to give the words as used their plain meaning, and not to colour one's interpretation by considering whether a meaning otherwise plain should be avoided if it alters the previous law. If the Act merely purported to codify the law, this caution would be well founded.\nHe then refers to the well-known words of Lord Herschell in the Bank of England v. Vagliano Brothers[6], and continues:\nBut if this is the canon of construction in regard to a codifying Act, still more does it apply to an Act like the present which is not intended to codify the English law, but is the result (as expressed in the Act) of an international conference intended to unify certain rules relating to bills of lading. It will be remembered that the Act only applies to contracts of carriage of goods outwards from parts of the United Kingdom: and the rules will often have to be interpreted in the courts of the foreign consignees. For the purpose of uniformity it is, therefore, important that the Courts should apply themselves to the consideration only of the words used without any predilection for the former law, always preserving the right to say that words used in the English language which have already in the particular context received judicial interpretation may be presumed to be used in the sense already judicially imputed to them.\nAt page 350, Lord Macmillan states:\nIt is important to remember that the Act of 1924 was the outcome of an International Conference and that the rules in the Schedule have an international currency. As these rules must come under the consideration of foreign Courts it is desirable in the interests of uniformity that their interpretation should not be rigidly controlled by domestic precedents of antecedent date, but rather that the language of the rules should be construed on broad principles of general acceptation.\nI adopt, if I may, these statements as my own as expressing the proper method to be followed in construing the Rules.\nThe actual decision and the remarks of Lord Wright in Patterson Steamships, Limited v. Canadian Co-operative Wheat Producers, Limited[7], are not in conflict therewith. First of all, what was there in question was The Water Carriage of Goods Act, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 207, which is entirely different from the Act with which we are concerned. At page 549 Lord Wright refers to the meaning of the words \"actual fault or privity\" in section 7 of that Act and states that they seemed to have been taken from section 502 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894. He points out that the meaning of the words had been explained by Hamilton L.J., as he then was, in Asiatic Petroleum Co. Ltd. v. Lennard's Carrying Co. Ltd.[8], as follows: \"Actual fault negatives that liability which arises solely under the rule of 'respondeat superior'.\" That is, at that point Lord Wright was referring to the meaning of the words \"actual fault or privity\" and was stating in different language what Lord Atkin had expressed in his reservation,\nalways preserving the right to say that words used in the English language which have already in the particular context received judicial interpretation may be presumed to be used in the sense already judicially imputed to them.\nLord Wright was not dealing with the question whether something that would fall within the meaning of the words \"actual fault or privity\" would relieve a carrier from liability for loss caused by unseaworthiness. In my opinion the Dreyfus case[9] is not applicable.\nIn the view of the editors of the 14th edition of Scrutton on Charter Parties and Bills of Lading, at page 497, and of the editors of the 7th edition of MacLachlan on Merchant Shipping, page 378, the exception as to fire in clause 2, paragraph (b) of Article IV of the Rules, does not operate if the fire has been caused by failure to use due diligence to make the ship seaworthy. The view of the authors of Williamson and Payne's Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, page 42, is to the contrary but it seems to be based upon the Dreyfus case9. For the reasons already given, I am of opinion that that decision does not apply. My conclusion is that considering the purpose of the Act, if the direct cause of a loss is the unseaworthiness of the ship, even though fire was the proximate cause, the loss is not one arising or resulting from fire within the meaning of Article IV, clause 2 (b) even though it is proven that the unseaworthiness was caused without the actual fault or privity of the carrier. That still leaves the clause free to operate where a loss is the direct result of fire only.\nIt has been proved that an English Company, Lawther Latta and Co. Limited, were the managers of the ship's owners, The Nitrate Producers Steamship Co., Limited, and of their ships, and that Sir John Latta, the managing director and chairman of the board of both companies, was registered owner of the Anglo Indian. There was no actual fault or privity on the part of the \"directing mind and will of the corporation\", Lennard's Carrying Co. Limited v. Asiatic Petroleum Co. Limited[10]. This, of course, is not sufficient so far as the obligation on the carrier to use due diligence to make the ship seaworthy is concerned as that diligence must be not only by the ship owner itself but by all its servants and agents. For the purposes of the Act, the owners were the carriers under the bill of lading but Canadian Transport Company Limited and their officers and servants were the owner's agents. Is the finding of the trial judge that due diligence was exercised by them sustainable? All arrangements were made for the shipment of the concentrates by the shippers, Derby and Company, with Canadian Transport Company Limited through the latter's eastern manager, A. L. Palmer. This latter company, with its head office at Vancouver, British Columbia, carried on a large shipping business, having on charter from forty to eighty ships at one time, carrying about three-quarters of a million tons of cargo a year. Mr. Palmer, who had had twelve years' previous experience, joined the company in 1932 and from that time down to and including the year 1937, the company shipped, from Quebec to Tacoma, Washington, about 100,000 tons of concentrates. With one exception, these came from the Beatty Gold Mine and an analysis had been made of them before any were shipped. They were shipped, below deck, in about thirty-three different ships similar to the Anglo Indian and no heating occurred. The exception was a small shipment of about 150 tons, stowed on deck because there was a suspicion that the concentrates were warm and they were stowed where they were accessible. It was in that shipment that the only difficulty occurred when the concentrates smoldered.\nWhen Derby and Company, through its agent, J. B. Saxe, first approached Mr. Palmer, in 1937, to arrange for the shipment of concentrates, the latter, upon being told that they were coming from a different gold mine, Thomson-Cadillac, asked for and received a sample. According to Mr. Saxe, concentrates from that mine had previously been shipped on various occasions through his company from Quebec to Antwerp and no trouble had occurred. The sample was sent for testing to a well-known and reputable firm of industrial chemists and engineers, G. S. Eldridge & Co., of Vancouver, and there was received from them by Canadian Transport Company the following report, dated May 20th, 1937:\nWe have tested the sample of concentrates submitted by you and report as follows:\nMarks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nNone;\nIron (Fe) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n31\u00b720%;\nSulphur (S) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n23\u00b732%;\nInsoluble Matter (SiO2, etc) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n23\u00b730%;\nAlumina (A1203) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n5\u00b731%;\nCalcium Oxide (CaO) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3\u00b762%;\nCopper (Cu) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nNone. As this concentrate consists mainly of iron pyrites and insoluble matter and does not show any appreciable amount of pyrrhotite, we are of the opinion that if this material is shipped wet as it comes from the filters there will be no danger of the concentrate taking fire within at least six months as long as these damp conditions are maintained.\nThe only reason for securing this report, according to Mr. Palmer, was because the concentrates were coming from a different gold mine.\nIt has already been noted that the charter party between Canadian Transport Company Limited and Derby and Company was dated April 7th, 1938, and that the clause in the charter party, describing the cargo, contained the statement: \"It is understood that concentrates shipped are safe, non-injurious and lawful merchandise.\" The concentrates actually shipped on the Anglo Indian were sent from the mine to Quebec in bags and accumulated in an unheated shed and lay there during the winter of 1937-1938. S. Barrow was the Quebec agent for Robert Reford Company, who in turn were the Quebec agents for Canadian Transport Company. Again, only because the concentrates were from a different gold mine, Mr. Palmer instructed Mr. Barrow to secure a sample from the pile of bags in the shed, and in April, 1938, Mr. Barrow had his wharfinger take a sample of eight to ten pounds from the centre of one of the piles. Still on Mr. Palmer's instructions, this sample was sent to well-known chemists and analysts in Montreal, Milton Hersey Company Limited, and on May 5th, 1938, that company made the following report to Canadian Transport Company Limited:\nOn examination of the sample of concentrates received from you, we find that the material consists of finely divided and compact mineral matter, 99 per cent passing a No. 100 standard sieve. About 11 per cent moisture is present.\nWe understand that the concentrates are packed in 100-lb. burlap bags, lined with paper.\nIn our opinion this material should be safe for shipment and not liable to heat if kept in compact form and at ordinary temperature.\nWhen the bags are transferred from the warehouse, careful attention should be given to be certain that no heating has developed in storage, and if the temperature of any bags should be found above normal, such bags should not be shipped but should be held for further investigation.\nIn May, 1938, both Mr. Palmer and Mr. Barrow examined the piles of bags and were satisfied that in accordance with the last paragraph of the above report there was no heating. The bags on top of the piles were wet and the ones in and towards the centre of the piles were frozen. Mr. Barrow oversaw the stowing of the bags and he and the captain and the mate of the Anglo Indian were satisfied that the bags were stowed in compact form in the ship. At Montreal, Furness Withy were the agents for Canadian Transport Company and J. D. McCloskey was superintendent of Furness Withy. He also testified that the bags were stowed in compact form. Two port wardens at Montreal were satisfied with the stowage and approved the placing of general cargo on dunnage boards erected over the concentrates.\nAs against this, the appellant relies upon the evidence of Mr. Freeman, who has made a special study of concentrates and who, before 1938, had perfected a system of sealing shipments of them by spraying them with a preparation. Mr. Freeman stated that the term \"concentrates\" by itself means nothing but that the important thing was to discover the amount of iron and sulphur therein. He described the concentrates shipped on the Anglo Indian as iron sulphide concentrates and stated that where the iron exceeds the copper content by weight, as shown in the Eldridge report,\nthere is certainty of the material being able to absorb oxygen and therefore heat up spontaneously. That is to say that the material should be regarded as definitely dangerous.\nHe also spoke of a fire that had occurred in a shipment of concentrates from Quebec to Three Rivers in 1937 as a result of which some publicity occurred, including a report in a newspaper published in the latter city and having a circulation \"in the St. Maurice Valley and waterfront companies\". Another witness on behalf of the appellant, Dr. Snell, objected to the smallness of the sample out of such a large shipment and also expressed the opinion that heating and fire were bound to occur. None of this was known to the Canadian Transport Company Limited or anybody connected therewith, nor do I think that it can be held that they should have known. They were bound only to act with reasonable care and exercise due diligence in view of the circumstances existing in May, 1938. I agree with the trial judge that the two reports obtained by Canadian Transport Company Limited were inaccurate and misleading but that the company was entitled to rely on them as coming from experts who were rightly considered as reliable and competent.\nIt was objected that the statement in the Eldridge report:\nWe are of the opinion that if this material is shipped wet as it comes from the filters there will be no danger of the concentrate taking fire within at least six months as long as these damp conditions are maintained.\ncould not be taken to refer to concentrates that were left for some months in a shed in Quebec after leaving the mine. However, the Transport Company was justified in thinking that when, in May, 1938, an examination disclosed that the bags of concentrates were wet or frozen, there would be no danger as the voyage of the Anglo Indian was to be considerably less than six months. As to the concentrates being packed in bags, it appears from the second paragraph in the report of Milton Hersey Company Limited that they knew the concentrates were packed in 100-lb. burlap bags lined with paper.\nThe appellant suggested that the result of some of the evidence was that the system of ventilation on the Anglo Indian should have been operated in a different manner and that the concentrates could have been dampened while on board the ship but this evidence is not material to the question of due diligence. I agree with the trial judge that the respondents have shown that before and at the beginning of the voyage they exercised due diligence to make the ship seaworthy.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Rand JJ. (dissenting) was delivered by\nRand J.\u2014This action arises out of fire damage in the course of a water shipment of glass bottles from Montreal to Vancouver. The cause of the fire was the heating of gold concentrates taken on board the vessel at Quebec on the 10th and 11th of May, 1938, and destined to Tacoma, Washington. The goods of the appellant were loaded on May 18th at Montreal, the day on which the vessel sailed. About June 3rd, after the ship had passed through the Panama canal, fumes and heat were noticed arising from the concentrates. This condition steadily deteriorated until on June 9th their temperature had risen to 110 degrees Fahrenheit and on the 13th the vessel made the port of San Pedro, California, where the fire was extinguished.\nSeveral points are raised. At the outset there is the question whether the rules under the Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1936, were in force at the time of the shipment and, if not, were they sufficiently incorporated in the contract of carriage by the language of the bill of lading; then there is the question whether the ship, at the time of sailing, was unseaworthy and, if so, had due diligence been used to make her seaworthy. If the rules did not apply, we are remitted to a consideration of the clauses of the bill of lading. In either case, does section 502 of the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, or item (b) of article IV, section 2, of the Rules furnish an answer to the claim.\nThe doubt as to the applicability of the rules under the Water Carriage of Goods Act of 1936 arises from the peculiar language of section 7 (2) which is as follows:\nThe Rules shall not by virtue of this Act apply to any contract for the carriage of goods by water made before such day, not being earlier than the first day of August, nineteen hundred and thirty-six, as the Governor General may by Order in Council direct, nor to any bill of lading or similar document of title issued, whether before or after such day as aforesaid, in pursuance of any such contract as aforesaid.\nSection 9 provides for the coming into force of the Act on a date to be fixed by proclamation of the Governor-in-Council, published in the Canada Gazette. On July 2nd, 1936, the proclamation was made. In the preamble it is recited;\nAnd whereas it is expedient and our Privy Council has advised that a proclamation be issued bringing the said Act into force on the day hereinafter mentioned.\nAnd then follows the declaration:\nNow know ye that by and with the advice of our Privy Council for Canada we do hereby proclaim and direct that the said Act shall come into force and have effect upon, from and after the first day of August in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and thirty-six. By section 23 of the Interpretation Act, such a proclamation is to be taken as having been issued under an order of the Governor-in-Council. Later, on February 14th, 1939, order in council P.C. 343 was made, the declaratory language of which is as follows:\nNow therefore His Excellency the Governor General-in-Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport is pleased to direct and doth hereby order and direct that the rules contained in the schedule to the Water Carriage of Goods Act 1936 shall apply to any contract-for the carriage of goods by water made after February 15th, 1939, and to any bill of lading or similar document of title issued whether before or after February 15th, 1939, in pursuance of any such contract.\nThe Act clearly includes the schedule containing the rules. The enacting part is in fact confined in its operation to the rules except as to the repeal by section 8 of the Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1910. It is argued that the statute contemplates both a proclamation of the Act and a separate order in council dealing with the rules. The inconvenience, not to say absurdity, of that procedure is obvious. With any lapse of time between the proclamation and the order in council, the effect would be to repeal the Act of 1910 and leave no statutory rules in force during that period. When section 7 (2) is carefully examined, it is seen to have only this intent, that the rules as part of the Act and so the Act itself, should not come into force before August 1st, 1936; and with an order in council supporting the proclamation, the section is, in my opinion, amply satisfied. In that view, order P.C. no. 343, made, no doubt, ex majore cautela, was simply inoperative.\nThe bill of lading contained the following reference to the Act of 1936:\nThis bill of lading is subject to provisions of the Canadian Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1936.\nWhether this is looked upon as a conformity with the requirement of section 4 or a contractual reference, I take it to incorporate the rules as part of the Act and to carry the intention of overriding any contrary provision of the bill of lading.\nI come, then, to the question whether the vessel was, at the time of sailing from Montreal, in an unseaworthy condition. The facts are not in dispute. The concentrates were of such a composition that sooner or later they must have developed the combustion that took place. They consisted mainly of iron sulphides. Now, iron sulphides can be either safe or dangerous. If they consist strictly of the proportions of weight represented by the formula FeS2, which makes approximately 48\u00bd per cent iron and 51\u00bd per cent sulphur, they are known as pyrites and can be carried with safety. If, however, there is a predominance of iron which brings to the mixture any appreciable quantity of what is known as pyrrhotite, in which the percentage of iron is 7 per cent. or more greater than that of the sulphur, then we have an unstable condition in which the iron, being unsatisfied by the sulphur present, reaches out for oxygen and, depending on the conditions in which the oxidation takes place, can bring about a combustion of any degree of danger.\nNow, the ship was under a time charter, not amounting to a demise, to the Canadian Transport Company Limited. The representative of that company, A. L. Palmer of Montreal, had had an experience in 1933 with heating concentrates and when he was approached by the shippers he raised the question of the characteristics of the goods to be shipped. Concentrates, it may be explained, are simply the ore from which, as in this case, gold was to be obtained, ground to a very fine degree with the foreign matter or gang removed by what is known as a flotation process. What remains is the concentrated mineral substance. In April or May, 1937, Palmer asked for and apparently obtained a small sample of concentrate from the mine from which the shipment was to come and had it sent to responsible chemists in Vancouver. Under date of May 20th, 1937, they reported back the analysis which showed iron 31\u00b702 per cent. by weight and sulphur 23\u00b732 per cent. and the following advice:\nAs this concentrate consists mainly of iron pyrites and insoluble matter and does not show any appreciable amount of pyrrhotite, we are of the opinion that if this material is shipped wet as it comes from the filters there will be no danger of the concentrate taking fire within at least six months as long as these damp conditions are maintained.\nActing on this opinion Palmer intimated that he was prepared to carry the goods as proposed. The operations of the mining company were not on such a scale as to produce sufficient material for an early shipment and from, evidently, the summer of 1937 until late in the fall the necessary quantity amounting to 1,668 tons was accumulated in the storage sheds on the dock at Quebec. It is not clear what the monthly output was though there is some intimation that it might have run between two and three hundred tons, but the evidence is that the entire quantity lay in storage during the whole of the winter and up until the time of shipment on May 10th.\nIt is conceded that the interpretation given to the analysis by the Vancouver chemists was not strictly accurate. The marked excess of weight of iron over sulphur made the category of pyrites questionable and indicated to one thoroughly familiar with sulphides that there was a dangerous quantity of pyrrhotite and that shipment without special precautions would be hazardous.\nPalmer evidently took it that the danger indicated by the report could be controlled by the use of water and he so informed the captain; and the latter accepted the goods as safe cargo for the reason that \"it made no difference because I could pour water upon the concentrates if necessary\". Palmer also informed him that a report of a chemist had been received and that he was acting on the strength of it.\nA week or so before the vessel sailed from Quebec another sample of between eight and ten pounds, taken apparently from one or more of the bags in the shed at Quebec, was sent to reputable chemical engineers in Montreal and a report on May 5th was given as follows:\nOn examination of the sample of concentrates received from you, we find that the material consists of finely divided and compact mineral matter, 99 per cent passing a No. 100 standard sieve. About 11 per cent moisture is present.\nWe understand that the concentrates are packed in 100-lb. burlap bags, lined with paper.\nIn our opinion this material should be safe for shipment and not liable to heat if kept in compact form and at ordinary temperature.\nWhen the bags are transferred from the warehouse, careful attention should be given to be certain that no heating has developed in storage, and if the temperature of any bags should be found above normal, such bags should not be shipped but should be held for further investigation.\nThe bags, 28,000 odd in number, were stowed in the bottoms of three adjoining holds. They were leveled off and on the top was laid a rough flooring of 6-inch by 1-inch dunnage. On this was placed general cargo, including the shipment of the appellant. Direct access to the concentrates was thus made inconvenient, if not impossible, and any application of water could have been made, if at all without the removal of cargo, only under difficulties and at the cost of damage to other cargo.\nDuring the voyage and up until June 9th, the three holds were given full ventilation. When the fumes appeared about June 3rd, extra ventilation was provided by means of wind-sails. The temperature in approaching and leaving the canal was between 80 and 85 degrees and through the ventilation the warm air played around the concentrates. The effect of this was to dry them out, raise their temperature and promote oxidation; but in the conditions of the stowage the heat so generated could not be adequately dissipated and the process became steadily intensified. What was vital was to prevent oxidation but it seems to be a fair conclusion that the method adopted could scarcely have been more calculated to bring about the opposite result. Between June 9th and June 13th a number of communications passed between the captain and the Transport Company at Vancouver as well as the owners in London. The purport of the captain's messages was for instructions, among other things, as to the use of water. This, in the light of his conversation with Palmer before the shipment, is difficult to understand but it seems to make clear that no method of treating the concentrates with water had been planned or foreseen. The fact is, however, that the fire, after the removal of other cargo, was put out by water in about four hours, that the concentrates \"which had been effectually flooded\" did not have to be removed from the holds and that the ship continued the voyage to discharge them at Tacoma.\nOn the facts I agree with Cannon J., that when the vessel left Montreal she was not in a seaworthy condition. There were within her the conditions of a process that must, before the termination of the voyage, result in fire injurious to other cargo as well as to the ship herself and she was properly equipped in neither stowage arrangement, means, measures nor methods by which that process could be adequately controlled. Did the master exercise due diligence in relation to this condition? It is on the basis of compliance with the two reports of May, 1937, from Vancouver, and May, 1938, from Montreal that the respondents claim to have done so. Although these reports were obtained by Palmer for the charterer, the master in effect adopted the action taken and accepted Palmer's assurance that the shipment was not dangerous; and the argument assumed that on what he did, in the light of the advice given, he must be judged. The salient point of that advice is a warning that fire from the concentrates is to be anticipated and it stresses maintenance of temperature and moisture, restriction of exposure to the air, and a time limit of safety. But the material was not shipped \"wet as it comes from the filters\"; nor so as to maintain \"those damp conditions\"; nor (at least doubtfully) so as to be \"kept at ordinary temperature\"; neither was the safety period of six months given consideration. In fact, although most of it had been in storage for more than six months, no more precaution seems to have been taken\u2014with the possible exception of ventilation\u2014than if the bags had contained sand. Either there was a failure to sense the danger against which the letter of May, 1937, so precisely warned and to appreciate the necessity of the safety conditions which it defined, or Palmer was willing to rely on his own judgment that the state of the concentrates, even though different from, was sufficiently close to those conditions to justify taking the risk.\nUp to this point it has been assumed that in the circumstances mere reliance on the advice received was sufficient, but in my opinion it was not. There is nothing in the evidence to indicate that the Vancouver consultants were informed of the destination of the goods or were asked to consider ventilation, and the circumstances of the material at the time of shipment were essentially different from those on which the advice was based. It is a reasonable inference from the letter of May, 1937, that if those engineers had been aware that the material would be accumulated over a period of eight or nine months in ordinary storage, would then be shipped in bags and stowed as mentioned, carried through the canal to Tacoma and be subjected to a continuous ventilation, the accentuated danger would have taken on a much more serious aspect and the advice might very probably have been either that the concentrates be brought to the equivalent of the conditions mentioned in the letter of May, 1937\u2014\"wet as it comes from the filters\"\u2014or that measures be taken for the application of water during the voyage, or that the shipment be refused. The evidence, too, makes it clear that the sample taken in May, 1938, was not a fair one; the letter from the Montreal engineers is dated the 5th of that month and the sample of eight pounds was intended to represent a lot of 28,000 bags of over 100 lbs. each and as the loading started on May 10th it must have been taken while the original pile stood. It seems a bit strange that the later sample should have been sent to Montreal and without any intimation of the analysis or the opinion already received from Vancouver: and again nothing was asked as to ventilation. Neither of the engineers who reported was called as a witness; but the onus lay with the respondents to show that these undisclosed facts would not have changed the advice and would not reasonably have called for any material change of conduct on their part in precaution or lack of it. In either case, therefore, the respondents have fallen short of the duty required under the statute.\nIn this I disregard the fact that there was in the field and literature of chemistry not only the common knowledge that iron sulphides were liable to spontaneous combustion, but also the limited knowledge of the means for controlling them. Before 1935 Swedish chemists had discovered that spraying the concentrates with a sulphite liquor coated the particles and effectively prevented oxidation; and the practical question became one of low-cost liquids with the required properties. An article setting forth the results of the research was in 1935 published in a chemical trade journal which circulated in Canada.\nIt is argued that section 502 of the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, applies; but this provision, so far as it was in force in Canada, was repealed by the 13th schedule of the Canada, Shipping Act, 1934, c. 44. It is then urged that by an express stipulation in the bill of lading the contract is to be governed by English law which must be taken to be what is called the \"proper law\" of the contract. Whatever effect might be given to such a stipulation in a court outside of Canada, within this country we are bound by the provisions of the Water Carriage of Goods Act of 1936. By section 8 of article III of the Rules any clause in a contract of carriage purporting to relieve a carrier for loss or damage arising from negligence in respect of the duties provided in that article (except as allowed by the Rules), is void. As the English law would have effect only by way of factual incorporation in the contract, and as the immunity of section 502 extends to all negligence imputable to the carrier by the rule of respondeat superior, on the assumption that item (b) next dealt with does not give exemption, it clashes with section 8 and must in this court be deemed to be excluded from the bill of lading.\nThere remains the defence that the respondents have brought themselves within the exception of item (b) of article IV, section 2, of the Rules:\n2. Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from:\n***\n(b) fire unless caused by the actual fault or privity of the carrier.\nIt will be convenient to set against this language that of section 502:\nThe owner of a British sea-going ship or any share therein shall not be liable to make good to any extent whatever any loss or damage happening without his actual fault or privity in the following cases, namely:\n(i) Where any goods, merchandise or other things whatsoever taken in or put on board his ship are lost or damaged by reason of fire on board the ship.\nThis latter provision is in a general shipping Act which does not deal specifically with stipulations of bills of lading, and is contained in a part which provides a number of limitations on the liability of owners of vessels. It is now settled that the exemption so given extends to a loss by fire resulting from unseaworthiness and we must consider whether the same interpretation is to be given to item (b). The Water Carriage of Goods Act of 1936 and its rules were intended to make uniform over a wide range of international commerce the rules under which goods are carried by sea and to limit the extent to which water carriers might restrict their liability for loss or damage. At the same time it qualified the important obligation of seaworthiness to which they were subject.\nAt common law the obligation of a water carrier was the same as that of a common carrier: he must deliver what he received unless excused by an act of God, the King's enemies or inherent defect. Implicit in this obligation was the duty at all times to exercise reasonable care and skill in the undertaking, and an absolute warranty that the vessel was reasonably fit for the purpose to which it was to be put or, in other words, was seaworthy. But these two inherent obligations of care and skill and seaworthiness were significant only in relation to exceptions from the absolute liability of the carrier and in the development of shipping law they became the background against which all exceptions, including the act of God or the King's enemies, came to be interpreted.\nThe Rules assume, and are intended to be terms and conditions of, a common law undertaking to carry and deliver. That is made clear by article II. In article III the responsibilities and liabilities of the carrier are set forth. Section 1 prescribes the obligation in respect of seaworthiness, i.e., the duty of due diligence in the furnishing of a complete vessel: section 2 deals likewise with the care and skill to be exercised in the receipt, carriage and delivery of the goods.\nSection 2, however, by its introductory language, \"subject to the provisions of article IV\", declares in effect that the responsibility so created, in relation to liability, is not absolute; that, for example, the exceptions may, on their proper construction, trench upon the duty so prescribed. On the other hand, there is no such subjection of section 1 of article III to article IV; and, in a manner complementary to section 1 of article III, section 1 of article IV expressly and exclusively deals with liability for loss or damage arising from unseaworthiness. The effect of that special treatment is, I think, to render the exercise of diligence absolute and to place it quite outside the scope of any of the itemized exemptions. It may be that the language of item (b), virtually identical with that of section 502, would, in the absence of the particular provisions of the Rules to which I have referred, call for a similar construction as to seaworthiness; but as item (b) clearly gives exemption in the case of fire caused by negligence, other than that of the carrier himself, arising in the course of the duties of section 2, article III, the exception is fully satisfied consistently with what appears to be perfectly plain and straightforward language, and I feel bound to assume that the legislature did not intend to ascribe to the item a more extended scope.\nIt may be suggested that item (p), \"latent defects not discoverable by due diligence\", embraces a defect rendering the vessel unseaworthy and no doubt it does; but the obligation within which these exceptions are to be construed is that of the undertaking to carry and deliver. So considered, it is seen that they are intended to exclude the liability of the carrier as insurer and to confine it to negligence not excepted.\nI would, therefore, allow this appeal and direct judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for the sum of $4,235.12, with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Montgomery, McMichael, Common & Howard.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Meredith, Holden, Heward & Holden.\n[1] [1939] A.C. 277.\n1 [1939] A.C. 277.\n[2] [1931] A.C. 726.\n2 [1931] A.C. 726.\n[3] [1912] 1 K.B. 229.\n[4] [1914] 1 K.B. 541.\n[5] [1932] A.C. 328.\n[6] [1891] A.C. 107.\n[7] [1934] A.C. 538.\n[8] [1914] 1 K.B. 419, at 436.\n[9] [1931] A.C. 726.\n9 [1931] A.C. 726.\n[10] [1915] A.C. 705, at 713.\n"}

Balciunas ([1943] S.C.R. 317). The accused, respondents, were charged on five counts, one for conspiracy to commit fraud, two for conspiracy to commit indictable offences and two for having committed the substantive offences themselves. The trial having been limited to the three conspiracy counts, the accused, having elected to be tried speedily under part 18 of the Criminal Code, were found guilty, but on appeal the conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. The decision of the appellate court was based on the ground that the trial judge upon speedy trial had no jurisdiction to try the three different counts in the indictment at the same time, that Court being of the opinion that it was contrary to the rule laid down by this Court in The King v. Balciunas ([1943] S.C.R. 317). The Crown appealed to this Court, leave having been granted under section 1025 of the Criminal Code.\nHeld that the appeal should be allowed. The judgment of this Court in the Balciunas case (supra) should not be considered as governing the present case, the true effect of that decision being that it is limited in its restriction of trial to cases where the several counts arise from separate informations and commitments.\nThe procedure was different in the two cases. In the present case, there was only one complaint which charged the respondents with the three conspiracy offences, there was only one preliminary inquiry referring to the three counts and there was only one charge sheet and one option. In the Balciunas case (supra), three separate informations were laid, each charging a distinct offence; there was a commitment for trial in each of the cases, although the three charges were set forth on a single Charge sheet, there was one speedy trial on all three Charges and the accused was convicted on each charge. Therefore, in the Balciunas decision, it was a case of a joinder for trial purposes of charges originating in different complaints, or in different and distinct commitments, or, in short, a joinder of different cases; and it was held that it was improper to try the three separate charges together.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, which allowed the respondents' appeal on questions of law and ordered a new trial, without giving any decision on questions of facts.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nG\u00e9rald Fauteux K.C. and Gustave Adam K.C. for the appellant.\nPhilippe Monette K.C. and M. Gameroff K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by The Chief Justice.\u2014The respondents were, by the Court of Sessions sitting in and for the district of Montreal, found guilty on three counts of conspiracy on which they had been tried. These counts of conspiracy formed part of a single charge sheet. The accused were charged with having conspired to commit a number of offences and also, on two other counts, with having committed the substantive offences themselves. Upon objection of the respondents, by way of motion to quash, against the joinder of the conspiracy charges and of the two other charges for having committed the substantive offences, the hearing of the two latter counts was adjourned and the case proceeded only upon the conspiracy charges, to the joinder of which, at that particular time, no objection was forthcoming from the respondents.\nAgainst the conviction on the three counts of conspiracy, the respondents appealed on questions of law and on questions of facts.\nBy judgment rendered on the 30th of December, 1943, the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) unanimously allowed the appeal on the questions of law and ordered a new trial; but, although the Court had heard counsel for the parties both on the law and on the facts, no reference either in the formal judgment or in the reasons for judgment was made to the appeal on questions of facts.\nThe decision of the Court was that the presiding judge, upon speedy trial under part 18 of the Criminal Code, had no jurisdiction to try the three different counts in the indictment at the same time, as he had done; that this was contrary to the rule laid down by the Supreme Court of Canada in The King v. Balciunas[1]. For that reason the conviction was quashed and the Court ordered a new trial.\nAlthough the formal judgment of the Court of King's Bench states that the respondents took exception to the mode of trial, it now appears that this was a mistaken impression and that the trial proceeded and the accused were found guilty without raising the objection which they alleged in their notice of appeal.\nThe Crown moved for leave to appeal to this Court, under section 1025 of the Criminal Code, alleging conflict in a like case between the judgment now appealed from and the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Nova Scotia in the case of The King v. Cross[2]. Leave to appeal was granted.\nThere is no doubt about the jurisdiction of the learned judge who gave leave, because the conflict is evident. In the Cross case2 the Court decided that a judge holding a speedy trial may deal with each charge as the counts in one indictment might be dealt with and is not bound to proceed with a speedy trial upon each formal charge. There was, as here, only one information. The Court of Appeal of Nova Scotia held that the magistrate had jurisdiction to try together the three charges there referred to and that the several charges were not to be treated as separate indictments and to be tried separately. The conviction was affirmed.\nThe judgment rendered by the Court of King's Bench in the present case is, therefore, clearly in conflict with the Cross case2, and the case comes under section 1025 of the Criminal Code, unless it may be said that the judgment of this Court in the Balciunas case[3] overruled the judgment in the Cross case2 and that the Court of King's Bench of Quebec only followed the decision rendered in this Court in the Balciunas case3.\nLeave having been granted, the Court first heard the appeal during the May sittings and judgment was then reserved; but, in the course of its deliberations, the Court felt there were points on which it would like to have a reargument. Accordingly counsel were advised that they were called upon to argue the following points:\u2014\nWhether, under the judgment of this Court in the Balciunas case,3 in no case can more than one count be the subject of trial under Part 18 of the Code at the same time, or whether the judgment is limited in its restriction of trial to cases where the several counts arise from separate informations and commitments.\nCounsel on both sides had full opportunity to be heard on the points thus submitted.\nThe reargument took place at the present sittings of the Court. Counsel for the Attorney-General for the province of Quebec took the position that the second alternative in the question submitted by the Court was the correct one and that to which one should adhere. I have come to the conclusion that the latter view is the true effect of the Balciunas judgment[4]. As appears in the judgment of the Court, the facts in that case were as follows:\u2014\nThree separate informations were laid against Balciunas. He was committed for trial on all three. A single charge sheet setting forth the three charges was prepared by the Crown Prosecutor and on this the accused was arraigned and elected to be tried speedily under part 18 of the Criminal Code. There was one trial on all three charges before the County Court judge and Balciunas was convicted on each charge. On appeal to the Court of Appeal this conviction was set aside\/and a new trial directed on the ground that it was improper to try the three separate charges together, the point being that, although there was authority in the Criminal Code to include in an indictment a number of separate charges, this was not the case as to a charge under the provisions of part 18. In this Court the judgment of the Court of Appeal was affirmed.\nIn the present case the procedure was different. There was only one complaint which charged the respondents with the three conspiracy offences. There was only one preliminary inquiry referring to the three counts, and there was only one charge sheet and one option.\nA motion to quash was made, but it objected to the joinder of the conspiracy charges with the other charges of having committed the offences themselves; it did not object to the joinder of the three conspiracy charges.\nAs appears, there was a single complaint, a single inquiry, a single charge comprising the three counts, a single option in relation to that charge, and a single trial on the three counts. No objection was made to having the conspiracy counts tried simultaneously, and objection was made only to the joinder with the substantive offences counts.\nThe procedure, therefore, was different in the two cases and I do not think the Balciunas judgment[5] should be considered as governing the present case. What the Court had before it in the Balciunas case5 was the fact of three separate informations, a commitment for trial on all three and a single charge sheet on which the trial proceeded to conviction on all three charges. The Court did not pretend to decide anything else than what was then before it. The effect of the judgment is that, in the premises, it was improper to try the three charges together; and the decision should not be extended to a different case. Speaking broadly, however general the terms may be in which a judgment is expressed, unless a contrary intention clearly appears, they extend only to the facts and to the questions with which the Court is at the moment concerned.\nIn the Balciunas case[6] what was condemned was the joinder for trial purposes of charges originating in different complaints, or different informations, the joinder of separate records, or, in short, of different cases. It should not, therefore, be considered as concluding this particular case.\nNow, as can be seen by the notice of appeal, there was substantially only one ground of appeal on the law before the Court of King's Bench in Quebec. The respondents contended that the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction in hearing simultaneously three counts in the indictment. Likewise, the Court of King's Bench decided that contention favourably to the respondents by resting its decision on the Balciunas judgment6; but, in my opinion, the two cases are different and, as this was the real ground of the decision in the Court of King's Bench, it follows that the appeal ought to be allowed.\nHowever, this does not dispose of the case. There was an appeal to the Court of King's Bench not only on the question of law just discussed, but also on questions of fact. The respondents were entitled to a pronouncement by the Court of King's Bench on their appeal on facts. In view of the result on the question of law, the Court of King's Bench gave no decision on the appeal on facts. The case ought, therefore, to be remitted to the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) of the province of Quebec in order that that Court may pass upon the grounds of appeal based on facts. In so ordering, I am adopting the course followed by this Court in The King v. Boak[7].\nThe appeal should be allowed to the extent indicated. The judgment of Taschereau and Rand JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.\u2014The respondents were charged before the Court of Sessions, district of Montreal, under the speedy trials provisions of the Criminal Code on five counts, one for conspiracy to commit fraud, two for conspiracy to commit indictable offences against sections 164 and 169 of the Excise Act, and two for those offences themselves. The charges had been laid in one information and the commitment was on all of them. On the objection of the respondents and with the consent of the Crown, the trial was limited to the conspiracy counts. The accused were found guilty but on appeal the conviction was set aside and new trials ordered. From that judgment the Attorney-General of Quebec appeals.\nThe ground on which the Court of King's Bench proceeded was that under part 18 of the Code, as interpreted by this court in the case of The King v. Balciunas[8], no more than one count or charge can be the subject of such a trial. But that was not, in my opinion, the effect of the Balciunas judgment8 nor do I think it governs this case. An examination of its facts shows that three informations had been laid, each charging a distinct offence. There was a commitment in each case. The three charges, however, were set forth on one charge sheet; on them the accused elected for a speedy trial and they were tried together. It was, therefore, a case of joining charges contained in separate and distinct commitments. The Court of Appeal for Ontario had held that there was no power under part 18 to do that and that section 834 had no application because all three were contained in the commitments; and it had directed\nthat the appellant be tried regularly upon the charges upon which he was committed for trial.\nThat judgment was affirmed in this court (1). In both, reference was made to section 856 of part 19 of the Criminal Code and assuming that section would have cured what was otherwise a misjoinder, it was held not to apply to proceedings under part 18. These judgments imply that, if the three charges had been properly on the charge sheet, they could have been tried together, and this is clearly the assumption underlying section. 856 in relation to an indictment. If the question had been simply whether there was jurisdiction under part 18 to try two charges together, it would have been quite unnecessary to emphasize the precise procedure followed or to make any reference to section 834.\nThen does part 18 exclude all joinder of counts in a charge sheet? The commitment on the five charges was unobjectionable. Section 827 requires, for the purposes of election, that the prisoner be informed that he is charged with \"the offence\", which ordinarily means that upon which he has been committed, but the singular number is not to be taken as a limitation. By subsection 3,\nthe prosecuting officer shall prefer the charge against the accused for which he has been committed for trial or any charge founded on the facts or evidence disclosed on the depositions.\nSection 834 has already been considered. Section 839, giving all powers of amendment, authorizes the division of a count under section 891.\nBy the common law rule, an indictment could in general contain any number of counts. In felonies, when it appeared that they did not all arise out of the same body of facts, the court, not as a matter of jurisdiction but of judicial discretion, followed this practice: if the discreteness was detected before the prisoner pleaded, the court would quash the indictment; if it did not appear until after plea, the prosecutor was called upon to elect upon which count he would proceed; but after verdict the joinder was not available on a writ of error. So long, however, as the counts were statements of different offences arising out of what was in substance a single transaction, there was no misjoinder and all could be tried together: The King v. Lockett et al.[9], and in this background both the purpose of section 856 and the interpretation of part 18 are clarified. If a joinder of two or more counts, arising as in this case, were not allowed, then either speedy trials would be limited to commitments on a single charge or a separate trial would be necessary for each of any number of charges although they all arose out of the same transaction, and the real object of part 18 would, in large measure, be defeated. Section 710 in part 15 shows with what specific language such a limitation of trial has been prescribed.\nThe ground, then, upon which the court below proceeded lay in a misconception of what the Balciunas judgment (1) decided and the appeal must be allowed but, as the accused had appealed as well on the facts and this ground has not been considered below, I would return the case to the Court of King's Bench to be dealt with accordingly.\nAppeal allowed.\n[1] [1943] S.C.R. 317.\n[2] (1909) 14 Can.

At trial, the jury, asked if defendant had satisfied them that plaintiff\u2019s loss or damage did not arise through negligence or improper conduct on defendant\u2019s part (the question being framed with regard to the onus created by s. 48 (1) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 288), answered in the affirmative; and the action was dismissed.

Defendant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. The trial Judge, in charging the jury, erred in the following respects:\n(1) In stating that \u201cwhen a defendant is called upon to prove that the damage was not caused by his negligence or improper conduct, he might prove it by showing that it was caused, in whole or in part, by the negligence of the plaintiff\u201d. Defendant could not satisfy the burden placed upon him by said s. 48 (1) by showing that the damages were caused in part by plaintiff\u2019s negligence; his obligation was to satisfy the jury that the loss or damage did not arise through any negligence or improper conduct on his part; if they were so satisfied, that was an end to the matter; if they were not, it would then be open to them to find that plaintiff\u2019s negligence caused or contributed in part to the accident in accordance with the provisions of The Negligence Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 115.\n(2) In putting the case to the jury as though their task under said s. 48 (1) were to examine defendant\u2019s conduct in certain particulars only so as (in the language of the charge) \u201cto come to a decision as to whose negligence caused the accident, or whether both were negligent\u201d. (No doubt plaintiff\u2019s counsel, in addressing the jury, had referred to certain conduct of defendant as constituting negligence; but the statement of claim had not alleged negligence, nor was it required that it should do so.) That manner of dealing with the onus fell far short of what is required in explaining its nature and was misleading. A jury may properly find that a defendant has failed to meet the statutory onus (each juror possibly having a different ground for so thinking) without being able to specify exactly in what the defendant\u2019s negligence consisted.\nWinnipeg Electric Co. v. Geel, [1932] A.C. 690, at 695, 696; [1931] S.C.R. 443, at 446, cited. Statement of the Law in Newell v. Acme Farmers Dairy Ltd., [1939] O.R. 36, at 43, approved.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which (Riddell J.A. dissenting) vacated and set aside the judgment of McFarland J. (dismissing the action on a finding by the jury) and ordered a new trial. The action was for damages by reason of personal injuries to one of the plaintiffs (wife of the other plaintiff) caused by her being struck, while crossing a street in Toronto, Ontario, by a motor car driven by the defendant. The ground of the judgment in the Court of Appeal was that, with regard to the onus created by s. 48 (1) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 288, there was error in the trial Judge\u2019s charge to the jury.\nE.L. Haines and D. Haines for the appellant.\nI. Levinter K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKELLOCK J.\u2014We are all of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. The appeal is from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dated November 18th, 1943, allowing an appeal from a judgment at trial, of McFarland J., with a jury, dated June 9th, 1943, by which the action was dismissed.\nThe respondents brought the action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by the respondent Mary Shapiro and for expenses incurred by her husband, the respondent Joseph Shapiro, as the result of an accident happening on or about the 27th September, 1942, while the first named respondent was crossing from north to south on Bloor Street West, in the City of Toronto, in the neighbourhood of Manning Avenue. Whilst so doing, she was struck by an automobile, owned and driven by the appellant.\nThe jury in answer to the question, \u201cHas the defendant Angus Wilkinson satisfied you that the loss or damage of the plaintiffs did not arise through negligence or improper conduct on his part\u201d, answered in the affirmative. The appeal to the Court of Appeal was on the ground of misdirection and non-direction in the charge of the learned trial judge.\nIn his charge, the learned trial judge, after explaining to the jury the meaning of the term \u201cnegligence\u201d, pointed out to them that the accident was not one requiring the respondents to prove negligence on the part of the appellant but was governed by the provisions of section 48, subsection 1, of The Highway Traffic Act, which he read. He then proceeded:\u2014\nIn this case, to put it frankly, the onus is upon the defendant Wilkinson to satisfy you that the injuries to the plaintiff were not caused by his negligence.\nI should also go on to say that when a defendant is called upon to prove that the damage was not caused by his negligence or improper conduct, he might prove it by showing that it was caused, in whole or in part, by the negligence of the plaintiff. And that is the allegation set up here.\n(The italics are mine.) The learned judge then turned to the questions to be submitted to the jury and proceeded:\u2014\nThe first question goes directly to the heart of the matter of which I have just been speaking; namely, onus; because the first question leads:\n(His Lordship then read the first question.) The jury were then charged that that question had to be answered \u201cYes, or No\u201d and that, if the answer were in the affirmative, the jury need not answer any of the later questions except the question as to damages. The later questions were the usual ones in actions of this character, as to negligence on the part of the plaintiff and the respective degrees of the negligence of plaintiff and defendant.\nThe learned judge then proceeded to deal with the evidence and said: \u201cas I see it, the negligence of the defendant, alleged by the plaintiff, was,\u201d in certain particulars which the learned judge set out seriatim.\nNo doubt counsel for the respondents, in his address to the jury, had referred to certain conduct on the part of the appellant as constituting negligence, but the statement of claim did not allege negligence on the part of the appellant at all, and it was not required that it should do so. The learned judge then proceeded to comment on the evidence dealing with the conduct of the respondent Mary Shapiro and the appellant\u2019s account of the accident. He then stated: \u201cI think you have heard enough to enable you to come to a decision as to whose negligence caused the accident, or whether both were negligent.\u201d After dealing with the question of damages, his Lordship later returned to the first question and repeated his instruction that if the jury found that the appellant had satisfied them that he was not negligent, and answered the first question in the affirmative, they should then proceed to the question of damages but, if they answered question 1 in the negative, they should deal with the other questions. He then said: \u201cRemember that the onus is upon the defendant. Any ten of you may agree on the answer to any question, it is not necessary for you to be unanimous.\u201d\nObjection was taken by counsel for the respondents on the ground that the learned trial judge had not adequately explained to the jury the meaning of section 48, subsection 1, and the learned judge was referred to Winnipeg Electric Company v. Geel[2], and Newell v. Acme Farmers Dairy Limited[3]. The learned judge recalled the jury and on the question of onus said:\u2014\nThe contention is made that certain expressions I used might probably have been misleading. I have been asked to make it quite clear to you again, that the onus rests squarely on the defendant to prove to your satisfaction that there was no negligence on his part. That onus rests upon him. Any verdict brought in by you must be based upon whether or not the defendant has sustained that onus. Now, I think that is putting it as clearly as I can.\nHis Lordship then referred to the sections of The Highway Traffic Act dealing with the requirements as to lights and horns, and the jury were instructed that the onus was upon the defendant to satisfy the jury that the section as to lights was observed and that the non\u2011operation of the horn was justified under the circumstances.\nEssentially two points arise on this charge: First, the instruction with regard to the first question submitted to them that the appellant could satisfy the burden of proof cast upon him by section 48, subsection 1, by showing that the damage suffered by the female respondent was caused \u201cin part\u201d by her negligence. The second point arises in connection with the manner in which the learned trial judge further dealt with the onus cast upon a defendant by the subsection and his putting of the case to the jury as though their task, under the section, were to examine the conduct of the appellant in certain particulars only so as \u201cto come to a decision as to whose negligence caused the accident, or whether both were negligent\u201d, to employ the language of the learned trial judge.\nThe appeal to the Court of Appeal was allowed, Riddell J.A., dissenting. Laidlaw, J.A., who wrote the majority judgment and with whom Gillanders, J.A., agreed, held that the trial judge was in error in his charge with regard to the first point and that the jury, so charged, could not properly deal with the question as to whether or not the appellant had satisfied the onus of proof resting upon him. We find ourselves in agreement with Laidlaw, J.A., on this point. The appellant could not satisfy the burden placed upon him by showing that the damages were caused in part by the female plaintiff\u2019s negligence. His obligation was to satisfy the jury that the loss or damage did not arise through any negligence or improper conduct on his part. If they are so satisfied, that is an end to the matter; if they are not, it would then be open to them to find that the female plaintiff\u2019s negligence caused or contributed in part to the accident in accordance with the provisions of The Negligence Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 115. With regard to the second point arising on the charge as above referred to, this was criticized by Laidlaw, J.A., but he thought it unnecessary to determine whether this would form a good ground of appeal in view of his opinion on the other point.\nWith regard to this aspect of the learned trial judge\u2019s charge, we think it falls far short of what is required in explaining the nature of the onus cast upon a defendant by subsection 1 of section 48 of The Highway Traffic Act and is quite misleading. If the jury were to be put in a position to discharge their duty, it was essential that the learned trial judge should direct them properly as to the law and as to how that law was to be applied to the facts before them, as they might find them. As to the relevant law, it is only necessary to refer to the judgment delivered by Lord Wright in the Privy Council in Winnipeg Electric Company v. Geel[4], and to the judgment of Duff J., as he then was, in the same case[5]. We find ourselves in agreement with the statement of the law of Middleton, J.A., in Newell v. Acme Farmers Dairy Limited[6], as follows:\u2014\nThe jury may find itself quite satisfied that the defendant has failed to meet the statutory onus cast upon him. But each of the jurors may have a different ground for so thinking, and it may be impossible for a jury who rightly believe that the accident was caused by negligence to specify exactly in what the negligence consisted.\nIt is not necessary to repeat or amplify these authorities. They indicate the requirements of a satisfactory explanation of the effect of the legislation under consideration. The charge in the case at bar does not comply with these requirements and we think that a verdict based on it cannot stand. What the learned judge said to the jury after they were recalled was quite inadequate to rectify the error existing in his previous instructions to them.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Haines & Haines.\nSolicitor for the respondents: J.M.

The King [1933] S.C.R. 509\u2014Comments as to extent of that decision as to the admissibility of a confession in whole or in part.\nOn a charge of murder the possession by accused of the weapon (revolver), with which the murder was committed, at the time of the killing was a relevant fact to be proved by the Crown. The evidence of the theft of the revolver was admissible; it was admissible because it was relevant as showing how the accused obtained possession of the revolver. Therefore the mention of the fact that the revolver was stolen in the confession of the accused did not vitiate that confession as evidence.\nIn Thiffault v. The King ([1933] S.C.R. 509), the decision of this Court was that the evidence pointed to the conclusion that the statement tendered in evidence was not a correct statement of what the accused had said and intended to say; and it was also held that a document, professing to embody the effect of admissions obtained in the way the admissions were obtained in that case and containing inter alia a record of an admission of a fact that would be inadmissible as evidence against the accused and was calculated to prejudice him, ought not to be admitted as evidence against him.\nThe decision of this Court in the Thiffault case does not lay down that, where a document contains a true record of a declaration by an accused which, it is established to the satisfaction of the trial judge, was a voluntary statement in the pertinent sense, the whole declaration must necessarily be excluded because it contains a statement of some irrelevant fact. If the declaration was obtained in circumstances and in a manner which makes it otherwise unobjectionable, and if the statement of the irrelevant fact can be separated from the rest of the document without in any way affecting the tenor of it, then the trial judge in most cases would probably be able to effect the exclusion of the objectionable statement while permitting the unobjectionable part of the document to go before the jury. To this course in such circumstances there could be no objection. Rex v. Sampson (62 C.C.C. 49, at 51) approved, subject to the observations in the judgment. But where a written declaration by an accused contains statements of facts prejudicial to the accused and not relevant to the issue, the trial judge may find it necessary to scrutinize with exceptional care the circumstances in which the declaration has been obtained.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1943] 2 W.W.R. 449; [1943] 3 D.L.R. 584) affirmed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the conviction of the appellant on a charge of murder.\nThe accused (appellant), when being interviewed by the police with respect of the theft of revolvers from a barracks, handed over a revolver then in his possession and confessed that he had stolen it. After a third and final interview had been apparently concluded, the accused blurted out \"I killed Phil Davis\", a taxi-driver. No mention of Davis had previously been made during the first two interviews. The usual warning had been given and the accused's confession was taken down in writing and signed by him; it included the theft of the revolver. The written statement embodying both confessions was admitted in evidence at the trial, after it had been found, following a \"trial within the trial\", to have been free and voluntary. The trial judge instructed the jury they could find the appellant guilty of murder, either on the confession itself, or apart from it, on his evidence given in the witness-box when he repudiated the confession and explained his possession of the deceased's watch and flashlight. The accused was convicted of murder. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, it was contended that the testimony of the theft was not material, since there was ample evidence of the accused's possession of the revolver, and that such testimony was not only irrelevant to the charge of murder but was also prejudicial to the accused. The majority of the appellate court held that, under all the circumstances, the fact of the illegal possession of the revolver was admissible and that the appeal should be dismissed. The accused appealed to this Court, and the appeal was dismissed.\nP. D. Murphy for the appellant.\nJ. A. Clark K.C. for the respondent.\nAt the conclusion of the argument by the appellant's counsel, without calling upon counsel for the respondent, the Chief Justice, speaking for the Court, delivered the following oral judgment:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014Mr. Clark, we think it will not be necessary to call upon you.\nWe have had the advantage of an admirable argument from Mr. Murphy; and what I am saying now, in a very summary way, is, first, that we are satisfied that evidence of the theft of the revolver was admissible and that mention of the circumstance that the revolver had been stolen in the confession does not vitiate it.\nAs regards the application that has been made, we have come to the conclusion that we ought not to accede to that application, because we are satisfied there is no conflict between the decision of the Court of Appeal in this case and the decision referred to, in the relevant sense.\nI must add, however, that a decision of this Court in the Thiffault case (1) was the subject of discussion in the Court below and we think it is possible that there has been some misapprehension of the effect of that judgment in that case, and for that reason we think some explanation should be given on that point. We will, therefore, give some reasons later.\nThe appeal will be dismissed.\nSome time later, the following written reasons for judgment were delivered by the Chief Justice speaking for the Court.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014In the reasons given on the 7th of October, 1943, in this appeal, it was stated that there would be further reasons dealing with a point raised as to the application of Thiffault v. The King[2]. As was stated in those reasons, we are satisfied that the evidence of the theft of the revolver was admissible; it was admissible because it was relevant as showing how the accused obtained possession of the revolver. Therefore, the mention of the fact that the revolver was stolen in the confession of the accused does not vitiate that confession as evidence.\nIn Thiffault v. The King[3] it was necessary to consider a declaration which had been received in evidence against the accused. The accused on the occasion on which the declaration was signed had been interrogated by a detective whose questions were directed to ascertaining not only the connection of the accused with the fire in which his wife had lost her life, but also to obtaining admissions of damaging facts in his past history. The clerk who was present made what professed to be a record of the effect of the statements of the accused, which the latter signed after it had been read to him. Admittedly the statement contained one most serious error, highly prejudicial to the accused. It also contained a statement that the accused had once been arrested for fighting and that he had paid the costs. The clerk who drew up the statement was not produced as a witness and no adequate explanation for his absence was given. Other witnesses who were present during the interrogation were not produced. Apart altogether from any question touching the voluntariness of the statement, this Court took the view that\nthe evidence points to the conclusion that, although the document was read over to him before he signed it, it is not a correct statement of what the accused said and intended to say.\nWe also considered that a document professing to embody the effect of admissions obtained in the way the admissions were obtained in that case, and containing inter alia a record of an admission of a fact that would be inadmissible as evidence against the accused and was calculated to prejudice him, ought not to be admitted as evidence against him.\nThe judgment in that case does not lay down that where a document contains the record of a declaration by an accused which, it is established to the satisfaction of the trial judge, was a voluntary statement in the pertinent sense, the whole declaration must necessarily be excluded because it contains a statement of some irrelevant fact. If the declaration was obtained in circumstances and in a manner which make it otherwise unobjectionable, and if the statement of the irrelevant fact can be separated from the rest of the document without in any way affecting the tenor of it, then the trial judge in most cases would probably be able to effect the exclusion of the objectionable statement while permitting the unobjectionable part of the document to go before the jury. To this course in such circumstances there could be no objection.\nSubject to what has just been said, we are in agreement with the judgment of Mellish J. in Rex v. Sampson[4].\nOf course, where a written declaration by an accused contains statements of facts prejudicial to the accused and not relevant to the issue, the trial judge may find it necessary to scrutinize with exceptional care the circumstances in which the declaration has been obtained.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] [1943] 2 W.W.R. 449; [1943] 3 D.L.R. 584.\n[2] Thiffault v.

Drolet (Defendant) Respondent.\n1943: November 1, 2; 1944: February 1.\nPresent: Rinfret, Davis, Kerwin, Taschereau and Rand JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nNegligence\u2014Elevator\u2014Sudden fall from upper floor\u2014Injury to passengers \u2014Damages paid by insurer of owner\u2014Claim by insurer, under subrogation, against contractor who installed elevator\u2014Liability resulting from offence or quasi-offence\u2014Probable failure of safety blocks\u2014Blocks made of cast iron\u2014Expert evidence such material used at time of construction\u2014Whether forged steel should have been employed\u2014Quaere as to liability of owner of building\u2014Certificate of inspection-Statement therein that elevator was in good order\u2014Duties of inspector \u2014Failure to mention kind of material of safety blocks\u2014Whether in certain cases certificate should mention improvements since date of construction.\nOn February 24, 1938, one of the elevators in use in the H\u00f4pital du St-Sacrement, at Quebec, fell from the second floor of the building to the bottom of the elevator pit, causing injuries to a number of passengers. Under the terms of its insurance policy with the hospital, the appellant company made a settlement of the claims filed by the injured persons, and disbursed a total sum of $7,453.48 which included the costs of repairs to the elevator, for which sum the appellant took subrogation from its assured and the injured persons. The appellant company then brought an action to recover that amount against both the general contractor for the building of the hospital and the present company respondent, which under a sub-contract had built and installed in 1926 the elevator; but the appellant company proceeded only against the latter. As there could not be any contractual fault of the respondent, the action had to proceed on the basis of its delictual or quasi-delictual responsibility, and the burden of proof was on the appellant. The precise cause of the failure of the elevator, the cause of its fall, has not been clearly demonstrated; but the injuries to its passengers were probably brought about by the failure of the brake appliance consisting of safety blocks, with which the elevator was equipped, to arrest the descent of the elevator and their rupture in the emergency which arose at the time of its fall. The main ground raised by the appellant was that the respondent furnished safety blocks made of cast iron, alleged to be a defective material and too weak to stand a violent shock, while such appliances should, in accordance with good practice, have been fabricated of cast or forged steel, thus effecting more security. The other ground of appeal was that, for many years, periodical inspections of the equipment were made by the respondent company, and, on the very day of the accident, an inspection had been made by an employee of the respondent and, as in previous occasions, a certificate was given to the appellant company attesting that the elevator was in good order. The trial judge maintained the appellants' action, but the appellate court reversed that judgment, holding that the evidence of the expert witnesses, as to the propriety or impropriety of using cast iron at the time the elevator was constructed from the point of view of safety, was contradictory and conflicting and permitted of no definite conclusion upon the point.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (Q.R. [1943] K.B. 511), that, under the circumstances of this case, the respondent company was not liable. The result from the evidence of the expert witnesses, although somewhat contradictory, is to the effect that, at the time the elevator was built and installed, safety blocks of either cast iron or forged steel were used by experienced and competent contractors and were both giving entire satisfaction. So, at that time, the respondent company was at liberty to choose between two methods of construction then usually employed by leading men of art, more so for an elevator as the one in this case, and there has been neither imprudence nor negligence on the part of the respondent company to have adopted one of these methods rather than the other, i.e. to have given preference to cast iron safety blocks.\nQuaere whether, if the action for damages had been brought against the hospital, owner of the building, the same conclusion would have been arrived at when determining the liability of the hospital, i.e. whether the hospital, as owner of the elevator, may be held to be bound to modify its construction along with the modern improvements made from time to time for the safety of the users of the elevator.\nHeld, further, that the respondent company was not liable on the ground that the certificate of inspection ought to have contained a statement that the safety blocks were of cast iron or did not mention improvements made since the construction of the elevator. The duties of the inspector were to verify, as a prudent man would do, the condition of the elevator and to report any defects which may imperil the safety of the passengers. Under the circumstances of this case, to ask more from the inspector and to exact from him more than a reasonable competency and the care of a prudent man, would be tantamount to constitute him a warrantor or a re-insurer of the appellant company. Rand J. dubitante.\nPer Rand J.: The inspection and certification may, under certain circumstances, extend to features of construction, and the inspection is not necessarily that of the machine or thing as it is merely. The scope of the duty of an inspector is one which, in the absence of express terms, is to be gathered from the circumstances of its being undertaken; but quaere, whether, in the ordinary case, an inspection should not require disclosure of a defect in design or material which was or should have been apparent to the inspector and which, since construction, experience has shown to be hazardous, and general and approved practice has condemned.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Verret J., and dismissing the appellant company's action.

L'appelante, assureur de l'h\u00f4pital, paya aux victimes les dommages soufferts, obtint des re\u00e7us avec subrogation contre les personnes qu'elle croyait responsables de l\u2019accident, et institua la pr\u00e9sente action contre C. Emile Morissette Lt\u00e9e et F. X. Drolet Lt\u00e9e.\nLa premi\u00e8re de ces deux compagnies avait obtenu le contrat pour la construction de l'h\u00f4pital, en 1925, mais confia \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e le soin d'installer les ascenseurs, et en particulier celui qui fait l'objet de ce litige. L'appelante proc\u00e9da seulement contre l'intim\u00e9e, et la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a accueilli son action, mais la cour d'appel l'a unanimement rejet\u00e9e.\nLes causes qui ont d\u00e9termin\u00e9 cet accident ne sont pas clairement expliqu\u00e9es. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que cet ascenseur \u00e9tait retenu \u00e0 la partie sup\u00e9rieure du puits par un c\u00e2ble qui s'enroulait sur un cylindre, o\u00f9 \u00e9taient pratiqu\u00e9es des cavit\u00e9es destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir tout glissement. Une hypoth\u00e8se est \u00e0 l'effet que, par suite de l'usure de ces cavit\u00e9s, le c\u00e2ble a gliss\u00e9, permettant ainsi la chute de l'ascenseur.\nMais ce n'est pas pour cette raison que l'appelante pr\u00e9tend que la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e est engag\u00e9e. De chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'ascenseur, se trouvaient des freins, appel\u00e9s \"blocs ds s\u00e9curit\u00e9\" destin\u00e9s \u00e0 l'immobiliser dans le puits, au cas de bris ou de d\u00e9faut de m\u00e9canisme. Or, ce sont ces appareils qui dans l'occurrence se sont cass\u00e9s parce qu'ils auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 d'un mat\u00e9riel d\u00e9fectueux, trop faible pour supporter un choc de cette violence. C'\u00e9tait de la fonte qu'on avait employ\u00e9e; on pr\u00e9tend que l'acier e\u00fbt offert plus de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. C'est la position prise par l'appelante dans son plaidoyer.\nCette action, dirig\u00e9e contre le constructeur, repose en premier lieu sur l'article 1053 C.C. (Nous verrons plus tard le second motif invoqu\u00e9 par l'appelante.)\nIl n'y a aucune relation contractuelle entre les parties qui sont devant cette Cour, et pour que la responsabilit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9fenderesse soit engag\u00e9e, il est donc n\u00e9cessaire qu'elle se soit rendue coupable d'un d\u00e9lit ou d'un quasi-d\u00e9lit. Il faut trouver dans sa conduite l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur de la responsabilit\u00e9, la faute, que l'appelante a indiscutablement le fardeau de prouver. Le simple fait dommageable du bris ne peut engendrer la faute; il faut aussi un fait fautif, et ce fait n'aura ce caract\u00e8re que s'il est le r\u00e9sultat de l'imprudence, de la n\u00e9gligence, ou de l'inhabilet\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e.\nL'appelante l'a bien compris. Aussi, a-t-elle tent\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir cette faute, et de d\u00e9montrer par des gens du m\u00e9tier que la fonte est un m\u00e9tal cassant, moins apte que l'acier \u00e0 r\u00e9sister \u00e0 la violence d'un choc.\nComme dans la plupart des causes de cette nature, la preuve est contradictoire, mais il ressort cependant des t\u00e9moignages que si certains manufacturiers ont employ\u00e9 l'acier dans la fabrication de ces blocs, d'autres non moins exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s, \u00e9taient satisfaits de la fonte, qui d'apr\u00e8s eux, donnait enti\u00e8re satisfaction. C'est ce que nous disent plusieurs t\u00e9moins dont Arthur Langevin, qui a une exp\u00e9rience de 33 ans dans l'installation des ascenseurs, et qui sur ce point est corrobor\u00e9 par Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick N\u00f6el Jodry, Louis Leclerc, etc. D'autres t\u00e9moins \u00e9mettent l'opinion que malgr\u00e9 que la r\u00e9sistance de la fonte soit moindre que celle de l'acier, cette d\u00e9ficience est compens\u00e9e par le fait que les blocs de fonte sont plus lourds et plus gros que les autres.\nQuoi qu'il en soit, il semble, maintenant que les ascenseurs modernes dans les grands \u00e9difices atteignent une vitesse de pr\u00e8s de 1,000 pieds \u00e0 la minute, que l'acier plus r\u00e9sistant est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable \u00e0 la fonte, et qu'il a des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s que l'autre n'a pas. Mais il est \u00e9galement vrai qu'en 1925, \u00e9poque de l'installation, la fonte \u00e9tait employ\u00e9e par des constructeurs r\u00e9put\u00e9s, dans une substantielle proportion des cas. L'ascenseur qui est tomb\u00e9, a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit il y a au-del\u00e0 de 15 ans, et sa vitesse maxima ne devait \u00eatre que 120 pieds \u00e0 la minute. A cette date, l'intim\u00e9e avait donc \u00e0 choisir entre deux m\u00e9thodes habituellement employ\u00e9es par les hommes de l'art, particuli\u00e8rement pour les ascenseurs de ce genre. Est-ce une imprudence ou une n\u00e9gligence d'avoir adopt\u00e9 l'une de ces m\u00e9thodes plut\u00f4t que l'autre, d'avoir pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 la fonte \u00e0 l'acier? Je ne le crois pas.\nLa r\u00e9gie sur ce point est bien connue. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 affirm\u00e9e maintes fois par les tribunaux de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et r\u00e9sum\u00e9e r\u00e9cemment par la cour d'appel, dans la cause de Bouillon v. Poir\u00e9[2]. C'est que le praticien ou le manufacturier n'est pas tenu d'employer exclusivement le moyen ou l'instrument qui est r\u00e9put\u00e9 le meilleur, mais qu'il peut employer le moyen, le mat\u00e9riel ou l'instrument couramment employ\u00e9 dans des conditions identiques. Et, ajoute M. le juge Dorion:\nDans ces mati\u00e8res o\u00f9 le progr\u00e8s de la science est constant, et produit des changements qui ne triomphent d\u00e9finitivement qu'apr\u00e8s de longues ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rimentation, il n'y a rien d'absolu, et tout se r\u00e9duit aux r\u00e9gies de la prudence ordinaire.\nLe Conseil Priv\u00e9 a aussi pos\u00e9 la m\u00eame r\u00e9gie dans une cause o\u00f9 se pr\u00e9sentait \u00e9galement une question de responsabilit\u00e9, et o\u00f9 l'on voit, dans le cas qui nous occupe, la similitude des principes du droit commun et du code civil. (Vancouver General Hospital v. McDaniel et al.[3].) Parlant pour le comit\u00e9 judiciaire, Lord Alness s'exprime ainsi:\nA defendant charged with negligence can clear his feet, if he shows that he has acted in accord with general and approved practice.\n(Voir aussi Higgins v. Comox Logging and Railway Co.[4].)\nIl est certain que ce qui n'\u00e9tait pas une faute autrefois peut le devenir aujourd'hui, maintenant que l'homme d\u00e9couvre des moyens nouveaux qu'il met \u00e0 la disposition de ses semblables. Certaines m\u00e9thodes employ\u00e9es dans le pass\u00e9 par nos devanciers nous paraissent d\u00e9su\u00e8tes, et les d\u00e9couvertes \u00e0 venir, en nous d\u00e9voilant de nouvelles notions scientifiques, modifieront forc\u00e9ment plusieurs de nos conceptions actuelles. Ainsi, nous pouvons maintenant au moyen d'appareils pr\u00e9cis soumettre les m\u00e9taux \u00e0 de hautes pressions pour \u00e9prouver leur r\u00e9sistibilit\u00e9, et il nous est m\u00eame permis, \u00e0 l'aide des rayons-X, de scruter l'int\u00e9rieur de la mati\u00e8re pour en d\u00e9celer les faiblesses et pr\u00e9venir les catastrophes. Autrefois, on ignorait ces m\u00e9thodes modernes, et en se servant des moyens et mat\u00e9riaux connus et employ\u00e9s dans le temps, on ne commettait certes pas une n\u00e9gligence.\nCette conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j'arrive pourrait peut-\u00eatre \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e s'il s'agissait de d\u00e9terminer la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'h\u00f4pital. Nous pourrions nous demander alors jusqu'\u00e0 quel point le propri\u00e9taire est tenu de munir son ascenseur des perfectionnements modernes de nature \u00e0 assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de ceux qui l'emploient. Mais nous n'avons pas \u00e0 juger ici la cause de l'h\u00f4pital. C'est contre le constructeur que l'action est dirig\u00e9e par des tiers, \u00e0 qui il incombe de prouver la faute, et celle-ci ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie que par la preuve de n\u00e9gligence au moment de la construction et de l'installation. Je crois que cette n\u00e9gligence n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, que l'intim\u00e9e a agi avec prudence, comme tout homme raisonnable aurait agi en employant dans le temps, un mat\u00e9riel habituellement employ\u00e9 dans des cas identiques, et qu'il ne pouvait pas raisonnablement pr\u00e9voir ce qui est arriv\u00e9.\nL'appelante base \u00e9galement sa r\u00e9clamation sur le fait que depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, l'intim\u00e9e, pour la somme de $1.50, lui fournissait p\u00e9riodiquement un certificat d'inspection attestant que l'ascenseur \u00e9tait en bonne condition. Le jour m\u00eame de l'accident, l'inspection avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par Arthur Tardif, employ\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e, et comme pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, il avait donn\u00e9 un certificat \u00e0 l'effet que ledit ascenseur n'avait rien de d\u00e9fectueux. Il est vrai que ce certificat n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident, mais il \u00e9tait semblable aux autres donn\u00e9s ant\u00e9rieurement, et il y a lieu de pr\u00e9sumer qu'ils sont l\u00e9galement devant la cour.\nDans sa d\u00e9claration, l'appelante all\u00e8gue que la cause de l'accident est l'usure des cavit\u00e9s qui a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 le glissement des c\u00e2bles Tardif explique qu'il a v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 si oui ou non il y avait un tel glissement, et il indique m\u00eame la m\u00e9thode employ\u00e9e pour faire cette constatation. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'au moment de l'inspection, le c\u00e2ble ne glissait pas sur le cylindre; et d'ailleurs, il n'est nullement prouv\u00e9 que ce soit l\u00e0 la cause premi\u00e8re de cet accident qui demeure dans le domaine des conjectures.\nCependant, dans son factum, l'appelante pr\u00e9tend que Tardif aurait d\u00fb lui signaler dans ses certificats que les \"blocs de s\u00e9curit\u00e9\" \u00e9taient en fonte au lieu d'\u00eatre en acier. Je ne puis partager cette pr\u00e9tention. L'inspecteur Tardif n'avait pas d'autre obligation que de v\u00e9rifier, en homme prudent, l'\u00e9tat de l'ascenseur, son m\u00e9canisme, son fonctionnement et de rapporter les d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9s qu'il pourrait y rencontrer et de nature \u00e0 mettre en p\u00e9ril la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des passagers. Dans les circonstances de cette cause, demander davantage \u00e0 cet inspecteur, et exiger de lui plus qu'une habilet\u00e9 raisonnable et l'attention d'un homme prudent dans l'exercice de ses devoirs, serait faire de lui un garant ou un r\u00e9assureur de l'appelante. Je ne crois pas que le d\u00e9faut de signaler les am\u00e9liorations ou les d\u00e9couvertes des hommes de l'art, incorpor\u00e9es aux ascenseurs plus modernes, soit de nature \u00e0 engager sa responsabilit\u00e9 ou celle de son employeur. C'est l'ascenseur tel que construit que Tardif devait inspecter.\nJe crois donc que ce second motif invoqu\u00e9 par l'appelante n'est pas fond\u00e9, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence le pr\u00e9sent appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nDavis J.\u2014On February 24th, 1938, at about 9.30 p.m., one of the elevators in use in the hospital called \"H\u00f4pital du St. Sacrement\" in the city of Quebec, while carrying eleven passengers therein, fell from the second floor of the building to the bottom of the elevator pit, causing injuries to the passengers. The appellant, an insurance company, seeks to recover from the respondent, a manufacturer, the amount of damages sustained as a result of the accident. Without delaying to refer to the appellant's status as plaintiff and the somewhat unusual form of the action and several difficult subsidiary questions of law raised in the action and argued before us, one question is fundamental to the whole action, as will appear from a short recital of the facts.\nThe accident occurred, as stated, in 1938. The hospital had been built in 1924 and 1925 under a contract signed in August, 1924. There were to be four elevators in the hospital and the general contractor gave a sub-contract for the elevators to the respondent, the Drolet company, which company as sub-contractor built and installed the four elevators during the year 1925. There was no direct contract between the hospital and the sub-contractor. The elevators were examined and tested by the hospital authorities at the time of their installation and were in operation for about a year before they were finally accepted These elevators were operated without interruption and satisfactorily from about the time of their installation until the day of the accident\u2014a period of some twelve or thirteen years.\nThis action seeks to hold the sub-contractor, the Drolet Company, responsible financially for the personal injuries suffered and expenses incurred by the passengers who were injured and for the expenses of the hospital itself for repairs to the elevator. The total sum sued for is $7,453.48. Judgment was awarded the appellant for this sum by the Superior Court of Quebec but was unanimously reversed on appeal and the action dismissed by the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side).\nNo proof is given of the cause of the sudden collapse of the elevator. All that appears to be known is that visitors in the hospital who were about to leave at the hour of the accident on the evening in question, had entered the elevator to descend from the second to the first floor when, all of a sudden, the cage fell to the bottom of the pit. The elevator was what is known as a two-system operating elevator. It could be operated, as it appears to have been, in the daytime by an employee of the hospital, and in the evenings and at off hours the passengers themselves could operate it automatically by pressing a button, a self-serving device.\nAll elevators appear to have some brake appliance to catch and hold the cage if it should fall beyond the control of the person at the time in charge. The common form of brake appliance appears to be safety blocks such as were installed with this elevator. These safety blocks, however, never come into play, are not called upon to perform their function, unless and until the elevator in some way gets out of control. It is suggested that one thing that may happen at times is that the cables which pass over wheels at the roof of the building or at the top of the elevator machinery get out of position and throw the cage of the elevator out of alignment. One may be a little surprised to learn that for the twelve or thirteen years this elevator was continually used, and at times by strangers attempting to work it themselves without the presence of an elevator man, nothing should have happened until the evening of the accident in question. As I have already said, there is really no explanation of what caused the elevator to drop that evening; but it did. The dropping of the elevator brought into play, then, what are known as the safety blocks as a brake appliance. They appear to work automatically if and when the elevator gets out of control. On this occasion they failed to work effectively because they broke and did not operate to catch and hold the falling cage.\nI should have thought that eleven passengers in the elevator at the time might have put an unnecessary strain upon its equipment, but that point, like several others which appeared to me to be of some importance, was not advanced. It seems to be admitted that the estimated weight of the eleven passengers was within the capacity of the elevator. At any rate the safety blocks broke and undoubtedly the injuries to the passengers were directly attributable to the fall of the elevator due to the failure of the brake appliance to work. I should have mentioned that wherever the safety blocks are located there are two of them opposite each other. I presume that if one broke, the strain on the other would break that other also; in this case at any rate both of them broke. In the very nature of things it does not appear to be known how often, if at all, the elevator had momentarily got out of control and been held by these safety blocks. It has been assumed that it never happened before.\nIt seems to me to be a far cry to call upon the subcontractor who manufactured and installed this elevator in 1925 to make good all the damages sustained by the passengers as well as by the hospital itself. It is admitted by counsel for the appellant that the action lies solely within article 1053 of the civil code. That means that fault must be established against the defendant\u2014a fault that caused the accident and to which the damages are directly attributable.\nWhat then is the fault set up against the defendant? Based on the theory that if the safety blocks had been made out of cast steel instead of out of cast iron they would have stood the strain and the accident would not have happened, it is contended that the defendant was at fault in 1925 when it manufactured and installed this elevator with safety blocks made out of cast iron instead of out of cast steel. It is said that because cast iron is more brittle and breaks more easily than cast steel which has greater strength and elasticity, cast steel is the proper material for use in the safety blocks. That theory, until recently at any rate, has not become an established practice. In the development of the art of the manufacture of elevators the evidence shows, I think, that by 1938 it had become pretty fairly agreed in the Canadian trade by engineers and experts in the business that cast steel should be used rather than cast iron in at least high-speed elevators, which have a speed of from 600 to 900 feet per minute; this elevator was low speed, not exceeding 120 feet per minute. But that does not establish fault back in 1925. In fact the evidence shows that some manufacturers are still using cast iron instead of cast steel and that at the time of the manufacture and installation of this particular elevator it was quite common practice in Canada to make the safety blocks of cast iron. Apart from other difficulties which arise in seeking to hold the manufacturer liable for an alleged imperfection in an article it manufactured and installed twelve or thirteen years ago and which meantime has been out of his control and has been in daily and continuous use by all sorts of people, the fundamental fact on the evidence is, as I see it, that proof of actionable fault on the part of the respondent has not been made out in this case. The safety blocks had been made according to the rules of the art and with material which at the time was generally accepted in Canada as sufficient. If that is the correct view, then all the other matters which were debated and argued before us at considerable length and which raised many difficult questions of law, such as assignment of claims, subrogation, prescription, sufficiency of proof of damages, etc., fail to arise for consideration.\nThe Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) dismissed the action with costs and I should dismiss with costs this appeal from that judgment.\nRand J.\u2014With some doubt, I concur in dismissing the appeal.\nI desire to reserve my opinion, however, upon the view that the inspection and certification could, under no circumstances, extend to features of construction. I am not satisfied that the inspection is necessarily that of the machine or thing as it is merely. The scope of the duty is one which, in the absence of express terms, is to be gathered from the circumstances of its being undertaken but that, in the ordinary case, it could not require disclosure of a defect in design or material which is or should be apparent to the inspector and which, since construction, experience has shown to be hazardous, and general and approved practice has condemned, is a proposition from which I must withhold assent.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Demers & Desjardins.\nSolicitors for the respondent: St-Laurent, Gagn\u00e9 & Taschereau.\n[1] Q.R.

The Minister of National Revenue, [1944] S.C.R. 92\nDate: 1944-02-01.\nHighwood-Sarcee Oils Limited Appellant;\nand\nThe Minister of National Revenue Respondent\n1943: October 13, 14; 1944: February 1.\nPresent: Rinfret, Davis, Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nIncome Tax\u2014Income War Tax Act (Dom.)\u2014Computing amount to be assessed\u2014Deductions claimed for losses\u2014Nature of business carried on\u2014Capital losses\u2014Whether investments were of fixed or circulating capital.\nAppellant claimed that in computing the amount of its assessment for income tax under the Dominion Income War Tax Act certain losses which it suffered should have been allowed as deductions; that in the taxation year in question and previously it was carrying on the business of financing other concerns engaged in or interested in the development of prospective oil properties and in trading and dealing in oil lands, leases, oil stocks, etc., and in the taxation year in question it was not in receipt of income within the meaning of said Act but made a loss. Respondent claimed that appellant's business in respect of which it claimed the deductions was the development of oil or gas properties by the investment of its capital for said purpose, and for its benefit of a share in the production of such properties as gains or profits to it from such outlay of capital, and that no deduction could be allowed for such investments or outlay by virtue of s. 6 (1) (b) of the Act.\nHeld (affirming judgment of Maclean J., [1942] Ex.C.R. 56): The deductions claimed for by appellant should not be allowed.\nPer Rinfret, Davis, Hudson and Taschereau JJ.: On the evidence it could not be said that appellant carried on the business of buying and selling oil shares or oil properties; it acquired shares and properties but there was no record of its having sold any; the only reasonable inference from the method of conducting its business was that its purpose was to acquire oil properties and hold them with the hope that ultimately they might become producing wells, as was the case in the particular enterprise which resulted in profits; its real business was aptly described as \"oil operators\"; its moneys invested in oil shares and its loans made were in their nature capital investments; and were investments in the nature of fixed, and not of circulating, capital.\nPer Kerwin J.: On the facts, what appellant sought to deduct from its admitted income was a loss of capital, and that was prohibited by s. 6 (1) (b) of the Act.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Maclean J., late President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing the appellant's appeal from the decision of the Minister of National Revenue affirming an assessment of the appellant for income tax under the Income War Tax Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, and amendments) in respect of the appellant's fiscal year ended June 30, 1935, and disallowing as deductions certain losses which the appellant claimed it was entitled to set off against profits. The appellant claimed that in the taxation year in question and in previous years it was carrying on the business of financing other concerns engaged in or interested in the development of prospective oil properties and in trading and dealing in oil lands, leases, oil stocks, and other properties and securities, and that in the taxation year in question it was not in receipt of income within the meaning of the said Act, but on the contrary made a loss in the said taxation period; that it had been assessed on the basis which had been applied to the taxation of companies engaged in the development of prospective oil properties and that said basis of assessment was not applicable to the business which it had carried on. The respondent claimed that the business of the appellant in respect of which it claimed the deductions was the development of oil or gas properties by the investment of its capital for the said purpose, and for the benefit of the appellant of a share in the production of such properties as gains or profit to the appellant from such outlay of capital, and no deduction could be allowed for such investments or outlay by virtue of s. 6 (1) (b) of said Act; that the basis of assessment on which the appellant had been assessed for income tax purposes for the said taxation period was the basis applicable to the business carried on by the appellant, according to its income tax return.\nH. S. Patterson K.C. for the appellant.\nR. Forsyth K.C. and A. A. McGrory for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Davis, Hudson and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nHudson J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the late President of the Exchequer Court[2], which dismissed with costs an appeal by the appellant against its assessment for income tax for the taxation year 1935.\nThe appellant filed a return for the period in question showing a net loss, but the Minister adjusted the income and declared that the appellant had taxable income of $30,254.94 for the period in question. This amount was arrived at after making certain customary allowances and disallowing a sum of $74,011.28, the amount of investments written off by the appellant's return. The decision of the Minister was that the\ninvestments in shares of and advances to other companies and persons were not expenditures of the taxpayer wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning its income, but were in fact capital in their nature, specifically disallowed for income tax purposes under the provisions of section 6 of the Act.\nThe appellant company was incorporated by letters patent and given a wide range of powers, only two of which need be referred to. They are:\n(a) 1. To search for and recover and win from the earth petroleum, natural gas, oil, salt, metals, minerals and mineral substances of all kinds, and to that end to explore, prospect, mine, quarry, bore, sink wells, construct works or otherwise proceed as may be necessary to produce, manufacture, purchase, acquire, refine, smelt, store, distribute, sell, dispose of and deal in petroleum, natural gas, oil, salt, chemicals, * * *\n(k) To purchase, underwrite, guarantee the principal and interest of, subscribe for and otherwise acquire and hold and vote upon the shares, debentures, debenture stock, * *. * of any company * * *\nThe appellant, by its income tax return, stated the nature of its business to be that of \"oil operators\".\nThe transactions giving rise to the profit were as stated by the learned President:\nOn July 20, 1933, a written agreement was entered into between T. O. Renner, S. J. Davies and C. H. Snyder, therein called \"the (1) [1942] Ex. C.R. 56; [1942] 3 D.L.R. 38. Operators\", of the one part, and the appellant company, therein called \"the Company\", of the other part. This agreement may be summarized by saying that the Company made available to the Operators, upon terms and conditions, $60,000 for the purpose of drilling a well on a lease which the Operators had secured from the trustee of a bankrupt. The Company was to be paid back the said $60,000 out of production and to receive a 65 per cent. interest in the well, its production and equipment. There are clauses in the agreement providing for the payment of prior charges, the termination of the agreement, and so on, but these provisions are unimportant. It is to be noted, however, that the Operators were to assign to the Company an undivided 65 per cent. interest in the lease. This venture proved successful and a producing well resulted which became known as Highwood-Sarcee Well No. 1. The lease also provided for participation by the Operators and the Company in drilling further wells if desired.\nOn these facts the learned President held that the profit arising on this transaction was income.\nThe transactions giving rise to losses which the appellant claims the right to set off appeared in the balance sheet of the company as of June 30, 1935, as follows:\nInvestments and Advances written off\u2014\nPine Hill Petroleums Limited . . . . . . . . . . .\n$56,511.28\nWestern Alberta Oils Limited . . . . . . . . . . .\n15,000.00\nSheldon Burden of Canada Limited . . . . . .\n2,500.00\n74,011.28\nThese transactions arose out of the purchase of shares in two other companies engaged in oil development and in loans to these companies or to persons connected with their operations. They were held by the learned President to be in the nature of capital investment and, for that reason, the claim to set off these losses was disallowed.\nIt appears from the evidence that the appellant did not carry on the business of buying and selling oil shares or oil properties. They acquired shares and properties but there is no record of their having sold any. The only reasonable inference from the method of conducting their business was that their purpose was to acquire these properties and to hold them with the hope that ultimately they might become producing wells, as was done by them in the case of the particular enterprise which resulted in profits. The real business of the company is, I think, aptly described in their return as \"oil operators\".\nThe argument pressed most strongly by Mr. Patterson is that the transactions in the case of the losses were essentially of the same character as those in the profitable transactions and that if the profits were taxable in the one, losses in the others might properly be set off. He contended that the activities of the company were analogous to those of an insurance company which did marine, fire and life insurance and lost in one branch and made profits in the other, and it was held that the business of all should be read as one for the purpose of ascertaining taxable income.\nIt could not, I think, on the facts be successfully contended that the moneys invested in these shares and the loans made were not in their nature capital investments, and the only point that has caused me some difficulty is whether or not this capital investment could be considered as in the nature of circulating capital and not fixed.\nThe illustrations are those of manufacturers having purchased raw material and of merchants trading in goods which they got for resale, or loans made by a brewery company to its customers. In each of these cases capital moneys are used and yet losses were allowed\nIn the present case the shares were not acquired to be turned over like a merchant's stock of goods, but to be held with a view of future profit from development. The loans were not made for the purpose of furthering the day to day business of the company. For these reasons, I think the investments were in their nature of fixed and not of circulating capital.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nKerwin J.\u2014On the facts of this case, what the appellant seeks to deduct from its admitted income is a loss of capital. That is prohibited by the provisions of section 6 (b) of the Income War Tax Act. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Patterson, Hobbs & Patterson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. S. Fisher.\n[1] [1942] Ex.

A barricade was erected on the spur track so that no railway operations thereon could extend to the track where the school car rested. For about two months before the accident in question a line of box cars had been on the spur track, with a gap of 1\u00bd or 2 feet between the two cars thereof nearest the school car, the nearer of said two cars being about 90 or 94 feet from the steps of the school car. A school girl, 12 years old, who, with some companions, had left the school earlier than usual (as examinations were being held), went from the school along a certain used way beside the spur track but left the way and proceeded to go through the said gap and was crushed by the coupling of the cars by a switching engine operating at the farther end of the line of cars, and died from her injuries. The children had no warning of movement of the cars. Defendant's employees did not know that children were outside the school and near the train. There were facts in evidence, discussed in the judgments, as to previous warnings to children with regard to the railway tracks and cars, as to ways used or available for going borne from school, as to distances and directions, and other circumstances.\nDefendant was sued for damages. The trial Judge, on motion for nonsuit, held that the girl was a trespasser in entering said gap, took the case from the jury and dismissed the action. The Court of Appeal for Manitoba, 51 Man. R. 33, ordered a new trial. Defendant appealed.\nHeld (Kerwin and Rand JJ. dissenting): Defendant's appeal from the order for a new trial should be dismissed. On the evidence, there were questions which should have been submitted to the jury.\nDiscussion as to duty to trespassers, and as to whether the girl should be considered a trespasser under the circumstances.\nPer Davis J.: Whether a person is really a trespasser is a question of fact (Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Barnett, [1911] A.C. 361, at 370) and was for the jury on a proper direction. The jury should have been asked whether on the evidence they thought that defendant knew or should have known of the likelihood of school children being about the cars at the time, and, if the jury thought so, then, was there a neglect of duty to the girl on defendant's part that caused the accident.\nPer Kerwin and Rand JJ., dissenting: The trial Judge was right in taking the case from the jury and dismissing the action, as there was no evidence to submit to the jury upon which they might return a verdict that would justify a judgment against defendant. A finding that the girl was upon the tracks by defendant's permission would have been perverse, there being no evidence to justify it. It was not a case where defendant's employees knew or should be held to have known or expected at the time in question that children were or were likely to be on or about the cars. There was no allurement. On its own property defendant was performing a normal and usual operation. The girl was a trespasser in entering the gap, and, putting defendant's duty towards her as such on the highest ground, it did nothing in breach of such duty. (Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Anderson, [1936] S.C.R. 200, at 203, 208, cited).\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] allowing (Trueman J.A. dissenting) the plaintiff's appeal from the judgment of Donovan J. at trial.\nThe plaintiff's daughter, twelve years of age, was crushed while passing between two box-cars, about 1\u00bd or two feet apart, at the end of a line of box-cars on a spur track of the defendant in its grounds at Darwin station, Manitoba, a flag station on the defendant's railway, and she died from her injuries. While she was passing between the two boxcars as aforesaid the line of cars was moved by a switching engine operating at the farther end of the line of cars. The material facts and circumstances of the case sufficiently appear in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported.\nThe action was brought by the plaintiff, in his own behalf and also as the administrator of the estate and effects of his said daughter, against the defendant for damages.\nThe action was tried before Donovan J. with a jury. On a motion for non-suit, Donovan J. (who held that the child was a trespasser in entering upon the space occupied by the rails and the space in between them) took the case from the jury and dismissed the action. The Court of Appeal set aside the judgment at trial and ordered a new trial (Trueman J.A., dissenting, would have dismissed the appeal). The defendant appealed to this Court.\nH. A. V. Green K.C. and Ian Sinclair for the appellant.\nF. Heap K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nHudson J.\u2014The facts are fully set forth in the judgment of Mr. Justice Robson in the court below and by my brother Davis in his judgment, which I have had an opportunity of reading. I shall say no more than to emphasize a few of these facts which, in my mind, should determine the disposition of this appeal.\nThe children were young. They were bound by law to attend the school. To reach the school car, those whose homes were north of the railway had to cross two main railway tracks and to travel through the railway company's property for several hundred yards. The road through these yards usually travelled by the children in going to and returning from school lay to the south of the side track. For some distance before reaching the school, this roadway was immediately adjacent to the track without any fence or ditch intervening. The two rear cars on the side track with the gap between them had remained in the same position for two months before the accident. It was admitted by the defendant that there was also available a road or way to the north of the side track which the children might take if so minded and, in that event, it would be necessary for them to cross this side track at some point.\nThe whole situation was one which demanded great care on the part of the defendant.\nThere was no negligence in placing the cars on the side track and leaving them there, but the immediate cause of the accident was the movement of these cars. As stated by Lord Justice Scrutton in Mourton v. Poulter[2]:\nThe liability of an owner of land to trespassers does not arise where there is on the land a continuing trap, such as that which was considered in a case in the Supreme Court of the United States of an innocent looking pond which contained poisonous matter: United Zinc and Chemical Co. v. Britt[3]. There, as the land remains in the same state, a trespasser must take it as he finds it, and the owner is not bound to warn him. That, however, is a different case from the case in which a man does something which makes a change in the condition of the land, as where he starts a wheel, fells a tree, or sets off a blast when he knows that people are standing near. In each of these cases he owes a duty to these people even though they are trespassers to take care to give them warning.\nThe gap between the cars here could not be considered a trap while the cars were stationary, but was that so when the cars were put in motion under all of the circumstances here?\nIn a note with reference to the cases of Excelsior Wire Rope Co. v. Callan[4], and Mourton v. Poulter above[5], in 46 L.Q.R. 393, Sir Frederick Pollock says:\nBut the kind and amount of warning called for must, in any case, depend on the circumstances, among which the apparent capacity of endangered persons to take care of themselves may have to be counted.\nThe plaintiff's daughter was not a trespasser when she was on the roadway to the south of and within a foot or two of the spur track, nor would she have been a trespasser on the north side of this track. Must she then be considered as a trespasser when passing from one side to the other under the circumstances here?\nThe effect of the most recent authoritative decisions is fairly stated in Winfield on Torts, 1937 Ed., at page 607: The disposition of children of tender years to mischief has given their elders nearly as much trouble in the law Courts as outside them, and the law about dangerous structures has been modified with respect to them in a way which may be thus formulated:\nAn occupier must take reasonable care to see that children, of whose presence he knows or ought to know or to anticipate and who are too young to appreciate the danger of some attractive object under his control and within his knowledge, are protected against injury from that danger either by warning which is intelligible to them or by some other means.\n***\nThe only respect in which a child differs from an adult is that what is reasonably safe for an adult may not be reasonably safe for a child and what is a warning to an adult may be none to a child.\nAt page 610:\nThe result of [certain cases referred to] is that if a child is a trespasser, he cannot recover unless the danger were put there expressly to injure him or unless the defendant knows that it is extremely likely that he will be exposed to grave danger.\nIn my view, there was evidence here sufficient to warrant a submission of the questions of fact to the jury. For this reason, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDavis J.\u2014The facts of this case are very unusual. Practically all negligence actions turn upon their own facts but this case peculiarly does so. Decisions in other cases on different facts are a very doubtful guide in determining the issue in this appeal.\nThe action arose out of the unfortunate death of a twelve-year-old schoolgirl who was caught between two box cars of the Canadian Pacific Railway when they were being coupled up. The main defence of the railway company is that the child was a trespasser to whom the railway company was under no duty. The trial judge thought the unfortunate child was a trespasser and took the case from the jury and dismissed the action on a motion for non-suit. The Court of Appeal for Manitoba, Trueman J.A. dissenting, ordered a new trial; the railway company appealed to this Court from that order.\nThe facts are simple and are really not in dispute, although exceptional in their character. The Department of Education of the Province of Manitoba acquired, we are not told from whom, a railway passenger car and converted it into a schoolroom. The purpose appears to have been to use this school car in deserted parts of the province as has somewhat recently, I understand, become a practice in the Province of Ontario, of having a school car go from settlement to settlement in the sparsely populated northern sections of the province so as to afford the children of those districts an opportunity to receive some schooling. In this case, whatever the original intention was, the Department of Education decided to leave this particular school car more or less permanently at a definite location, Darwin, there to be used instead of building a schoolhouse. Darwin is a flag station in Manitoba on the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway running between Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Kenora, Ontario. Trains stop at the station only when flagged to do so; it is not a regular stopping place. There is not even what one could call a village at the location; there are a few houses scattered in the vicinity; it is not an agricultural section of the country but there is some cutting and shipping of timber as cordwood or railway ties and the like. An agreement was made between the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, the School District of Darwin Station and the Minister of Education whereby, for a money consideration, this school car was run down the railway spur track (which runs easterly from a connection on the south side of the main line), to be left permanently within the railway company's station grounds at the end of the spur track.\nSome eighteen or twenty children from the neighbourhood appear to have attended school in the railway car. While the doors at one end of the car had been closed up, a door at the other end was left open on the south side of the car for the children to go in and out; children living north of the railway, as the deceased child did, would have to cross both the spur and the main tracks to and from school; there was no fenced-in approach to or exit from the car to or from any public highway. The railway company in its factum admits that \"the school car was situated where it was landlocked by property of the company\". A good deal was said about a cinder path that ran along the south side of the spur track as being a safe and adequate road available to the children, but it could scarcely be called in any sense a roadway. To that improvised school building\u2014the railway car fitted up as a school\u2014the children of the neighbourhood went day by day and at their recess periods had no other place to play than around the car and about the tracks. The most significant fact is that the railway company had left six box cars standing on the same spur track on which the school car was placed. The fifth and sixth cars were standing apart, a distance of a foot and a half or two feet between them. The rear of the sixth car (nearest the school car) was approximately ninety feet from the nearest end of the school car.\nThese box cars had stood there on the spur track near the school car undisturbed, empty and with the doors open, for a period of some two months before the day of the accident, and it would not be unnatural if the school children had come to regard them as fixtures there. There was evidence that the school children played in and around these cars\u2014playing tag, hide-and-seek, and other children's games. One of the children said in evidence that they would hide \"sometimes around the wheels of the box cars and sometimes in the cars\". It is in evidence that on different occasions three different foremen of the railway company (one of them a section foreman) warned the children not to play around the cars, but a jury might well take the view that that sort of warning would be ineffective with a lot of school children. That evidence establishes, however, that the railway company knew of the practice of the school children and of the danger inherent in the situation.\nOn the day of the accident it was not a question of the children playing around the cars. School had been let out a little earlier at the noon hour because they had had some examinations and four of the children were making their way northerly across the tracks in the direction in which their homes lay; and the jury might well have inferred that they were on their way home for their dinner. They proceeded to pass through the open space between the fifth and sixth Ibox cars, but just at the moment that this twelve-year-old girl was going through the gap the cars were suddenly moved by a switching engine up at the front of the six cars and she was caught, in the coupling process, between the fifth and sixth cars and died within a few hours from her injuries. There is no suggestion that there was the slightest warning or notice given that after the cars had stood there for a couple of months they were at that moment to be moved and the two end cars coupled up. With the hindsight of an adult, many explanations were offered us on behalf of the railway company as to how this child could have crossed the tracks without any harm coming to her\u2014of course it is suggested that there were ninety feet between the end of the school car and the end of the sixth car, and the children might have crossed at that point, or they might have walked alongside the spur track till they got to the front of the six cars and then have crossed. Those are all very easy statements to make after an event. They fail however to take into account the element of human nature and offer little assistance to me on the question so strongly advanced and argued on behalf of the railway, that the child was at the moment and place of the accident a trespasser in the strict legal sense of the word, to whom the railway company owed no duty of warning.\nIt is said that the railway did not know the child was there at the time. No one suggests that it did; but if the railway company knew that there was the likelihood of the school children being in or about those box cars, I should have no doubt that there was a duty on the railway to see that children were not then about the cars, and if they were, to warn them of the impending movement of the cars.\nI do not think the case should have been taken from the jury. Whether a person is really a trespasser is a question of fact, as said in the judgment of the Privy Council in Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada v. Barnett[6], and was for the jury on a proper direction. I think the jury should have been asked whether on the evidence they thought the railway company knew or should have known of the likelihood of the school children or some of them being about the box cars at the time and if the jury thought so, then, secondly, was there a neglect of duty on the part of the railway company to the deceased child that caused the accident? The question whether the accident was caused or contributed to by the child's own negligence is, of course, also a question of fact for the jury.\nIt was strenuously contended by counsel for the railway company that knowledge of likelihood is not sufficient in law; that the person charged with neglect must either have seen the child or at least have known that the child was there. With that contention I do not agree. The American Law Institute has done an invaluable work of legal research, particularly in the field of modern tort problems, and those in English common law jurisdictions are under a heavy debt for its Restatement on Torts. Section 334 states the law thus:\n334. A possessor of land who knows, or from facts within his knowledge should know, that trespassers constantly intrude upon a limited area thereof, is subject to liability for bodily harm there caused to them by his failure to carry on an activity involving a risk of death or serious bodily harm with reasonable care for their safety.\nTo much the same effect I take the language of Lord Atkin to be when he said very recently in the House of Lords in East Suffolk Rivers Catchment Board v. Kent[7]:\n* * * every person whether discharging a public duty or not is under a common law obligation to some persons in some circumstances to conduct himself with reasonable care so as not to injure those persons likely to be affected by his want of care.\nI am loath to believe that the law of this country will recognize the position of this school child in the special circumstances as only that of a trespasser in the sense in which that word is strictly and technically used in law, to whom no obligation to take care existed.\nFor the above reasons I think the case should go back to be tried with a jury. That was the order of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba which was appealed from. I should therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Rand JJ., dissenting, was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014My sympathy goes out to the parents of Mary Kislyk, who was killed in the unfortunate occurrence giving rise to these proceedings, but, as Lord Justice Farwell remarked in Latham v. Johnson[8], \"sentiment is a dangerous will-of-the-wisp to take as a guide in the search for legal principles\". On the legal principles applicable, the trial judge was right, in my opinion, in taking the case from the jury and dismissing the action brought by the girl's father. He was right in so doing because there was no evidence to submit to the jury upon which they might return a verdict that would justify a judgment against the Railway Company. To demonstrate this requires a statement of the evidence, including various distances or measurements which, while put in exact figures, will be understood as only approximate.\nBy an agreement of December 28th, 1940, the School District of Darwin Station No. 1950, in the Province of Manitoba, was given permission by the Company to place and maintain a railway school car on the easterly one hundred feet of the Company's spur line at Darwin. Darwin is merely a flag station on the through line of railway between Kenora and Winnipeg. There are two main lines of tracks, the east-bound one being north of the westbound line, and there is a private crossing that runs north and south over both main lines. Ten feet east of the east limit of this crossing is the switch for the spur line, which runs in a general southeasterly direction (including a slight curve) for 760 feet. The spur line is entirely on the Company's property.\nIn pursuance of the agreement, the school car, 64 feet long, was duly placed at the very end of the spur. The only entrance to and exit from it was by means of steps at its west end. Forty-eight feet west of these steps the tracks were narrowed and a barricade of railway ties erected so that no railway operations on the spur line could extend to the tracks on which the school car rested. From the steps, a roadway 10 feet in width ran along the south side of the spur track for some distance and then curved southwesterly and north to meet the road forming the private crossing. This roadway was cindered in places where it adjoined the tracks and could be used by teams, automobiles and foot passengers, except in very wet weather.\nIt was used by people in the vicinity to bring railway ties to be loaded on railway cars placed from time to time for that purpose on the spur line. On the day of the accident, June 24th, 1941, there were six such cars, numbered for convenience from west to east as 1 to 6. The first five were coupled together while between cars 5 and 6 was a gap of two feet. The length of each car may be taken as about 40 feet. The distance from the east end of car 6 to the barrier of railway ties was 46 feet. It was therefore 94 feet from the steps of the school car to the east end of car 6 and 134 feet to the gap between cars 5 and 6. Except that one car had been loaded with ties and taken out, the situation as to these cars had remained the same for approximately two months, including the gap between cars 5 and 6.\nThe roadway was also used by the pupils attending school in the school car. These pupils were mainly, if not entirely, the children of the Company's employees and among them were Mary Kislyk and Joe Moroz, each about twelve years of age. The latter lived about one-quarter of a mile to the west of the private crossing and to the north of the tracks. Mary also lived to the west of the private crossing and north of the tracks but a little east of Joe. There were other pupils whose homes were north of the tracks, sand we know of at least one, Alfred Barclay, who, during the school term, lived with relatives to the south of the Company's right-of-way.\nSchool was held in the car from Christmas, 1940, to the date of the accident. According to Joe Moroz, on the first day of school, the teacher warned the pupils, including Mary Kislyk, to go to and from school along the ten-foot-wide roadway that led from the school car and not any other way, and not to play around any cars that might be on the spur track, and not to get on the spur track or the main line. His father told him not to play on the box cars or on the spur track. On another occasion, when Joe and other children not identified were playing around the cars on the spur track, a section foreman dove them away. Alfred Barclay said that he and other children played hide and seek for a time soon after the school commenced being held in the railway car, going underneath and around the cars. He remembered being warned by the teacher about playing around and on the cars and on the line, and he was warned by two different section foremen not to play near the cars. The area generally used by the children as a playground was to the south, and east of the railway car.\nOn the day of the accident, examinations were being held in the school. Alfred Barclay was the last to arrive that morning. Although school generally commenced at nine o'clock, for some reason he did not come until about eleven. The pupils were dismissed half an hour earlier than usual, i.e., at 11.30. About five minutes before such dismissal, what are described as railway cook cars or boarding cars came in from the east on the south main line track and were left standing on such main line track a little to the west of the school car. Upon school being dismissed, the first pupils to leave were Joe Moroz, Mary Kislyk and two other children. Joe was in the lead and ran along the roadway and then walked through the gap between the fifth and sixth cars. It will be recollected that the distance from the school steps to the gap was only about 134 feet. He then saw an engine backing up on the spur line. He called to Mary not to follow him but his warning came too late and Mary was crushed between the fifth and sixth cars.\nMuch was attempted to be made in argument as to why Joe or any pupil should go through the gap at this particular time. It was suggested that they would be allured by the cook cars which contained several men, and also emphasis was laid upon the fact that across a ditch, between the spur line and the west-bound main line, were laid some poles, and at another spot a single tie, and upon the fact that the grass approaching these poles and tie was trampled down. In truth the evidence as to the grass and the poles and tie over the ditch is that the poles and tie were placed some time before by railway men for their own convenience. There was no path and there is not even a suggestion that Joe Moroz ever attempted to go home that way or that he was considering doing so on the 24th of June. In cross-examination he was asked: \"Q. It was just a mischievous prank to run between the cars?\" to which he answered \"Yes\". The trial judge then intervened when the following occurred:\nQ. The Court: Do you know what that means? Do you know what a mischievous prank is?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. What is it?\u2014A. When you are up to something.\nThe Court: I thought perhaps he didn't understand that.\nThere is no evidence that the Company ever permitted, much less invited, any of the school children, including Mary Kislyk, to play or walk or be upon any of its cars or any of its tracks, including the tracks of the spur line. This being so, and on the evidence referred to, if the jury had been asked as the jury in Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Barnett[9] was asked, if the victim of the accident was upon the tracks by permission of the Company, and had answered Yes, there would be no evidence to justify the answer and the finding would be perverse.\nI agree with the trial judge that Mary was a trespasser in entering upon the space occupied by the rails and the space in between them, and that it is not a case where the Railway employees knew, or should be held at the time in question, 11.30. a.m., to have known or expected that children were, or were likely to be, playing around the stationary cars or on the tracks. There was no allurement and, even if the duty of an occupier of premises to a trespasser may be placed on such a high plane, there was no reason, I repeat, why the employees of the Company should in this case have known or anticipated that it was likely that any school children would be on or about the empty cars on the spur line at 11.30 in the morning.\nThe authorities were exhaustively considered by the Chief Justice of this Court in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Anderson[10]. His remarks, at page 203, are applicable to the present case:\nThey [meaning the Railway Company] are engaged in the execution of statutory powers and are, therefore, under an obligation to take reasonable care not to cause unnecessary harm to those who may be injured by a careless or unreasonable exercise of their rights. But they are under no obligation to intending trespassers to prevent them effectuating a trespass upon their cars, which are a part of the railway; whether they be children or adults. If they permit children to climb upon their cars they may find themselves in the position of tacit licensors and, in consequence, affected by duties towards them as licensees; but nobody suggests (such a suggestion is negatived by the evidence) that the respondent was a licensee.\nThe Anderson case1 was, of course, tried by a judge without the intervention of a jury but in the present case there was no evidence upon which a jury could find that Mary Kislyk was a licensee.\nOn its own property, the Railway Company was performing a normal and usual operation on the spur line track. The following remarks of the Chief Justice at page 208 of the Anderson case1 are, I think, relevant:\nSo long as a person is actually using his vehicle in the ordinary and accustomed way, he is, it would appear, entitled to the enjoyment of it without the curtailment of his rights by trespasses or encroachments of anyone. The fact that the vehicle may present an irresistible allurement to children in the street can make no difference. There is neither negligence nor nuisance in making use in the ordinary way of a vehicle presenting attractions of such a character to infants. If, unfortunately, children of an age too tender to possess the capacity to take care of themselves put themselves in a position of danger by getting into it without the consent of the persons in charge of the vehicle, and without their knowledge, then there arises just one of those risks to which such children, when left unguarded, will unhappily be subject. The person who is making use of a vehicle he employs in the usual way, having committed no wrong, is not chargeable with responsibility for them. Mary Kislyk was a trespasser and the only duty owing to her by the Company was not intentionally to injure her or \"not to do a wilful act in disregard of humanity towards her\" or \"not to act with reckless disregard of the presence of the trespasser\". Even if the duty of an occupier of premises towards a trespasser be put on the highest ground,: the Railway Company did none of these things. The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at the trial restored with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H. A. V.

But right of appeal to these courts was allowed, on certain conditions, by a federal order in council, coming into force on the 7th of June, 1943, from such judgments when rendered on convictions for offences against wartime regulations. Certain regulations were made and established by the order in council, amongst which those material to this appeal read as follows: an appeal shall lie to a provincial court of appeal, by leave of such court, on any ground which involves a question of law or of mixed law and fact; a further appeal from the judgment of the court of appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada by leave of such Court; and it was also regulated that \"sections 1023 to 1025 inclusive of the Criminal Code shall, insofar as the same are not inconsistent with this regulation, apply to any appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada***\".\nHeld: That the effect of the regulations made by the order in council was not to give a right of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from any and all judgments or decisions of a provincial court of appeal, with the sole proviso that leave of the Supreme Court of Canada be given by that Court; but\nHeld: That the result and effect of the regulations were that an appeal only lies to the Supreme Court of Canada, by leave of that Court \"on any questions of law on which there has been a dissent in the court of appeal\" (s. 1023 Cr. C). or \"if the judgment appealed from conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case\" (s. 1025 Cr. C). The provisions contained in these two sections are not in any way inconsistent with the regulations and must be taken into account in any appeal to this Court under the regulations made by the order in council.\nTherefore, applying to the appellant's application for leave to appeal to this Court the regulations so interpreted, the motion should be dismissed: there having been no dissent in the Court below, this Court has no jurisdiction to grant leave, as the applicant has not shown that the judgment to be appealed from, in respect to the main point involved in the appeal, conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case.\nAPPLICATION for leave to appeal to this Court from a decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, allowing the respondent's appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Crown side) and quashing the conviction of the respondent, after speedy trial before the Court of Sessions of the Peace, for having committed infractions of an Order of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board. The Court of King's Bench (Crown side) had quashed the conviction in one out of ten charges, but had affirmed the convictions in the others.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nG\u00e9rard Lacroix K.C., for the application.\nChas. A. Cannon K.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The appellant is an investigator of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board. The respondent, which is a manufacturer of packing boxes, was prosecuted by the appellant, acting on behalf of the Board, before the Court of the Sessions in the city of Quebec for ten alleged infractions of order in council no. 8528, dated the 1st of November, 1941 (and amendments thereto), which deals with maximum or ceiling prices at which manufactured goods may be sold after the 1st day of December, 1941.\nFor the purpose of the present judgment, I do not find it necessary to enter into the particulars of each one of these charges (no. 22171 to no. 22180).\nThe accused was tried under Part XV of the Criminal Code and found guilty of all charges. It appealed to a judge of the Court of King's Bench (Crown Side), who heard the appeals, quashed the conviction in no. 22172, but affirmed the convictions in all the other cases.\nBy order in council no. 4600, which came into force on the 7th of June, 1943, the Minister of Justice having reported\nthat in many of these prosecutions under Part XV aforesaid, questions of law of first rate importance are not infrequently raised relating to the validity and the construction of wartime regulations and it has been represented to him that, in the interest of uniformity of decisions, as well as the true construction of all wartime regulations, further appeals should be allowed to the provincial courts of appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada wherever, in the opinion of the Court to be appealed to, an important question of law or of mixed law and fact is raised, it was deemed necessary or advisable,\nfor the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada that such appeals be provided for.\nCertain regulations were accordingly made and established and those which are material to the present appeal read as follows:\u2014\n2. In any proceedings under Part XV of the Criminal Code for an offence against wartime regulations, an appeal from a judgment of the county or district court judge, or in the province of Quebec, the judge of the Court of King's Bench, Crown Side, on any ground of appeal which involves a question of law or of mixed law and fact shall lie to the court of appeal by leave of such Court.\n3. A further appeal from a judgment or decision of the court of appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada by leave of such Court.\n***\n6. Sections 1023 to 1025 inclusive of the Criminal Code shall, insofar as the same are not inconsistent with this regulation, apply to any appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada taken pursuant to this regulation.\n7. The Attorney General of Canada shall have a right of appeal in any case where the Attorney General of the province in which the offence is alleged to have been committed has such right.\nThe respondent secured from the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) (that Court being the court of appeal for the province of Quebec referred to in the regulations) leave to appeal in the nine cases where the conviction had been affirmed. The appeals were heard by that Court both on questions of law and on questions of mixed law and fact. They were allowed in every one of the cases and the nine convictions were quashed.\nThe appellant then moved for leave to appeal to this court from these judgments of the Court of King's Bench under the provisions of the Order in Council No. 4600.\nIn his notice of motion the appellant alleged that the cases involved questions of public law and of the meaning and real extent of the regulations enacted under the War Measures Act of Canada; and that, amongst other questions, the Court was asked to decide mainly:\u2014\n9. (a) What may constitute a sale during the basic period under regulations enacted pursuant to the War Measures Act of Canada and especially in virtue of order in council no. 8528, as well as orders flowing therefrom;\n(b) If the mens rea, or criminal intent, constitutes a necessary element in offences created by order in council no. 8528, and the orders flowing therefrom;\n(c) Which is the meaning and the extent of the reference to the Canadian Criminal Code in said order in council no. 8528, and the orders made pursuant thereto.\nThe appellant further alleged that the decisions of the courts up till now were not unanimous on these specific points and, moreover, that the judgment rendered in the premises by the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) was in conflict with several other judgments of other courts of appeal in similar cases, while the Supreme Court of Canada had never so far decided these specific points in relation to the interpretation of the regulations and orders enacted pursuant to the War Measures Act of Canada.\nThe petition for leave to appeal, as originally served, did not indicate the judgments of the other courts of appeal alleged to be in conflict with the decision appealed from. As a preliminary objection the respondent, therefore, invoking the judgment in Liebling v. The King[1], argued that the Court should not entertain the application.\nThe appellant, however, had subsequently served an additional notice in which he referred to four different judgments which he alleged to be in conflict with the judgment now appealed from and, as this additional notice was served sometime before the motion came to be heard before the Court., it was thought that this was a sufficient compliance with the rules of the Court and it was decided that the respondent \"should take nothing\" by the objection so made by him.\nAnother objection made by the respondent was that, while both the Court of King's Bench (Crown Side) and the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) had delivered two separate judgments on the matters now before the Court, there was only one notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada and the respondent was entitled to be told from which of the two judgments the appellant intended to appeal to this Court. The appellant, being requested to optate between the two, thereupon declared that he abandoned the appeal from the judgment rendered on the case numbered 22171 and bearing number 3573 in the Court of King's Bench (Crown Side) and thus limited his appeal to the eight other convictions and to the judgment in the appeal bearing number 3574 in the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side).\nTwo questions stand to be decided on the application for leave to appeal. The first one concerns the extent of the right of appeal conferred by the regulations under order in council no. 4600. The other question is whether, under those regulations as they must be interpreted, the appellant has succeeded in making out before this Court a case where leave to appeal ought to be granted to him in the circumstances.\nDealing with the first question. It must be remembered that up till order in council no. 4600 there existed no right of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from judgments rendered on summary conviction under Part XV of the Criminal Code. (Attorney General for Alberta v. Roskiwich[2]; Au Chung Lam alias On Lim v. The King[3]. The object of order in council no. 4600 is, amongst other things, to give a right of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada in proceedings under Part XV of the Criminal Code for an offence against wartime regulations, but such right of appeal is given only under certain conditions and what we have to decide is precisely what those conditions are.\nIt was contended by counsel for the appellant that the effect of the regulations under order in council no. 4600 is to give a right of appeal from any and all judgments or decisions of the court of appeal, with the sole proviso that leave of the Supreme Court of Canada be given by that Court.\nThe respondent, however, questioned such an interpretation of paragraph (3) of the regulations and argued that there was no intention by order in council no. 4600 to change the ordinary conditions under which an appeal could be brought to this Court, except that in these matters leave of the Court itself would be required. As the law stood before, there was a right to appeal de plano \"on any question of law on which there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal\"; and also\nthere was a right of appeal when the judgment intended to be appealed from conflicted with the judgment of any court of appeal in a like case, provided leave to appeal was granted by a Judge of the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThis was under sections 1023 and 1025 of the Criminal Code and, in both instances, it applied only to proceedings in respect of an indictable offence.\nIf we were to accept the appellant's interpretation of the regulations, it would mean that no account should be taken of paragraph (6) which enacts that\nSections 1023 to 1025 inclusive of the Criminal Code shall * * * apply to any appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada taken pursuant to this regulation.\nThis paragraph states that the sections mentioned \"shall apply\" and, therefore, effect must be given to it \"in so far as the same are not inconsistent 'with these regulations\", as stated in the paragraph.\nNow, the only inconsistency with sections 1023 to 1025 of the Criminal Code that we can find in the regulations is the proviso that the appeal lies to the Court only \"by leave of such Court\". Otherwise the provisions contained in sections 1023 to 1025 are not in any way inconsistent with the regulations and, therefore, must be taken into account in any appeal to this Court under these new regulations. This interpretation is further strengthened by the fact that if order in council no. 4600 were not to be construed as just indicated, it would mean that appeals in proceedings upon summary convictions under Part XV of the Criminal Code, which did not exist before the order in council was passed, would, by such order in council, be made wider than appeals in proceedings in respect of indictable offences. That, of course, would lead to absurd consequences.\nMore particularly, having regard to the fact that, by force of section (9) of the order in council no. 8528, the same contravention, or failure, to observe any regulation, or order, constitutes an offence which may be tried either upon summary conviction under Part XV, or, if the Attorney General of Canada or of any province so directs, upon indictment. So that the trial of the same offence, according as upon summary conviction or upon indictment, would thus be made susceptible of an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada under different conditions, and conditions which would be such that the right of appeal in proceedings in respect of indictable offences would be more restricted than in proceedings upon summary conviction.\nIt is only reasonable to believe that the intent of the order in council was to put the appeals in one or the other of these matters upon the same footing, except that on indictable offences, as already provided for by the Criminal Code, no leave is necessary when there has been in the court of appeal a dissent on a question of law, or, where there has been no dissent, a right of appeal lies by leave of a judge of the Court where the judgment conflicts with that of another court of appeal in a like case; and in proceedings on summary conviction under. Part XV of the Criminal Code a new right of appeal is created, where none existed before, and all the usual conditions under sections 1023 to 1025 Cr. C. apply, except that in each case no appeal lies unless the Supreme Court itself grants leave to appeal.\nIn our view, therefore, the effect and result of the regulations under order in council no. 4600, so far as it applies to appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada, are as follows: In proceedings under Part XV of the Criminal Code for offences against wartime regulations an appeal now lies to the Supreme Court of Canada by leave of that Court \"on any questions of law on which there has been dissent in the court of appear (Criminal Code, section 1023), or \"if the judgment appealed from conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case\" (Criminal Code, section 1025).\nApplying to the present application for leave the regulations so interpreted, as there has been no dissent in this case, this Court has jurisdiction to grant leave only if it can be shown that the judgment appealed from conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case.\nThe appellant was able to suggest that such a conflict existed only on two of the questions mentioned in his notice of motion, one being:\nIf the mens rea, or criminal intent, constitutes a necessary element in offences created by order in council no. 8528, and orders flowing therefrom;\nthe other being:\nWhich is the meaning and the extent of the reference to the Canadian Criminal Code made in said order in council no. 8528, and the orders made pursuant thereto.\nPerhaps it should be noted that, after all, this second question is really included in the first question.\nBut the appellant was unable to refer the Court to any judgment of another court of appeal conflicting with the judgment appealed from on the main point involved in the appeal, to wit:\u2014\nWhat may constitute a sale during the basic period under regulations enacted pursuant to the War Measures Act of Canada and especially in virtue of order in council no. 8528, as well as orders flowing therefrom.\nThe latter is really the fundamental point in the proceedings against the respondent.\nThe Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side), held that the proof made by the appellant of the alleged sales by the respondent during the basic period were not sales within the meaning of order in council no. 8528, but merely deliveries of articles covered by contracts of sale within the meaning of the said order entered into long prior to the 15th day of September, 1941. In consequence of that decision, the appellant has failed to establish one of the two essential elements of the offences charged. The appellant, in view of the fact that there has been no dissent and that no conflict is alleged, is unable to ask this Court to reverse the judgment of the court of appeal on this fundamental question, and it means, therefore, that, even assuming there is a conflict on the other points raised in the appeal and even if he should succeed in getting this Court to reverse the judgment of the court of appeal on these other points, the respondent would, nevertheless, remain acquitted. The appeal would be devoid of any possible practical result and the Court would be asked only to pass upon an academic question.\nIn the circumstances the appeal cannot be entertained, leave to appeal should not be granted, and the motion to that effect should be dismissed.\nApplication dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Paul Roy.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Taschereau, Parent & Cannon.\n[1] [1932] S.C.R. 101\n[2] [1932] S.C.R. 570.\n[3] [1944] S.C.R. 136.\n"}

Co., ratified and confirmed by c. 84, statutes of Canada, 1924\u2014Application by City to Board of Transport Commissioners for decrease in fares chargeable by Company\u2014Question whether City had complied with proceedings required before making application\u2014Form of resolution by City Council\u2014Interpretation of agreement, statute\u2014Words of provision, whether imperative, or directory only.\nAn agreement between the City of Ottawa and the Ottawa Electric Ry. Co. (a company incorporated by Act of Parliament of Canada), which agreement was ratified and confirmed by c. 84, statutes of Canada, 1924, provided, inter alia, for application for increase or decrease of fares on a certain part of the Company's railway. Clause 9 (c) of the agreement provided that \"should the revenue to be derived from the operation of [said part of the railway] appear likely to be more than sufficient, in the opinion of the City expressed by resolution, to provide during the five year period next succeeding the five year period then current, for [items specified in clause 9 (a)], then the City may notify the Company in writing, one year before the end of any five year period, that it considers the fares excessive\", and, if no satisfactory adjustment was made within one month, the City might apply to the Board (now the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada) for a decrease in fares.\nThe City Council at a meeting \"received and ad-opted\" a presented report of the City's Board of Control recommending that the City Clerk notify the Company that \"in accordance with clause 9 of the\" said agreement, it was the City's \"intention to apply for a reduction in the current tariff of fares\"; and the City Clerk notified the Company that \"under authority of clause \"c\" of section 9 of the [said agreement], the City Council, at a meeting held * * * passed a resolution and instructed me to notify your company that it considers the present fares excessive and if no satisfactory adjustment is made within one month from * * * it is the intention of the City to apply to the Board of Transport for such a decrease in fares during the next five year period as will allow a revenue not more than sufficient to provide for the items specified in clause \"a\" of section 9 of the said agreement\". Later the City applied to the Board for an order decreasing the fares. The Company contended, by way of preliminary objection, that before giving the notice the City had failed to express by resolution the opinion that the revenue to be derived appeared likely to be more than sufficient to provide during the next five year period in question for said items, as required by the said agreement and statute of 1924, and that therefore the City was not entitled to give the notice or maintain its application to the Board. That question came before this Court, by leave of the Board of Transport Commissioners, on appeal from holdings of the Board.\nHeld (affirming holdings of the Board, 56 C.R.T.C. 317), that the City was entitled to give the notice and to maintain its application.\nPer the Chief Justice and Taschereau J.: The fact that the City Council's resolution, instead of reproducing the exact words of said clause 9 (c), adopted a report which proceeded by way of a reference to the clause itself, did not justify the Company's objection. Whether the terms of the clause be held as being imperative or directory, the condition therein stated in respect of the resolution was sufficiently complied with\u2014indeed more than substantially\u2014and the action taken by the City Council completely satisfied the requirements of the clause. The resolution necessarily imported the City's opinion that the Company's revenues appeared likely to be more than sufficient for the purposes in question, and in effect expressed that opinion. Also, no prejudice could result to the Company on account of the alleged omission in the resolution. Also, it was not to be assumed (nor was there any evidence) that the resolution was adopted without due deliberation and after careful consideration. (The words of said Act of 1924, so far as material in this case, merely confirm and validate the agreement and make it binding as a contract between the parties; though the Act, because of its direction to the Board and because the agreement affects the interest of the general public, may not be considered merely as providing and imposing mutual obligations on the Company and the City. Also the Act, rather than conferring a privilege of applying to the Board, really restricts the parties' rights in that connection; the Company is under the Board's jurisdiction existing under the Railway Act, and said Act of 1924 limits the right of each party to apply to the Board as to fares, to the terms and conditions of the agreement. The agreement as ratified by the Act, in so far as clause 9 (c) is concerned', only deals with the procedure whereby the Board's jurisdiction is to be set in motion; it indicates what form will be given to the application to the Board\u2014a certain resolution of the City Council and the notice in writing to the Company).\nPer Kerwin J.: The Act of 1924 did more than merely ratify and confirm the agreement; and the agreement should be construed as a statutory enactment. Even considered as such, the first part of clause 9 (c), down to the word \"resolution\", is merely directory, not imperative, and the word \"then\" in the phrase \"then the City may notify the Company in writing\" means no more than that the parties were making provision for the City's application; it does not mean that the City may give notice only if it should first specifically express its opinion by resolution. The lack of a resolution expressed in the precise words used in clause 9 (c) was not fatal to the City's application made after its notice to the Company. There was nothing to indicate that thorough consideration was not given to the matter by the City Council, nor was there any prejudice to the Company.\nPer Rand J.: The provisions of the agreement dealing with fares and the Board's powers over them must be taken to have become, by the Act of 1924, the subject of statutory enactment. But the mere expression of opinion by the City in a formal resolution is not an imperative step to the right to raise the question of fares. To the language used by Parliament in restricting the power to deal with the fares, which involves the taking away of the general privilege under the Railway Act, there should not be attributed the intention of surrounding the public trust lying on the City Council with conditional formalities of no substantive value. The formality intended to be secured was approval of the Council before executive action should take place, and whether that approval should lie in a resolution fomally expressing the opinion of the Council, to be followed automatically by executive action, or in one instructing the giving of the notice, would be a matter of indifference. The essential protection to the Company was that there should be no unauthorized action; that behind any step by the executive should stand the knowledge, opinion and approval of the Council. That protection was present here. The resolution directing the giving of the notice, by the necessary implication of its terms, involved the opinion of the Council essential to the propriety of its action.\nPer Kellock J.: The principle of the decision in Halford v. Cameron's Coalbrook Steam Coal, etc., Co., 16 Q.B. 442, 'applies. The resolution of the City Council did \"express\" (giving to that word the meaning adopted in the Haljord case: \"represent in words\", \"exhibit by language\" or \"shew or make known\") that the City was of the opinion specified in said clause 9 (c), and was sufficient, though the word \"opinion\" or a similar term was mot used.\nAPPEAL by the Ottawa Electric Railway Company (a company incorporated by an Act of the Parliament of Canada) from the order of the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada[1] deciding in favour of the City of Ottawa a preliminary question of law raised in connection with an application by the City to the Board under clause 9 (c) of a certain agreement in writing between the City and the Company dated January 25, 1924. That agreement is set out in the schedule to, and is ratified and confirmed by, c. 84 of the Statutes of Canada, 1924 (and see c. 143 of the Statutes of Ontario, 1924, as to confirmation, etc., by the Legislature of Ontario).\nThe City's application to the Board, which was dated August 6, 1943, was for an order decreasing the fares established and in effect on that part of the Company's transportation system as is situate within the limits of the City of Ottawa and such other parts as are situate outside such limits but within the area specified in clause 4 (c) of said agreement (which parts are called \"the said part\" in clause 9 (c) of said agreement quoted in the reasons for judgment now reported), which existing rates of fare had been established and approved by an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada in 1933.\nSaid clause 9 (c) and other relevant provisions of the agreement (and also the enacting provisions of the said Act of 1924) are set out in the reasons for judgment now reported. Said clause 9 (c) provides for certain proceedings before such an application as that now in question is made by the City. A certain resolution was passed by the City Council, and, following it, a notice was given to the Company. These are also set out in the said reasons for judgment. The Company contended that the resolution of the City Council, in the form which it took, was not a compliance with what was required, and that, therefore, the City was not entitled to give the notice to the Company nor to maintain its application to the Board.\nThe Board held (MacPherson C. dissenting) that the City was entitled to give the notice to the Company and was entitled to maintain its application to the Board. The Board granted to the Company leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada upon the following questions, which, in the opinion of the Board, were questions of law and of jurisdiction:\nWhether, as a matter of law, the Board was right\u2014\n1. In holding that the Applicant [the City] was entitled to give to the Respondent [the Company] the notice dated June 27th, 1942.\n2. In holding that the Applicant is entitled to maintain its application to the Board dated the 6th day of August, 1943.\nW. F. Schroeder K.C. and J. L. Kemp for the appellant.\nG. C. Medcalf K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Taschereau J. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice\u2014On the 6th of August, 1943, the Corporation of the City of Ottawa applied to the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada for an Order decreasing the fares in effect on that part of the Company's transportation system situate within the limits of the City of Ottawa and such other parts as are situate outside such limits but within the area specified in clause (c) of section 4 of a certain agreement between the City and the Ottawa Electric Railway Company, dated January 25th, 1924, which rates of fares were established and approved by an Order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada (as it then was), dated August 31st, 1933, to be effective for a period of five years from and after the 13th day of August, 1933.\nIt was submitted in the application that the rates of fares presently in effect were excessive and produced a larger revenue from the operation of the said part of the Company's system than was\nsufficient to provide the said Company during the five-year period commencing with the 13th day of August, 1943, with the cost of operating the said part of the said Company's transportation system, and such portion of the cost of operating works in connection therewith as is properly chargeable to the said part, and in maintaining and keeping up the same in an efficient condition and making proper provision for their depreciation, renewal and replacement, and for a just and reasonable rate to the Company on the capital investment in the said part and on such portion of the capital investment in the said works as is properly chargeable to the said part.\nThe answer of the Company to the application, as it was originally fyled on August 13th, 1943, amounted to a general denial, but it was subsequently amended on the 10th of September, 1943, and then alleged that, before giving the notice under section 9 (c) of the agreement between the Company and the City, the latter had failed to express by resolution the opinion that the revenue to be derived from the part of its transportation system affected by the agreement appeared likely to be more than sufficient to provide for the five year period next succeeding the five year period then current, which expression of opinion was required by the terms and provisions of the agreement and the statute into which it was incorporated, being Chapter 84 of the Statutes of Canada, 14-15 George V; and that the City was not, therefore, entitled to give the said notice and the proceedings were not now maintainable. In its reply, the City admitted that the Council thereof did not express by resolution, on or before the 13th day of August, 1942, its opinion that the revenue to be derived from the operation of that part of the street railway owned and operated by the Company appeared likely to be more than sufficient to provide for the items specified in clause (a) of section 9 of the agreement; but it added that such opinion was expressed in the notice served upon the Company of its intention to apply to the Board for a decrease of fares. On behalf of the City, it was submitted that, as a matter of law, the failure of the Council to pass such a resolution in no way affected its right to make its application to the' Board.\nIn view of the respective contentions above referred to, a special case was submitted to the Board of Transport Commissioners on the preliminary question of law raised by the pleadings.\nOn January 12th, 1944, the majority of the Board, upon consideration of all that had been placed before it, arrived at the conclusion that on a true construction of the agreement and Statute the City had substantially and sufficiently complied with the provisions of section 9 (c) of the agreement to entitle it to give the Company the notice and to make and maintain its application to the Board for an Order decreasing the present rates of fares.\nThe Board took the view that, as between the parties, the agreement, even although validated by the Statute, was to be regarded as having created only obligations arising out of a contract; that the agreement was to be construed accordingly, and that the provision with regard to the resolution to be passed by the Council was directory, rather than absolute or imperative, and that no disadvantage, or prejudice, to which the Company may have been put could result to the Company from the course that had been followed by the City.\nOne of the Commissioners, however, Mr. MacPherson, was of a contrary opinion. He thought that the condition set out in section 9 (c) had to be fulfilled before the City had a right to give the notice to the Company, or to make an application to the Board, that the City admitted that it had not been fulfilled, and that the application should, therefore, be dismissed.\nThere was then an application to the Board for leave to appeal to this Court, which was granted and, by an Order, dated February 12th, 1944, the following questions, which, in the opinion of the Board are questions of law and jurisdiction, were submitted to us:\u2014\nWhether, as a matter of law, the Board was right\u2014\n1. In holding that the Applicant was entitled to give to the Respondent the notice dated June 27th, 1942.\n2. In holding that the Applicant is entitled to maintain its application to the Board dated the 6th day of August, 1943.\nIt is not necessary to discuss in detail the history of the preceding Companies which were known as the Ottawa City Passenger Railway Company and the Ottawa Electric Street Railway Company, Limited, and which, in the year 1893, were amalgamated and followed by incorporation of the appellant under the name of the Ottawa Electric Railway Co.\nIt is sufficient to say that the appellant Company was created by a Statute of the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada and carries on a transportation business by means of electric street cars and busses throughout the City of Ottawa and beyond the City limits into the City of Hull, which is in the Province of Quebec.\nThe appellant and the respondent entered into an agreement bearing date of the 25th of January, 1924, which was duly confirmed by a by-law of the City, bearing the same date, and which deals with the terms and conditions of the operations of the appellant's business in the City of Ottawa.\nThe appellant, being a federal Company, came under the provisions of the Railway Act. The agreement was confirmed and validated by Statute of the Parliament of Canada, to which it was attached as a schedule.\nThe City is under the jurisdiction of the provincial legislature and the agreement was also validated and confirmed by the Ontario Legislature (Chapter 143 of the Statutes of Ontario, 1924). For the purpose of the present appeal, it does not seem that we are concerned with the Ontario Statute and it will be sufficient to refer to the provisions of the Dominion Statute.\nIn the preamble of that Statute it is recited, among other things, that the Company has prayed that the agreement be ratified and confirmed, and that the parties be empowered and authorized to carry out their respective obligations and to exercise their respective privileges thereunder. It is important to set out in full sections 1 and 2 of the Statute, reading as follows:\u2014\n1. The agreement sat out in the Schedule to this Act, dated the twenty-fifth day of January, 1924, between the Company and the Corporation is ratified 'and confirmed, and the parties thereto are hereby empowered and authorized to carry out their respective obligations and to exercise their respective privileges thereunder.\n2. Notwithstanding the provisions of The Railway Act, 1919, and amendments thereto, the rates of fares on The Ottawa Electric Railway Company's transportation system, as established by the said agreement, shall not be altered before the thirteenth day of August, 1928, either by the parties thereto or by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, and thereafter any alteration in such fares shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the said agreement.\nThe relevant portions of the agreement, which, as already stated, is attached as a schedule to the Dominion Statute, are sections 4 (b), 9 (a) (b) (c) (d), and 13, as follows:\u2014\n4. (b) Notwithstanding any provision of the Railway Act (Canada) 1919, or of any subsequent Act amending the same, or of any order in council made thereunder, the above fares shall not be altered until the 13th day of August, 1928, and then only if such 'alteration is permitted in accordance with clause 9 hereof and only while such alteration remains in force.\n9. (a) Should the Company consider that the revenue to be derived from the operation of the part of its transportation system within the City limits, as they may be from time to time, and from the other lines mentioned in sub-clause (c) of clause 4 hereof (hereinafter in this clause called \"the said Part\") will be insufficient to provide during the five year period next succeeding the five year period then current, for the following items, viz., the cost of operating the said part and such portion of the cost of operating works in connection with the Company's transportation system as is properly chargeable to the said part, and of maintaining and keeping up the same in an efficient condition, and of making proper provision for their depreciation, renewal and replacement, and for a just and reasonable return to the Company on the capital investment in the said part and on such portion of the capital investment in the said works as is properly chargeable to the said part, as such capital investments may foe from time to time, the Company may notify the City in writing not later than one year before the end of any five year period, that it cannot profitably continue, after such period, the tariff of flares then in effect on the said part, and shall submit therewith a tariff of fares, and the tariff of fares to be effective during the next five year period shall thereupon be open for discussion between the parties hereto.\n(b) Should no satisfactory adjustment be effected within one month after such notification, the Company may, at any time thereafter, apply to the Board of Railway Commissioners for authority to charge such an increased tariff of fares on the said part of the said system, during the next five year period, as will produce a sum sufficient to provide in such period for the said items.\n(c) Should the revenue to be derived from the operation of the said part appear likely to be more than sufficient in the opinion of the City expressed by resolution, to provide during the five year period next succeeding the five year period then current, for the said items, then the City may notify the Company in writing, one year before the end of any five year period, that it considers the fares excessive, and if no satisfactory adjustment of the matter is made within one month after such notification, the City may apply to the Board for such a decrease in fares upon the said part during the next five year period, as will allow a revenue not more than sufficient to provide for the said items.\n(d) Whenever notice has been served by the Company or by the Corporation under clause 9 of this Agreement, any accountant or engineer instructed by the Corporation by a resolution shall have full right of access to the books, records, documents, vouchers and balance sheets of the Company, and shall have full right to examine the same, and to take extracts therefrom.\n13. The parties hereto agree to join in applying to the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada and to the Legislature of the Province of Ontario for legislation confirming and ratifying this Agreement, and declaring the same to be valid, legal and binding upon the parties hereto (the expense of such legislation to be borne by the Company).\nThe proceedings, whereby the application of the City involved in the present appeal was initiated, are entered in the minutes of the City Council, of June 25th, 1942, as follows:\u2014\nMINUTES OF THE CITY COUNCIL\nTransportation Building,\nJune 25th, 1942,\n4.30 p.m.\nPresent: All the members with the exception of Aldermen Ash, Band, Bradley and Hamilton.\nSpecial meeting called by His Worship the Mayor.\nController Geldert presented Report No. 16 of the Board of Control. REPORT No. 16, BOARD OF CONTROL\nTo the Council of the Corporation of the City of Ottawa.\nGentlemen:\n1. Ottawa Electric Railway Co.\nThe Street Railway Committee having adopted a motion to instruct the City Clerk to notify the Ottawa Electric Railway Co. that, in accordance with Clause 9 of the agreement between the Corporation and the Railway Company, dated January 25, 1924, it is the Corporation's intention to apply for a reduction in the current tariff of fares, the Board recommends that the City Clerk give such notice to the Railway Company.\nThe five year extension period of the agreement with the Company expires on August 13, 1943, and it is required that notice of one year be given the Company of any change that may be contemplated by the City in the agreement.\u2014Carried.\n2. Ottawa Electric Railway Co.\nThe Street Railway Committee having adopted a motion to instruct the City Clerk to notify the Ottawa Electric Railway Co. of the Corporation's intention to re-examine the terms of the agreement respecting bus services with a view to securing a revision of these terms, the Board recommends that the City Clerk give such notice to the Railway Company.\u2014Carried.\n3. Ottawa Electric Railway Co.\nThe Street Railway Committee having adopted a motion to instruct the City Clerk to notify the Ottawa Electric Railway Co. of the City's intention to seek reconsideration of the terms of the agreement relating to the cost of snow removal from City streets, the Board recommends that the City Clerk give such notice to the Railway Company.\u2014Carried.\nRespectfully submitted\nJune 25th, 1942. (Sgd.) J. E. S. Lewis, Chairman,\nE. A. Bourque,\nG. M. Geldert,\nJ. A. Forward,\nC. E. Pickering.\n1. Moved by Controller Geldert, seconded by Controller Bourque, that Report No. 16 of the Board of Control, just presented, be received and adopted.\u2014Carried.\nThis was followed by a notice, bearing date of June 27th, 1942, signed by the City Clerk, addressed to the Manager of the appellant Company, and reading thus:\u2014\nI beg to inform you that under authority of Clause \"C\" of Section 9 of the Agreement between your Company and the City of Ottawa, dated January 25th, 1924, the City Council, at a meeting held on Thursday the 25th day of June, instant, passed a resolution and instructed me to notify your company that it considers the present fares excessive and if no satisfactory adjustment is made within one month from the date of this notification it is the intension of the City to apply to the Board of Transport for such a decrease in fares during the next five year period as will allow a revenue not more than sufficient to provide for the items specified in clause \"A\" of Section 9 of the said Agreement.\nThe question involved in the appeal is whether, in the circumstances set out above, the City was entitled to give the Company the notice as provided in section 9 (c) of the agreement and to make and maintain its application to the Board of Transport Commissioners.\nCounsel for the Company argued that the majority of the Board, while correctly holding that the provisions and conditions of the 1924 agreement relating to the alteration of fares have been given the force of the Statute, erred in holding that these provisions and conditions should be construed in precisely the same way as if they had been matters not of enactment but of private agreement; that the conditions enumerated in section 9 (c) of the agreement with respect to the passage of a resolution by the City were directory and not imperative and that strict compliance therewith is not necessary; that the City has substantially complied with the provisions of that section, and that the appellant has suffered no disadvantage or prejudice by reason of the failure' of the City to comply with those provisions.\nThe appellant submits that the provisions of section 9 (c), being a part of the Statute (chapter 84, 14-15 George V), are imperative and absolute, first, because such provisions relate to a privilege, right or power granted with a direction that certain regulations, formalities or conditions shall be fulfilled, secondly, because it is a provision of the Statute which enables the parties affected by it to take legal proceedings under certain specified circumstances, thirdly, that it is part of the Statute which confers jurisdiction upon a tribunal of limited authority and statutory origin and is one of the conditions and qualifications annexed to the grant, fourthly, it is a provision relating to Court procedure, fifthly, it is a condition precedent to the right to give the notice without the giving of which the proceedings before the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada cannot be launched. The real reply of the City was, in effect, that, even if there had been no resolution preceding the notice sent to the Company on the 27th of June, 1942, such resolution was not necessary.\nThere was some discussion at bar with regard to the true meaning of the admission made by the City in its reply before the Board that its Council had not expressed by resolution the opinion provided for by section 9 (c) of the agreement. In my view, that admission does not mean any more than that the resolution of the Council had not used the precise words of section 9 (c).\nIt cannot be said that there was no resolution at all, and the only interpretation that can be given to the admission as made in the reply, consistent with the facts and circumstances as we know them, must be that the text of the resolution is not couched exactly in the words of the agreement.\nThere can, however, be no question about the notice sent by the City Clerk in carrying out the order of the Council. It says distinctly that a resolution was passed instructing him\nto notify your company that it considers the present fares excessive and if no satisfactory adjustment is made within one month from the date of this notification it is the intention of the City to apply to the Board of Transport for such a decrease in fares during the next five year period as will allow a revenue * * *.\nThe notice itself is clearly worded according to section 9 (c) and was unobjectionable as to its form for all intents and purposes.\nThis Court was invited by counsel for the Company to construe section 9 (c) strictly and to decide that the conditions therein mentioned had to be adhered to according to the rules of interpretation of statutes; while counsel for the City contended that, although validated by Statute (Chapter 84), as between the parties, the agreement should be construed according to the general rules accepted for the interpretation of contracts.\nA rather large number of cases were referred to by each counsel in support of his respective contention; but, as was observed by Lord Campbell in The Liverpool Borough Bank v. Turner[2]:\u2014 No universal rule can be laid down for the construction of statutes, as to whether mandatory enactments shall be considered directory only or obligatory, with an implied nullification for disobedience. It is the duty of Courts of justice to try to get at the real intention of the legislature, by carefully 'attending to the whole scope of the statute to be construed.\nAfter having very carefully read the cases to which the Court was referred by counsel, and also some others, I had to come to the same conclusion as Lord Penzance in Howard v. Bodington[3], where he said:\u2014\nI have been very carefully through those cases, but upon reading them all the conclusion at which I am constrained to arrive is, that you cannot glean a great deal that is very decisive from a perusal of those cases.\nThe statutes and agreements under discussion in the decided cases are on all sorts of subjects and I think it must be said that the Court must determine its opinion by an interpretation of the particular statute, or agreement, which it has to apply in the case submitted to it.\nIn the Statute of 1924 (Chapter 84) now under consideration, the agreement, while being \"ratified and confirmed\" by section 1, was not made part of the Act. The object of that section is to give the agreement validity and to state that \"the parties thereto are hereby empowered and authorized to carry out their respective obligations and to exercise their respective privileges thereunder\". Be it noticed that the authorization is to carry out the obligations and the privileges thereunder and, therefore, those of the agreement. No power or authorization is added to the agreement itself.\nSection 2 of the Statute derogates from certain provisions of The Railway Act, 1919, in respect of the rates of fares, but merely to state that \"as established by the said agreement [they] shall not be altered before the thirteenth day of August, 1928.\" That part of the section may now be disregarded, as the date fixed has now long since expired. Then section 2 goes on:\u2014\nand thereafter any alteration in; such fares shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the said agreement.\nAgain, therefore, it does not derogate from the agreement itself and merely confirms the \"terms and conditions\" thereof in regard to any alteration in fares. The words of the Statute, so far as material in the present case, merely confirm and validate the agreement and make it binding as a contract between the parties. The intention of the legislature, gathered from the provisions of the only two sections of the Statute, would appear, therefore, to limit the effect of the enactment to the validating of the agreement between the Company and the City.\nIt may not, however, be considered merely as providing and imposing mutual obligations on the Company and the City, because of the direction given in the Statute to the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, and also because it may not be denied that the agreement also affects the interest of the general public in their right to utilize the facilities of the Company.\nAs between the appellant and the respondent, it would seem that their respective obligations and privileges, to use the words of section 1 of the Statute, are reciprocal. Clauses 9 (a) and 9 (c) of the agreement clearly lead to that view; but I cannot agree with counsel for the Company that section 2 of Chapter 84 confers a privilege on either party in respect of the right to apply to the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada (now the Board of Transport Commissioners). On the contrary, I would think that it restricts the rights of the parties in that connection. There can be no question that the Company is under the jurisdiction of the Board and that, in particular, in respect of its rates and fares, the effect of section 2 restricts the right of each party to the agreement to apply to the Board and limits it to the terms and conditions of the agreement. So far as that point is concerned, I fail to see how it can be said that the Statute confers a privilege on either party.\nThis leads me to say that the questions submitted to the Court hardly raise a point as to the jurisdiction of the Board. Neither the agreement, nor the Statute, created that jurisdiction. It existed under the Railway Act by reason of the incorporation of the Company as a federal entity and, but for the agreement and Statute, the jurisdiction of the Board would have been general and unaltered. Perhaps it was suspended in regard to rates and fares until the 13th day of August, 1928, but since that date the question is no longer one of jurisdiction. The latter is not derived either from the agreement or from the special Statute; the right of control which the Board exercises over the rates of fares of the Company is given to it by the Railway Act, and the agreement as ratified by the Statute, in; so far as 9 (c) is concerned, only deals with the procedure whereby the jurisdiction of the Board is to be set in motion. It indicates what form will be given to the application to the Board:\u2014a certain resolution of the City Council and the notice in writing to the Company.\nI would not, therefore, follow the contention of the City to the extent of saying that the failure of the City Council to pass a resolution was wholly immaterial, but the discussion on that point is really irrelevant in the premises, because, as a matter of fact, there was a resolution passed by the Council. Report No. 16 of the Board of Control was adopted by a resolution of the Council. The minutes of June 25th, 1942, show that a resolution was then and there carried by the Council and the question, as it presents itself, is not, therefore, whether a resolution is necessary or riot under clause 9 (c) of the agreement, but rather whether the particular resolution adopted by the Council was sufficient for the purpose which the City intended thereby to achieve.\nThe point raised by counsel for the Company is that the resolution was not effective because it was not strictly adopted in the words of section 9 (c) and, to be more precise, because it did not express the opinion of the City that the revenue to be derived by the operation of that part of its transportation system within the City appeared likely to be more than sufficient to provide during the five year period next succeeding the five year period then current for the items enumerated in section 9 (a) of the agreement, and that the City considered the fares excessive.\nIt is true that the resolution is not in the express terms of section 9 (c), but the word \"expressed\" in 9 (c) cannot mean any more than \"put forth\" and does not exclude the idea that the opinion can be implied. It is, to my mind, the necessary implication of the report of the Board of Control that they were acting under clause 9 (c) of the agreement. It refers to clause 9 and it states that \"it is the Corporation's intention to apply for a reduction in the current tariff of fares\". Obviously the intention of the City was to make an application to the Board for a reduction of the fares \"in accordance with Clause 9\", in view of the fact that the conditions provided for in that clause had arisen; and that intention was clearly conveyed to the Company by the notice sent on behalf of the City on June 27th, 1942, in the very terms of the section.\nThe only quarrel of the Company is really with the form of the resolution and nothing else.\nFor my part, I cannot see that the objection can have any merit, because, instead of reproducing in the resolution the exact words of section 9 (c), the report of the Board of Control and the resolution of the Council proceeded by way of a reference to the clause itself. Whether the terms of that clause be held as being imperative or directory, I would hold that the condition therein stated, in respect of the resolution to be adopted by the Council, has been sufficiently complied with\u2014indeed more than substantially\u2014and that the action taken by the City Council completely satisfied the requirements of that particular clause. In effect it expressed the opinion referred to' in that clause and it necessarily imports the opinion of the respondent that the revenues of the appellant were more than sufficient for the purposes in question. Any alleged omission (and I do not agree that there is any) should certainly be considered as non-essential, and, in the words of Fry, on Specific Performance, 6th edit., p. 440, as the omission of a term which is neither \"important\" nor \"considerable\".\nNor can I see what prejudice can have resulted, or can result, to the appellant on account of the alleged omission in the resolution of the City Council. The resolution, even if it carried out strictly the provision in clause 9 (c), is really of no value to the appellant as a source of information, or as a guarantee of careful and informed consideration by the Council before entering into the rate dispute. The Company was fully and completely informed of what the City intended to do by its resolution and by its notice. There cannot be the slightest doubt about the City's intention and there is nothing in clause 9 (c) to the effect that the opinion which the City expresses in its resolution should only be arrived at after due deliberation.\nMoreover, it is not to be assumed that the resolution was adopted by the Council without due deliberation and after careful consideration of the matters involved. There is certainly no evidence to the contrary in the material before the Court.\nI would, therefore, answer the questions submitted by the Board in the affirmative. The appellant should pay the costs of the respondent on the appeal to this Court.\nKerwin J.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the proposed judgment of my Lord the Chief Justice and, while I agree in the result, my reasons for so doing differ in some respects from his and I therefore propose to state them shortly.\nThe application to the Board by the City was made in pursuance of the agreement of January 25th, 1924, and it is therefore unnecessary, in my view, to consider or express any opinion as to the effect of subsection 5 of section 325 of the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 170. I agree that the reply of the City to the amended answer of the Company is not an admission that the City had not expressed by resolution its opinion that the revenue to be derived from the operation of the relevant part of the Company's transportation system would appear likely to be more than sufficient to provide for the stated items during the five year period next succeeding the five year period then current. It means no more than that the resolution passed by the City Council on June 25th, 1942, was not phrased in the precise words used in section 9 (c) of the agreement.\nI concur with the Assistant Chief Commissioner of the Board that the Dominion statute of 1924 does more than merely ratify and confirm the agreement of January 25th, 1924, between the City and the Company. The various cases cited on this point are of very little assistance and one must come to a conclusion upon a consideration of all the terms of the agreement and statute. Ratification and confirmation was accomplished by section 1 of the Act:\u2014\nThe agreement set out in the Schedule to this Act, dated the twenty-fifth day of January, 1924, between the Company and the Corporation is ratified and confirmed, and the parties thereto are hereby empowered and authorized to carry out their respective obligations and to exercise their respective privileges thereunder.\nSection 2, however, enacts:\u2014\nNotwithstanding the provisions of The Railway Act, 1919, and amendments thereto, the rates of fares on The Ottawa Electric Railway Company's transportation system, as established by the said agreement, shall not be altered before the thirteenth day of August, 1928, either by the parties thereto or by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, and thereafter any alteration in such fares shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the said agreement.\nIt is true that the period ending August 13th, 1928, has long since expired and we need not, therefore, concern ourselves with what might have been the position if some one other than the City had applied to the Board during that period for a reduction of fares. But the provision that \"the rates of fares * * * shall not be altered * * * by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada\", coupled with the last leg of section 2 \"and thereafter any alteration in such fares shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the said agreement\" lead me to the conclusion that something more than mere approval of the agreement is accomplished and that in fact the agreement should be construed as a statutory enactment.\nEven considered as such, the first part of clause 9 (c) of the agreement down to the word \"resolution\" is merely directory and not imperative. Again, expressions used in other agreements and enactments and the decisions thereon are of little assistance. Provision is made by clauses 9 (a) and 9 (b) for an application by the Company if it thought the revenue would be insufficient. Clause 9 (c) provides for an application to be made by the City and I think no further meaning may be attached to the word \"then\", in the phrase \"then the City may notify the Company in writing\", than that the parties were making provision, therein for the City's application. It does not mean that the City may give notice to the Company only if it should first specifically express its opinion by resolution.\nIn view of clause 15 of the agreement:\nThe Company may at the request of the City, to be expressed by bylaw, substitute other streets or parts thereof for the purpose of reaching the objective points of the extensions referred to in Schedule) \"A\".\nwherein it will be noted that the request of the City to the Company to substitute other streets is to be expressed by by-law, it may be that the parties did not want any possible implication to arise that by the general law the City should pass a by-law when proceeding under clause 9. It does not follow, however, that the lack of a resolution expressed in the precise words used in 9 (c) is fatal to the City's application to the Board after it had notified the Company of its intention so to apply. It was forcefully argued by Mr. Schroeder that the passing of a resolution by the City Council in the exact terms of clause 9(c) would insure that the matter would receive thorough consideration but there is nothing to indicate that such consideration was not given to the matter when it came before the City Council on June 25th, 1942, and the report of the Board of Control was received and the recommendation therein contained that the City Clerk give the required notice to the Company, was adopted. Neither on this nor any other ground can I find that any prejudice was suffered by the Company.\nThe questions submitted by the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada should be answered in the affirmative and the appellant should pay the costs of the respondent of the appeal to this Court.\nRand J.\u2014This is an appeal from an order of the Board of Transport on two questions of law which relate to the right of the respondent to proceed with an application to the Board for a reduction of fares on the street railway of the appellant. The controversy arises out of the interpretation of a clause in an agreement entered into between the parties in 1924. The agreement deals generally with the relations between the City and the Company, and the particular clause, with the procedure preliminary to a modification of fares. The clause is as follows:\n9. (a) Should the Company consider that the revenue to be derived from the operation of the part of its transportation system within the City limits, as they may be from time to time, and from the other lines mentioned in sub-clause (c) of clause 4 hereof (hereinafter in this clause called \"the said Part\"), will be insufficient to provide during the five year period next succeeding the five year period then current, for the following items, viz., the cost of operating the said part and such portion of the cost of operating works in connection with the Company's transportation system as is properly chargeable to the said part, and of maintaining and keeping up the same in an efficient condition, and of making proper provision for their depreciation, renewal and replacement, and for a just and reasonable return to the Company on the capital investment in the said part and on such portion of the capital investment in the said works as is properly chargeable to the said part, as such capital investments may be from time to time, the Company may notify the City in writing not later than one year before the end of any five year period, that it cannot profitably continue, after such period, the tariff of fares then in effect on the said part, and shall submit therewith a tariff of fares, and the tariff of fares to be effective during the next five year period shall thereupon be open for discussion between the parties hereto.\n(b) Should no satisfactory adjustment be effected within one month after such notification, the Company may, at any time thereafter, apply to the Board of Railway Commissioners for authority to charge such an increased tariff of fares on the said part of the said system, during the next five year period, as will produce a sum sufficient to provide in such period for the said items.\n(c) Should the revenue to be derived from the operation of the said part appear likely to be more than sufficient, in the opinion of the City expressed by resolution, to provide during the five year period next succeeding the five year period then current, for the said items, then the City may notify the Company in writing, one year before the end of any five year period, that it considers the fares excessive, and if no satisfactory adjustment of the matter is made within one month after such notification, the City may apply to the Board for such a decrease in fares upon the said part during the next five year period, as will allow a revenue not more than sufficient to provide for the said items.\nOn June 25th, 1942, the City, acting under the power of paragraph (c), by its council passed a resolution instructing\nthe city clerk to notify the Ottawa Electric Railway Company that, in accordance with clause: 9 of the agreement between the Corporation and the Railway Company, dated January. 25th, 1924, it is the Corporation's intention to apply for a reduction in the current tariff of fares.\nThe motion before the council was by way of adopting a report from the Board of Control which in turn had approved a recommendation of a committee of the council. The report recited that the current five year period of the agreement would expire on August 13th, 1943, and that notice of one year had to be given to the Company of any change in fares that might be sought by the City. The notification was by letter as follows:\nJune 27th, 1942.\nD. N. Gill, Esq.,\nManager, Ottawa Electric Ry. Co.,\n56 Sparks Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Sir:\nI beg to inform you that under authority of Clause \"C\" of Section 9 of the Agreement between your Company and the City of Ottawa, dated January 25th, 1924, the City Council, at a meeting held on Thursday the 25th day of June, instant, passed a resolution and instructed me to notify your company that it considers the present fares excessive and if no satisfactory adjustment is made within one month from the date of this notification it is the intention of the City to apply to the Board of Transport for such a decrease in fares during the next five year period as will allow a revenue not more than sufficient to provide for the items specified in clause \"A\" of Section 9 of the said Agreement.\nYours truly,\nNRO\/RFH City Clerk.\nIn the material before this Court there is nothing to indicate anything further between the parties before August 6th, 1943, when the City launched its application to the Board. The answer by the Company was simply a denial that the rates were excessive or would produce a larger revenue during the ensuing five year period than would meet the requirements enumerated in the agreement. Subsequently, in an amended answer, the Company raised the point that under clause 9 (c) it was a condition to the right to make an application that the City should have formally passed a resolution expressing its opinion on the revenue of the Company to be derived in the next succeeding five year period, substantially in the terms of the clause, and that, as no such resolution had been passed, the right to make an application had not arisen. On this issue the Board held that such a formal step was not a prerequisite to the application but at the request of the appellant stated the following questions of law to this Court:\nWhether, as a matter of law, the Board was right\u2014\n1. In holding that the Applicant was entitled to give to the Respondent the notice dated June 27th, 1942.\n2. In holding that the Applicant is entitled to maintain its application to the Board dated the 6th day of August, 1943. The appellant was incorporated by a statute of parliament and its undertaking has been declared a work for the general advantage of Canada. The contract was confirmed by chapter 84, Statutes of Canada, 1924, in the following terms:\n1. The agreement set out in the Schedule to this Act, dated the twenty-fifth day of January, 1924, between the Company and the Corporation is ratified and confirmed, and the parties thereto are hereby empowered and authorized to carry out their respective obligations and to exercise their respective privileges thereunder.\n2. Notwithstanding the provisions of The Railway Act, 1919, and amendments thereto, the rates of fares on The Ottawa Electric Railway Company's transportation system, as established by the said agreement, shall not be altered before the thirteenth day of August, 1928, either by the parties thereto or by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, and thereafter any alteration in such fares shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the said agreement.\nIn the argument before the Board and this Court a great deal of discussion took place as to the effect of this language; whether by it the contract or any part of it had been made statutory or whether the result was simply to leave the agreement authorized, in its character as contract. I have little doubt that the provisions dealing with fares and the powers' of the Board over them have become the subject of statutory enactment. In the absence of this special code, the fares would be subject to the general jurisdiction of the Board under the Railway Act. It would be extraordinary if we should find that statutory jurisdiction modified materially by a purely contractual stipulation.\nThere remains the narrow point whether a formal resolution containing only the expression of opinion by the City is an imperative step to the right to raise the question of fares. The \"opinion\" and the notice to the Company are obviously bound up with each other: certainly a state of mind is ordinarily assumed to precede action, and to be in harmony with it. There is no requirement that the notification be authorized by resolution, nor that the resolution now insisted on is in any way to be communicated to the Company. These considerations, so far from indicating any special significance in the resolution of opinion, appear rather to treat that opinion and the notice as two parts of a single act. It was contended by Mr. Schroeder that the object was to ensure a certain deliberation on the part of the council in the course of which, data available from annual reports of the Company or other public sources would be or might be brought under examination. But so far as that contention confines such a purpose to the mere expression of opinion, I am unable to accede to it.\nThe precise particulars by which parliament has restricted the power to deal with these fares involves the taking away of the general privilege, under the Railway Act, of any recognized public body to raise such a question before the Board. The entire interests of the public of Ottawa have, therefore, been entrusted to the City Council and I cannot attribute to the language of parliament the intention of rendering that trust precarious by surrounding it with conditional formalities of no substantive value.\nWhat clause 9 (c) contemplates is, first, preliminary negotiation between the City and the Company to reach agreement and, failing that, an application to the Board. The executive arm of the City consists of a Board of Control and the Mayor. The formality intended to be secured was approval of council before executive action should take place, and whether that approval should lie in a resolution formally expressing the opinion of the council, to be followed automatically by executive action, or in one instructing the giving of the notice, would seem to me to be a matter of indifference. The essential protection to the Company was that there should be no unauthorized action; that behind any step by the executive should stand the knowledge, opinion and approval of the council. That protection was present here. The resolution directing the notice to be given by the clerk, by the necessary implication of its terms, involved the opinion of the council essential to the propriety of its action.\nBy clause 9 (a) the Company has the right, \"if it should consider\" fares to be inadequate, to raise the question with the City. Under this a state of mind, even adverse in opinion to its action, is irrelevant and I can see no reason why the opposite should, in pure formality, be taken to be the import of the language used in relation to the City when that is capable of another and perfectly reasonable construction. This points also to the place of emphasis in the words, \"in the opinion of the City expressed by resolution\"; it is not \"opinion\" but \"resolution\"; opinion will be deemed to be in harmony with action but it must be deducible from \"resolution\", as we have it here.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nKellock J.\u2014The point involved in this appeal is taken in paragraph 2 of the amended answer of the appellant, to the effect that the respondent had \"failed to express by resolution\" the opinion referred to in paragraph 9 (c) of the agreement of the 25th of January, 1924, and that, having so failed, it was not entitled to give the notice provided for by the said clause. Appellant contends, that the agreement is to be taken as part of the Statute, 14-15 Geo. V, chapter 84, that the words above quoted are to be construed as mandatory and not merely directory, and when so regarded the resolution of the respondent's council of June 25th, 1942, is not a compliance with the terms of the agreement. On behalf of the respondent, it is contended, (1) that clause 9 (c) should be construed as a contractual provision and not as part of the statute, and when so construed, the resolution of June 25th, 1942, if in any respect deficient, which is denied, complies with all the essential terms of the agreement; (2) that if the clause in the agreement is to be construed as a statute, that part of clause 9 (c) above referred to is merely directory; and (3) even if the clause is to-be construed as mandatory, the resolution of the respondent council completely satisfied its requirements.\nIt will be convenient to consider this last contention first. The question is as to whether appellant is right in its assumption that any resolution which meets the requirements of clause 9 (c) must contain in explicit terms the opinion of the council of the respondent on the matter dealt with by that clause.\nIn Halford. v. Cameron's Coalbrook Steam Coal, etc., Company[4], there was involved the construction of 7 & 8 Victoria, Chapter 110, section 45, which enacted as to bills of exchange made or accepted on behalf of any company subject to the Act that\nevery such bill of exchange or promissory note shall be made or accepted (as 'the case may be) by and in the names of two of the directors of the company on whose behalf or account the same may be so made or accepted, and shall be by such directors expressed to be made or accepted by them on behalf of such company;\nand that every such bill should be binding upon the company and the company should be liable thereon. In the case before the court, acceptance, as far as the directors were concerned, consisted of their signatures followed by a description of them as directors of the company appointed to accept the bill. It was objected on behalf of the company that the requirements of the statute had not been met and that the action did not lie.\nThe court (Lord Campbell C.J., Patteson, Coleridge and Erle JJ.) held that the objection was not a valid one. Lord Campbell, in giving the judgment of the court, said at page 445:\nBut we think that there is no necessity for the very words and syllables here mentioned to be written by the two directors on the face of the bill. According to Dr. Johnson, the meaning of the verb \"to express\" is \"to represent in words; to exhibit by language; to shew or make known in any manner\". Now do not the two directors who have accepted this bill represent in words, exhibit by language, shew and make known, that the bill is accepted by them as directors on behalf of the company?\nIn my opinion, the principle of this decision applies to the case at bar. Turning to the resolution of the 25th of June, 1942, it is as follows:\nMoved by Controller Geldert, seconded by Controller Bourque, that Report No. 16 of the Board of Control, just presented, be received and adopted.\u2014Carried.\nThe Report referred to is as follows:\n1. Ottawa Electric Railway Co.\nThe Street Railway Committee having adopted a motion to instruct the City Clerk to notify the Ottawa Electric Railway Co. that, in accordance with Clause 9 of the agreement between the Corporation and the Railway Company, dated January 25, 1924, it is the Corporation's intention to apply for a reduction in the current tariff of fares, the Board recommends that the City Clerk give such notice to the Railway Company. The five year extension period of the agreement with the Company expires on August 13, 1943, and it is required that notice of one year be given the Company of any change that may be contemplated by the City in the agreement.\u2014Carried.\nIt is to be noted that what was to be notified to the appellant by the city clerk under the resolution \"in accordance with clause 9\" of the agreement of the 25th of January, 1924, was that it was the respondent's intention to apply for a reduction in fares. The resolution states that \"the five year extension period of the agreement expires on August 13, 1943\". This refers to the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada of August 31st, 1933, which had established different rates of fares from that originally provided for under the agreement of January 25th, 1924, made pursuant to clause 9 (c). This would be well understood by the appellant. The resolution goes on to state that \"it is required that notice of one year be given the Company of any change that may be contemplated by the City in the agreement\". There is no change but one provided for in clause 9 (c) \"in accordance with\" which the notice was to be given and this is with respect to a reduction of fares during the five year period next succeeding the period expiring August 13th, 1943. Such a change must be based upon the opinion of the respondent which the clause describes. Can it be said that this resolution could be otherwise understood by the appellant?\nIn my opinion, the resolution does \"represent in words\" or \"exhibit by language\" or \"shew or make known\" that the city was of the opinion specified in the clause, although the word \"opinion\" or a similar term is not used. I think the principle of the decision above referred to is to be applied to the facts of the case at bar. I do not think there is any substance in the argument put forward on behalf of the appellant that if the word \"opinion\" were to be found in the resolution, there would necessarily have been any difference in the consideration given to the matter when the resolution was before the council of the respondent for consideration. I see no weight in this argument as in any way touching the interpretation to be given to the language of the agreement in question. I agree with my Lord the Chief Justice with regard to the effect of the admission contained in the respondent's reply.\nIn view of the opinion to which I have come, it is not necessary to deal with the other points argued.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacCraken, Fleming, Schroeder & Burnett.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Gordon C.

(ibid) restraining it from proceeding with the advertised sale for arrears of taxes, or at any future time selling or attempting to sell for taxes, certain land which adjoined land of respondent, and declaring that the land in question was a public way and not assessable. A motion was made to quash the appeal to this Court for want of jurisdiction. The taxes to which the proceeds of the advertised sale could be applied did not exceed $1,500. The value of the land in question was assumed to be $7,200.\nHeld: The appeal should be quashed for want of jurisdiction, as \"the amount or value of the matter in controversy\" in the appeal did not exceed $2,000, within s. 39 (a) of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 35). The \"matter in controversy\" was the right of the City to collect $1,500 of taxes through the sale of property. As to \"the amount or Value\", it is the interest of the appellant that must be considered (Kinghorn v. Larue, 22 S.C.R. 347, at 349); and this was clearly the taxes; and their amount was the measure of value which determined the jurisdiction (Gendron v. McDougall, Cassels' Digest, 2nd Ed., p. 429, cited). (Special leave to appellant to appeal to this Court was refused).\nMOTION to quash an appeal brought by the defendant, the City of Sydney, from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1] dismissing its appeal from the judgment of Graham J.[2] restraining it from proceeding with the advertised sale for arrears of taxes, or at any future time selling or attempting to sell for taxes, a certain piece of land which adjoined land of the plaintiff, and declaring that the land in question was a public way and not assessable. At the opening of the hearing of the appeal in this Court, counsel for the respondent moved that the appeal be quashed for want of jurisdiction, on the ground that the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal did not exceed $2,000. Counsel for the appellant opposed the motion, but asked, if necessary, for special leave to appeal (leave was refused by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco). This Court reserved judgment on the motions, and heard the appeal. In the judgment now reported, this Court, dealing only with the motions, quashed the appeal, and refused special leave to appeal.\nE. H. Charleson and B. B. Jordan for the appellant.\nG. F. Henderson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRand J.\u2014When this appeal was called, a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction was made by the respondent. The appeal was heard on the merits and judgment on the motion reserved.\nThe point of jurisdiction depends upon whether or not within section 39 (a) of the Supreme Court Act \"the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal exceeds the sum of $2,000.\" The action was brought for an injunction to restrain the City of Sydney from proceeding with a tax sale of a strip of land adjoining property owned by the respondent. The taxes to which the proceeds of the sale could be applied were not more than $1,500. The land was assessed for $7,200 and for the purposes of deciding the question raised I will assume that sum to be its value. Further relief claimed was a declaration that the strip had, by dedication, become a public highway. The Courts below upheld the plaintiff's contention.\nWhat, then, is the matter in controversy in this Court? It is the right of the City to collect $1,500 of taxes through the sale of property. Then, as to \"the amount or value\", it is to the interest of the party appealing that we must look: Taschereau J., in Kinghorn v. Larue[3]. What is that here? It is clearly the taxes, and their amount is the measure of value which determines the jurisdiction.\nFor that conclusion we are not without authority. The point is governed by Gendron v. McDougall[4]. There the plaintiff had obtained a judgment for $231 and in execution seized an immovable worth $2,000. The defendant filed an opposition \u00e0 fin de distraire, claiming the land seized to be his property. Gendron contested that opposition but it was maintained. He then appealed to this Court which, on a challenge to the jurisdiction, held that the value of his interest in the appeal was $231 only. I see no difference in principle between that case and the present.\nThe appellant had applied to the Court of Appeal for special leave to bring the controversy to this Court but it was refused, and by consent the application was renewed before us. The case, however, is sui generis and is not, in my opinion, one in which special leave should be granted.\nThe appeal should be quashed with costs to the respondent of one motion.\nAppeal quashed, with costs to the respondent of a motion; the application for leave to appeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Finlay MacDonald.\nSolicitor for the respondent: John MacNeil.\n[1] 18 M.P.R. 20; [1944] 2 D.L.R. 133.\n[2] 18 M.P.R. 20, at 20-26; [1944] 2 D.L.R. 133, at 133-138.\n[3] (1893) 22 S.C.R. 347, at 349.\n[4] (1885) Cassels' Digest, 2nd Ed., p. 429.\n"}

The issue at the trial was whether or not the complainant voluntarily consented to the intercourse. A witness, R., who had arrived at the scene of the alleged offence shortly after what took place, testified to there being a \u201cmatted down\u201d area of about 20 x 6 feet. The complainant in her evidence had said nothing about such condition. Appellant testified that such condition existed before what took place. In charging the jury the trial Judge said that the evidence of R. and two other men corroborated the complainant\u2019s story in regard to some of the material aspects thereof and he followed by detailing certain matters of their evidence, including the condition of the area as described by R.\nHeld (Taschereau and Kellock JJ. dissenting): The conviction should be quashed and a new trial directed.\nPer the Chief Justice and Kerwin J.: It was not necessary that the complainant should have given some particular bit of evidence before an independent witness upon that point could corroborate her general story on the issue of consent. As part of the Crown\u2019s case, it was quite proper to show the condition of the particular area when R arrived, and the jury would not be bound to believe appellant\u2019s evidence as to its condition before the occurrence. But it was misdirection to say that evidence of the matted down condition of the area after the occurrence could constitute corroboration of a material aspect of the complainant\u2019s story as to which she had not testified. And it could not be said that the misdirection had caused no miscarriage of justice.\nPer Rand J.: It was beyond controversy on the evidence that the state of the surface of the area could not have furnished the slightest corroboration to the complainant\u2019s story or to the case of the Crown. The charge to the jury was, therefore, in that respect, a misdirection in law and of such a nature that it could not be said that it might not have influenced the jury in reaching their verdict.\nPer Taschereau and Kellock JJ. (dissenting): The reference in question in the charge to the condition of the area, having regard to its context, related, not to any supposed statement of the complainant as to the condition of the area which was corroborated by R., but to a reference earlier in the charge to the complainant\u2019s evidence as to the nature of the alleged assault, and would be so understood by the jury; and R.\u2019s evidence as to the condition of the area was consistent with, and could properly be regarded as corrobora- tive of, the complainant\u2019s evidence with respect to the struggle alleged by her to have taken place, unless it were clearly established as a matter of fact that the struggle described by her was of such a limited character that it could not have been the cause of an area of the extent described by R., and on that question the jury, if accepting complainant\u2019s evidence that she did not consent and was attacked, and giving due weight to the circumstances, might well have considered that no difficulty arose, and that was a question of fact, expressly left as such to, and entirely one for, the jury. There was really no question of law involved in the dissent in the Court of Appeal, but merely matters of fact, and therefore the appeal should be quashed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing (Laidlaw J.A. dissenting) the appellant\u2019s appeal from his conviction, at trial before Greene J. and a jury, on a charge of rape.\nH. Freshman for the appellant.\nW.B. Common K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014The conviction of the appellant Mclntyre on a charge of rape was upheld by the Court of Appeal for Ontario with Mr. Justice Laidlaw dissenting. As I consider there should be a new trial, I refrain from discussing the evidence except as it may be necessary to explain my reasons for so doing.\nIf the offence occurred, there is no doubt that the appellant committed it. He admits that he had intercourse with the complainant, Eva Pettigrew, at the time and place mentioned by her but his defence is that she consented voluntarily. The intercourse took place about noon on a bright Sunday, May 23rd, 1943, not far from a travelled highway in the Township of Ancaster. The exact spot is part of the abandoned right-of-way of an electric railway company and is described in the evidence as being about twenty feet by six feet in area. The ground surrounding it is filled with weeds and tall grass.\nAfter the occurrence, Eva Pettigrew complained to one or more of the occupants of a neighbouring farm house, one of whom described the condition of the particular area immediately thereafter as \u201cmatted down\u201d. There would appear to be no denial of this fact but, in view of the defence, the important question in this connection was as to the condition of that area before the complainant and accused had reached it. The only one who gave any evidence on this question was the accused, who said it was \u201cwell flattened\u201d and \u201cthe only matted down spot in the whole territory.\u201d\nThe vital point in the whole case was as to whether the complainant consented or, if she had consented, whether such consent had been extorted by threats or fear of bodily harm (Criminal Code, s. 298). The trial judge told the jury that they \u201cshould be reluctant to convict in a case of this kind upon the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant\u201d but that \u201cit is within your power to do so.\u201d He then dealt with the question \u201cwhether the story of the complainant had been corroborated in a material aspect.\u201d He stated that the evidence of three people in the farm house \u201camply corroborates the story as told by Eva Pettigrew in regard to some of the material aspects of that story.\u201d He then detailed some of these aspects and stated, as one of them:\u2014\u201cThey described the condition of the area twenty feet by six where the grass was pressed down\u201d, and concluded:\u2014\u201cSo in several matters they corroborated the evidence of Eva Pettigrew as she gave it in the witness box here to-day.\u201d Later in his charge he said:\u2014\u201cShe says that she did not consent, and that she was overpowered by fear when he threatened her with bodily harm. Indicating that there was perhaps some struggle or evasion\u2014it is for you gentlemen to say\u2014there was a beaten down area in the grass and weeds there of some twenty feet by six.\u201d\nIt was pointed out in argument before us that the trial judge was in error in stating that three occupants of the farm house had described the condition of this lot where the grass was pressed down. As a matter of fact only one had referred to it but, as we may deal only with the dissent in the Court below, I disregard this discrepancy. All that was required was that the corroboration should be of the evidence of the complainant that the accused had carnal knowledge of her without her consent or with consent that had been extorted by threats or fear of bodily harm It was not necessary that the complainant should have testified to some particular bit of evidence before an independent witness upon that point could corroborate her general story on the issue of consent. As part of the Crown\u2019s case, it was quite proper to show the condition of the particular area when the independent witnesses arrived, and the jury would not be bound to believe the evidence of the accused as to its condition before the occurrence.\nHowever, that is not what the trial judge told the jury. He instructed them that the evidence could be taken by them as corroborating her story in regard to some of the material aspects thereof and then gave as one aspect the condition of the area. As a matter of fact she had said nothing about it. It was misdirection to say that evidence of the matted down condition of the area after the occurrence could constitute corroboration of a material aspect of the complainant\u2019s story as to which she had not testified. It is in this sense that I understand Mr. Justice Laidlaw\u2019s statement:\u2014\u201cThere could not, of course, be corroboration, ample or otherwise, of evidence not given by the complainant, Eva Pettigrew, and in my opinion there was a misdirection to the jury in this matter.\u201d In any event, later in his judgment he states:\u2014\u201cThere was again [referring to the same point] misdirection of such a character and magnitude as to make the trial unfair to the appellant.\u201d\nIn other parts of his charge, the trial judge had told the jury that they were the sole judges as to what facts had been proved by the evidence; that while it was his duty to review some of the highlights of the evidence and to comment on them, if he saw fit, he could not pretend to review everything and, if he expressed an opinion of the facts, they were not bound to follow it unless their own opinion happened to be the same; and, towards the conclusion of his charge, he stated that he did not pretend to have covered all the evidence,\u2014that there might be parts of it that were important that they recalled which he had not gone over but that he was satisfied that among their twelve joint memories they would have before them everything that was of any real importance. These general observations, however, cannot weigh in this case where the question of consent was of prime importance, nor does it matter that the judge was right in pointing out other evidence which, if the jury believed it, would warrant them in treating it as corroboration. There being misdirection, I am unable to say that there has been no miscarriage of justice. The fact that counsel for the accused did not object at the trial should not be taken, in the circumstances, to indicate that the point was negligible. There had already been one trial where the jury disagreed, and, considering the evidence as a whole in the record before us and the importance attached to the matted down area by the trial judge, the Crown has failed to convince me that but for the misdirection the verdict would necessarily have been the same. Gouin v. The King[2].\nThe appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Kellock JJ., dissenting, was delivered by\nKELLOCK J.\u2014This is an appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an appeal from the conviction of the appellant on a charge of rape. Appellant relies upon the dissenting judgment of Laidlaw J.A. as establishing jurisdiction in this Court pursuant to the provisions of section 1023 of the Criminal Code.\nThe difference of opinion in the Court below was with regard to certain portions of the charge of the learned trial judge. Laidlaw J.A. was of opinion that there was material misdirection and that the Crown had not met the onus thereby cast upon it of showing that there had been no miscarriage. The Chief Justice of Ontario and Gillanders J.A. were of opinion that there was no misdirection, the Chief Justice being further of the view that even if it could be said that misdirection existed, it was quite improbable that it had had any effect upon the result. The question in issue at the trial was as to whether or not there had been consent on the part of the complainant, the defence being that there had been such consent. In his charge, the learned trial judge said:\nThe evidence of the three gentlemen near by, the farmer Mr. Robson, his father-in-law and his brother-in-law Scott, amply corroborates the story as told by Eva Pettigrew in regard to some of the material aspects of that story. In other words, they painted the scene as she has told it to you. They found the man naked. They told you how she arrived at the house with nothing but her skirt and jacket on, and they described (the condition of the area twenty feet by six where the grass was pressed down. So in several matters they corroborated the evidence of Eva Pettigrew as she gave it in the witness box here to-day.\nThe complainant did not give any evidence with regard to the condition of the area at any time. In the course of his judgment, Laidlaw J.A., after pointing this out, refers to the description given by complainant as to her struggle with the appellant, and the evidence of the appellant that the place in question was matted down at the time he and the complainant came there. The ground of dissent was that Robson\u2019s evidence could not amount to corroboration of any evidence given by complainant either as to the condition of the area or as to her struggle with the appellant, for the reason that she had given no evidence as to the condition of the area and the extent of the beaten down area described by Robson could not have been caused by the struggle described by the complainant.\nIn considering whether or not there was misdirection in the charge, the language of the learned trial judge is to be scrutinized to see what the jury might reasonably be considered to have understood from it. It is, of course, misdirection if a jury is directed to treat something as corroboration which is not in law corroboration. In the present case, the question is whether there is to be taken from what the learned trial judge told the jury that the complainant had made some statement in evidence with regard to the condition of the area which was corroborated by Robson, or whether his charge is to be taken as referring only to her evidence as to her struggle, and if the latter, then was the evidence of Robson in any way corroborative of it?\nTo my mind, the context in which the above portion of the charge appears affords an answer to the first branch of the question.\nThe learned trial judge had first warned the jury that they should be reluctant to convict upon the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant and pointed out that if they did so, it was a very serious responsibility to assume unless her story had \u201cbeen corroborated in some material aspect\u201d. He then proceeded to say:\nIt is proper that we should take just a moment to consider as to whether the story of the complainant has been corroborated in a material aspect. I think I need only recall to you her story as to what took place in that gully or depression in the land that has been referred to, about her clothes being removed, and the nature of the assault which she alleges this man made upon her.\nThen followed the portion of the charge which is objected to as already set out above. In my opinion, the reference to the condition of the area in the part objected to relates to the reference in the earlier part to the complainant\u2019s evidence as to the nature of the assault which she alleged had been made upon her and, in my opinion, would be so understood by the jury. The learned trial judge in a subsequent passage of his charge, returns to the relation of the complainant\u2019s evidence as to the assault and the existence of the beaten down area and the bearing of the one upon the other when he said:\nIndicating that there was perhaps some struggle or evasion\u2014it is for you gentlemen to say\u2014there was a beaten down area in the grass and weeds there of some twenty feet by six.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that in the portion of the charge objected to as first set out above, there is no implication that the learned trial judge was telling the jury that the complainant had made any statement with regard to the condition of the beaten down area.\nThere remains to be considered the second branch of the question, namely, as to whether or not the evidence of Robson could be properly regarded as corroborative of the evidence of the complainant with respect to the struggle which she alleged had taken place between herself and the appellant. To put the matter another way, while the complainant had not said that the grass was pressed down as the result of the struggle, she had given evidence of a struggle and Robson\u2019s evidence as to the condition he found would be consistent with a struggle having taken place at that point and therefore corroborative of the evidence of the complainant unless it were clearly established as a matter of fact that the struggle described in evidence by the complainant was of such a limited character that it could not have been the cause of an area of the extent described by Robson. In considering this matter, it is to be remembered that if the complainant\u2019s evidence that she did not consent and that she was attacked was accepted by the jury, the latter may well have considered that the complainant was not to be held literally to her account of the struggle as she was not, in her agitated condition in the circumstances of the attack, likely to have noted it in detail or to have remembered it fully afterwards. Giving due weight to the circumstances, the jury may well have considered that no difficulty arose in this matter. In my view, this was a matter of fact entirely for the jury and no ground is presented for interference by the court. This question of fact was expressly left to the jury as such in the second passage of the charge to which I have referred, namely: \u201cIndicating that there was perhaps some struggle or evasion\u2014it is for you gentlemen to say\u2014there was a beaten down area in the grass and weeds there of some twenty feet by six\u201d. The learned dissenting judge refers to this part of the charge but takes the view that the complainant\u2019s description of the struggle and the extent of the beaten down area were quite inconsistent the one with the other. This is a finding of fact. With respect, this was, in my opinion, a matter purely within the province of the jury.\nThe fact that appellant had given evidence that the area was beaten down when he and the complainant first arrived at the place has no relevancy to the point under discussion. The learned trial judge in the passage of his charge referred to, was not dealing with any evidence given by the appellant, but was dealing with the evidence of the complainant and some aspects in which her evidence was corroborated by that of Robson. He had already charged the jury\u2014\nThere are two things that I wish to stress in regard to the facts of the case as apart from the law: in my review I cannot pretend to review everything; I try to assist you with a review of some of the more important parts of the evidence, but that does not relieve you from your duty, with your twelve joint memories, of recollecting and considering anything that may be of importance in deciding the real issue in this case; and if I express an opinion on the facts, or seem to express an opinion, you are not bound to follow my opinion unless your own happens to be the same.\nViewing the evidence as I do, there is no question of law involved in the dissent below, but merely matters of fact. I would, therefore, quash the appeal.\nRAND J.\u2014This is an appeal by the accused from a conviction for rape and comes here through the dissent in the Court of Appeal for Ontario of Laidlaw, J.A., on a point of law.\nThe only issue at the trial was consent or no consent, and the point on which the dissent arose was in relation to a portion of the judge\u2019s charge which dealt with corroboration.\nThe woman was twenty years of age and the young man eighteen. Her story was of struggle until exhaustion, although terrified by threats of bodily injury. The occurrence took place a short distance in the country from the city of Hamilton in a low-lying area about twenty feet by six, over which the grass had been beaten down until it was almost flat. Pictures of the surrounding land indicated the grass to be fairly high and somewhat coarse and heavy.\nA witness, who had reached the spot while the accused was still there and naked, gave evidence of that state of the grass. The complainant had not in her evidence referred to it. The accused gave a similar description of it but added that it was in that condition when he and the complainant had come to it. This latter feature was not challenged either in cross\u2011examination or in rebuttal.\nIn his charge to the jury, the trial judge used the following language:\nThey told you how she arrived at the house with nothing but her skirt and jacket on, and they described the condition of the area twenty feet by six where the grass was pressed down. So in several matters they corroborated the evidence of Eva Pettigrew as she gave it in the witness box here to-day.\nAnd later in the charge:\nIndicating that there was perhaps some struggle or evasion\u2014it is for you gentlemen to say\u2014there was a beaten down area in the grass and weeds there of some twenty feet by six. In the peculiar circumstances of the case presented, extraordinary even as told by the complainant, and in view of the sole issue before the jury, I doubt that any single suggestion could have carried more weight to incline the balance of their judgment than that the grass in this spot might have shown the condition it did as a result of her struggles. So far, however, from that being the fact, it is beyond controversy, on the evidence, that the state of the surface of the area could not have furnished the slightest corroboration to the story of the complainant or to the case of the Crown. It was, therefore, a misdirection in law and of such a nature that we are quite unable to say that it might not have influenced the jury in reaching their verdict.\nThe conviction should, therefore, be quashed and a new trial directed.\nAppeal allowed, conviction quashed, and new trial directed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Herbert Freshman.\n[1] 81 Can.

Act.\nThe Quebec Railway, Light & Power Company applied for an order of the Board of Transport Commissioners approving its tariff of tolls for the carriage of passengers on the motor busses operated by it; while the town of Beauport petitioned the Quebec Public Service Board for an order by which the same tolls would be fixed. The Board of Transport Commissioners dismissed the company's application for want of jurisdiction; while the appellate count of Quebec, reversing the decision of the President of the Public Service Board, held that that Board was without jurisdiction to deal with such tolls on the ground that the railway company fell under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal board. The decisions being contradictory, both the railway company and the town of Beauport appealed to this Court.\nHeld, Davis and Hudson JJ. dissenting, that the fixing of fares, or tolls, to be charged by the railway company in respect of its motor bus service, was within federal jurisdiction; but that federal legislation was lacking, as regulation of tolls over such service is not included in the powers granted to the Board of Transport Commissioners.\nPer Davis and Hudson JJ. dissenting.\u2014Jurisdiction over the fares, or tolls, of the railway company's autobus system is vested in the province. Such jurisdiction has not been transferred to the Dominion under Dominion Acts and should be exercised by the Quebec Public Service Board.\nPer Rinfret J. and Kerwin J.:\u2014A Dominion Act of 1895 declared the \"undertaking of the (railway) company * * * a work for the general advantage of Canada\" and thus brought the company under the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada (Quebec R. L. & P. Co. v. Montcalm Land Co. [1927] S.C.R. 545). The word \"undertaking\" as used in the statute comprises the whole of the works of the company, not only the works existing in 1895 but all its future enterprises. The auto busses owned and operated by the company fall within the meaning of the term \"works\" in head 10 (c) of section 92 B.N.A. Act and, therefore, can properly be brought and integrated into the \"undertaking\".\nPer Rand J:\u2014The steam railway and the tramway system of the company are both within the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion (Montcalm Land Co.'s case, supra). The works of the company are, in the jurisdictional aspect, to be considered as if they had been specifically set forth in section 91 (29) of the B.N.A. Act. The federal legislation of 1939, adding the power to operate auto busses is within the scope of the legislative field appropriate to the subject matter of the declaration in the Dominion Act of 1895. It cannot be denied to such an undertaking modifications in operational means and methods designed more efficiently to carry out its original and essential purposes. The controlling fact is that the identity of the works is presented: they remain in substance the works of transportation dealt with by the declaration.\nPer Rinfret, Kerwin and Rand JJ:\u2014The proviso of the amending federal Act of 1939 whereby the power to operate auto busses \"subject to all provincial and municipal enactments\" was conferred, does not give to the provincial Board jurisdiction to deal with the fares and tolls to be charged by the company. Such proviso made autobus service amenable to provincial laws for certain purposes, e.g. the right to license and regulate traffic, but the exclusive field of the Dominion as to regulation of rates is unaffected by that Act.\nPer Davis J. (dissenting):\u2014The generality of the language of the subsection (2) added by the Dominion Act of 1939, imposing a condition on the grant of the power to operate auto busses, is sufficient to involve the regulation and control by the province of the motor busses on the municipal and provincial highways of the province, and the fixing of fares or tolls, for uniformity or otherwise, by a provincial board comes within the condition, upon a proper construction of the subsection.\nPer Hudson J. (dissenting):\u2014The declaration contained in the Dominion Act of 1895 does not, and never was intended by Parliament to, extend to the operation of auto busses on the highways, either in respect of the regulations of rates or otherwise.\nAPPEAL from an order of the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada[1], ruling that the Board had no jurisdiction in the matter of the fares, or tolls, to be charged by the Quebec Railway Light & Power Company in respect of the motor bus service operated by it; and\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[2], which, reversing the judgment of the President of the Quebec Public Service Board[3], held that such matter was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal Board.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-notes and in the judgments now reported.\nIn the first appeal:\nPaul Taschereau K.C. for the appellant.\nY. Pr\u00e9vost for the respondent: Town of Beauport.\nF. Dorion K.C. for the respondent: Town of Courville.\nC. Stein for the Attorney General for Canada.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and R. Genest K.C. for the Attorney General for Quebec.\nIn the second appeal:\nGuy Hudon K.C. for the appellant.\nP. H. Bouffard K.C. for the respondent.\nC. Stein for the Attorney General for Canada.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C and L. A. Pouliot K.C. for the Attorney General for Quebec. Rinfret J.\u2014These are two appeals, heard together by this Court, which raise an identical question: whether the fares, or tolls, to be charged by the Quebec Railway Light & Power Co. in respect of its motor bus service are within the jurisdiction of the Quebec Public Service Board, or whether they are within the jurisdiction of the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada, or, in other words, whether these fares and tolls come under the provincial or under the federal authority.\nI do not propose to go in detail into the history of the Quebec Railway Light & Power Co., except in so far as it seems to me necessary for the purpose of explaining the grounds upon which I base my conclusions.\nThe company was originally incorporated by an Act of the legislature of the province of Quebec (Statutes of Quebec, 44-45 Victoria, c. 44) under the name of the Quebec, Montmorency and Charlevoix Railway Company. It was then undoubtedly a local provincial company, operating a railway solely within the province of Quebec.\nLater, in 1894, the powers of the company were extended to permit it to operate an electric tramway within the limits of the city of Quebec and this was also done by legislation of the province of Quebec.\nBut in 1895 the parliament of Canada passed an Act (58-59 Victoria, c. 59) constituting the company a federal corporation; and sections (1) and (2) of that Act read as follows:\u2014\n(1) The undertaking of the Quebec, Montmorency and Charlevoix Railway Company, a body incorporated as mentioned in the preamble, and hereinafter called \"the Company\", is hereby declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada.\n(2) The Company as now organized and constituted under the said Acts of the province of Quebec is hereby declared to be a body politic and corporate within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada; and this Act and The Railway Act of Canada shall apply to the Company and its undertaking, instead of the said Acts of the province of Quebec and The Railway Act of Quebec: Provided that nothing in this section shall affect anything done, any rights or privilege acquired, or any liability incurred under the said Acts of the province of Quebec, prior to the time of the passing of this Act,\u2014to all which rights and privileges the Company shall continue to be entitled and to all of which liabilities the Company shall continue to be subject.\nThe undertaking of the company was, therefore, \"declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada\"; and, furthermore, the company was declared to be a body politic and corporate within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada;\nand\nthis Act (that is to say, the Dominion Act of 1895) and The Railway Act of Canada were declared to apply to the company and its undertaking, instead of the Acts of the province of Quebec and The Railway Act of Quebec.\nThe same Act also contained the following section:\u2014\n(8) The Company may use and employ for the locomotion and propulsion of its cars, vehicles and rolling stock, where such power is required, electricity in all its forms, steam, and any approved mechanical power or other means, agency or force for such purposes that science or invention may develop,\u2014and shall have all rights, powers and privileges necessary and essential to the management, operation and maintenance of its line as an electrical system either in whole or in part; and may acquire, use and develop every kind of electrical force, power and energy required or useful in the working of the undertaking, and apply such agencies and motive power for all its uses and purposes aforesaid.\nIn 1899 the name of the company was changed to the Quebec Railway Light and' Power Company, its present name.\nIn 1939 the following subsection (2) was added by Parliament to the above section (8) by statute of Canada, 3 Geo. VI, c. 56:\u2014\n(2) It is enacted and declared that the Company's now existing powers apart from any limitations with respect to the use of steam, include the power to own, maintain, lease, possess and operate auto busses, trolley busses and all kinds of public or private conveyances whether propelled or moved by oil, vapour or other motor or mechanical power in, over and throughout any of the territory in which it is now authorized to operate, subject to all provincial and municipal enactments, in respect to highways and motor vehicles operated thereon and applicable thereto.\nIn my mind the legislation already reproduced is all that is necessary to be referred to for the purposes of the decision which we have to render.\nAs will be noticed, by the amendment of 1939 it was declared that the company's powers \"include the power to own, maintain, lease, possess and operate auto busses\".\nAccordingly, the company applied for an order of the Board of Transport Commissioners approving its tariff of tolls for the carriage of passengers on the motor busses operated by it between the village of Boischatel and the city of Quebec. On the other hand, the town of Beauport petitioned the Quebec Public Service Board for an order prescribing certain improvements in the service of the same auto busses, but mainly with the object of having fixed the rates and tolls on the same line.\nThe Board of Transport Commissioners dismissed the application of the railway company on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to deal with the company's tariffs of tolls or rates in question here; but on the petition of the town of Beauport to the Quebec Public Service Board, while the President of that Board[4] held that it had jurisdiction to entertain the request of the town, the judgment of the President went before the Court of King's Bench (appeal side)[5] which held that the provincial board had no jurisdiction and that the railway company, in the exercise of its statutory rights, fell under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada.\nThe two decisions being contradictory, the result was that both the town of Beauport appealed to this Court from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) and the Quebec Railway Light and Power Company appealed from the decision of the Board of Transport Commissioners.\nThe question to be decided is whether the control of the tariffs of the autobus rates and tolls of the Quebec Railway Light and Power Company comes under the jurisdiction of the provincial Public Service Board of Quebec, or under the jurisdiction of the Dominion Board of Transport Commissioners; and that is the only question at issue in the two appeals before this Court.\nIt is common ground that the railway company operates its autobus service between Jacques Cartier Square in the city of Quebec and the village of Boischatel, and that it holds a permit from the Public Service Board of the province; but also that, since the legislation of 1895 declaring the undertaking of the company to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, both the steam railway and the tramway system of the Quebec Railway Company are under the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion. It was so decided in a judgment of this. Court in Quebec Railway, Light & Power Co. v. Montcalm Land Co.[6].\nIn my opinion the autobus system also comes within the jurisdiction of the Dominion.\nIn 1895 the Dominion Act (58-59 Victoria, c. 59), declared the \"undertaking of the company * * * a work for the general advantage of Canada\". Obviously this was done to bring the company under the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada by force of subsection (10) (c) of section (92) of The British North America Act. The effect of such a declaration is to bring the work which is the subject thereof under subsection (29) of section (91) of the Act,\nMoreover, the company, by section (2) of the Dominion Act (58-59 Victoria, c. 59), is specifically declared to be \"a body politic and corporate within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada\"; and it is further enacted by the same section that\nthis Act and The Railway Act of Canada shall apply to the Company and its undertaking, instead of the said Acts of the province of Quebec and The Railway Act of Quebec.\nIt was argued that the declaration that the work was for the general advantage of Canada applied only to the undertaking as it stood in 1895, but, in my view, the declaration extends to the whole of the undertaking of the company, railway, tramway and autobus, for several reasons.\nMost of what was said and decided by this Court in the Montcalm Land case6 equally applies in the premises. As was said by Mr. Justice Newcombe, at p. 559 of the report of that case:\u2014\nOne must look to what the respondents' claim involves; it is nothing less than provincial statutory compulsion of a Dominion railway corporation, either to exercise powers which Parliament has not conferred, or, in the exercise of its competent Dominion powers, to submit to provincial review and regulations, followed in either case by the consequence that, for failure to comply with the provincial order, the company may forcibly be deprived of its property, powers, rights and management, and ultimately subjected to an action for its dissolution; and this notwithstanding what is undoubtedly true that neither the constitution and powers of the company nor its authorized undertaking is subject to the legislative authority of the province. It is needless to say that these things cannot be done. The declaration that the undertaking is for the general advantage of Canada may not be severed; it must be understood to apply to the whole of the undertaking. As was said Mr. Justice Newcombe, it is impossible to admit of a dual control over the essential functions of a federal work.\nIt may be true that it was only by the Act of 1939 that the power to own, maintain, lease, possess and operate auto busses was for the first time specifically mentioned in the Acts respecting the company, but the Act of 1939 (3 Geo. VI, c. 56) was only declaratory. It must be noted that it is expressed in the following words:\u2014\nThe Company's now existing powers * * * include the power to own, maintain, etc., auto busses.\nWhile it may be said that the word \"undertaking\" in the Act of 1895 covers all future enterprises of the company and means the railway and works of whatsoever description which the company has authority to construct and to operate (Railway Act, section 2-35), it must be noted that the powers of the company, as defined in its original charters, although making no reference to auto busses in particular, are very broad and include the\npropulsion of vehicles and rolling stock by any means, agency, or force that science or invention may develop\n(section (6) of the statutes of Canada, 58-59 Victoria, c. 59).\nIt was further argued that a bus line is neither a physical thing nor a work susceptible of being made the subject of a declaration under subsection (10) (c) of section (92) of The British North America Act; and that, consequently, the declaration that the undertaking of the company was for the general advantage of Canada was ineffective to bring the autobus service under the federal jurisdiction. It was said that a work must have a locus, which obviously, it was alleged, the autobus service was utterly incapable of possessing and that, therefore, the declaration contained in the Dominion Act was inappropriate to bring the autobus system under the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada. However, I would refer to what was said by Lord Dunedin in In re Regulation and Control of Radio Communication in Canada[7].\n\"Undertaking\" is not a physical thing, but is an arrangement under which, of course, physical things are used.\nApplying that statement to the situation in the present case, I would be inclined to think that the word \"undertaking\" as used in the statute comprises the whole of the works of the company, which, upon that interpretation, were all included in the declaration that they were for the general advantage of Canada.\nAccordingly, I am of opinion that the auto busses of the company can properly be brought and integrated into the undertaking which was declared to be for the general advantage of Canada. It would appear that it was the intention of Parliament that newly acquired works would fall within the declaration.\nMuch was made in the argument of the amendment inserted in 1939, whereby the power to operate auto busses was stated to be\nsubject to all provincial and municipal enactments in respect to highways and motor vehicles operated thereon and applicable thereto.\nUndoubtedly it could not be contended that for certain purposes the autobus service is not amenable to the provincial laws, but, in my view, that must mean: provincial laws of general application. (Lukey v. Ruthenian Farmers' Elevator Co. Ltd.[8]; John Deere Plow Co. Ltd. v. Wharton[9].\nThe province has the control of its highways (Provincial Secretary of Prince Edward Island v. Egan[10]. It has to maintain them and to look after the safety and convenience of the public by regulating and controlling the traffic thereon. An instance of the exercise of that control by the province might be the fact that the railway company held a permit from the Quebec Public Service Board; but I do not think that the submission to provincial and municipal enactments can be extended to anything beyond the regulations of the character just mentioned and surely not, in my opinion, to the tariffs of rates and tolls of the company, which are made the subject of special laws and enactments under federal legislation and, in particular, under The Railway Act of Canada. Otherwise there would be that dual control, already adverted to and rendering the proper working and operations of the company practically impossible.\nNow, The Railway Act of Canada deals with tolls and, having regard to all that I have said so far, my conclusions would have been that, in the premises, the Act should apply mutatis mutandis to the fixing of rates for the autobus system of the Quebec Railway Light & Power Co., in respect of which the Board of Transport Commissioners may exercise its jurisdiction.\nIt is true, nevertheless, that the Dominion Railway Act does not specifically refer to the regulation of bus lines and it may be that the specific power to deal with autobus traffic is not given to the Board of Transport Commissioners.\nTwo of my colleagues who, like me, are of the opinion that there is federal jurisdiction in relation to the auto bus tolls have come to the conclusion that the regulation of tolls over services of auto busses is not included in the powers of the Board of Transport Commissioners. In the circumstances, although personally I would be inclined to share the view expressed in his reasons for judgment by the Deputy Chief Commissioner, I will agree with the conclusions of my brothers Kerwin and Rand.\nIt follows that each appeal should be dismissed with costs, except that there should be no costs to or against either intervenant.\nDavis J.\u2014The appeals in these two cases were heard together. They raise the question whether the Quebec Public Service Board (a provincial board) or the Dominion Transport Board has the authority to fix the fares or tolls to be charged by the Quebec Railway, Light & Power Company in respect of its motor bus services. One appeal is from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) of the province of Quebec[11] which, reversing the decision of the President of the Quebec Public Service Board,[12] held that it was not a matter properly for determination by the provincial board on the ground that the Dominion Board of Transport Commissioners had exclusive jurisdiction in the matter. The other appeal is from the order of the Board of Transport Commissioners which decided that it had no jurisdiction in the matter of fares or tolls on motor buses. While it was not suggested on the argument, I should have thought it might well be that neither the provincial board nor the Dominion Board had clear authority to control and fix the fares. It seemed to be taken for granted, however, that one or the other of the boards must have authority.\nIf the railway company were a provincial company, there would appear to be no lack of jurisdiction in the provincial board, but the railway company having been declared by Dominion legislation some years ago to be a company within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, it was contended that it was beyond the control of a provincial board, and that it was only the Dominion Transport Board that has jurisdiction over the company and the fares and tolls that it is entitled to charge. Shortly stated, that is the problem which is presented to the Court in these appeals.\nThe railway company, under the name of the Quebec, Montmorency and Charlevoix Railway Company, was originally incorporated, in 1881, by an Act of the legislature of the province of Quebec, 44-45 Vic., c. 44. It was a local provincial company, owning and operating a railway solely within the province of Quebec. In 1894 the province of Quebec, by 57 Vic., c 71 (passed January 8th, 1894), extended the power of the Company to operate an electric tramway within the city of Quebec Subsequently, in 1895, by 58-59 Vic., c 59, the Parliament of Canada constituted the company a body corporate within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. Sections 1 and 2 of the said Act of Parliament read as follows:\u2014\n1. The undertaking of the Quebec, Montmorency and Charlevoix Railway Company, a body incorporated as mentioned in the preamble, and hereinafter called \"the company\", is hereby declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada. 2. The Company as now organized and constituted under the said Acts of the province of Quebec is hereby declared to be a body politic and corporate within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada; and this Act and The Railway Act of Canada shall apply to the Company and its undertaking, instead of the said Acts of the province of Quebec and The Railway Act of. Quebec: Provided that nothing in this section shall affect anything done, any rights or privilege acquired, or any liability incurred under the said Acts of the province of Quebec prior to the time of the passing of this Act,\u2014to all which rights and privileges the Company shall continue to be entitled and to all of which liabilities the Company shall continue to be subject.\nMuch of the argument turns upon an amendment to the Dominion statute made by Parliament in 1939 whereby a subsection was added to section 8 of the original Act. It is important, therefore, to set out section 8 as it appeared in the original Act and remained untouched until 1939:\n8. The Company may use and employ for the locomotion and propulsion of its cars, vehicles and rolling stock, where such power is required, electricity in all its forms, steam, and any approved mechanical power or other means, agency or force for such purposes that science or invention may develop,\u2014and shall have all rights, powers and privileges necessary and essential to the management, operation and maintenance of its line as an electrical system, either in whole or in part; and may acquire, use and develop every kind of electrical force, power and energy required or useful in the working of the undertaking, and apply such agencies and motive powers for all its uses and purposes aforesaid.\nIn 1939, then, by Act of Parliament, 3 Geo. VI, c. 56, the following was added as subsection (2) of section 8 of the original Act:\n(2) It is enacted and declared that the Company's now existing powers apart from any limitations with respect to the use of steam, include the power to own, maintain, lease, possess and operate auto busses, trolley busses and all kinds of public or private conveyances whether propelled or moved by oil, vapour or other motor or mechanical power in, over and throughout any of the territory in which it is now authorized to operate, subject to all provincial and municipal enactments, in respect to highways and motor vehicles operated thereon and applicable thereto.\nIt almost strikes one at a glance that the controversy must turn upon the meaning and scope of the concluding words of the added subsection\nsubject to all provincial and municipal enactments, in respect to highways and motor vehicles operated thereon and applicable thereto.\nThe railway company appears to have acquired and operated motor busses some little time prior to the amendment of 1939 and has continued to own and operate motor busses on municipal and provincial highways solely within the province of Quebec since that time. The town of Beauport desired to have the fares or tolls to be charged by the company in connection with the operation of its motor busses fixed by the provincial board known as the Quebec Public Service Board and the company desired its tariff to be fixed by the Dominion Board of Transport Commissioners.\nThose who argued against the authority of the Dominion board and in favour of the authority of the provincial board, very strenuously pressed upon us the contention that the word \"undertaking\" used in section 1 of the Act of Parliament, 58-59 Vic., c. 59, above quoted, was not an appropriate word to cover, and does not cover, the rolling stock of the company, particularly the motor busses; the specific purpose of this argument being to establish the contention that the motor busses of the company cannot be regarded in law, under the wording of section 1, as \"a work for the general advantage of Canada.\" What is said is that the authority of Parliament under section 92, head 10 (c) of the British North America Act is limited to \"Works\"\u2014and does not mention \"undertakings.\" It may be convenient here to set out section 92 (10):\n92. In each province the legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated; that is to say,\u2014\n10. Local works and undertakings other than such as are of the following classes:\u2014\n(a) Lines of steam or other ships, railways, canals, telegraphs, and other works and undertakings connecting the province with any other or others of the provinces, or extending beyond the limits of the province;\n(b) Lines of steam ships between the province and any. British or foreign country;\n(c) Such works as, although wholly situate within the province, are before or after their execution declared by the Parliament of Canada to be for the general advantage of Canada or for the advantage of two or more of the provinces.\nWhile the opening words of 10 are \"Local works and undertakings\" and (a) uses \"other works and undertakings,\" (b) uses neither word \"works\" nor \"undertakings,\" and (c) uses only the word \"works.\" The argument is that the \"undertaking\" of the company was not validly declared a work for the general advantage of Canada\u2014that the authority of Parliament is by 10 (c) limited to \"works\". A sentence is taken from the judgment of Lord Dunedin in the Radio case,[13] as a definition of these words \"undertaking\" and \"works\" and applied to the construction of the particular Act of Parliament which is before us. The sentence used by Lord Dunedin is,\n\"Undertaking\" is not a physical thing, but is an arrangement under which of course physical things are used.\nIt was argued from that that when the Act of Parliament, 58-59 Vic., c. 59, declared the \"undertaking\" of the company to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, it did not touch or affect the \"works\" of the company and, particularly for the argument of these appeals, that the word \"undertaking\" does not touch or affect the motor busses of the company because they are physical things moving about from place to place. I find it difficult to accept such an interpretation of the particular statute. The effect of the statute would be nugatory on such an interpretation. It seems to me that the word \"undertaking\" there used involves the totality of the works of the company and that the effect of the statute was that they were declared to be for the general advantage of Canada. Such a declaration was within the competence of the Dominion Parliament when the meaning and scope of the statute is fairly construed. The argument was advanced obviously to put the motor busses of the company beyond Dominion control and place them within provincial control, but I do not think that any such strained construction of the statute as contended for is necessary even to accomplish that end.\nSection 2 of the Act of Parliament, 58-59 Vic., c. 59, declares the company\nto be a body politic and corporate within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.\nIn my opinion when Parliament in 1939 amended section 8 of its original Act of 1895 by adding thereto subsection (2) above quoted, it extended, or at least expressly defined, the power of the company to own, maintain and operate auto busses in, over and throughout any of the territory in which the company is authorized to operate. But Parliament made a conditional grant of the power\u2014the condition being that the exercise of the power was to be subject to all provincial and municipal enactments in respect of highways and motor vehicles operating thereon and applicable thereto. It might well lead to a state of chaos if a Dominion company had a right to operate motor vehicles on municipal and provincial highways according to its own ideas without reference to the provincial laws, rules and regulations governing the operation of other motor vehicles on the public highways in the province. For instance, you could not in any practical sense have a province requiring all motor vehicles to travel on the right hand side of the road and a Dominion company denying any authority of the province over it because it was a Dominion company, and asserting the right to run its motor vehicles on the left hand side of the road. Counsel for the company, confronted with such situations, admitted frankly that the company was undoubtedly liable to what he called \"all ordinary regulations of general application,\" respecting motor vehicles on provincial and municipal highways, but contended that that does not include the control or fixing of fares or tolls, because according to his argument you cannot read the word \"tolls\" into the general words of the subsection to which the power to operate motor busses is made subject. His contention is that the fixing of tolls for the motor busses, because the company itself is a railway company, comes under the Dominion Railway Act and the Dominion Transport Act.\nIn my opinion the generality of the language of the 1939 amendment imposing a condition on the grant of the power is sufficient to involve the regulation and control by the province of the motor busses on the municipal and provincial highways of the province; and the fixing of fares or tolls, for uniformity or otherwise, by a provincial board comes within the condition of the subsection upon a proper construction thereof. It was contended by the Dominion that that construction involves an unwarranted delegation of legislative authority beyond the power of Parliament. I think the principle is that stated in the John Deere Plow case[14]: It is enough for present purposes to say that the province cannot legislate so as to deprive a Dominion company of its status and powers. This does not mean that these powers can be exercised in contravention of the laws of the province restricting the rights of the public in the province generally. What it does mean is that the status and powers of a Dominion company as such cannot be destroyed by provincial legislation.\nAnd in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[15]:\nThey (their Lordships) cannot see how the power of making banks contribute to the public objects of the provinces where they carry on business can interfere at all with the power of making laws on the subject of banking, or with the power of incorporating banks.\nThe appeals should in my opinion be disposed of in accordance with the above conclusion.\nKerwin J.\u2014The Quebec Railway, Light and Power Company was formerly known as the Quebec, Montmorency and Charlevoix Railway Company. That company was incorporated by a special Act of the legislature of the province of Quebec. This Act was amended from time to time until by the year 1895 the Company had been authorized to own and operate a railway within a certain area of the province of Quebec and to own and operate an electric tramway within the city of Quebec and its environs. In 1895, the Parliament of Canada passed an Act embodying therein such provisions of the provincial Acts as were desired to be retained in force and enacting the following as sections 1 and 2:\n1. The undertaking of the Quebec, Montmorency and Charlevoix Railway Company, a body incorporated as mentioned in the preamble, and hereinafter called \"the Company\", is hereby declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada.\n2. The Company as now organized and constituted under the said Acts of the province of Quebec is hereby declared to be a body politic and corporate within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada; and this Act and The Railway Act of Canada shall apply to the Company and its undertaking, instead of the said. Acts of the province of Quebec and The Railway Act of Quebec: Provided that nothing in this section shall affect anything done, any rights or privilege acquired, or any liability incurred under the said Acts of the province of Quebec prior to the time of the passing of this Act,\u2014to all which rights and privileges the Company shall continue to be entitled and to all of which liabilities the Company shall continue to be subject.\nSubsequently the Company acquired from the Montmorency Electric Power Company the latter's business and undertaking and also the business and undertaking of the Quebec District Railway Company, and in 1899 its name was changed to its present title. The appellant company and the other companies mentioned were incorporated for provincial objects and it is only by virtue of the declaration in section 1 of the Act of 1895 that the Dominion could acquire any jurisdiction. That section was passed in pursuance of exception (c) to head 10 of section 92 of The British North America Act and no more extended meaning than the word \"works\" therein bears on its proper construction may be ascribed to the word \"undertaking\" in section 1 of the 1895 Act.\nIn the year 1939, section 8 of the Dominion Act of 1895 was amended by adding thereto subsection 2. As thus amended section 8 now reads:\u2014\n8 (1) The Company may use and employ for the locomotion and propulsion of its cars, vehicles and rolling stock, where such power is required, electricity in all its forms, steam, and any approved mechanical power or other means, agency or force for such purposes that science or invention may develop,\u2014and shall have all rights, powers and privileges necessary and essential to the management, operation and maintenance of its line as an electrical system, either in whole or in part; and may acquire, use and develop every kind of electrical force, power and energy required or useful in the working of the undertaking and apply such agencies and motive powers for all its uses and purposes aforesaid.\n(2) It is enacted and declared that the Company's now existing powers apart from any limitations with respect to the use of steam, include the power to own, maintain, lease, possess and operate auto busses, trolley busses and all kinds of public or private conveyances whether propelled or moved by oil, vapour or other motor or mechanical power in, over and throughout any of the territory in which it is now authorized to operate, subject to all provincial and municipal enactments, in respect to highways and motor vehicles operated thereon and applicable thereto.\nIt appears that some time prior to the enactment of the amendment of 1939 the Company had commenced to operate auto busses in the city of Quebec and adjoining territory. The meaning to be ascribed to the word \"works\" in exception (c) to head 10 of section 92 of The British North America Act has been considered in City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Ry. Co.[16]; Wilson v. Esquimau and Nanaimo Railway Company[17]; In Re Regulation and Control of Radio Communication in Canada[18]. Whatever the precise construction may be, I am satisfied that the busses owned and operated by the Company fall within the meaning of that term so that they would be part of the Company's works as much as the rails and tramcars of the Company's electric tramway system. As to these, it has been decided by this Court in Quebec Railway, Light and Power Company v. Montcalm Land Company[19], that the Quebec Public Service Commission (now the Public Service Board) had no jurisdiction to order the Company to cause its tramcars to run more frequently. Unless, therefore, the concluding words of the amendment of 1939,\nsubject to all provincial and municipal enactments, in respect to highways and motor vehicles operated thereon and applicable thereto,\nhave the effect of altering the position, the Public Service Board has no jurisdiction to deal with the fares or tolls to be charged by the Company for travel on its auto busses. The words quoted are not, in my opinion, apt to confer such a power. The proviso might apply to such things as the necessity of the busses to carry license plates and of the drivers thereof to obey the provincial or municipal regulations as to traffic, but it does not cover the fixing of fares. It was submitted by the Attorney General for the Dominion that Parliament would have no power to delegate such authority but, since I deem the proviso inapplicable, it is unnecessary to express any opinion upon the point.\nIt does not follow that jurisdiction must reside in The Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada. Upon the declaration being made that the works of the Company were for the general advantage of Canada,\nthe effect of subsection 10 of s. 92 of The British North America Act is * * * to transfer the * * * works mentioned * * * into s. 91 and thus to place them under the exclusive jurisdiction and control of the Dominion Parliament. City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Ry. Co.[20].\nIt is the \"works\", however, and not the Company that is thus brought within the jurisdiction of the Dominion. Section 2 of the 1895 Act cannot by itself effect any such result but the \"works\" being considered as an enumerated head of section 91, Parliament may enact such further legislation as is necessarily incidental to the exercise of its jurisdiction over them, and, in a proper case, it may be necessary to consider how far particular provisions of The Railway Act apply to them. Section 323 of that Act was referred to but in my view it has no application. The \"tolls\" therein mentioned are defined by clause 32 of section 2 but it seems plain that these provisions refer only to tolls for railways as defined in clause 21 of section 2. The word \"rolling stock\" used in the last mentioned clause, as defined in clause 24, clearly refers only to railways. It is not all charges made, even by a railway company, that fall within the jurisdiction of the Dominion Board. In re Powers as to Wharfage Charges[21].\nThe appeal in each case should be dismissed with costs, except that there should be no costs to or against either intervenant.\nHudson J.\u2014The main controversy in these appeals is whether the right to control rates on busses operated by the Quebec Railway, Light and Power Company on the streets and highways in the town of Beauport lies within the authority of the Transport Board of Canada or the Public Service Board of Quebec.\nThe Quebec Railway, Light and Power Company was incorporated by a statute of the legislature of Quebec but in 1895, by an Act of the Parliament of Canada, the undertaking of the Company was \"declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada\", and the Company as then organized was declared to be a body politic and corporate within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada and that the Railway Act of Canada should apply to the Company and its undertakings, instead of the Acts of the province of Quebec and the Railway Act of Quebec. By this and subsequent Acts the Company was given the ordinary powers of railway and tramway companies.\nIn 1939, by Act of Parliament, the Company's powers were extended by providing:\n8. (2) It is enacted and declared that the Company's now existing powers apart from any limitations with respect to the use of steam, include the power to own, maintain, lease, possess and operate auto busses, trolley busses and all kinds of public or private conveyances whether propelled or moved by oil, vapour or other motor or mechanical power in, over and throughout any of the territory in which it is now authorized to operate, subject to all provincial and municipal enactments, in respect to highways and motor vehicles operated thereon and applicable thereto. The right to license regulate and control traffic on streets and highways within a province lies with the legislature of such province. Such right has been actively exercised by the provinces since Confederation and has never been seriously challenged. It has been recognized by provincial courts on numerous occasions, and recently by this Court in the case of Provincial Secretary of Prince Edward Island v. Egan[22].\nThe right of the Dominion to interfere with such licence, regulation and control is confined strictly to matters falling within one or other of the enumerated heads of section 91 of The British North America Act.\nIt is contended here that the busses of the Quebec Railway, Light and Power Company and the operation thereof became part of the undertaking of the Company and fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion by virtue of the declaration made in 1895.\nUnlike other legislative powers allotted to the Dominion on the one hand and the provinces on the other, the jurisdiction transferred by declaration under section 92 (10) (c) of The British North America Act is conferred by an Act of the Parliament of Canada itself and may be repealed, varied, qualified or limited in its application, whenever that Parliament so decides. This is the effect of a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Hamilton, Grimsby and Beamsville Railway Company v. Attorney-General for Ontario[23]. There the Hamilton, Grimsby and Beamsville Railway had been incorporated by an Act of the legislature of Ontario. One of its lines crossed the railway line of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, a Dominion railway. By reason of the provision then existing in the Railway Act, all railways connected with or crossing a Dominion railway were deemed to be works for the general advantage of Canada. Subsequently, the Dominion Railway Act was amended and it was provided that such provincial railway should be a work for the general advantage of Canada, in respect only of the connection or crossing, and certain other matters not here relevant. A provincial board made an order with respect to sanitary conveniences on the provincial railway cars. This was contested on the ground that the railway had become a Dominion railway under the original declaration. However, it was held by the Judicial Committee that this was not so, that the Act could be repealed, or amended and, as stated by Lord Buckmaster,\nthe declaration is a declaration which can be varied by the same authority as that by which it was made\nand that in this instance it was properly varied.\nNew and subsequently acquired works may fall within such a declaration but it must appear that Parliament so intended.\nIn the present case the claim is that a declaration made in 1895 extended to works first authorized by Parliament in 1939.\nThe operation of autobusses was not necessarily incidental to the operation of the railway. Somewhat similar situations have been the subject of discussion in the House of Lords. In the case of London County Council v. Attorney-General[24]. Reading at p. 169 Lord Macnaghten said:\nThe London County Council are carrying on two businesses\u2014the business of a tramway company and the business of omnibus proprietors. For the one they have the express authority of Parliament; for the other, so far as I can see, they have no authority at all. It is quite true that the two businesses can be worked conveniently together; but the one is not incidental to the other. The business of an omnibus proprietor is no more incidental to the business of a tramway company than the business of steamship owners is incidental to the undertaking of a railway company which has its terminus at a seaport.\nIn the case of Attorney-General v. Mersey Railway Company[25], a similar decision was arrived at.\nHere, as in the two above mentioned cases, it appears that the railway company undertook the autobus business because of competition on the highway. I am satisfied that the railway company had no authority to carry on this autobus business until 1939.\nThe amendment of 1939 does not in terms transfer jurisdiction to the Dominion. In effect it rejects any assumption of control by the Dominion and expressly recognizes maintenance of provincial control. It is difficult to see how an authority to operate a new kind of service, subject to all provincial and municipal enactments in respect to highways and motor vehicles operated thereon and applicable thereto,\ncan be construed as evidencing an intention by Parliament to place such services under Dominion control.\nNeither in the Dominion Railway Act nor in any legislation applicable to this company is there any provision for control of traffic on the highways in respect of rates or otherwise. It has been suggested that the regulation of tolls and rates is essentially different from the control of physical things on the highways. I cannot see this. The highways are owned by the municipality or the province and it is the duty of the municipality to maintain them and to provide for the safety and convenience of the public thereon.\nThe regulation of rates charged by common carriers using highways is nowadays universally recognized as in the public interest. The fact that Parliament has not seen fit to make any provision for such regulation in the present case strongly supports the view that it was intended that such regulation should be left with the province, where such regulation was already in force.\nMy conclusion then is that the declaration of 1895 does not and never was intended by Parliament to extend to the operation of autobusses on the highways, either in respect of the regulation of rates or otherwise.\nIt was strongly argued that Parliament had no power to make a declaration under section 92 (10) (c) of the British North America Act affecting the right of control here in question. It was pointed out that on several occasions the Judicial Committee held that the word \"works\" used therein is confined to physical things, and that here the only physical things involved were busses which were not moving on rails the property of the railway company but freely amidst general traffic on a public highway. To my mind, this question is open to some doubt and, in view of the conclusion I have arrived at as to the intention of Parliament, it is unnecessary for me to express my opinion.\nI would allow the appeal in the case of Town of Beauport v. Quebec Railway, Light and Power Company, and dismiss the appeal in Quebec Railway, Light and Power Company v. Town of Beauport. Rand J.\u2014These two appeals raise the same questions of law and were argued together. The first is by the town of Beauport from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, holding that the regulation of tolls for autobus and tramway services, and of the quantum and quality of those services furnished by the Quebec Railway, Light and Power Company, was not within the legislative powers of the province; the second is from an order of The Board of Transport Commissioners dismissing an application by the Company for the approval of tolls for the same services.\nAt the time the proceedings were initiated, the Quebec Railway, Light and Power Company was carrying on within the city of Quebec and surrounding district a line of steam railway between the city and Cape Tourment, a point about thirty miles to the east, a tramway system serving the city proper, and as well an autobus service both within and without the city.\nBy a judgment of this court rendered in 1927 (Quebec Railway, Light and Power Co. v. Montcalm Land Co.[26]), it was held that, under the legislation of 1895 declaring the undertaking of the company to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, both the steam railway and the tramway system were within the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion.\nIn 1939 (3 Geo. VI, c. 56) the powers of the company were enlarged by the following provision:\n(2) It is enacted and declared that the Company's now existing powers apart from any limitations with respect to the use of steam, include the power to own, maintain, lease, possess and operate auto busses, trolley busses and all kinds of public or private conveyances whether propelled or moved by oil, vapour or other motor or mechanical power in, over and throughout any of the territory in which it is now authorized to operate, subject to all provincial and municipal enactments, in respect to highways and motor vehicles operated thereon and applicable thereto.\nThe autobus services have been integrated with those of both the railway and the tramway system. The company has provided for joint carriage by railway and autobus and by tram and autobus, both within and beyond the city. Questions may, therefore, arise as to tolls between points on the tramway system proper, between points on the autobus routes, and between points on either the railway or the tramway and on the autobus routes, and vice versa. Admittedly, all rates confined to the railway and the tramway are within the federal jurisdiction and the application of The Railway Act 1919. The question raised is whether the tolls applicable between points on the routes of the autobus services and between those points and points on the tramways are likewise within that exclusive jurisdiction and, if so, whether they come within the scope also of that Act.\nThe works of the company are, in the jurisdictional aspect, to be considered as if they had been specifically set forth in section 91 (29) of the B.N.A. Act. Was, then, the legislation of 1939, adding to the powers of the company, within the scope of the legislative field appropriate to the subject-matter of the declaration? I think it was. We cannot deny to such an undertaking modifications in operational means and methods designed more efficiently to carry out its original and essential purposes. The controlling fact is that the identity of the works is preserved: they remain in substance the works of transportation dealt with by the declaration.\nNor do I think there can be attributed to the last clause of that provision an effect which would nullify the operative part of the subsection. What was intended to be and was done was the creation of new powers in the federal works as such, and not merely the addition of a corporate capacity. The contrary view involves the introduction of a dual control over the essential functions of such an undertaking. The concluding language, therefore, must be taken to refer only to provincial regulation arising from ownership and control of highways which might affect features of the autobus operations. It is, at most, a legislative disclaimer of intention to encroach upon an area, in different aspects common to both jurisdictions: but the exclusive field of the Dominion, within which lies the regulation of rates, is unaffected.\nThe further question arises, however, whether The Railway Act 1919 extends to tolls either in respect of the autobus services proper or the joint services of autobus and tramway. By the enactment of 1895, section 2, The Railway Act of Canada is to apply to the undertaking of the company, and by section 323 of The Railway Act 1919 it is provided:\nNor shall the company charge, levy, or collect any toll or money for any service as a common carrier, except under and in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\nCan the regulation of tolls for autobus or joint autobus and tramway services be brought within the language of that legislation?\nThere can be little question that The Railway Act 1919, as its title indicates and as its provisions confirm, is concerned primarily with transportation by railways. Service \"as a common carrier,\" in the absence of a context clearly extending it, means, therefore, as a carrier by railway. All services incidental to that form of transportation are within the clause of section 323 quoted. But autobus services are not incidental to either the railway or the tramway: they are a new form of primary transportation. Now the word \"railway\" imports locomotion on or over \"rails,\" furnishing a service within fixed and rigid limits: and precise language would be necessary to bring within its scope transportation operations by means of power and vehicles unknown when the legislation was first enacted, with a service of a highly mobile character and involving different considerations of public policy. Closely associated with railway service is carriage by water, but this is the subject of special provisions of The Railway Act 1919. That enactment cannot, therefore, be held to embrace the regulation of tolls for autobus transportation, either alone or in conjunction with the tramway.\nThen, does the specific application of \"The Railway Act of Canada\" to the undertaking of the company by the legislation of 1895 add in any way to what otherwise would follow from the declaration? To hold that it does would be to imply a very broad mutatis mutandis which is not, in my opinion, warranted. The enactment of 1895 did no more than to apply the Dominion Act to such of the company's activities as were within its ambit.\nThere is, then, federal jurisdiction in relation to these tolls, but federal legislation is lacking. It is not suggested that there was in force in the province at the time of Confederation any law of carriers adequate or appropriate to fill the hiatus in that legislation. However inconvenient it may appear, therefore, it follows that the regulation of tolls for services in whole or in part by autobus is not within the powers of the Board of Transport; and as The Provincial Transportation and Communication Board Act is inapplicable within the exclusive dominion field, these tolls lie outside of any existing statutory control.\nThe same conclusion follows as to the regulation of the autobus services in the manner proposed.\nThe appeals should be dismissed with costs except as to the Intervenants.\nBoth appeals dismissed with costs, no costs to or against intervenants.\nIn the first appeal:\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taschereau, Parent & Cannon.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Town of Beauport: Gagnon, DeBilly, Pr\u00e9vost & Hone.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Town of Courville: Dorion, Dorion & No\u00ebl.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Village of Boischatel: Dumoulin & R\u00e9millard.\nSolicitor for the Attorney General for Canada: F.

Rand J. dissented.\nPer Rand J., dissenting: The underlying purpose and conception of s. 8 (1), which is reasonable provision for maintenance, is carried through into s. 8 (2), and what is envisaged is a determination \"in the opinion of the Court\" of what the actual maintenance of the widow\u2014the pecuniary dimensions of her actual living\u2014in the circumstances of intestacy would have been and to take the amount so found as the measure for determining the supplementary or original allowance called for by s. 8 (1). The Court is to exercise its judgment upon the resources that would go into actual maintenance under intestacy and to determine to what extent that would be received from the intestate share. The minimum allowance for maintenance should be what the reasonable maintenance of the widow, under the circumstances of intestacy, would have drawn from her share of the estate.\nAPPEAL by the City of Saskatoon from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1] rendered on an appeal by the said appellant and others from the judgment of Anderson J.[2] on an application of the present respondent under The Dependants' Relief Act, R.S.S. 1940, c. 111.\nElmer Shaw, late of Abernethy in the province of Saskatchewan, died on April 6, 1941, leaving his widow (the present respondent) and no children. He left a large estate. By his will, he gave to his wife a sum of money, his household furniture, etc., his motor car, the dwelling house on his farm for her lifetime, and an annuity. These and other provisions in his will are described in the judgments in the Courts below (above cited). His widow (the present respondent) applied in the Court of King's Bench, Saskatchewan, for relief under the said Act.\nFrom the judgment given on the first hearing of the application an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal and from its judgment an appeal was brought to this Court[3]. This Court agreed with the construction of the Act by the Court of Appeal to the effect that s. 8 (1) of the Act sets out a condition as a basis for the jurisdiction which enables the Court to intervene and that condition requires the Court to be of the opinion that reasonable provision has not been made in the will for the dependant to whom the application relates. This Court also agreed with the Court of Appeal in finding that, on the evidence before the Court, it could not be said that the deceased had by his will so disposed of his real or personal property that reasonable provision had not been made for the maintenance of his widow. This Court, however, held that leave should be given to file further material and remitted the matter to the Court of King's Bench, Saskatchewan.\nFurther material was filed, and the application came on for rehearing before Anderson J. in the said Court of King's Bench[4], who found on the evidence that the applicant had discharged the onus cast on her of proving that the testator had by his will so disposed of real and personal property that reasonable provision had not been made for the applicant's maintenance; and held that, by force of s. 8 (2) of the Act, the applicant was entitled to a one-third share in the estate; the will was to stand in full force and effect (including, inter alia, the provision for the payment of succession duties, etc., which by the will were payable out of residue) save with the variation that for the annuity given to the applicant by the will there was substituted one-third of the estate, as at the time of the testator's death, free from deductions or one-third clear. As a further reason for his order, Anderson J. held that, in the exercise of his discretion under s. 8 (1) and s. 8 (2), the applicant was entitled to the allowance made as being maintenance \"reasonable, just and equitable in the circumstances\".\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[5], that Court found that reasonable provision for the applicant's maintenance was not made by the terms of the will, and held that, the Court being obligated to comply with s. 8 (2) of the Act, the applicant should be awarded as an allowance under the provisions of the Act one-third of the estate after payment of debts, funeral and testamentary expenses, that the award should be paid out of the residue of the estate and stand in lieu of all the benefits provided for the applicant under the will, including the provision relieving her from payment of succession duty but excluding the bequests to her of the car, the household furniture and use of the house. (The Court found that such award would amply provide reasonable maintenance).\nThe appellant limited its appeal to this Court to the question of whether the Court, having found the testator did by his will so dispose of real and personal property that reasonable provision was not made for the maintenance of the applicant, was bound under said s. 8 (2) of the Act to award her one-third of the estate.\nG. H. Yule K.C. for the appellant.\nE. L. Leslie K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Hudson and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nHudson J.\u2014This controversy arises out of a claim by the respondent under The Dependants' Relief Act of Saskatchewan, to a share of her deceased husband's estate.\nThe late Mr. Shaw was a prosperous farmer residing in Saskatchewan and died there, leaving an estate of a value of over $300,000. By his will he provided for his widow a life annuity of $3,600 per annum, in addition to some small specific bequests. The Dependants' Relief Act, 1940 (c. 36), R.S.S. 1940, c. 111, provides that a dependant, i.e. wife, husband or child of a testator, may make an application to the Court for an order making reasonable provision for his or her maintenance. Section 8 defines the relief which may be granted on such application:\n8. (1) If upon an application the court is of opinion that the testator has by will so disposed of real or personal property that reasonable provision has not been made for the maintenance of the dependant to whom the application relates, then, subject to the following provisions and to such conditions and restrictions as the court deems fit, the court may, in its discretion, make an order charging the whole or any portion of the estate, in such proportion and in such manner as it deems proper, with payment of an allowance sufficient to provide such maintenance as the court thinks reasonable, just and equitable in the circumstances.\n(2) No allowance ordered to be made to the wife of the testator shall, in the opinion of the court, be less than she would have received if the husband had died intestate leaving a widow and children.\nMrs. Shaw, the respondent, applied to the Court for relief. The application was heard by Mr. Justice Anderson who held that under the will the testator had failed to make reasonable provision for the maintenance of his widow and that she thereby became entitled under subsection 2 to a one-third of the estate of the deceased, free from all deductions. Mr. Justice Anderson also held, in exercise of the discretion given to him by subsections 1 and 2 of section 8, that because of the mode of accumulation of the estate of the deceased as well as other relevant facts and circumstances he was of the opinion that an allowance of one-third of the estate for the widow was reasonable, just and equitable.\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeal sustained the judgment of Mr. Justice Anderson in holding that the allowance provided by the will was inadequate and that the applicant was entitled to one-third of the estate under subsection 2 of section 8, but held that she was not entitled to receive this free of deductions specified in the judgment. The point as to whether or not one-third was just and equitable under all of the circumstances was not dealt with.\nThe appeal to this Court was brought on behalf of one of the residuary beneficiaries. It was conceded here that the amount allowed by the will was insufficient and the appeal was expressly limited to a question of the construction of the Act. There was no cross-appeal in respect of the deductions.\nBefore giving consideration to the relevant language of the statute, it will be helpful to look at the law as to the rights of widows in Saskatchewan prior to the passing of this statute.\nIn early territorial days the common law right of a widow to dower was abolished, but in 1910-11 the Saskatchewan Legislature amended The Devolution of Estates Act providing that the widow of a man who died leaving a will by the terms of which his widow would, in the opinion of the judge before whom an application was made, receive less than she would have if he had died intestate leaving a widow and children, might apply to the Supreme Court for relief, and on such application the Court might make an allowance out of the estate as should in the opinion of the judge be equal to what would have gone to such widow under The Devolution of Estates Act.\nThese provisions, with slight alterations, were reenacted in 1918-19 and in several subsequent years, lastly by a separate Act entitled The Widows' Relief Act. In 1919 they came before the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal for consideration in a case of In re Baker Estate[6], and the statement of the late Mr. Justice Lamont at pp. 112 and 113 as to the purpose and effect of the statute is worthy of quotation at some length:\nThe language of secs, 11a and 11g clearly indicates an intention on the part of the Legislature to restrict the right of a man to dispose of his property by will to the exclusion of his wife.\nFrom the abolition of dower by the Territories' Real Property Act to the enactment of the above sections, a man living in the territory now forming this province had the power to dispose by will of all his property without making the slightest provision for his wife and children. Cases arose in which men willed away their property without making any, or sufficient, provision for the widow and cases of such hardship arose that the Legislature took steps to prevent the injustice being continued.\nThe Legislature had previously provided that in case a man died intestate leaving a widow and child, or children, one-third of his real and personal property should belong to the widow. The Act as it now stands gives the Court jurisdiction to place the widow in as favourable a position where her husband has made a will but in which he has not left her as large a share of his property as would have been hers had he died without a will.\nThe first question therefore is: Did the deceased Baker by his will leave his widow one-third of his real and personal estate?\nA perusal of the will shows that he did not. He left her only the income until she remarried, (if she should remarry) and even then she was directed to use that income for the maintenance of the children as well as herself. If she remarried, she lost it all.\nThe learned trial judge was of opinion that if a man made ample provision for the needs of his widow until she married another, whose duty it would be to provide for her maintenance, that she did not stand in need of \"relief\". With deference, I think he misinterpreted the language of sec. 11a. The \"relief\" for which a widow may apply to the Court is not the procuring of such a sum of money as will be sufficient to provide her with the necessaries of life according to her station. It is relief against the provisions of a will by which she has been left a lesser share of the property of her late husband than she would have received had he died intestate. If the will does not leave her the equivalent of what she would have received upon intestacy, she need not be bound by its terms but may apply to the Court for that equivalent. This is what the widow has done here, and in my opinion she is entitled to one-third of the estate.\nI do not see that either she or the children would be placed in any better position if the Court gave her that share in any of the ways provided by the Act other than by way of a lump sum. I think, therefore, she should be given a lump sum.\nThe decision in the Baker case[7] was followed in subsequent cases: In re Bursaw Estate[8], and Williams v. Moody[9], so that it was the accepted law in that province until the Act of 1940 that a widow had an absolute right to a one-third share in her late husband's estate, save where there was available to the executors or administrators of the husband an answer or defence in any suit for alimony.\nThe Dependants' Relief Act, passed in 1940, is an Act to provide relief for dependents including not merely a wife but also a husband and children. Section 8 (1) includes any dependant and authorizes the Court to make an order for such maintenance as the Court thinks reasonable, \"subject to the following provisions * * *.\"\nThe first following provision is subsection 2 which relates only to a dependant who is a wife and, in her case, provides that no allowance shall, in the opinion of the Court, be less than she would have received if the husband had died intestate, etc. This language is the language of the provision in The Widows' Relief Act until then in force, as is subsection 3 of section 8.\nMr. Yule in a very careful argument contended that from section 3 and section 8 (1) it was perfectly clear that what the Legislature had in mind was to provide reasonable maintenance for the dependant, whether such dependant was a wife or otherwise, that subsection 2 could not be reconciled with a number of other sections of the Act, and that if it were given the construction of the Courts below it would create a most unreasonable situation, particularly in the case of large estates, that for these reasons the provision of subsection 2 of section 8 should be disregarded.\nIt does not seem to me that the Court should accede to these arguments. The language of subsection 2 of section 8 is clear. It does not create a new or unknown right but recognizes, subject only to the provisions of section 8 (1), a state of things that had existed under the law of Saskatchewan as repeatedly stated by the Legislature and the Courts over a period of thirty years. It would not be right to attribute to the Legislature an intention to reduce the pre-existing provision for the benefit of the widow, unless expressed in clear and definite language. Here the language is an affirmation and not a denial of the right.\nIn respect of the conflict with other sections of the Act, as pointed out by Chief Justice Martin, it may well be that these provisions are not applicable to a case where a widow is allotted one-third of the estate. But these provisions are still applicable to cases where a periodic allowance is directed, and the fact that the provisions of the statute are not applicable to an order made under section 8 (2) cannot affect the plain meaning of the words used in that section and which constitute an exception in favour of the widow.\nIt may be that the statute will sometimes produce unreasonable results, particularly in the case of large estates, but in enactments of this character unreasonable or unfair instances are bound to occur. The Legislature was, no doubt, legislating with an eye to the average case, and it does not appear that in such an average case in the Province of Saskatchewan the present statute would create any undue hardship, particularly in view of what the widow would have got in that province at any time during the preceding thirty years.\nI agree with the Court of Appeal. Having come to this conclusion, it is unnecessary to deal with the finding of Mr. Justice Anderson, that in any event a one-third interest would be reasonable considering the way in which the estate had been accumulated. If it had been necessary to decide this question, then I think the matter should be referred back to the Court of Appeal because we have not here the evidence upon which Mr. Justice Anderson's finding is based.\nI would dismiss the appeal, costs of all parties to be paid out of the estate.\nRand J. (dissenting)\u2014This appeal raises a question of the interpretation of The Dependants' Relief Act, 1940, of Saskatchewan. That Act is designed to assure provision for a minimum maintenance for dependants notwithstanding contrary testamentary disposition. Dependants include husband, wife, and children either under twenty-one years of age or unable, by reason of either physical or mental disability, to earn a livelihood.\nThe pertinent sections are as follows:\n3. Where a person dies domiciled in Saskatchewan, leaving a will and leaving a dependant or dependants, an application may be made to the Court of King's Bench by or on behalf of any dependant for an order making reasonable provision for his or her maintenance.\n8. (1) If upon an application the court is of opinion that the testator has by will so disposed of real or personal property that reasonable provision has not been made for the maintenance of the dependant to whom the application relates, then, subject to the following provisions and to such conditions and restrictions as the court deems fit, the court may, in its discretion, make an order charging the whole or any portion of the estate, in such proportion and in such manner as it deems proper, with payment of an allowance sufficient to provide such maintenance as the court thinks reasonable, just and equitable in the circumstances.\n(2) No allowance ordered to be made to the wife of the testator shall, in the opinion of the court, be less than she would have received if the husband had died intestate leaving a widow and children.\n13. (1) Where an order is made under this Act, then for all purposes, including the purposes of enactments relating to succession duties, the will shall have effect, and shall be deemed to have had effect as from the testator's death, as if it had been executed, with such variations as are specified in the order, for the purpose of giving effect to the provision for maintenance made by the order. (2) The court may give such consequential directions as it thinks fit for the purpose of giving effect to an order, but no larger part of the estate shall be set aside or appropriated to answer by the income thereof the provision for maintenance thereby made than such a part as, at the date of the order, is sufficient to produce by the income thereof the amount of the said provision.\n(3) A certified copy of every order made under this Act shall be filed with the clerk of the surrogate court out of which the letters probate or letters of administration with the will annexed issued, and a memorandum of the order shall be indorsed on, or annexed to, the original letters probate or letters of administration with the will annexed, as the case may be.\n16. No dependant for whom provision is made pursuant to this Act shall anticipate the same, and no mortgage, charge or assignment of any kind whatsoever of or over such provision made before the order of the court shall be of any force, validity or effect.\nFrom the language of section 8 (1) it will be seen that the condition of jurisdiction to make an order is that the Court, by reason of the dispositions of the will, should find that reasonable provision has not been made for the maintenance of the dependant. With that finding made, the scope of the Court's duty as well as discretion is clearly indicated. Subsection 5 of the same section requires the Court, in addition to the other considerations laid down, to have regard to the pecuniary resources of the dependant. The legislation, therefore, is intended to operate on the estate by permitting the Courts to supplement the means of the dependant, whether arising from the will or existing dehors, so as to secure to him a maintenance that in the opinion of the Court will be reasonable, just and equitable in the circumstances.\nThe applicant here was the widow. The Court found that the will did not make an allowance to her sufficient to satisfy the requirements of section 8 (1). It then proceeded to make an order under that subsection. At this point subsection (2) entered and, in its construction of that provision, the Court held that it was bound, as a minimum sufficient in the circumstances, to award to the widow the undivided share she would have received had the husband died intestate leaving children. This, under the intestate statute, would be one-third of the net estate. The question is whether or not the Court, in so construing the provision, was right.\nIn its ascertainment of the preliminary question, the Court came to the conclusion that an annual allowance of $5,559.40 would have satisfied the subsection. The will made provision for annual payments to the widow of $3,600. She enjoyed a private income of $1,200; and, disregarding certain other bequests to her, the difference between these two amounts, $5,559.40 and $4,800, was found to represent the sum by which her reasonable maintenance exceeded what, by the effect of the will, was available to her. The estate was of a gross value of $332,712.30. In addition to the annuity, there was bequeathed to the wife a legacy of $1,000, a life interest in the home, furniture valued at $750 and a motor car valued at $750. All succession duty was payable out of the residue. The award to the widow of one-third of the corpus did not, by the judgment below, displace the life interest in the home, the furniture or the automobile.\nPrior to the enactment of this legislation, there had been what was known as The Widows' Relief Act under which the Court could and was bound to make such an award to the widow as would make up a share of the estate equal to what she would have received had the husband died intestate leaving children. There was in this statute nothing to indicate any other mode of division than that of a fractional share of the corpus, nor was there any power to make an award that would give her anything beyond that share.\nIt should be remarked that relief legislation of the nature of that in question, which in recent years has appeared in various parts of the world, is not intended to convert courts into will-making or will-destroying bodies. The principle that the distribution of property at death should lie not only in the right but also in the discretion and judgment of the owner, is trenched upon only within well-defined limits. What these statutes do is to enable the Court to subtract from the estate appropriated to others, sufficient to secure to certain dependants certain benefits: subject to those overriding interests, the original dispositions remain.\nIn the case of large estates, the construction given the subsection leads admittedly to absurdities. In the present instance, if instead of $3,600 the annuity to the widow had been fixed at $4,500, a difference which, considering her age at the husband's death, 79 years, would have had an insignificant effect upon the total distribution, the statute would not have become operative. And the absurdity rises as the independent means of the widow are greater. The difference of opinion between the testator and the Court as to the sufficiency of those means might be a paltry sum but it would automatically disrupt what might otherwise foe considered a wise distribution of benefits. And other anomalies are disclosed in many combinations of circumstances quite within the reaches of probability.\nConsistently with section 3, the controlling language in subsection (1) of section 8 is unequivocal. It is reasonable provision for maintenance of the dependant, whether that dependant is the widow or a child, that is the desideratum. Maintenance of a dependant does not, however, reach to that enjoyment of property which consists solely of the exercise of rights of ownership, even though, as in the case of a widow, it might be property in the accumulation of which she should consider herself to have shared. The allowance contemplated looks essentially to the living needs, in a broad sense, of the dependant and not to the creation of a role of owner.\nThe construction of the preliminary question already laid down by this Court in this same estate[10] excludes the view that, in the case of a widow, the reasonable provision must, as a minimum, be what is required by subsection (2); but it is this fact that, in applying subsection (2), leads to the seeming logical hiatus in the theory underlying the first subsection. What appears as anomalous is that provision conditioned in maintenance in subsection (1) should be followed by a discrete absolute under subsection (2). But I have come to the opinion that this apparent incommensurability lies not so much in the intention of the legislation as in misconception in the interpretation of subsection (2).\nWhat the Court below in effect holds is that, upon the preliminary ground being established, The Intestate Succession Act automatically applies as a minimum for the benefit of the widow. Now, if that were so, why in the subsection should we have the language, \"No allowance ordered to be made to the wife of the testator shall, in the opinion of the court, be less than she would have received if the husband had died intestate leaving a widow and children\"? Why, \"in the opinion of the court\"? Certainly the opinion of the Court is not called into action to declare academically the unquestioned effect of the intestate law; and whatever subsection (2) may mean, it cannot, in my opinion, intend only that automatic recognition. We must give some meaning to these words but I cannot find in the judgments below that that has been done.\nWhat, then, is the matter upon which the judging faculty of the Court is to be exercised? This involves, I think, an examination of the word, \"received.\" It has been taken that that word means simply and exclusively \"been entitled to by law\"; but in a context calling for the exercise of opinion or judgment by the Court, I must attribute to it a less rigid signification.\nWhat, under the subsection, the Court must do is to contemplate the widow in relation to her maintenance under an intestacy. The share which in those circumstances the law awards her may, and generally will, be the source of her maintenance; but it is by no means necessary that the whole of it would, in fact, serve that end. Its application to maintenance would have its limit in the total exhaustion of her share during her lifetime. The statute is dealing, however, with probabilities and these are to be forecast by the Court to which the question is submitted.\nIn the case of intestacy we may have the widow being \"maintained\" in her actual needs and requirements and even indulgences by the share the law awards her; these may be free or restricted depending upon her total resources; and, in advance, to estimate judicially the actual pecuniary measure of that maintenance is of the sort of task daily accepted in our Courts. Over and above that maintenance, however, the intestacy may have placed within her control, to do with by way of disposing or otherwise as she might please, property far in excess of what she would actually use or need. But this statute, intended to realize the substance of the widow's just and legitimate rights to security, is not concerned to furnish her with a substratum through which to gratify a desire to exercise formal rights of ownership or to share in the distribution of her husband's property.\nThe \"opinion of the court\" may be said to be exercised if a substantial equivalent of the widow's share under intestacy should be ascertained and granted as an allowance under subsection (1): or even if specific assets should be set aside as that equivalent. That is not, of course, what the court below did. The former would ordinarily involve the conversion of a share of bulk into periodic payments. But could the mathematics of a life annuity to be purchased by a bulk share, to be charged upon the estate, and to be paid as maintenance, be the matter of the \"opinion\"? I do not think so. And the moment we go beyond the undivided intestate share as such we are at large upon the proper construction of the subsection.\nAn analysis of subsections (1) and (2) raises a doubt as to the precise signification of the word, \"allowance\". That may be either the total sum which the Court finds the will should have given to complete the reasonable provision for the dependant or the amount by which the actual allowance of the will falls short of that figure. In the former sense, the full allowance being provided by order would, in cases where there is partial provision by the will, necessarily involve a substitution for what is given by the will. In the latter sense, the will is maintained in toto in its provision for the dependant and the supplementary allowance would be charged upon the distribution outside of that.\nThe condition of the application is that the Court should be of opinion that the testator \"has by will so disposed of real or personal property that reasonable provision has not been made for the maintenance of the dependant\". Now, there is nothing in the Act dealing with substitution and, in view of section 13, the language just quoted\u2014where there is no question as between dependants\u2014means essentially disposal of property to persons other than the dependant; there is no reason to touch allowances to the dependant and the failure of reasonable provision takes into account what may have been so given. But this makes significant to the order the difference between inadequate provision in the will for the dependant and provision in the will for non-dependants.\nThen, in passing to subsection (2), to ascribe to the word, \"allowance\", the meaning of a supplementary provision may at first sight appear to present a difficulty, but I think a closer examination dispels it. Whether the order operates with a supplementary effect or as a substitutional or original provision for the whole amount, the total allowance is in fact \"ordered\"; it exists by reason of the order; \"ordered to be made\" means made by reason of the order; the total allowance is what it is because of the order. The language is to be interpreted as if the subsection read:\nNo (total) allowance (for maintenance) ordered to be made to the wife of the testator shall, in the opinion of the court, be less than (the total allowance for maintenance) she would have received if the husband had died intestate leaving a widow and children.\nFrom this consideration of the section, it is clear to me that the underlying purpose and conception of subsection (1) are carried through into (2) and that what is envisaged is a determination \"in the opinion of the court\" of what the actual maintenance of the widow\u2014the pecuniary dimensions of her actual living\u2014in the circumstances of intestacy would have been and to take the amount so found as the measure for determining the supplementary or original allowance called for by the first subsection. The Court is to exercise its judgment upon the resources that would go into actual maintenance under intestacy and to determine to what extent that would be received from the intestate share. It would be received because it would proceed from that share to absorption in the maintenance.\nSuch a construction not only reconciles subsections (1) and (2) but gives meaning to all of the language of (2) and brings it within the theory that underlies the statute as a whole: it escapes the anomalies and absurdities of the alternative construction: and it carries out the intention and purpose of the legislative language of guaranteeing to the widow, in such a case, as a minimum as ample a maintenance under a will as if the husband's property had been distributed by law. I would, therefore, allow the appeal and send the matter back to the judge of first instance to have it ascertained by him what the reasonable maintenance of the widow, under the circumstances of intestacy, would have drawn from her share of the estate. That amount will be the minimum allowance for maintenance, and for the difference between that and the provision made by the will, an order for a supplementary allowance should be made, charged upon property otherwise disposed of, as the judge may determine. The costs of both parties in all Courts should be paid out of the estate.\nThorson J. (ad hoc)\u2014The effect of The Widows' Relief Act, R.S.S. 1930, chap. 91, and previous legislation to the same effect was that a man could not by his will validly leave his widow in a worse position than she would have been in if he had died intestate leaving a widow and children, and that if he attempted to do so, the Court, on her application for relief from the terms of the will, would make an allowance to her equal to one-third of his estate, since this would be the amount, according to the intestacy law of the province, that would have gone to her if he had died intestate leaving a widow and children. The only fact which the widow had to prove was that her deceased husband by his will had left her less than one-third of his estate. This state of the law gave the widow an absolute right to one-third of her husband's estate notwithstanding the terms of his will. This right existed whether the husband had made reasonable provision for his wife's maintenance or not, and whatever the means of the widow might be. On the other hand, the Court had no power to allow the widow more than one-third of the estate even if this was inadequate to provide reasonable maintenance for her, no matter what the size of the estate was. Moreover, the only dependant of the testator to whom relief could be given was his widow.\nThe defects in this social legislation were largely met by The Dependants' Relief Act, 1940, (c. 36), R.S.S. 1940, chap. 111, which repealed The Widows' Relief Act, extended the right to relief to other dependants of the testator than only his widow and established a new test of entitlement to relief. The nature of the test and the power of the Court to grant relief appear from section 8(1), which reads as follows:\n8. (1) If upon an application the court is of opinion that the testator has by will so disposed of real or personal property that reasonable provision has not been made for the maintenance of the dependant to whom the application relates, then, subject to the following provisions and to such conditions and restrictions as the court deems fit, the court may, in its discretion, make an order charging the whole or any portion of the estate, in such proportion and in such manner as it deems proper, with payment of an allowance sufficient to provide such maintenance as the court thinks reasonable, just and equitable in the circumstances.\nTwo fundamental changes in the law were made. It is no longer possible for a widow to obtain relief from the terms of her husband's will merely on proof that he has left her less than one-third of his estate. She must now satisfy the Court that the testator has by will so disposed of real or personal property that reasonable provision has not been made for her maintenance. Until the Court is of opinion that such is the case, it has no power to interfere with the terms of the will or order the payment of any allowance to her. The test of her entitlement to relief is a new one, namely, proof that reasonable provision has not been made for her maintenance. This is one change in the law. There was also another change, for when the Court, on the evidence before it, is of opinion that reasonable provision has not been made for the maintenance of the widow, it is not restricted to allowing her one-third of the estate, but may order the payment of an allowance sufficient to provide reasonable maintenance for the widow \"as the court thinks reasonable, just and equitable in the circumstances\". Such allowance may greatly exceed one-third of the estate and may conceivably in a given case exhaust it. In this respect also there is a radical change in the law.\nIt is admitted that the respondent satisfied the onus cast upon her by section 8 (1) and that the Court below had the right to order the payment of an allowance to her. This appeal is limited to the construction of section S (2) which provides as follows:\n8. (2) No allowance ordered to be made to the wife of the testator shall, in the opinion of the court, be less than she would have received if the husband had died intestate leaving a widow and children. The Court of Appeal ordered payment to the respondent of one-third of the estate of her deceased husband as a reasonable provision for her maintenance. The estate was a large one, amounting to over $332,000.\nThe amount provided by the will, apart from certain specific bequests, together with her own means gave the respondent an annual income of $4,800. She gave evidence in support of her application under the Act that the annual amount required for reasonable provision for her maintenance was $5,559.40. The amount received was, therefore, approximately $63 per month less than the amount required.\nCounsel for the appellant contended that the Court, having acquired jurisdiction to order the payment of an allowance, the respondent having proved that reasonable provision had not been made for her maintenance, had no jurisdiction beyond making an order for payment of an allowance sufficient to provide such maintenance as the Court thought reasonable, just and equitable in the circumstances and had no authority to do more than order the payment of an additional allowance of $63 per month, since that would meet the needs of the respondent and remove her cause of complaint; that section 8 (1), together with section 3 (which gives a dependant the right to apply to the Court for an order making reasonable provision for his or her maintenance), is the governing section of the Act and that section 8 (2) must be brought into line with it; and that the interpretation placed upon section 8 (2) by the Court below makes the section inconsistent with and repugnant to section 8 (1), section 3 and several other sections of the Act.\nThe answer to this argument, as I read the Act, is that section 8 (2) is an exceptional section. The broad scheme of the Act is that a man's freedom to dispose of his estate by will is made subject to his duty to make reasonable provision for the maintenance of his dependants, and that if he fails in such duty the Court will intervene and give such relief from the provisions of his will as the necessity of the case demands. Section 3 allows any dependant, as defined by the Act, to apply to the Court for an order making reasonable provision for his or her maintenance, but each dependant applicant must comply with the test of entitlement established by section 8 (1), for this is a condition of the jurisdiction of the Court to intervene. When the onus of proof imposed upon the applicant has been discharged and the Court has acquired jurisdiction to act, the applicant is entitled to the order contemplated by section 8 (1)\u2014an order for payment of an allowance sufficient to provide such maintenance as the Court thinks reasonable, just and equitable in the circumstances. Every successful dependant is entitled to this order, whether it be the widow or any other dependant. The power conferred upon the Court by section 8 (1), once the condition for its exercise has been complied with, is, however, made \"subject to the following provisions\", one of which is section 8 (2). That section puts the widow who has met the statutory test of entitlement in an exceptional position, not enjoyed by any other dependant of the testator, and imposes an exceptional obligation upon the Court which does not rest upon it when it is dealing with any dependant applicant other than the widow. When the widow has proved her entitlement to relief, the Court is required by section 8 (1) to order the payment of an allowance sufficient to provide such maintenance as the Court thinks reasonable, just and equitable in the circumstances, but the Court is also required by section 8 (2) to see to it that the allowance ordered by it shall not, in the opinion of the Court, \"be less than she would have received if the husband had died intestate leaving a widow and children\", that is to say, that it shall not be less than one-third of the estate.\nEffect must be given to both section 8 (1) and section 8 (2). To contend that section 8 (1) is the controlling section and that section 8 (2) must be brought into line with it involves the elimination of the words \"subject to the following provisions\" from section 8 (1) and the rejection of section 8 (2) altogether in every case where, because of the size of the estate, one-third of it would exceed the requirements of the widow for her maintenance. This would make the construction of section 8 (2) depend upon the size of the estate. There is no need to strain the words of section 8 (2) to force it into line with section 8 (1), and full effect can be given to both sections if section 8 (2) is regarded as putting the widow in an exceptional position as compared with that of other dependants. That was, in my opinion, the intent of section 8 (2), expressed in clear and explicit terms in which I see no ambiguity. Once a widow has proved her entitlement to relief, the Act gives her the benefits of both section 8 (1) and section 8 (2), whichever are the greater. She is entitled to such allowance as the Court has power to order under section 8 (1) to make reasonable provision for, her maintenance, and, if that is less than one-third of the estate, she is entitled under section 8 (2) to an allowance that is not less, in the opinion of the Court, than one-third of the estate, even if such allowance, by reason of the size of the estate, exceeds the amount required for reasonable provision for their maintenance. The allowance ordered by the Court may be greater than one-third of the estate, but it must not be less.\nCounsel for the appellant also argued that the respondent was not entitled by section 8 (2) to one-third of the estate and that the Court below had failed to consider the effect of the words \"in the opinion of the court\" contained in the section. His contention was that these words meant that the Court must consider what the respondent would have had to maintain herself if one-third of the estate had gone to her on the death of her husband, and that it must form an opinion as to how much she would reasonably spend for her maintenance if one-third of the estate had gone to her. This contention involves importing into the section words that are not there and different from those that are there. What would the respondent have received if her husband had died intestate leaving a widow and children? The answer is that she would have received one-third of the estate, with no restriction upon her rights in respect of it. Section 8 (2) is, therefore, a direction to the Court that the allowance ordered by it shall, in the opinion of the Court, not be less than one-third of the estate. It is not a direction that it shall not be less than something else, such as what the widow would spend for her maintenance if she had one-third of the estate. The Court is required to measure the respective amounts involved, the amount of the allowance proposed on the one hand, and the amount of one-third of the estate on the other, and form an opinion as to their equivalency. The allowance need not necessarily take the form of one-third of the estate so long as it is not less than one-third would be. It may take various forms, as section 8 (3) indicates, but if an allowance other than one-third of the estate, such as an allowance of periodic payments, is ordered, the Court must be sure that such allowance is not less than one-third of the estate. How could the Court more precisely determine the amount of the allowance ordered, to ensure that it will not be less than one-third of the estate, than by ordering that one-third of the estate should be paid? And how could it be said that in so doing the Court has disregarded the judicial function required to be performed by the words \"in the opinion of the court\" contained in the section, even if these words are not specifically referred to in the reasons for judgment of the Court below?\nThe Court was faced with a problem similar to that which faced the Court under The Widows' Relief Act and similar previous legislation. The language of section 8 (2) of the present Act is similar to that of section 8 of The Widows' Relief Act, from which it appears to have been substantially borrowed. Under that and similar previous legislation the Court was directed, in effect, to make such allowance as shall, in the opinion of the Court, be equal to one-third of the estate, and the Court, in such cases as In re Baker Estate[11], met the direction of the section by allowing the successful widow one-third of her husband's estate. I see no reason why the Court should not follow a similar practice under section 8 (2) of the Act under review.\nI agree that the appeal should be dismissed. The costs of the parties throughout should be payable out of the estate.\nAppeal dismissed. Costs of all parties to be paid out of the estate.\nSolicitor for the appellant: G. H.

R.S.O., 1937, c. 288, as amended in 1939 by 3 Geo. VI, c. 20, s. 6.\nThe respondent, having accepted in Montreal' an invitation from the wife of the appellant to accompany them on a trip to Ottawa, was seriously injured as the result of an accident occurring in Ontario. The automobile was owned and driven by the appellant. The respondent's action for damages was maintained by the trial judge for an amount of $5,536.18, which judgment was affirmed by the appellate court.\nHeld that the appeal to this Court should be dismissed. Upon the evidence, the negligence of the appellant has been established; and the respondent was entitled to maintain her action, as such negligence, actionable under the law of Quebec, was punishable under the law of Ontario.\nPer The Chief Justice and Hudson, Taschereau and Estey JJ.\u2014The respondent has fulfilled the two conditions required in order to establish the liability of the appellant: first, the negligent act of the appellant was a quasi-offence for which the respondent would have recovered damages in Quebec if the act had been committed in that province, and, secondly, the respondent has established that such act was \"wrongful\" i.e. \"non justifiable\", and therefore punishable under the law of Ontario, as it has been established that the appellant has driven his car \"without due care and attention,\" in violation of a statuory law of that province (Highway Traffic Act, s. 27).\nPer The Chief Justice and Taschereau and Estey JJ.\u2014An agreement between the benevolent driver of an automobile and a passenger whom he has invited to travel with him, as a favour, is neither a contract of transport, which necessarily implies an onerous remuneration, nor a contract of prestation of gratuitous services, generally called \"contrat de bienfaisance\". Therefore, no \"responsabilit\u00e9 contractuelle\" can be incurred by a benevolent driver; and any claim by an invited guest must derive from an offence or a quasi-offence.\nCanadian National Steamships Co.

About four miles from the town of Rockland, in the province of Ontario, the car suddenly left the road and went into the ditch. As a result of the accident, the respondent was injured, sued the appellant for damages and was awarded by the Superior Court a sum of $5,536.18; and the appellate court affirmed the judgment.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and John Bumbray K.C. for the appellant.\nJames P. Diplock and James E. Mullally for the respondent.\nThe judgment of The Chief Justice and of Taschereau J. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014Dans le cours du mois de juillet 1940, l'intim\u00e9e, alors qu'elle \u00e9tait passag\u00e8re dans l'automobile du demandeur, fut victime d'un accident pour lequel elle r\u00e9clame de l'appelant, propri\u00e9taire et conducteur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole de la voiture, la somme de $9,536.18. Elle avait accept\u00e9, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, l'invitation de se rendre \u00e0 Ottawa en compagnie de l'appelant et son \u00e9pouse, et au cours du voyage, sur la route pr\u00e8s de Rockland, dans la province d'Ontario, l'automobile d\u00e9rapa, et l'intim\u00e9e fut s\u00e9rieusement bless\u00e9e.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure lui a accord\u00e9 $5,536.18, et la cour d'appel de la province de Qu\u00e9bec a unanimement confirm\u00e9 ce jugement.\nLa demanderesse invoque la responsabilit\u00e9 contractuelle de l'appelant, avec qui un contrat de transport gratuit, appel\u00e9 contrat de bienfaisance, serait intervenu, et qui l'obligerait aux \"soins d'un bon p\u00e8re de famille\". Elle fait \u00e9galement reposer son droit \u00e0 des dommages sur la responsabilit\u00e9 quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle de l'appelant, qui serait engag\u00e9e par la faute la plus l\u00e9g\u00e8re (levissima culpa).\nMalgr\u00e9 que les parties soient toutes deux domicili\u00e9es dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, et que l'accident se soit produit dans la province d'Ontario, l'intim\u00e9e invoque la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec comme \u00e9tant celle qui doit d\u00e9terminer ce litige. Elle soumet que, relativement \u00e0 l'obligation contractuelle, c'est la loi du lieu o\u00f9 le contrat est intervenu qui doit trouver son application; et en ce qui concerne la responsabilit\u00e9 quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle, sa pr\u00e9tention est \u00e0 l'effet que la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec s'applique, car le quasi-d\u00e9lit reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant donnerait ouverture \u00e0 une action en dommages dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, s'il \u00e9tait commis dans cette province, et est \u00e0 la fois \"wrongful\" ou \"non-justifiable\" dans la province d'Ontario. Et \u00e0 l'appui de cette derni\u00e8re soumision, l'intim\u00e9e a cit\u00e9 quelques autorit\u00e9s qui la justifieraient et que j'examinerai tout \u00e0 l'heure.\nVoyons en premier lieu s'il y a contrat entre le conducteur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole de l'automobile et son passager. Il est certain que l'acte de courtoisie que pose une personne qui en invite une autre \u00e0 monter dans sa voiture, ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un contrat de transport. Ce dernier est en effet essentiellement un contrat \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux. Les textes sont pr\u00e9cis \u00e0 ce sujet, et les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux du droit doivent n\u00e9cessairement nous conduire \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion. Comme le dit Josserand (Recueil Hebdomadaire, Jurisprudence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Dalloz 1926, chronique, page 22):\u2014\nLe contrat de transport est une des op\u00e9rations qui donnent naissance, de part et d'autre, au plus grand nombre d'obligations possibles, et dont le plexus obligatoire est le plus riche; cette caract\u00e9ristique r\u00e9pugne \u00e0 la notion du titre gratuit qui se retrouve au contraire dans les op\u00e9rations \u00e0 contexture simple (donation, d\u00e9p\u00f4t).\nLa gratuit\u00e9 qui caract\u00e9rise le transport b\u00e9n\u00e9vole est clairement incompatible avec le contrat de transport dont la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration est l'un des' \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels. Et aussi la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise est-elle d\u00e9finitivement fix\u00e9e, et elle a conclu depuis longtemps qu'il n'y a pas de contrat de transport entre le conducteur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole d'une voiture automobile et son passager qu'il transporte par complaisance. (Toulouse, 22 juin 1914, D.P. 1917, 2. 83; Nimes, 19 mai 1924, Rec.

Judic, 7 ao\u00fbt).\nDans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, la r\u00e8gle n'est pas diff\u00e9rente, et il ne se trouve pas d'arr\u00eat de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure ou de la cour d'appel, je crois, qui contredise la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise. Mais on pr\u00e9tend qu'entre le chauffeur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole et celui qu'il transporte, il y a contrat de prestation de services gratuits, qu'on appelle contrat de bienfaisance. Et l'intim\u00e9e a cit\u00e9 quatre jugements qui justifieraient cette pr\u00e9tention.\nDans Langevin v. Beauchamp,[1] la question ne fut pas r\u00e9solue, la cour d'appel s'\u00e9tant content\u00e9e de d\u00e9clarer qu'il y avait responsabilit\u00e9 de la part du conducteur de l'automobile, sans d\u00e9terminer si cette responsabilit\u00e9 naissait d'une obligation contractuelle ou d'une faute quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle.\nQuant \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision dans la cause de Garfingle v. Eliasoph,[2] elle semble plut\u00f4t \u00e0 l'effet que la responsabilit\u00e9 du conducteur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole est purement quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle. Ainsi, M. le juge L\u00e9tourneau s'exprime ainsi:\u2014\nSous les articles 1053 et 1054 de notre Code civil, il ne peut \u00eatre ainsi distingu\u00e9 entre la faute grossi\u00e8re et la faute l\u00e9g\u00e8re, si celle-ci tout aussi bien que celle-l\u00e0 a pu donner lieu \u00e0 un accident; la faute l\u00e9g\u00e8re sera dans ce cas, tout autant que la faute lourde, g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice de responsabilit\u00e9.\nEt, pour sa part, M. le juge Bond dit:\u2014\nIn my opinion, the question of responsibility of the appellant must be determined by the provisions of article 1053 C. C. which provides that every person capable of discerning right from wrong is responsible for the damage caused by his fault to another, whether by positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of skill.\nMais la cour d'appel s'est d\u00e9finitivement prononc\u00e9e en 1932 et a conclu \u00e0 la double responsabilit\u00e9, contractuelle et quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle, du conducteur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole. Parlant au nom d'une cour unanime, dans Parent et British Colonial v. Garneau[3] M. le juge Dorion dit ce qui suit:\nCette responsabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9sulte, ou bien d'un quasi-d\u00e9lit (Art. 1053 C.C.), et alors elle est encourue pour la faute la plus l\u00e9g\u00e8re (levissima culpa). ou bien d'un contrat, et alors elle n'existe que si le contrevenant n'a pas accompli ses obligations avec les soins d'un bon p\u00e8re de famille (levis culpa) Art. 1064 C.C. Cette question est trait\u00e9e au long dans l'ouvrage de M. Rutsaert: Le fondement de la responsabilit\u00e9 civile extra-contractuelle, (page 248).\nIl me para\u00eet hors de toute qu'il y a contrat entre le chauffeur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole et celui qu'il transporte, il y a duorum consensus in idem placitum. Quelle diff\u00e9rence y a-t-il entre le contrat de louage de services et le contrat de prestation de services gratuits? La m\u00eame que celle qui existe entre la vente et la donation. L'un est contrat \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux et l'autre, un contrat \u00e0 titre gratuit. Dans les deux cas les obligations du d\u00e9biteur sont celles d'un bon p\u00e8re de famille et ses responsabilit\u00e9s, celles qui r\u00e9sultent de la faute l\u00e9g\u00e8re.\nEn 1941, dans une cause de Assad v. Latendresse,[4], M. le juge E. M. W. McDougall a adopt\u00e9 \u00e9galement la th\u00e9orie de la faute contractuelle, sans exclure la responsabilit\u00e9 quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle, et dit ce qui suit:\u2014\nConsidering, moreover, that if the case be regarded from the point of view of a breach of the agreement to carry the plaintiff safely, (faute contractuelle), it is a matter of indifference that the accident may have occurred outside the limits of the jurisdiction within which the agreement was entered into (Quebec), and there is nothing in the law which declares such remedy to be repugnant to the remedy in delict.\nDans les causes que je viens de citer, les faits ne se pr\u00e9sentaient pas comme se pr\u00e9sentent ceux qui font l'objet du pr\u00e9sent litige. En effet, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat qu'il y avait de distinguer entre la responsabilit\u00e9 contractuelle ou quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle ne reposait que sur la question de savoir si le conducteur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole \u00e9tait responsable de sa faute lourde, de sa faute l\u00e9g\u00e8re, ou de sa faute tr\u00e8s l\u00e9g\u00e8re. La jurisprudence a r\u00e9pondu que dans l'un ou l'autre cas, la faute lourde n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire pour engendrer la responsabilit\u00e9, et que la preuve d'une faute tr\u00e8s l\u00e9g\u00e8re ou l\u00e9g\u00e8re \u00e9tait suffisante, pour qu'il y ait responsabilit\u00e9, quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle dans le premier cas, et contractuelle dans le second. La diff\u00e9rence entre les fautes l\u00e9g\u00e8re et tr\u00e8s l\u00e9g\u00e8re semble bien difficile \u00e0 \u00e9tablir, et j'avoue qu'il m'est impossible, \u00e0 moins de rester dans les sph\u00e8res de la th\u00e9orie, de tracer une ligne de d\u00e9marcation facilement applicable aux cas concrets qui se pr\u00e9sentent tous les jours. Aussi, est-il moins n\u00e9cessaire de rechercher s'il y a responsabilit\u00e9 quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle ou contractuelle du conducteur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole, quand les parties sont domicili\u00e9es dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, o\u00f9 l'accident se produit, et o\u00f9 s'instruit le proc\u00e8s. Que la responsabilit\u00e9 soit quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle ou contractuelle, peu importe! Elle est engendr\u00e9e, dans les deux cas, par des fautes dont la diff\u00e9rence de degr\u00e9 est \u00e0 peine d\u00e9terminable. Le demandeur n'a qu'\u00e0 poser le dilemme, et il doit obtenir des dommages.\nMais dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, il n'en est pas ainsi, car si la responsabilit\u00e9 est contractuelle, c'est la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec (lex fori) qui s'applique, et l'intim\u00e9e doit r\u00e9ussir. Mais si, au contraire, c'est en vertu des principes de la responsabilit\u00e9 quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle que cette cause doit \u00eatre jug\u00e9e, alors la situation peut \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente.\nEn Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, l'honorable juge MacKinnon, se basant sur les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents cit\u00e9s plus haut, a accept\u00e9 la th\u00e9orie de la double responsabilit\u00e9 et a maintenu l'action. En cour d'appel, messieurs les juges Pr\u00e9vost, McDougall et Marchand ont exprim\u00e9 l'opinion qu'il y avait responsabilit\u00e9 contractuelle et d\u00e9lictuelle, tandis que M. le juge en chef L\u00e9tourneau refuse de consid\u00e9rer l'aspect contractuel, \u00e0 cause de la r\u00e9daction de la d\u00e9claration qui limiterait la demanderesse \u00e0 un recours quasi-d\u00e9lictuel. Enfin, M. le juge St-Germain conclut que la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'appelant est engag\u00e9e soit contractuellement, soit par le quasi-d\u00e9lit qu'il a commis.\nC'est la premi\u00e8re fois que ce tribunal est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre la question de savoir s'il existe des rapports contractuels entre le conducteur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole et son invit\u00e9 qui prend place dans sa voiture automobile. Comme nous l'avons vu pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, il ne se forme pas entre les deux parties de contrat de transport, car la notion de gratuit\u00e9 r\u00e9pugne \u00e0 l'existence d'une semblable convention. Y a-t-il cependant un contrat de bienfaisance qui oblige le conducteur complaisant?\nLe contrat de bienfaisance n'est pas d\u00e9fini dans notre code. Le code Napol\u00e9on le d\u00e9finit ainsi:\u2014\nLe contrat de bienfaisance est celui dans lequel l'une des parties procure \u00e0 l'autre un avantage purement gratuit. Malgr\u00e9 l'absence de d\u00e9finition, un semblable contrat existe tout de m\u00eame chez nous, car il y a de nombreux contrats, reconnus dans notre droit comme en France d'ailleurs, o\u00f9 l'un des contractants procure \u00e0 l'autre un avantage sans aucune contre-partie. Ainsi, la donation est le plus important que l'on puisse classifier dans cette cat\u00e9gorie \u00e0 laquelle viennent se joindre aussi le d\u00e9p\u00f4t, le mandat, ou\u00efe pr\u00eat \u00e0 usage, dont cependant certains cessent d'\u00eatre des contrats de bienfaisance quand ils sont salari\u00e9s.\nMais tous ces contrats dits de bienfaisance, o\u00f9 un avantage purement gratuit est procur\u00e9, sont productifs d'obligations. Ainsi, la donation suppose une lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 de la part du donateur et l'acceptation du donataire. Et lorsque le concours des volont\u00e9s est intervenu, le contrat est parfait et devient irr\u00e9vocable, sauf les cas pr\u00e9vus par la loi, ou une condition r\u00e9solutoire valable (Art. 755 C.C.). Le donateur aura donc l'obligation de d\u00e9livrer, et cette obligation donne ouverture \u00e0 une action personnelle contre le donateur en d\u00e9faut, en faveur du donataire.\nMais y a-t-il de semblables obligations qui naissent du transport b\u00e9n\u00e9vole?\nSavatier (Trait\u00e9 de la responsabilit\u00e9 civile, tome 1er, 1939, p. 163) r\u00e9pond dans l'affirmative \u00e0 cette question, et il s'appuie sur quelques arr\u00eats des tribunaux fran\u00e7ais.\nAinsi, le tribunal civil d'Avignon a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en 1924 (Dalloz, Recueil Hebdomadaire, 1924, p. 711) qu'il s'\u00e9tablit un contrat de bienfaisance entre le propri\u00e9taire d'une automobile et celui qu'il consent \u00e0 promener \u00e0 titre gratuit, et ce principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par le tribunal civil de Nimes (Recueil des Assurances, 1925, p. 443). Ce dernier tribunal cependant a r\u00e9form\u00e9 l'arr\u00eat rendu par le tribunal civil d'Avignon, parce que ce dernier en \u00e9tait venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le propri\u00e9taire de la voiture ne devait r\u00e9pondre que de sa faute lourde, et le tribunal de Nimes au contraire a conclu que la faute l\u00e9g\u00e8re \u00e9tait suffisante pour engager la responsabilit\u00e9 du conducteur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole.\nLa Cour d'Appel de Lyon a jug\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame sens (Recueil des Assurances, 1926, p. 54) et trois arr\u00eats de la Cour d'Appel de Dijon (Gazette du Palais, 1928, vol. 2, p. 885; Gazette du Palais, 1929, vol. 2, p. 60; et Gazette du Palais, 1929, vol. 2, p. 592) appuient la m\u00eame th\u00e8se et concluent \u00e0 l'existence d'un contrat purement de bienfaisance productif d'obligations.\nSavatier qui, comme nous l'avons vu, partage cette opinion, regrette (cit\u00e9 supra page 164) que, d'une fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la jurisprudence en France n'ait pas accept\u00e9 sa mani\u00e8re de penser et qu'elle ait refus\u00e9 de voir un contrat dans le transport gratuit.\nEn effet, l'\u00e9tude de la jurisprudence r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, si elle a manifest\u00e9 quelques h\u00e9sitations, elle est maintenant ralli\u00e9e au syst\u00e8me oppos\u00e9, et elle a d\u00e9finitivement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le transport b\u00e9n\u00e9vole exclut toute id\u00e9e de contrat de transport ou de bienfaisance. Ce n'est pas sur le terrain contractuel que doit se placer le passager bless\u00e9 au cours d'un transport gratuit, mais il doit faire reposer son action sur un d\u00e9lit ou un quasi-d\u00e9lit du conducteur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole. Ce principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu par la plupart des tribunaux en France, et il est admis par la grande majorit\u00e9 des auteurs.\nC'est ainsi qu'en 1914, le tribunal de Toulouse (Dalloz, Jurisprudence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 1917, Recueil p\u00e9riodique, p. 83) d\u00e9cide qu'aucun contrat de transport ne se forme entre le propri\u00e9taire d'une automobile et une personne qu'il transporte gratuitement et par pure complaisance dans sa voiture.\nLa Cour d'Appel de Grenoble (Gazette du Palais, 1924, vol. 2, p. 189) d\u00e9cide que le transport b\u00e9n\u00e9vole d'un tiers par un propri\u00e9taire d'automobile exclut l'id\u00e9e de tout contrat; un tel transport n'engendre \u00e0 la charge du propri\u00e9taire d'autre obligation que celle de r\u00e9pondre du pr\u00e9judice provenant d'une faute, d'une n\u00e9gligence ou d'une imprudence.\nLe Tribunal Civil de la Seine (Recueil des Sommaires, 1925, p. 42, n\u00b0 739) statue que:\u2014\nLa personne transport\u00e9e \u00e0 titre gratuit dans une automobile ne peut, en cas d'accident, invoquer un contrat de transport; elle doit, pour r\u00e9ussir dans sa demande en indemnit\u00e9, prouver la faute du d\u00e9fendeur.\nEt, \u00e0 la m\u00eame page du m\u00eame Recueil se trouve une d\u00e9cision du tribunal de Nimes, 19 mai 1924, o\u00f9 un arr\u00eat semblable a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu. (Vide dans le m\u00eame sens Dalloz, Jurisprudence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 1925, Recueil p\u00e9riodique, p. 41 et p. 44; Dalloz, Jurisprudence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 1926, Recueil p\u00e9riodique, p. 121, o\u00f9 sont cit\u00e9es des d\u00e9cisions des cours de Grenoble, de Caen, de Paris, de Lyon, de Douai et de Nimes).\nEn 1927, la Cour d'Appel d'Aix (Dalloz, Jurisprudence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 1927, Recueil Hebdomadaire) a jug\u00e9 \u00e9galement que le propri\u00e9taire d'une automobile ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme li\u00e9 \u00e0 celui qu'il transporte b\u00e9n\u00e9volement dans sa voiture par un contrat de transport.\nEn 1927, la Cour de Cassation, (Chambre des requ\u00eates) (Dalloz, Jurisprudence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 1927, Recueil p\u00e9riodique) a formellement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le transporteur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole est responsable envers la personne transport\u00e9e des accidents caus\u00e9s par sa faute, mais que cette responsabilit\u00e9 est d\u00e9lictuelle et non contractuelle. Et la Cour de Cassation, l'ann\u00e9e suivante, insiste encore sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la faute d\u00e9lictuelle. En 1928, cette jurisprudence est r\u00e9affirm\u00e9e de nouveau par la Cour de Cassation (Sirey, lois et arr\u00eats, 1928, p. 353); (Gazette du Palais, 1928, vol. 1, p. 616).\nLe Juris-Classeur Civil, 2i\u00e8me appendice, articles 1382-1386, fascicule 9, 1936, paragraphe 559) contient ce qui suit:\u2014\nSi le transport a lieu \u00e0 titre purement b\u00e9n\u00e9vole et gratuit, par complaisance, comme c'est le cas lorsqu'un automobiliste, invite, par exemple, des amis \u00e0 faire une promenade, la jurisprudence est bien fix\u00e9e aujourd'hui en ce sens qu'on ne peut appliquer, en cas d'accident, ni les r\u00e8gles du contrat ni celles de l'article 1384.\nLa Cour de Cassation, en 1929, a rendu un autre arr\u00eat dans le m\u00eame sens (Sirey, lois et arr\u00eats, 1929, p. 249) et conclut que la base de la responsabilit\u00e9 dans le cas de passage b\u00e9n\u00e9vole se trouve dans les termes de l'article 1382 du code civil.\nLe 30 d\u00e9cembre 1931, la Cour de Cassation (Sirey, arr\u00eats, 1932, p. 62) applique encore l'article 1382 du code civil, de m\u00eame que la Cour d'Appel d'Angers (Gazette du Palais, 1936, vol. 1, p. 323), o\u00f9 toute id\u00e9e de responsabilit\u00e9 contractuelle est exclue.\nEnfin, pour ne citer que ce dernier arr\u00eat, la Cour d'Appel de Bordeaux en 1936 (Recueil Hebdomadaire, Dalloz Jurisprudence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 1936) signale de nouveau la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la faute d\u00e9lictuelle, pour que soit engag\u00e9e la responsabilit\u00e9 du conducteur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole. A cette longue s\u00e9rie d'arr\u00eats, ajoutons quelques opinions d'auteurs contemporains, et l'on verra que seule la faute quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle est g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice de la responsabilit\u00e9 du conducteur.\nColin et Capitant (Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, vol. 2, p. 212) s'expriment ainsi:\u2014\nLorsque le transport est fait \u00e0 titre gracieux, la situation est diff\u00e9rente car il n'y a pas alors contrat de transport.\nPlaniol et Ripert (Trait\u00e9 pratique de droit civil fran\u00e7ais, vol. 6. p. 848):\u2014\nLa question a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e \u00e0 propos des accidents survenus aux personnes transport\u00e9es en automobile \u00e0 titre gracieux. Les demandeurs en responsabilit\u00e9 ont d'abord invoqu\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 contractuelle du transporteur; mais les arr\u00eats ayant g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement refus\u00e9 d'admettre qu'il y ait contrat dans cette hypoth\u00e8se, ils ont fait appel \u00e0 l'article 1384.\nEsmein: S. 1926, 1, 249, dit ce qui suit:\u2014\nCe n'est pas qu'un service gratuit ne puisse faire l'objet d'un engagement juridique: Le code civil l'admet pour le mandat et le d\u00e9p\u00f4t: et il en peut \u00eatre ainsi pour l'engagement d'op\u00e9rer un transport: En parlant d'un prix dans la d\u00e9finition du transport, l'article 1710 a simplement envisag\u00e9 le cas usuel. Mais le plus souvent celui qui offre un transport gratuit n'a pas l'intention de s'obliger juridiquement et par suite la responsabilit\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre rattach\u00e9e \u00e0 une obligation contractuelle.\nJosserand (Dalloz, Jurisprudence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 1926, Recueil Hebdomadaire, Chronique, p. 22);\u2014\nOn comprend d\u00e8s lors que nos jurisdictions, faisant table rase de toute conception contractuelle, se refusent, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, \u00e0 faire d\u00e9river la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'automobiliste envers son oblig\u00e9, aussi bien d'un contrat innomm\u00e9, \u00e0 contenu plus ou moins d\u00e9fini, que d'un contrat de transport.\nIl faut donc renoncer, et nos juridictions renoncent pour la plus grande majorit\u00e9, \u00e0 construire la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'automobiliste complaisant sur le plan contractuel: C'est dans le domaine extra-contractuel qu'il faut en situer l'origine et en rechercher les \u00e9l\u00e9ments.\nRen\u00e9 Roger (Dalloz, Jurisprudence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 1935, Recueil p\u00e9riodique, \u00e0 la page 39) dit ceci:\u2014\nPeu importe le qualificatif, car il est certain que l'intention de se lier par contrat n'existe pas: ni le voiturier, ni le voyageur n'ont d'action l'un contre l'autre, le premier pour obliger le voyageur \u00e0 monter, te second pour forcer le voiturier \u00e0 le prendre.\nEt enfin, Mazeaud, (Trait\u00e9 de la responsabilit\u00e9 civile, d\u00e9lictuelle et contractuelle, 3i\u00e8me \u00e9d. p. 142, n\u00b0 113) dit ce qui suit:\u2014\nVoici maintenant une personne qui demande \u00e0 l'un de ses amis de l'amener dans sa voiture automobile ou qui accepte la place qui lui est offerte. Un accident se produit. Y a-t-il responsabilit\u00e9 contractuelle du transporteur? La question se pose journellement devant les tribunaux. La jurisprudence, d'abord divis\u00e9e, est aujourd'hui fix\u00e9e: elle affirme qu'on ne peut pas admettre ici une responsabilit\u00e9 contractuelle, car il n'y a pas de contrat, m\u00eame innomm\u00e9. En principe, il faut approuver cette solution. Il est certain que dans cette hypoth\u00e8se, le transporteur qui rend un service d'amiti\u00e9 ou de complaisance n'entend assumer aucune obligation, pas plus que le transport\u00e9 songe \u00e0 lui demander un engagement quelconque.\nCette th\u00e9orie accept\u00e9e par la jurisprudence et les auteurs se justifie parfaitement. Pour que le transport gratuit f\u00fbt un contrat de bienfaisance, il faudrait de toute n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, non pas seulement que le transporteur avantage\u00e2t gratuitement la personne transport\u00e9e, mais il faudrait \u00e9galement qu'une fois le contrat conclu, il li\u00e2t les parties, et f\u00fbt productif d'obligations. Il est clair que ni le transporteur ni le transport\u00e9 n'ont d'action pour faire ex\u00e9cuter l'engagement auquel ils ont consenti. Car cet engagement est r\u00e9vocable \u00e0 volont\u00e9, contrairement au contrat de complaisance o\u00f9 la r\u00e9vocation, sauf par exception, donnerait ouverture \u00e0 une action en dommages. On a peine \u00e0 concevoir la position d'un demandeur r\u00e9clamant des dommages parce qu'un ami complaisant, qui l'avait pri\u00e9 de se promener dans sa voiture, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 subitement de canceller son invitation. La frivolit\u00e9 d'une semblable r\u00e9clamation dispense de songer \u00e0 sa possibilit\u00e9, et d'en discuter la valeur.\nSi donc, il n'existe pas d'action pour sanctionner la r\u00e9vocation d'une invitation de cette nature, c'est qu'il n'y a pas de contrat intervenu, et que toute r\u00e9clamation de l'invit\u00e9 doit proc\u00e9der d'un quasi-d\u00e9lit.\nCertains auteurs ont pr\u00e9tendu d\u00e9couvrir une obligation \u00e0 la charge du transporteur en disant que celui-ci ne saurait d\u00e9poser son ami en cours de route, loin du point de d\u00e9part et du lieu de destination, sans engager sa responsabilit\u00e9. Il est clair qu'il n'engagerait pas sa responsabilit\u00e9 plus que l'ami complaisant qui inviterait une autre personne \u00e0 loger chez-lui, et qui le mettrait \u00e0 la porte avant l'expiration du temps fix\u00e9 pour son d\u00e9part.\nMazeaud (tome 1er, 3i\u00e8me \u00e9d., p. 144) r\u00e9pond ainsi \u00e0 cette objection:\u2014\nCertes dans le cas envisag\u00e9, la responsabilit\u00e9 du conducteur serait engag\u00e9e; mais ce ne serait nullement comme on le pr\u00e9suppose sa responsabilit\u00e9 contractuelle: l'ami abandonn\u00e9 sur la route baserait sa demande sur la faute d\u00e9lictuelle du transporteur. La preuve en est que si, au cours du transport, la voiture ne peut poursuivre sa route \u00e0 la suite d'une avarie, quand m\u00eame cette avarie serait due \u00e0 un mauvais entretien de la machine, on sent bien que le conducteur n'engagera aucune responsabilit\u00e9: parce qu'il n'a pas assum\u00e9 l'obligation d'effectuer le transport.\nNi le conducteur ni le passager n'entendent se lier contractuellement. Aucun des deux ne songe \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir des droits ou \u00e0 assumer des obligations. Le transport purement b\u00e9n\u00e9vole est donc un simple acte de courtoisie, o\u00f9 n'entrent pas les \u00e9l\u00e9ments du contrat avec les droits et obligations qui y correspondent. Il y a bien, comme dit Josserand, de l'obligeance, mais il n'y a pas d'obligations.\nCe que je viens de dire couvre le cas o\u00f9 un transporteur n'a aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat au transport qu'il consent \u00e0 faire, c'est-\u00e0-dire le cas o\u00f9 il agit \u00e0 titre purement b\u00e9n\u00e9vole. Mais \u00e9videmment, la situation pourrait \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente dans le cas o\u00f9 le transport n'est que l'accessoire d'une autre op\u00e9ration. Il se peut, en effet, que le transport soit li\u00e9 \u00e0 une convention ou \u00e0 des rapports extra-contractuels plus g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, et alors dans ce cas, pour voir s'il y a eu contrat, il faudra, comme le dit Mazeaud (vol. 1, p. 140):\u2014\nanalyser l'op\u00e9ration d'ensemble envisag\u00e9e, et voir si cette op\u00e9ration est ou non une convention\u2026 sans poser de r\u00e8gle absolue, tout d\u00e9pendant des circonstances de fait; il semble que le plus souvent dans de pareilles situations, celui qui rend service entend ne s'obliger \u00e0 rien, et la preuve c'est qu'on ne retiendrait pas sa responsabilit\u00e9 contractuelle s'il refusait d'accomplir sa promesse; la responsabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant d'un accident au cours du transport sera donc g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement d\u00e9lictuelle.\nMais dans le cas qui nous occupe, rien de tel ne se pr\u00e9sente, car le transporteur n'avait aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat au transport qu'il a consenti \u00e0 effectuer, et ce m\u00eame transport a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9gag\u00e9 de toute autre op\u00e9ration. Il ne s'agit pas d'un accessoire, mais du but m\u00eame qu'on s'est propos\u00e9.\nIl semble donc que la th\u00e9orie en France doive s'appliquer ici car le contrat de bienfaisance en France est exactement ce qu'il est chez nous. Cependant, si sous les deux droits il n'y a pas de responsabilit\u00e9 contractuelle, il y a tout de m\u00eame une responsabilit\u00e9 qui s'attache au conducteur de l'automobile.\nEn France, on s'est demand\u00e9 si cette responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9coule de l'article 1382 du Code Napol\u00e9on, \u00e0 savoir, s'il faut qu'il y ait preuve de faute, ou si la responsabilit\u00e9 provient de l'article 1384 C.N., (notre article 1054 C.C.) qui rendrait le propri\u00e9taire de l'automobile responsable par le fait m\u00eame de la chose. Des opinions diff\u00e9rentes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mises \u00e0 ce sujet, et M. Josserand (Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, 1926, Recueil Hebdomadaire, (Chronique) p. 24) dit ceci:\u2014\nLa v\u00e9rit\u00e9 est que la responsabilit\u00e9 du fait des choses inanim\u00e9es, telle qu'elle est inscrite dans le premier alin\u00e9a de l'article 1384, se d\u00e9duit, comme d'ailleurs toutes les responsabilit\u00e9s du m\u00eame ordre, qu'elles d\u00e9rivent du fait des personnes ou de celui des animaux ou encore de celui des b\u00e2timents, de l'id\u00e9e de pouvoir et de ma\u00eetrise: la o\u00f9 est le pouvoir, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 se trouve la direction, l\u00e0 doit \u00e9galement r\u00e9sider la responsabilit\u00e9.\nD'autres auteurs ne partagent pas cette id\u00e9e, et les tribunaux en France se sont divis\u00e9s sur cette question. Mais, chez nous, dans un cas comme celui qui nous occupe, l'article 1054 C.C. ne trouve pas son application. Lorsqu'un conducteur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole d'une voiture automobile conduit un passager qui est bless\u00e9, ce n'est pas la chose elle-m\u00eame qui cause le dommage, mais c'est la personne conduisant la voiture qui est l'auteur du dommage, et il s'ensuit qu'\u00e0 cause de cette \"intervention humaine\", il faut prouver faute en vertu de l'article 1053 C.C.\nCe principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 affirm\u00e9 par cette Cour dans la cause de Lacombe v. Power,[5], et M. le juge en chef Anglin s'exprime ainsi \u00e0 la page 411:\u2014\nBefore the plaintiff can invoke a presumption of fault against the defendants under article 1054 C.C., she is obliged to establish (a) thai the damage was in fact caused by the thing in question within the meaning of that article, and (b) that that thing was at the time under the care of the defendant. The automobile on which the deceased was working was safe and harmless while in the position in which he had placed it on the third floor of the defendant's garage. It became dangerous only because it either started of itself or was put in motion. If the proper inference from the evidence was that the automobile started of itself, without the intervention of human agency, and owing to something inherent in the machine, the ensuing damage might be ascribable to it as a \"thing\" and be within the purview of article 1054 C.C. But if its movement was due to an act of the deceased, conscious or unconscious, the damage was caused, not by the thing itself, but by that act, whether it should be regarded as purely un voluntary and accidental or as amounting to negligence or fault. On the latter hypotheses, the provision of article 1054 C.C. invoked by the appellant, does not apply.\nLe m\u00eame principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9-affirm\u00e9 la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e dans P\u00e9russe v. Stafford[6]:\u2014\nIn the second place, it is contended that fault is presumed against the defendant under article 1054 of the Civil Code, because the injury was caused by a thing under her care. Our view is that that provision has no application to a case where, as here, the real cause of the accident is the intervention of some human agency\u2014the question whether such human agency\u2014that of the driver in this case, is at fault being a question of fact. Damage is not caused by a thing which is in the control of the defendant within the meaning of article 1054 C.C., where it is really due to some fault in the operation or handling of the thing by the person in control of it.\nQuel que soit le principe appliqu\u00e9 en France, il est certain qu'ici la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'automobiliste b\u00e9n\u00e9vole n'existe que si le passager peut prouver une faute, imputable au conducteur, et pour laquelle ce dernier peut \u00eatre recherch\u00e9 dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, o\u00f9 l'action est institu\u00e9e.\nJe suis donc d'opinion que cette faute doit \u00eatre d\u00e9lictuelle ou quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle, et que la plus l\u00e9g\u00e8re entra\u00eene la responsabilit\u00e9 du conducteur, tout en faisant cependant les r\u00e9serves n\u00e9cessaires, concernant certains risques qui peuvent \u00eatre normalement envisag\u00e9s par le passager, et dont parle M. le juge Rivard dans la cause de Langevin v. Beauchamp[7]. Mais ici cette question ne se pr\u00e9sente pas.\nJe n'ai pas de doute que, si l'accident pour lequel des dommages sont r\u00e9clam\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente cause s'\u00e9tait produit dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, l'appelant serait quasi-d\u00e9lictuellement responsable. On peut en effet lui reprocher de s'\u00eatre engag\u00e9 par un temps pluvieux dans une c\u00f4te \u00e0 une vitesse trop grande, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la condition dangereuse de la route, condition qui \u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9e sur un panneau visible de tous, et d'avoir continu\u00e9 sa route \u00e0 trente milles \u00e0 l'heure dans une courbe en appliquant maladroitement ses freins. Il a certainement commis une faute, et une plus grande prudence eut sans doute pr\u00e9venu ce malheureux accident.\nMais les parties sont domicili\u00e9es \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, o\u00f9 l'action a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e, et c'est dans la province d'Ontario que l'accident est arriv\u00e9. Dans ces conditions, la responsabilit\u00e9 contractuelle \u00e9tant \u00e9limin\u00e9e, pour r\u00e9ussir, la demanderesse doit \u00e9tablir en premier lieu, que le quasi-d\u00e9lit commis en Ontario aurait donn\u00e9 ouverture \u00e0 une action en dommages dans Qu\u00e9bec, s'il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 commis dans cette derni\u00e8re province. En second lieu, il lui faut aussi d\u00e9montrer que l'acte reproch\u00e9 au conducteur, pour employer l'expression des auteurs, est \"wrongful, i. e. non-justifiable\" selon la loi du lieu o\u00f9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis le quasi-d\u00e9lit.\nC'est la r\u00e8gle pos\u00e9e par Dicey (Conflict of Laws, 5th Ed. p. 770) et adopt\u00e9e par les tribunaux. Dicey dit:\u2014\nAn act done in a foreign country is a tort, and actionable as such in England, if it is both\n(1) wrongful i.e. non-justifiable, according to the law of the foreign country where it was done; and\n(2) wrongful i.e. actionable as a tort, according to English law, or, in other words, is an act which, if done in England, would be a tort.\nL'auteur ajoute que le mot \"wrongful\" a un sens diff\u00e9rent dans les deux clauses ci-dessus. Dans la premi\u00e8re, il signifie un acte qui n'est pas innocent ou excusable, ou en d'autres mots,\u2014\nwhich is either actionable or punishable according to the law of the country where it was done.\nDans l'autre clause, il signifie un acte qui, s'il \u00e9tait fait en Angleterre, donnerait ouverture \u00e0 une action suivant la loi anglaise. (Vide Machado v. Fontes[8]: Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Parent[9]; Walpole v. Canadian Northern Railway Co.[10]; O'Connor v. Wray[11]; Canadian National Steamships Co. v. Watson[12]; Lieff v. Palmer[13]; Howells v. Wilson[14]. Comme on peut le voir, le droit de la demanderesse \u00e0 des dommages d\u00e9pend de l'effet combin\u00e9 du lex loci delicti commissi et du lex fori.\nDe ces causes, celle qu'il importe surtout de retenir, est la cause de Canadian National Steamships v. Watson12, o\u00f9 Sir Lyman Duff, alors juge en chef du Canada, a d\u00e9fini la v\u00e9ritable signification du mot \"wrongful\". Il dit ce qui suit:\u2014\nIt is now settled that, in an action brought in the province of Quebec for damages in respect of personal injuries due to a tortious act committed outside that province, the plaintiff's right to recover rests upon the fulfilment of two conditions. These conditions are stated in the following passage in the judgment of Lord MacNaughton in Carr v. Francis Times & Co.[15]:\u2014\n\"In the first place, the wrong must foe of such a character that it would have been actionable if committed in England; and secondly, the act must not have been justifiable by the law of the place where it was committed.\"\n\"Justifiable\" here refers to legal justification; and an act or neglect which is neither actionable nor punishable cannot be said to be otherwise than \"justifiable\" within the meaning of the rule (Walpole v. Canadian Northern Railway Co.[16].\nThat this rule prevails in Quebec results from O'Connor v. Wray[17].\nSi l'acte que l'on reproche \u00e0 McLean ne donne pas ouverture \u00e0 une action civile en Ontario, et s'il n'est pas \"punishable\" dans cette province, m\u00eame s'il est \"wrongful\" dans Qu\u00e9bec, alors l'intim\u00e9e ne peut pas r\u00e9ussir.\nJ'ai dit d\u00e9j\u00e0 que si le quasi-d\u00e9lit avait \u00e9t\u00e9 commis dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, l'intim\u00e9e aurait pu r\u00e9clamer en vertu de l'article 1053 C.C. Mais il est certain qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il existe un recours civil dans Ontario contre le conducteur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole, au profit du passager qui subit des l\u00e9sions corporelles comme r\u00e9sultat d'un accident. Au contraire, la loi ontarienne d\u00e9nie semblable action, et la pr\u00e9cision du texte ne pr\u00eate \u00e0 aucune ambiguit\u00e9.\nLa section 47 du Highway Traffic Act se lit ainsi:\u2014\nThe owner or driver of a motor vehicle, other than a vehicle operated in the business of carrying passengers for compensation, shall not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from bodily injury to, or the death of any person being carried in, or upon, or entering, or getting on to, or alighting from such motor vehicle.\nIl n'existe donc pas de recours civil dans Ontario, mais l'acte est-il \"punishable\", et peut-on dire que l'appelant a viol\u00e9 quelque disposition du Code Criminel ou de l'Ontario Highway Traffic Act?\nLa conduite de l'appelant ne pr\u00e9sente certainement pas les caract\u00e9ristiques d'une offense criminelle, et je ne puis me convaincre que sa maladresse ou son inhabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e8lent les \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9cessaires qui me permettent de qualifier de crime l'acte qu'il a pos\u00e9. American Automobile Insurance Co. v. Dickson[18]. Mais, il en est autrement je crois du reproche qu'on lui fait qu'il a viol\u00e9 un statut provincial, ce qui fait que son acte \u00e9tait punissable dans l'Ontario, et par cons\u00e9quent non justifiable. L'article 27 du Highway Traffic Act se lit ainsi:\u2014\nEvery person who drives a motor vehicle on a highway without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable in the case of the first offence to a penalty of not less than $5 and not exceeding $50, and in the case of a second or subsequent offence, within one year of the commission of the first offence, to a penalty of not less than $10 and not exceeding $100, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month.\nIl est vrai que le magistrat de Rockland a acquitt\u00e9 l'appelant d'une accusation port\u00e9e en vertu de cet article, mais cette d\u00e9cision n'a \u00e9videmment pas l'autorit\u00e9 de la \"chose jug\u00e9e\" et ne peut lier les tribunaux civils. (La Fonci\u00e8re Compagnie d'Assurance de France v. Ferras[19].) Pour ma part, je suis d'opinion, comme le juge au proc\u00e8s et la cour d'appel, que l'appelant n'a pas conduit sa voiture avec le \"due care and attention\" que requiert la section 27. Car, il me semble certain que s'il avait fait preuve du soin voulu et de l'attention n\u00e9cessaire, cet accident aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vit\u00e9.\nC'est \u00e9videmment un manque de soin et d'attention que de conduire comme l'a fait l'appelant dans les conditions que j'ai mentionn\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, et je ne vois pas comment je pourrais sur ce point diff\u00e9rer d'opinion avec le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et la cour d'appel, dont les jugements me paraissent bien fond\u00e9s.\nIl ne faudrait pas confondre l'article 27 du Highway Traffic Act avec les dispositions du paragraphe 6 de l'article 285 du Code Criminel. Jusqu'en 1939, le Highway Traffic Act contenait un article r\u00e9dig\u00e9 \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s dans les termes que l'on trouve maintenant au paragraphe 6 de l'article 285 du Code Criminel, et par cons\u00e9quent, ce que l'on est convenu d'appeler le \"reckless driving\" n'\u00e9tait pas une offense cr\u00e9\u00e9e par l'autorit\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, mais bien par l'autorit\u00e9 provinciale.\nEn 1938, cependant, le Code Criminel a incorpor\u00e9 dans l'article 285 des dispositions relatives au \"reckless driving\" de sorte que cette offense est devenue une offense criminelle. Elle consiste, comme on le sait, \u00e0 conduire sur une route publique un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur d'une \"fa\u00e7on insens\u00e9e ou d'une mani\u00e8re dangereuse pour le public\", eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 toutes les circonstances, y compris la nature, l'\u00e9tat et l'utilisation du chemin.\nEn 1939, la l\u00e9gislature d'Ontario a en cons\u00e9quence rappel\u00e9 sa propre loi, devenue inop\u00e9rante par suite de la l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et lui a substitu\u00e9 l'offense pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'article 27 du Highway Traffic Act, que l'on appelle commun\u00e9ment le \"careless driving\".\nIl ne fait pas de doute que le degr\u00e9 de n\u00e9gligence dont il faut faire preuve pour se rendre coupable en vertu des dispositions du Code Criminel, 285, paragraphe 6, est de beaucoup sup\u00e9rieur au degr\u00e9 de n\u00e9gligence qu'il est n\u00e9cessaire de prouver, pour que l'acte soit punissable sous la loi provinciale o\u00f9 seul, le manque de soin voulu et d'attention constitue l'offense. Une disposition semblable \u00e0 celle que l'on trouve dans la loi d'Ontario existe en Angleterre (section 12, Road Traffic Act, 1930) et a fait l'objet de commentaires de la part de Lord Atkin, dans la cause de Andrews v. Director of Public Prosecutions[20]. Il dit ce qui suit:\u2014\nSection 12 of the Road Traffic Act 1930, imposes a penalty for driving without due care and attention. This would apparently cover all degrees of negligence.\nJe suis d'opinion, qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le demandeur n'a pas fait preuve de ce soin et de cette attention que requiert l'article 27 du Highway Traffic Act, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence l'acte qu'il a pos\u00e9 et qui a eu pour r\u00e9sultat de causer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e des l\u00e9sions corporelles graves, est punissable en vertu de la loi d'Ontario, l'endroit o\u00f9 le quasi-d\u00e9lit est arriv\u00e9. Au sens des autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es plus haut, il est \"wrongful\" i. e. \"non-justifiable\".\nIl s'ensuit que l'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9tabli deux des conditions n\u00e9cessaires pour engager la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'appelant. L'acte qu'elle lui reproche est un quasi-d\u00e9lit pour lequel elle obtiendrait des dommages dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, s'il \u00e9tait commis dans cette province. Elle a aussi d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il est \"wrongful\" dans Ontario, parce qu'il constitue une violation d'un statut provincial. L'appelant ne peut pas \u00eatre exonor\u00e9, et l'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens. Hudson J.\u2014I have had an opportunity of reading the judgment prepared by my brother Taschereau and agree with him that this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons stated by him, but express no opinion as to the possibility of a contractual liability of the defendant.\nKellock J.\u2014In my opinion, on the basis of the law as stated by the then Chief Justice of Canada in Canadian National Steamships Limited v. Watson[21], the respondent was entitled to maintain her action. The negligence of which she complains is actionable under the law of Quebec and I think that it was also punishable under the law of Ontario.\nRespondent alleged that her damages were caused, among other things, by the negligence of the defendant in\nconducting his automobile in a manner contrary to the provisions of the laws governing the operation of motor vehicles and the dictates of careful and prudent driving.\nThe respondent was a gratuitous passenger in the appellant's automobile on a trip from Montreal to Ottawa in the month of July, 1940 and was injured when the appellant's automobile left the road in the province of Ontario near Rockland. The accident occurred as the automobile proceeded down a hill and around a curve. It was raining at the time. The road was smooth asphalt, and was not very well banked. As the appellant approached the hill, there was a large sign confronting him containing the warning \"Drive slowly on wet pavement\". A member of the Ontario provincial police who attended at the scene of the accident testified that the appellant told him that he had not seen this sign. Some distance closer to the brow of the hill, there was another sign indicating the existence of the sharp curve. The finding of negligence in the judgment of the Superior Court is in the following terms:\nThe Court considers that when defendant started down a 'hill at 40 miles per hour on a slippery, greasy road with a sharp turn at the foot of the hill which required the application of the brakes to slacken its speed, that he was inviting trouble and that he was driving his automobile without due care and attention. It was held in the Superior Court and by the Court of King's Bench on appeal that the appellant had brought himself within the provisions of section 27 of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1937, chapter 288 as amended in 1939 by 3 Geo. VI, chapter 20, section 6. This enactment is taken from section 12, subsection (1) of the Imperial Road Traffic Act 1930, chapter 43 which created a new and less serious offence than the offence described in section 11 of the Act, corresponding to subsection (6) of section 285 of the Criminal Code. In referring to the offence created by section 11, Lord Atkin in Andrews v. Director of Public Prosecutions[22], said:\nSection 12 of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, imposes a penalty for driving without due care and attention. This would apparently cover all degrees of negligence. Section 11 imposes a penalty for driving recklessly or at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous to the public. There can be no doubt that this section covers driving with such a high degree of negligence as that, if death were caused, the offender would have committed manslaughter.\nIn McCrone v. Riding[23] Lord Hewart L.C.J. in dealing with the offence created by section 12 said:\nI think that it is not without significance that the statute uses both the word \"care\" and the word \"attention\". In other words, the driver, whoever he may be, experienced or inexperienced, must see what he is about. He must pay attention to the thing he is doing and perceiving that which he is doing or entering upon, he must do his best and he must show proper care in the doing of that thing upon which he is intent.\nI see no reason to differ from the courts below in their view that section 27 of the Act applied.\nEvidence was given on behalf of the appellant at the trial that he had been acquitted on a charge of careless driving under the section, tried in Rockland 2nd of August, 1940. This acquittal, however, does not stand in the way of a finding in this action that the appellant had committed an offence under the section: La Fonci\u00e8re Compagnie D'Assurance de France v. Perras[24]. It is therefore not necessary for me to consider the other ground upon which the respondent seeks to support the judgment.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nEstey J.\u2014I am of opinion, for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Taschereau, that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appelant: Bumbray & Carroll.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Diplock & Mullally.\n[1] [1928] Q.R. 44 K.B. 569\n[2] [1931] Q.R. 51 K.B. 34\n[3] [1932] Q.R. 54 K.B. 335, at 341\n[4] [1941] Q.R. 79 S.C. 286, at 287\n[5] [1928] S.C.R. 409\n[6] [1928] S.C.R. 416, at 418\n[7] [1928] Q.R. 44 K.B. 569\n[8] L.R.

C.C.\nThe appellant Lamarre, acting as trustee to the bankruptcy of an estate represented by a deceased trader's universal legatees, one of which unmarried and the other a married woman separated as to property, brought an action to annul the sale of an immoveable property by the legatees to the respondent. The two legatees were joined as co-plaintiffs, although they took no part in the conclusions taken in the statement of claim. The husband was a party to the deed of sale for the purpose of authorizing his wife; but he did not authorize her to act as plaintiff in the case. The judgment of the Superior Court, maintaining the appellants' action, was reversed by the appellate court which held that the want of authorization by the husband to enable his wife to appear in court constituted a cause of nullity of the action. Held, affirming the judgment appealed from (Q.R. [1943] K.B. 691) but on another ground, that the Superior Court could not pronounce the nullity of the contract of sale, as one of the contracting parties, i.e. the husband, had not been called before the Court. La Corporation de la Paroisse de St. Gervais v. Goulet ([1931] S.C.R. 437).\nThe appellants had based their action on three different grounds; but, before the Court, they urged only one of them, i.e. their right of action (action paulienne) under article 1032 et seq. C.C.\nHeld, also, that the appellant Lamarre, in his quality of trustee representing the creditors, was entitled to bring alone the present action, as action paulienne; and, therefore, it was immaterial whether the husband had authorized or not his wife to act as plaintiff, as her presence as such was entirely unnecessary.\nHeld, further, that, although the trustee could thus act alone, the appellant's action could not be maintained, as the legatees, as vendors, have not been made parties to the action as defendants or mises-en-cause; but, even if their presence as co-plaintiffs could be considered sufficient to allow the Court to adjudicate on the merits of the case, the wife would still be acting without the authorization of her husband.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, D\u00e9cary J. and dismissing the appellants' action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nJ.

Lavall\u00e9e for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014Le demandeur, en sa qualit\u00e9 de syndic \u00e0 la faillite de feu Dame Catherine Campion, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Delle Albina S\u00e9n\u00e9cal et Dame Gertrude Meehan, ses l\u00e9gataires universelles, a institu\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de Montr\u00e9al, pour faire annuler certains actes intervenus les 18 juin et 8 octobre 1940, devant le notaire J. H. Savaria.\nLe 18 juin 1940, Albina S\u00e9n\u00e9cal et Dame Gertrude Meehan, \u00e9pouse s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens de G\u00e9rard Vincent, ont reconnu que l'intim\u00e9 Albert Bigras avait avanc\u00e9 un certain montant d'argent pour payer les dettes de la succession de feu Dame Catherine Campion, et en consid\u00e9ration du fait que ledit Bigras avait administr\u00e9 les biens de la succession et avait avanc\u00e9 de l'argent pour son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice, elles ont consenti \u00e0 vendre au dit Bigras un immeuble situ\u00e9 dans la ville de Montr\u00e9al, et d\u00e9crit \u00e0 l'acte. Cet immeuble \u00e9tait hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 en une somme de $7,500.00.\nAucun prix de vente n'est mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'acte, et le 8 octobre 1940, voulant sans doute le compl\u00e9ter, les m\u00eames parties ont sign\u00e9 un nouveau contrat, affectant le m\u00eame immeuble, dans lequel il est stipul\u00e9 que la vente est consentie pour le prix de sept mille cinq cent une piastres ($7,501.00), dont les venderesses ont reconnu avoir re\u00e7u une piastre ($1.00) dont quittance. Quant \u00e0 la balance de sept mille cinq cent piastres ($7,500.00), elle \u00e9tait payable \u00e0 Delle Aline Th\u00e9roux.\nM. le juge D\u00e9cary, de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de Montr\u00e9al, a maintenu cette action dirig\u00e9e contre l'intim\u00e9, et est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que ces ventes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites en fraude des droits des cr\u00e9anciers, et qu'elles devaient \u00eatre annul\u00e9es en vertu des articles 1032 et suivants du Code Civil.\nLe demandeur \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9, qui s'\u00e9tait adjoint Delle Albina S\u00e9n\u00e9cal et Dame Gertrude Meehan comme demanderesses, a invoqu\u00e9 trois raisons pour conclure \u00e0 l'annulation des actes des 18 juin et 8 octobre 1940. La premi\u00e8re est que les droits de succession provinciaux n'\u00e9taient pas pay\u00e9s au moment o\u00f9 la vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 consentie; la seconde est que les venderesses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tromp\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9 vu qu'elles n'ont pas compris la teneur et la port\u00e9e des actes intervenus; et la troisi\u00e8me est qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en fraude des droits des cr\u00e9anciers. Seul le troisi\u00e8me motif a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueilli par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur Bigras inscrivit cette cause devant la cour d'appel de la province de Qu\u00e9bec qui maintint l'appel et rejeta l'action[2]. La raison donn\u00e9e et soulev\u00e9e pour la premi\u00e8re fois par la Cour elle-m\u00eame, est que le demandeur \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 poursuivait conjointement avec Albina S\u00e9n\u00e9cal et Dame Gertrude Meehan, et qu'il n'appara\u00eet pas que cette derni\u00e8re, qui est l'\u00e9pouse s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens de G\u00e9rard Vincent, ait \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e par son mari \u00e0 instituer cette action. Il est admis que ledit G\u00e9rard Vincent n'a pas autoris\u00e9 son \u00e9pouse \u00e0 ester en justice, et qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 comme partie \u00e0 l'instance.\nLa cour d'appel en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion que ce d\u00e9faut d'autorisation du mari comporte une nullit\u00e9 que rien ne peut couvrir, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence, la Cour ne peut annuler la vente de l'immeuble faite au d\u00e9fendeur par les-dites Dame Gertrude Meehan et Delle Albina S\u00e9n\u00e9cal. Il est donc bon de noter que lorsque la vente de l'immeuble en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 Bigras, Vincent, comme il le fallait, est intervenu \u00e0 l'acte de vente pour autoriser son \u00e9pouse.\nDevant cette Cour, les appelants, abandonnant les autres motifs, ont limit\u00e9 leur action au recours qui leur serait conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par les articles 1032 et suivants du Code Civil. Cette action en est une qui n'appartient qu'aux cr\u00e9anciers, qui seuls peuvent attaquer en leur propre nom les actes faits par leurs d\u00e9biteurs en fraude de leurs droits. En instituant une semblable action, le demandeur \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 syndic \u00e0 la faillite agissait comme repr\u00e9sentant des cr\u00e9anciers, et il avait indiscutablement le droit en cette qualit\u00e9 d'instituer les proc\u00e9dures telles que modifi\u00e9es, afin de faire entrer dans le patrimoine de la faillite un actif qui en aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 soustrait frauduleusement. La pr\u00e9sence comme demanderesses de Delle Albina S\u00e9n\u00e9cal et de Dame Gertrude Meehan me semble enti\u00e8rement inutile, et je suis d'opinion que le demandeur pouvait seul, en sa qualit\u00e9 de syndic, instituer l'action. Les l\u00e9gataires universelles de Dame Campion sont parties \u00e0 l'acte de vente que l'on pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en fraude des droits des cr\u00e9anciers, et elles ne sont pas en cons\u00e9quence des tierces personnes \u00e0 qui est donn\u00e9e, en vertu de l'article 1032, le recours de \"l'action paulienne\". Si la pr\u00e9sence de ces deux demanderesses n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire, il s'ensuit logiquement qu'il est indiff\u00e9rent que Vincent ait ou non autoris\u00e9 son \u00e9pouse \u00e0 instituer la pr\u00e9sente action.\nCependant, l'action telle que libell\u00e9e demande l'annulation des actes intervenus entre les deux l\u00e9gataires de Dame Catherine Campion et l'intim\u00e9 Bigras, les 18 juin et 8 octobre 1940. Elle vise \u00e0 faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 in toto ces deux actes en question, et elle doit en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre dirig\u00e9e contre toutes les parties \u00e0 l'acte, qui ont int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 \u00eatre assign\u00e9es devant la Cour pour y d\u00e9fendre leurs droits. Il existe une jurisprudence constante \u00e0 cet effet, et qu'il est inutile de citer ici au long. Qu'il suffise de rappeler la cause de La Corporation de la Paroisse de St-Gervais v. Goulet[3].\nOr, dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, Albina S\u00e9n\u00e9cal et Gertrude Meehan ne sont pas d\u00e9fenderesses ni mises-en-cause, et il s'ensuit que la nullit\u00e9 de l'acte ne peut pas \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e.\nOn a argument\u00e9 qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que Delle S\u00e9n\u00e9cal et Dame Meehan soient en cause, vu qu'elles apparaissent comme demanderesses \u00e0 l'action, et que ceci est suffisant pour permettre \u00e0 la Cour de juger de la validit\u00e9 des actes intervenus.\nJe ne puis accepter cette pr\u00e9sentation, car m\u00eame si elle \u00e9tait juste, Dame Gertrude Meehan est irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement demanderesse, vu que son mari ne l'a pas autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 instituer des proc\u00e9dures et n'est pas partie \u00e0 l'action. C'est en vain \u00e9galement qu'on a soutenu que la vente peut \u00eatre annul\u00e9e pour partie. Il s'agit dans le pr\u00e9sent cas d'un immeuble entier, et le transport argu\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre rescind\u00e9 pour le tout ou subsister pour le tout, car, comme le dit M. le juge Pr\u00e9vost, la Cour ne peut imposer \u00e0 l'une des parties un contrat qui ferait l'intim\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire d'une moiti\u00e9 indivise de l'immeuble.\nIl est presque inutile de rappeler que l'autorisation du mari \u00e9tait essentielle dans la pr\u00e9sente cause. Dans les cas o\u00f9 elle est n\u00e9cessaire, cette absence d'autorisation comporte une nullit\u00e9 absolue que rien ne peut couvrir. L'article 176 du Code Civil est \u00e0 l'effet qu'une femme mari\u00e9e ne peut ester en jugement sans l'autorisation ou l'assistance de son mari, quand m\u00eame elle serait non commune ou marchande publique. Quant \u00e0 la femme mari\u00e9e s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens, elle ne peut non plus ester en justice sauf, dit le Code, dans le cas pr\u00e9vu par le dernier alin\u00e9a de l'article 177 C.C. Le dernier alin\u00e9a de cette article est \u00e0 l'effet que si une femme mari\u00e9e est s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens, sa capacit\u00e9 d'agir civilement est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par les articles 210 et 1422 C.C. Or, si l'on r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 Particle 210 C.C., on voit que la s\u00e9paration de biens rend la femme capable de tous les actes de la vie civile, et supprime la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de l'autorisation maritale et judiciaire. Enfin, l'article 1422 C.C. dit que la femme mari\u00e9e ne peut sans autorisation, ali\u00e9ner ses immeubles.\nOr, dans le cas qui nous occupe, il fallait \u00e0 Dame Meehan l'autorisation de son mari, qu'elle a d'ailleurs obtenue pour vendre l'immeuble en question \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 Bigras. Il me semble impossible de soutenir qu'il ne lui faut pas \u00e9galement cette m\u00eame autorisation, dans un proc\u00e8s o\u00f9 l'on demande d'an\u00e9antir l'acte de vente qu'elle a consenti, avec cette autorisation n\u00e9cessaire.\nL'action ne peut donc pas r\u00e9ussir, et \u00e0 cause de cette conclusion o\u00f9 j'arrive, il me semble inutile de discuter les autres questions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es.\nJe rejetterais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Lanctot & Hamelin.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

(1939, c. 45)\u2014Secs. 1(b), 2(a), 5(1)(b), 19(c) of the Act, and Regulation 26 made under the Act. The Security Transfer Tax Act, 1939, Ont. (1939, c. 45), imposes a tax, payable by the vendor, transferer or assignor, \u201cupon every change of ownership consequent upon the sale, transfer or assignment\u201d of a \u201csecurity\u201d (defined by the Act to include any share of capital stock issued by any company), and authorizes regulations \u201cdetermining what constitutes a sale, transfer or assignment within the meaning of this Act.\u201d By regulation 26, \u201cif any company * * * makes distribution of or assigns to its shareholders assets consisting of taxable securities such distribution or assignment shall be deemed to constitute a sale, transfer or assignment of such securities within the meaning of the Act\u201d. By s. 5(1)(b) of the Act, the allotment by a company \u201cof its shares in order to effect an issue thereof\u201d shall not be subject to the tax.\nAppellant, a company, by an agreement sold its assets to another company, part of the consideration being payment by the latter of a sum to be satisfied by the allotment and issue by the purchasing company of 144,950 shares of its capital stock to shareholders of appellant pro rata. Appellant was to surrender its charter as soon as possible. In accordance with the agreement, the directors of the purchasing company allotted the shares to a trustee for the shareholders of appellant to be distributed among such shareholders, delivery of certificates of shares in the purchasing company to be made on surrender for cancellation of certificates of shares in appellant.\nHeld: Appellant was liable to the tax imposed by said Act. (Rand and Kellock JJ. dissented).\nPer Kerwin J.: The effect in law of the agreement and other proceedings (keeping in mind the distinction between a share and the certificate of the share) was that appellant became owner of the shares and (within the meaning of the Act and regulation 26) transferred or assigned them to its shareholders, and consequent upon that transfer or assignment there was a change of ownership from appellant to its shareholders. In contemplation of law there were two transactions, one between the two companies and the other between appellant and its shareholders.\nPer Hudson J.: The shares went to appellant\u2019s shareholders because, as such shareholders, they were entitled by law to the proceeds of the sale of appellant\u2019s assets. Under all the circumstances, it should be held that the purchasing company in making the distribution of shares did so on behalf of appellant, and that this in fact amounted to a distribution of taxable assets by appellant within the meaning of regulation 26.\nPer Taschereau J.: In determining whether appellant was liable for the tax, the substance and not the form of the transaction must be considered. In substance what was done was, issue of the shares in fulfilment of the purchasing company\u2019s obligation to appellant, and distribution, out of those shares, of appellant\u2019s assets (in contemplation of its voluntary liquidation) in fulfilment of appellant\u2019s obligation to its shareholders. That was what was covered by the procedure followed, and the direction to the purchasing company to issue the shares to appellant\u2019s shareholders did not change what was done in substance; this mere delegation did not affect or alter the legal rela- tions existing between the parties. The absentee of actual delivery and change of possession of certificates of shares by the purchasing company to appellant and by appellant to its shareholders\u2014a purely physical formality, which is merely the evidence, and not a constituting factor of the rights of the shareholders\u2014is irrelevant and has no bearing on the ownership of the shares; there was a legal change of ownership of the shares, which is what is taxable under the Act.\nPer Rand and Kellock JJ. (dissenting): The shares were never \u201cissued\u201d prior to their issue to the shareholders of appellant or to the trustee for them, and, therefore, there was no transfer or assignment or change of ownership thereafter to which the tax could attach. Appellant was never a shareholder of the purchasing company in respect to these shares; its only right under the agreement was to call for issue to third persons, namely, its own shareholders. Once given that the agreement constituted a real transaction, as to which no question was raised, its contents determined the legal rights of the parties thereto, and they were entitled to have the transaction take the form which it did take (Partington v. Attorney\u2011General, L.R. 4 H.L. 100, at 122; Maclay v. Dixon, [1944] 1 All E.R. 22, at 23; Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Duke of Westminster, [1936] A.C. 1, at 19, 24 et seq., 28, 31, cited. Swan Brewery Co. Ltd. v. The King, [1914] A.C. 231, discussed and distinguished).\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing the defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment of Mackay J. against it for a tax claimed by the plaintiff under The Security Transfer Tax Act, 1939, Ontario (1939, c. 45).\nBy an agreement between the defendant and another company, both incorporated under the Companies Act of Canada, the defendant sold all its assets to the other company (hereinafter sometimes called the purchasing company). The purchasing company, besides assuming two existing hypothecs, was to pay a net amount of $1,220,479, to be satisfied by the allotment and issue by the purchasing company of 144,950 shares of its capital stock to the shareholders of the defendant pro rata. The directors of the purchasing company passed a by-law (subject to confirmation by its shareholders) authorizing the execution and carrying out of the agreement and directing allotment and issue of the 144,950 shares to the shareholders of the defendant or to the trustees for said shareholders, and subsequently passed a resolution allotting the shares to a certain trust company as trustee for the shareholders of the defendant to be distributed by said trustee among the shareholders of the defendant so that each shareholder of the defendant would receive one share of the capital stock of the purchasing company for each two shares of the capital stock of the defendant held by such shareholder, and authorizing and directing the said trust company upon surrender up for cancellation by any shareholder of the defendant of his share certificate or certificates representing shares of the capital stock of the defendant, to deliver to such shareholder a certificate or certificates representing one share of the capital stock of the purchasing company for each two shares represented by the certificate or certificates so surrendered. Further details of the agreement, etc., appear in the reasons for judgment now reported.\nThe plaintiff, as Treasurer of the Province of Ontario and suing on behalf of His Majesty the King in right of the Province of Ontario, sued the defendant, claiming a declaration by the Court that the said issue and allotment of shares to the shareholders of the defendant was a change of ownership under The Security Transfer Tax Act, 1939, Ontario (1939, c. 45), a declaration that the said allotment and issue of shares was subject to tax under said Act, and an order directing the defendant to pay to the plaintiff the sum of $1,449.50 plus the penalties provided by the Act. The defendant denied that there was any tax imposed by the Act on the transaction.\nThe matter came before the Court by way of special case on the following question or questions: (1) Was the said allotment of 144,950 shares of its capital stock by the purchasing company an allotment in order to effect an issue thereof within the meaning of s. 5 of said Act? If the Court should be of opinion in the affirmative, then judgment should be for defendant, dismissing the action with costs; but if the Court should be of opinion in the negative, then there was the further question, (2) Was the said allotment and issue of 144,950 shares of its capital stock by the purchasing company a transfer of shares within the meaning of s. 2 of said Act and Regulation 26 of the Regulations passed pursuant to said Act and as such subject to transfer tax? If the Court should be of opinion in the affirmative, then there should be judgment for the plaintiff for $1,499.50 with costs; if the Court should be of opinion in the negative, then there should be judgment for defendant, dismissing the action with costs.\nThe relevant provisions of the Act and the said Regulation 26 are sufficiently set out in the reasons for judgment now reported.\nThe case was heard by Mackay J. who, at conclusion of the hearing, gave judgment for the plaintiff, holding that there was \u201cin substance, in effect a transfer within the contemplation of\u201d the Act. An appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed (no written reasons being given). Special leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nS.H. Robinson for the appellant.\nC.R. Magone K.C. for the respondent.\nKERWIN J.\u2014The sole point for determination raised by the parties to this litigation is whether the appellant, Canada China Clay, Limited, is liable to the respondent, the Treasurer of the Province of Ontario, for a tax and penalties under the provisions of the Ontario Security Transfer Tax Act, 1939, and No. 26 of the regulations made by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council in pursuance thereof. So far the appellant has met with no success, as the action of the plaintiff, respondent, was sustained by the trial judge and an appeal therefrom was dismissed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. In my opinion, the Courts below were right in so deciding.\nBy section 2 of the Act:\u2014\nThere shall be imposed, levied, collected and paid to His Majesty for the uses of Ontario, a tax,\u2014\n(a) upon every change of ownership consequent upon the sale, transfer or assignment of a security made or carried into effect in Ontario;\nBy section 1 (b):\u2014\nSecurity shall include,\u2014\n(i) any share of capital stock or debenture stock and any bond or debenture issued by any association, company, corporation or government; Section 19 (c) enacts:\u2014\nThe Lieutenant-Governor in Council may make regulations,\u2014\n(c) determining what constitutes a sale, transfer or assignment within the meaning of this Act;\nRegulation 26 reads as follows:\u2014\nIf any company, corporation, association or syndicate for any reason, makes distribution of or assigns to its shareholders assets consisting of taxable securities such distribution or assignment shall be deemed to constitute a sale, transfer or assignment of such securities within the meaning of the Act.\nBy a written agreement, the appellant sold and Canada China Clay and Silica, Limited, purchased all the business, undertaking, goodwill and corporate franchise of the vendor, and all of its movable and immovable property, cash on hand and accounts receivable. In consideration of the transfer, the purchaser agreed, in addition to assuming two hypothecs, to pay the vendor certain specified sums of money, less the vendor\u2019s liabilities, other than its capital stock,\nleaving a net amount of one million two hundred and twenty thousand four hundred and seventy-nine dollars ($1,220,479.00), the whole to be satisfied by the allotment and issue by the purchaser of one hundred and forty-four thousand nine hundred and fifty (144,950) shares without nominal or par value of the capital stock of the purchaser as fully paid and non-assessable shares to the shareholders of the vendor pro rata to the number of shares of the vendor held by each of its shareholders.\nThis agreement was authorized by a by-law of the directors of Canada China Clay and Silica, Limited, which also authorized and directed its directors to allot and issue the 144,950 shares to the shareholders of Canada China Clay, Limited, or to the trustees for those shareholders. Pursuant to the by-law and agreement the directors of Canada China Clay and Silica, Limited, allotted the shares to Chartered Trust and Executor Company as trustee for the shareholders of the appellant, to be distributed by the trustee among such shareholders so that each would receive one share of the capital stock of Canada China Clay and Silica, Limited, for each two shares of the capital stock of the appellant held by such shareholder.\nWhat was the effect in law of these proceedings? The appellant sold its assets and the consideration therefor was the 144,950 shares of the capital stock of Canada China Clay and Silica, Limited. Having been allotted and issued by the directors of the latter company, these shares are a \u201csecurity\u201d as defined by section 1 (b) of the Act. Although allotted and issued direct to a trustee for the shareholders of the appellant, once the distinction between a share of capital stock of a company and the certificate of such share is borne in mind, I am unable to agree with the contention that the appellant did not become the owner of these shares. Whatever question might have arisen as to whether the distribution by the appellant to its shareholders of assets consisting of taxable securities was a transfer or assignment under section 2 (a) of the Act, appears to me to be set at rest by regulation 26 which did not go beyond the terms of section 19 (c) of the Act. This being so, there was a change of ownership from the appellant to its shareholders consequent upon the transfer or assignment of the shares of the purchasing company. In one sense while there was but one transaction, in contemplation of law there were two transactions, one between the two companies and the other between the appellant and its shareholders.\nIt was argued that the appellant was not subject to the tax in view of the provisions of section 5 (1) (b) of the Act, which so far as is material reads as follows:\u2014\nThe following transactions shall not be subject to the tax imposed by this Act,\u2014\n(b) the allotment by an association, company or corporation of its shares in order to effect an issue thereof.\nThe short answer to that contention, in my view, is that no claim is made to a tax upon the allotment by Canada China Clay and Silica, Limited, of its shares.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nHUDSON J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs and have very little to add to what has been said by my brothers Kerwin and Taschereau.\nThe appellant company sold its undertaking and entire assets to Canada China Clay and Silica Ltd. The consideration for this sale was the assumption by the purchaser of the outstanding obligations of the appellant and a sum of $1,220,479 which was to be satisfied by the allotment and issue by the purchaser of 144,950 shares of its capital stock to the shareholders of the appellant pro rata. The appellant agreed to surrender its charter as soon as possible and, in order to insure the fulfilment of the agreement notwithstanding the dissolution, the appellant appointed the purchaser \u201cits true and lawful attorney for it and in its name, place and stead to execute and deliver all\u201d deeds, transfers, etc., of the undertaking, property and assets of the appellant in favour of the purchaser, etc.\nThe assets were duly conveyed by the appellant to the purchaser and thereupon the directors of the purchasing company allotted the shares in question to the Chartered Trust and Executor Company as trustee for the shareholders of the appellant, to be distributed by said trustee among the said shareholders, one share of the capital stock of the purchaser for each two shares held by such shareholder for the appellant company. It further provided that the certificates should be issued to such shareholders upon surrender for cancellation of the shares which were held in the appellant company.\nIn the result, the entire proceeds of the sale by the appellant came to its shareholders in the form of share certificates in the purchasing company.\nTo fulfill its undertaking in the agreement for sale the appellant was bound to surrender its charter as soon as possible. In order to effect a legal surrender it was necessary for it to comply with the provisions of section 29 (1) (a) of the Dominion Companies Act, 1934, which provides as follows:\n29. (1) The charter of a company may be surrendered if the company proves to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State\n(a) that it has no assets and that any assets owned by it immediately prior to the application for leave to surrender its charter have been divided rateably amongst its shareholders or members; * * *\nThe delivery of share certificates in the purchasing company was made conditional on surrender for cancellation of the certificates in the appellant company.\nAll these proceedings appear from the record to have been almost contemporaneous and to be merely steps in a single transaction. The shares in question went to the shareholders of the appellant because they were shareholders of that company and as such entitled by law to the proceeds of the sale of that company\u2019s assets.\nUnder all of these circumstances, in my opinion it should be held that the purchasing company in making the distribution of shares did so on behalf of the appellant, and that this in fact amounted to a distribution of taxable assets by the appellant within the meaning of Regulation 26.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014On the 17th of September, 1941, the appellant, Canada China Clay, Limited, sold all its assets to Canada China Clay and Silica, Limited.\nIn consideration of this sale, the purchaser agreed to pay to the vendor $504,426.89 for the mine buildings, plant and equipment; $195,868.88 in respect of the amount spent by the vendor in the exploration and development of its mine properties; $31,211.44 for current assets; $1,000,000 for mine properties, less $511,028.21, amount of liabilities, making a grand total of $1,220,479. This sum was payable by the allotment and issue by the purchaser of 144,950 shares without nominal or par value of its capital stock, as fully paid and non\u2011assessable, to the shareholders of the vendor.\nThe agreement entered into was ratified by the directors and shareholders of the respective companies, and, at a later date, the directors of the Canada China Clay and Silica, Limited, were authorized and directed to issue 144,-950 shares of its capital stock to the shareholders of the Canada China Clay, Limited, or to the trustees for said shareholders.\nNo tax was paid by the vendor company under The Security Transfer Tax Act, 1939, in respect of the allotment and issue of these shares, and the Treasurer of the Province of Ontario, therefore, brought action against the appellant in which he claimed a declaration by the Court that the said issue and allotment of shares direct to the shareholders of Canada China Clay, Limited, is a change of ownership under the Act, that said allotment and issue of shares is subject to tax under the Security Transfer Tax Act, and an order directing the defendant-appellant to pay the sum of $1,449.50, plus the penalties provided by the Act.\nThe contention of the defendant is that the agreement entered into with the Canada China Clay and Silica, Limited, to allot and issue 144,950 shares of its capital stock, did not in any way constitute a change of ownership within the meaning of the Security Transfer Tax Act, and that the transaction is not subject to any tax imposed by the Act.\nThe action was maintained and the judgment of Mr. Justice Mackay was unanimously confirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nThe relevant sections of the Security Transfer Tax Act are the following:\u2014\n1. In this Act,\u2014\n(b) \u201cSecurity\u201d shall include,\u2014\n(i) any share of capital stock or debenture stock and any bond or debenture issued by any association, company, corporation or government;\n2. There shall be imposed, levied, collected and paid to His Majesty for the uses of Ontario, a tax,\u2014\n(a) upon every change of ownership consequent upon the sale, transfer or assignment of a security made or carried into effect in Ontario;\n4. The tax imposed by this Act shall be payable in security transfer tax stamps or cash by the vendor, transferor, assignor or, in the case of transfers and deliveries referred to in clauses c and d of section 2, by the person, company, corporation, bank or trust company making delivery.\n5. (1) The following transactions shall not be subject to the tax imposed by this Act,\u2014\n(b) the allotment by an association, company or corporation of its shares in order to effect an issue thereof.\n19. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council may make regulations,\u2014\n(c) determining what constitutes a sale, transfer or assignment within the meaning of this Act;\nREGULATION 26.\nIf any company, corporation, association or syndicate for any reason, makes distribution of or assigns to its shareholders assets consisting of taxable securities such distribution or assignment shall be deemed to constitute a sale, transfer or assignment of such securities within the meaning of the Act.\nIn order to determine if the appellant is bound to pay the amount of tax which is claimed, the substance and not the form of the transaction must be considered. It is quite true that under the Act (section 5, paragraph (b)), the allotment of shares by a company, in order to effect an issue thereof, is exempt from taxation, and the form with which the transaction has been clothed would at first sight create the impression that there has been no transfer of shares.\nBut I do not think that this is the situation. In selling its assets to the Canada China Clay and Silica, Limited, the appellant was entitled to receive 144,950 shares without nominal or par value. That was the consideration for the sale, as these shares represented the purchase price paid for the property of the appellant company. If the Canada China Clay and Silica, Limited, had not fulfilled its obligation to allot, issue and deliver such shares, the appellant would have been entitled to bring action to compel it to do so.\nNormally, the shares should have been issued to the appellant, which was the party entitled to them, and they would have become a part of its assets, available for distribution to its shareholders, in the event of a voluntary liquidation, which was then contemplated. These operations really involved two transactions, the first between the two companies, and the second, between the appellant and its shareholders.\nThe direction given to the purchaser to issue these shares to appellant\u2019s shareholders did not change the substance of these two independent transactions, and this mere delegation of payment did not affect or alter the legal relations existing between both parties. The procedure followed, in reality covered these two transactions, and as a result of the single operation that has taken place, two different obligations have been fulfilled. The Canada China Clay and Silica, Limited, has paid its debt to the appellant, and the latter, out of these shares, has distributed its assets to its shareholders.\nThere was no actual delivery and change of possession of a certificate of shares by the Canada China Clay and Silica, Limited, to the appellant and by the latter to its shareholders; but the absence of this purely physical formality, which is merely the evidence, and not a constituting factor of the rights of the shareholders, is irre- levant, and has no bearing whatever on the ownership of these shares. In fact, there was no transfer of a certificate of shares, but there was a legal change of ownership, and this is precisely what is taxable under the Act (section 2, paragraph a).\nI believe that the appellant cannot escape the payment of the tax, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rand and Kellock JJ., dissenting, was delivered by\nKELLOCK J.\u2014This is an appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment at trial in favour of the respondent in an action brought by the latter for a declaration that a certain transaction fell within the provisions of The Security Transfer Tax Act, 1939 (chapter 45), and for the recovery of certain taxes consequent thereon. The parties submitted a special case for the opinion of the Court from which it appears that by an agreement dated the 17th of September, 1941, between the appellant as vendor and Canada China Clay and Silica, Limited, as purchaser, it was provided that the latter should purchase the assets of the former upon certain terms. The important clause in the agreement is 3 (a), which reads as follows:\n3 (a) To pay to the Vendor the sum of Five Hundred and Four Thousand Four Hundred and Twenty-Six Dollars and Eighty-nine Cents ($504,426.89) for the mine buildings, plant and equipment of the Vendor and One Hundred and Ninety-five Thousand Eight Hundred and Sixty-eight Dollars and Eighty-eight Cents ($195,868.88) in respect of the amount spent by the Vendor in the exploration and development of its mining properties and Thirty-one Thousand Two Hundred and Eleven Dollars and Forty-four Cents ($31,211.44) for current assets of the Vendor and in addition the sum of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) for the mining properties and all other assets of the Vendor less Five Hundred and Eleven Thousand and Twenty-eight Dollars and Twenty-one Cents ($511,028.21) being the amount of the liabilities of the Vendor other than its Capital Stock, leaving a net amount of One Million Two Hundred and Twenty Thousand Four Hundred and Seventy-nine Dollars ($1,200,479.00), the whole to be satisfied by the allotment and issue by the Purchaser of One Hundred and Forty-four Thousand Nine Hundred and Fifty (144,950) shares without nominal or par value of the Capital Stock of the Purchaser as fully paid and non-assessable shares to the Shareholders of the Vendor pro rata to the number of shares of the Vendor held by each of its Shareholders; The execution of this agreement by the purchasing company was authorized by by-law of the directors of the company, paragraph 2 of which provided as follows:\n2. That under and pursuant to the terms of such Agreement upon the approval of this By-law by the Shareholders, the Directors be and are hereby authorized and directed to allot and issue One Hundred and Forty-four Thousand Nine Hundred and Fifty (144,950) shares without nominal or par value of the Capital Stock of this Company as fully paid and non-assessable shares to the Shareholders of Canada China Clay, Limited, or to the Trustees for said Shareholders.\nSubsequent to the execution of the agreement, a resolution was passed by the directors of the purchasing company allotting the shares to a trust company as trustee for the shareholders of the appellant company to be distributed pro rata in accordance with their shareholdings in the appellant.\nThe learned trial judge held that the transaction was subject to tax as being a transfer within the Act. The appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed, no written reasons being given.\nBy section 1 (b) of the Act, it is provided that \u201c\u2018security\u2019 shall include (i) any share of capital stock or debenture stock and any bond or debenture issued by any * * * company\u201d. Section 2 (a) is the taxing section. It provides for a tax upon \u201cevery change of ownership consequent upon the sale, transfer or assignment of a security made or carried into effect in Ontario\u201d. By section 4, it is provided that the tax is payable by the vendor, transferor or assignor. By section 19, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council is authorized to make regulations determining what shall constitute a sale, transfer or assignment within the meaning of the Act. Under the authority of this section, regulations were passed including regulation 26 as follows:\nIf any company * * * for any reason, makes distribution of or assigns to its shareholders assets consisting of taxable securities such distribution or assignment shall be deemed to constitute a sale, transfer or assignment of such securities within the meaning of the Act.\nFor the appellant, it is contended that there was no \u201cchange of ownership\u201d of any \u201cissued\u201d shares at all and that section 2, by reason of the definition of \u201csecurity\u201d, applies only to a change of ownership of shares already issued. Appellant argues that, upon well settled principles, unless the transaction can be brought within the fair intendment of the legislation, having regard to the language employed, the respondent must fail. Counsel for the respondent admits, as perforce he must, that in the form in which the transaction is found, it is not caught by the language of the statute, but he argues that it is the substance of the transaction which must be looked at and he contends that the substance of the transaction here in question is a sale by the appellant of its assets for shares in the purchasing company and a distribution by the appellant of those shares to its shareholders. In his factum, he says: \u201cIt is submitted that a company cannot by the mere expedient of changing the form but not the substance of a transaction escape taxation\u201d.\nIt may be granted at once that had the transaction now in question taken a form other than that which it did take, namely the issue of the shares to the vendor, the appellant company, and the distribution of such shares to the shareholders of the appellant, it would clearly have fallen within the provisions of regulation 26 and, even without that regulation, within the language of section 2 (a) itself. The transaction, however, did not assume that form.\nLord Cairns in his oft quoted judgment in Partington v. Attorney General[1] said:\nI am not at all sure that, in a case of this kind\u2014a fiscal case\u2014form is not amply sufficient; because, as I understand the principle of all fiscal legislation, it is this: If the person sought to be taxed comes within the letter of the law he must be taxed, however great the hardship may appear to the judicial mind to be. On the other hand, if the Crown, seeking to recover the tax, cannot bring the subject within the letter of the law, the subject is free, however apparently within the spirit of the law the case might otherwise appear to be. In other words, if there be admissible, in any statute, what is called an equitable construction, certainly such a construction is not admissible in a taxing statute, where you can simply adhere to the words of the statute.\nIn giving the judgment of the Court in Maclay v. Dixon[2] Scott L.J. said at page 23:\nIn my opinion, they were both entitled so to arrange the matter, as not to attract the control of the Acts, or, putting it positively, as to prevent the Acts from applying. If the actual transaction was not within the Acts, it made no legal difference that the parties had intentionally kept it out of the Acts. In the case at bar then, the Crown must show a transfer involving a change of ownership of a \u201csecurity\u201d within the meaning of the Security Transfer Tax Act. Having regard to what the Act states is a security, the burden upon the Crown is to show in the first place that the shares in question were issued, and in the second place that subsequently there was a transfer of the shares to a new owner.\nThe first question which arises, then, is as to when the shares in question became \u201cissued\u201d shares within the meaning of the Act. In order that a share may be issued, it must be issued to somebody who is a shareholder. In my opinion, the shares in question were never \u201cissued\u201d at any time prior to their issue to the shareholders of the appellant company or to the trustee for them, and, therefore, there was no transfer or assignment or change of ownership thereafter to which the tax could attach. The respondent does not seek to make any point with respect to any question of transfer as between the trustee for the shareholders and the shareholders themselves no doubt because there would be no change of ownership as between such trustee and the shareholders who would be the beneficial owners.\nThe appellant company was never at any time a shareholder of the purchasing company in respect to these shares. It never had any right under the agreement in question except the right to call for the issue of these shares to third persons, namely, its own shareholders. Once given that the agreement constituted a real transaction, and there is no question raised with regard to this, its contents determine the legal rights of the parties thereto and the only legal right of the appellant, as above pointed out, on the document was the right already mentioned.\nIn Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Duke of Westminster[3], Lord Russell of Killowen said:\nThe Commissioners and Finlay J. took the opposite view on the ground that (as they said) looking at the substance of the thing the payments were payments of wages. This simply means that the true legal position is disregarded, and a different legal right and lia- bility substituted in the place of the legal right and liability which the parties have created. I confess that I view with disfavour the doctrine that in taxation cases the subject is to be taxed if, in accordance with a Court\u2019s view of what it considers the substance of the transaction, the Court thinks that the case falls within the contemplation or spirit of the statute. The subject is not taxable by inference or by analogy, but only by the plain words of a statute applicable to the facts and circumstances of his case.\nLord Russell then referred to what was said by Lord Cairns in Partington v. Attorney General already cited above, and proceeded:\nIf all that is meant by the doctrine is that, having once ascertained the legal rights of the parties, you may disregard mere nomenclature and decide the question of taxability or non-taxability in accordance with the legal rights, well and good. That is what this House did in the case of Secretary of State in Council of India v. Scoble[4]; that and no more. If, on the other hand, the doctrine means that you may brush aside deeds, disregard the legal rights and liabilities arising under a contract between parties, and decide the question of taxability or non-taxability upon the footing of the rights and liabilities of the parties being different from what in law they are, then I entirely dissent from such a doctrine.\nThe substance of the transaction between Allman and the Duke is in my opinion, to be found, and to be found only, by ascertaining their respective rights and liabilities under the deed, the legal effect of which is what I have already stated.\nLord Tomlin dealt with the same point at page 19 as follows:\nApart, however, from the question of contract with which I have dealt, it is said that in revenue cases there is a doctrine that the Court may ignore the legal position and regard what is called\u2019 \u201cthe substance of the matter,\u201d and that here the substance of the matter is that the annuitant was serving the Duke for something equal to his former salary or wages, and that therefore, while he is so serving, the annuity must be treated as salary or wages. This supposed doctrine (upon which the Commissioners apparently acted) seems to rest for its support upon a misunderstanding of language used in some earlier cases. The sooner this misunderstanding is dispelled, and the supposed doctrine given its quietus, the better it will be for all concerned, for the doctrine seems to involve substituting \u201cthe incertain and crooked cord of discretion\u201d for \u201cthe golden and streight metwand of the law.\u201d Every man is entitled if he can to order his affairs so as that the tax attaching under the appropriate Acts is less than it otherwise would be. If he succeeds in ordering them so as to secure this result, then, however unappreciative the Commissioners of Inland Revenue or his fellow taxpayers may be of his ingenuity, he cannot be compelled to pay an increased tax. This so-called doctrine of \u201cthe substance\u201d seems to me to be nothing more than an attempt to make a man pay notwithstanding that he has so ordered his affairs that the amount of tax sought from him is not legally claimable. I refer also to the judgment of Lord MacMillan at page 28, as well as to the judgment of Lord Wright at page 31 as follows:\nAnd once it is admitted that the deed is a genuine document, there is in my opinion no room for the phrase \u201cin substance.\u201d Or, more correctly, the true nature of the legal obligation and nothing else is \u201cthe substance.\u201d I need not develop this point, as I agree with what has been said by my noble and learned friends, Lord Tomlin and Lord Russell of Killowen.\nThe shares in question herein were issued pursuant to the resolution of the directors, Exhibit\u2011C, which allotted the shares to the trustee for the shareholders of the appellant company to be distributed among them in a certain proportion. Whether a shareholder in the appellant company could be made a shareholder in the purchasing company against his will, or whether he does not become such until he has taken effective steps to accept the shares to which he is entitled, need not be decided on this appeal. In my view, the appellant company at least, never became a shareholder and never had any shares issued to it. It was, therefore, never in a position to distribute or transfer or assign the shares to its shareholders. The agreement between the two companies might have been drawn in such a way as to come within the provisions of the Act and the regulations, but the parties provided otherwise, as they were entitled, in my view on the basis of the above authorities, to do.\nI do not think that the authorities to which we were referred by counsel for the respondent are in point. They arose in other circumstances and under other statutory provisions and I do not find any principle in them applicable to the case at bar. I desire to refer to one only, namely, Swan Brewery Company, Limited v. The King[5], and to the judgment of Lord Sumner, particularly at page 235. What was in question in the case was whether or not certain bonus shares were to be considered a dividend within the meaning of a statute of Western Australia defining dividend as including \u201cevery dividend, profit, advantage or gain intended to be paid or credited to or distributed among any members or directors of any company, In that case the company, having certain accumu- lated profits, passed resolutions providing for the transfer of a portion thereof to share capital account and issued to the existing shareholders new shares as fully paid up for the same amount. It was held that these shares fell within this definition as being advantages to the shareholders. Lord Sumner, however, went on to say that what was done was, in a sense, all one transaction, but that there were really two transactions, namely the creation and issue of the new shares on the company\u2019s part and on the shareholders\u2019 part the satisfaction of the liability to pay for them by acquiescing in the transfer from the reserve to share capital. He held in effect that what had taken place was the distribution among shareholders of the profits in question and the repayment by the shareholders to the company of the same amount as the price of the new shares. This judgment has been considered in Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Blot[6] and Commissioner of Income Tax, Bengal v. Mercantile Bank of India, Limited[7]. Whatever may have been the facts of the transaction dealt with in the Swan Brewery case[8], the question there involved was quite different from that in the case at bar. I do not read the opinion of Lord Sumner as expressed in the latter part of his judgment as laying down a principle of general application opposed to the principle affirmed by the judgments in the Duke of Westminster case[9] already mentioned.\nFor these reasons, I would allow the appeal with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Holden, Murdoch, Walton, Finlay & Robinson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C.R.

The trial judge found that some of the instruments, but not all of them, were tools a truck driver might use in his trade, while all of the instruments so found were capable of being used for purposes of housebreaking. But he further stated that he was satisfied, in all the surrounding circumstances established in evidence, that at that particular time and place the tools were not in the appellant's possession for an innocent purpose, and, \"on the whole of the evidence\", he found the appellant guilty. The conviction was affirmed by a majority of the Court of Appeal. The dissenting judge was of the opinion that the trial judge failed to apply the principle in Rex v. Ward (85 L.J.K.B. 483), where it was held that the accused had prima facie satisfied the onus cast upon him of proving that he had a lawful excuse for his possession of the tools and that the onus was then cast upon the prosecution of proving affirmatively that the accused had no lawful excuse for being in possession of the tools at that particular time and place.\nHeld, Kellock J. dissenting, that, in the circumstances of this case and upon the evidence, the trial judge was legally warranted in drawing the conclusions he arrived at. The decision in Rex v. Ward (supra) does not apply. In that case, the trial judge had directed the jury that it was for the accused to establish to their entire satisfaction that his possession of the implements was lawful; while the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the jury had not been properly directed with regard to the onus of proof. In the present case the trial judge was sitting alone without a jury; it was not necessary for him to expound the law and then verbally apply it to the facts in giving his reasons for judgment; and it should be sufficient if it appears he was alive to the law and that he properly charged himself when reaching his finding upon the evidence. Moreover, the findings alone would be sufficient to take this case out of the application of the Ward case.\nPer Kellock J. dissenting:\u2014The trial judge did not properly direct himself as to the law applicable as laid down in the Ward case. Therefore, the question for decision is as to whether or not he must \"inevitably\" have come to a conclusion of the guilt of the accused on the evidence, notwithstanding such misdirection; and this must depend upon whether the Crown discharged the onus of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had possession with guilty intent. The circumstances disclosed in evidence upon which the Crown can rely are not sufficient to make the result, that the accused was guilty, inevitable. There should be a new trial.\nAPPEAL by Mihalchan, one of the accused, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] dismissing (O'Halloran J.A. dissenting) his appeal from his conviction, on a trial before the County Court of Westminster, Whiteside J., on a charge of being found by night in possession of instruments of housebreaking without lawful excuse, contrary to section 464 (a) of the Criminal Code.\nThe appellant and one Smylski were charged jointly with possession of housebreaking instruments. The implements consisted of a substantial assortment of tools, together with a piece of celluloid, found in the car the appellant was driving. The trial judge acquitted Smylski but convicted the appellant and sentenced him to six months' imprisonment.\nNo one appearing for the appellant.\nE. Pepler K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin, Taschereau and Rand JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The appellant was convicted in the County Court Judge's Criminal Court at New Westminster, B.C., of having been found in possession by night, without lawful excuse, of instruments of housebreaking, contrary to section 464 (a) of the Criminal Code.\nThe conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, but there was a dissent in that Court and the appeal here is on the question on which there has been dissent.\nIn the formal judgment appealed from the dissent is expressed thus:\u2014\nMr. Justice O'Halloran dissents from this judgment upon the grounds that the trial judge misdirected himself as to the onus of proof and failed to apply the correct legel principles in considering the explanation of the appellant in relation to his possession of the alleged housebreaking instruments and in discharging the onus placed upon him by section 464 (a) of the Criminal Code.\nIn his reasons the learned dissenting judge stated that, in his opinion, the trial judge failed to apply the principle in Rex v. Ward[2] . The point would be that when once the instruments found in the possession of the accused, although capable of being used for purposes of housebreaking, are also shown to be the ordinary tools which the accused might well use in his trade, the accused thus establishes prima facie a sufficient excuse, and the burden shifts upon the prosecution of satisfying the jury, from the other circumstances, that the accused had no lawful excuse for being in possession of these tools at that particular time and place.\nIn the Ward case[3] , the Deputy Chairman had directed the jury that it was for the accused to establish to their satisfaction that his possession of the implements in ques- tion was lawful. It was held by the Court of Criminal Appeal that the jury had not been properly directed with regard to the onus of proof and the appeal was allowed.\nIn the present case the trial judge was sitting alone without a jury. It was not necessary for him to expound the law and then verbally apply it to the facts in giving his reasons for judgment. It should be sufficient if it appears he was alive to the law and that he properly charged himself when reaching his finding upon the evidence. (The King v. Frank[4] ).\nHere no error in direction, or self-direction, was made manifest and the learned judge's reasons do not warrant the conclusion that he misdirected himself, or that he proceeded upon an erroneous view of the law, and this is not to be assumed.\nThe appellant is a truck driver and the learned judge found that some of the instruments in the appellant's possession\u2014but not all of them\u2014were tools a truck driver might use in his trade; while all of the instruments so found were capable of being used for purposes of housebreaking. These findings alone would be sufficient to take the case out of the application of Rex v. Ward.[5] .\nBut, moreover, the learned judge was satisfied, in all the surrounding circumstances established in evidence, that at that particular time and place the tools were not in the appellant's possession for an innocent purpose; and, as stated in his judgment, \"on the whole of the evidence\" the learned judge found the appellant guilty.\nIt was recognized in the Ward case[6] that \"other circumstances\" might displace the prima facie proof, or show a guilty intent, and it was, of course, for the learned trial judge in the present case, acting as judge and jury, to say whether or not, in the particular circumstances, the possession was innocent.\nWith deference, I do not see here any misdirection on the part of the trial judge and I think, in the circumstances and upon the evidence, he was legally warranted in drawing the conclusions he arrived at.\nI would dismiss the appeal. KELLOCK J. (dissenting).\u2014All the members of the Court of Appeal were of opinion that, with the exception of the piece of celluloid, all the tools found in the possession of the accused were tools which the accused might reasonably require in his occupation as a truck driver in Northern British Columbia. The possession of such tools, excepting the celluloid, was then prima facie explained. (Rex v. Ward[7].) The learned trial judge believed the statement of the accused that the celluloid had come into his possession with the car when he purchased the latter some months earlier. O'Halloran J.A. who dissented did so because in his view the learned trial judge had misdirected himself in failing to apply the principle of the above decision with the result that the evidence was never properly considered from the standpoint of the burden under which the Crown came by reason of the explanation furnished by the accused's occupation for his possession of the tools, excepting the celluloid.\nA reading of the judgement at trial, coupled with the learned judge's report, satisfies me that the learned judge did not properly direct himself as to the law applicable as laid down in Rex v. Ward[8] . In his report he says that the accused's excuse for being on his way to Port Haney seemed flimsy\nwhen heard in connection with his explanation of why he happened to have such a complete housebreaking equipment in his truck\n(he should have said car). The explanation of the accused for his possession of the tools apart from the celluloid by reason of his occupation was perfectly good, and as I have said, was so regarded by all the members of the Court of Appeal, and as to the celluloid, the learned judge believed the accused when he said it had come with the car. To my mind the above passage indicates that the learned judge paid no attention to the fact that the tools were tools of the accused in connection with his occupation and regarded the burden imposed by section 464 (a) Cr. C. as never having been other than throughout on the accused.\nIf that be so the question for decision is as to whether or not the learned trial judge must inevitably have come to a conclusion of the guilt of the accused on the evidence, notwithstanding the misdirection; Stirland v. Public Prosecutor[9] . This must depend upon whether the Crown discharged the onus of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had possession with guilty intent.\nThe circumstances disclosed in evidence upon which the Crown can rely is (1) the presence of the celluloid,[10] the evidence as to the errand in Port Haney upon which the accused was engaged at the time and (3) the evidence of the appellant and Smylski that they had approached the garage thinking it was a place where they could buy cigarettes.\nIn my opinion there is no \"inevitability\" about the celluloid in view of the acceptance by the learned trial judge of the explanation with regard to it, and if it amounts to nothing it adds nothing to the other circumstances. As to number 2, its coupling by the learned judge in his report, with the explanation by the accused of his possession of the tools, as already pointed out, makes it impossible for me to say he would not have believed this evidence had he not been in error with regard to the tools. In addition there was a tailor by the name of Mostrenko in Port Haney, and the learned judge has misapprehended this part of the evidence as he refers to \"the very inadequate sum\" of three dollars paid to the appellant by Smylski \"for the trip\". It was not paid for the trip but for the gas which would be used on the trip. It was therefore not an inadequate sum at all.\nThis leaves (3) above. What is the evidence with regard to this? Smylski says:\u2014\nI thought I would go and buy a chocolate bar, or soft drink. We got near the side-walk, and he (the appellant) said \"It is closed\". And we were talking about it was too far to go back, and then he said \"There is someone stealing the car\". We ran back.\nThe appellant said:\u2014\nAt that time I did'nt think it was constable Saunders, but we passed the car, walking to the garage. We stopped there and noticed there was it was not a business place at night, like it was a confectionery; not in our line. We decided to turn back because it was too far to go to town from there. It would be foolish. Either that or we would have to go back. And sudden, I heard the car start, and I said \"Joe somebody is stealing our car\".\nConstable Saunders said that he noticed the car, which later proved to be the appellant's, parked by the roadside with its lights out. He stopped and got out and before the appellant and Smylski came up he had been there long enough to get into the car, start and stop the engine and get out of the car. As he had driven past the garage previously he had noticed \"two figures near the garage and I thought it was somebody just walking by\".\nThe reason given by the accused and Smylski for leaving the car and approaching the garage was that they thought it was a place where they could buy cigarettes. They had previously driven past a number of places where they could have done so.\nWould the learned trial judge have refused to believe this as an explanation of the presence of the accused near the garage or should he have done so, had he correctly approached a consideration of all the evidences. With respect I find myself unable to say that such a result was inevitable. I therefore think that there should be a new trial and I would allow the appeal accordingly.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] [1944] 82 Can. Cr.
