The King\nCollection\nSupreme Court Judgments\nDate\n1932-01-13\nReport\n[1932] SCR 101\nJudges\nRinfret, Thibaudeau\nOn appeal from\nQuebec\nSubjects\nCriminal law\nDecision Content\nSupreme Court of Canada\nLiebling v. The King, [1932] S.C.R. 101\nDate: 1932-01-13.\nSam Liebling Appellant;\nand\nHis Majesty The King Respondent.\n1932: January 5, 13.\nPresent:\u2014Rinfret J. in chambers.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nCriminal law\u2014Leave to appeal\u2014Section 1025 Cr. \u0421.\u2014Application should indicate judgments alleged to be in conflict\u2014Rule 54 of this court\u2014Conviction of an insolvent for not having kept books\u2014Whether conflicting decisions were \u201cin a like case\u201d and from an \u201cother court of appeal\u201d\u2014Section 417c Cr. \u0421\u2014Section 193 Bankruptcy Act.\nWhen application is made under section 1025 Cr. \u0421. for leave to appeal in a criminal case, it is not sufficient to allege that the decision which is intended to be appealed from \u201cconflicts with decisions of different courts of equal jurisdiction\u201d; but the application, in order to comply with rule 54 of this court, should indicate specifically the judgments of other courts of appeal alleged to be in conflict with the decision to be appealed from.\nThe appellant was an insolvent trader and had been convicted under section 417c Cr. \u0421. for not having kept proper books of account. Application for leave to appeal under s. 1025 Cr. \u0421. was made on the ground that, inasmuch as section 417c Cr. \u0421. was alleged to have been virtually abrogated by section 193 of the Bankruptcy Act subsequently enacted, the decision of the appellate court in affirming the conviction failed to apply the principle of law that a subsequent statutory enactment has the effect of abrogating an anterior enactment which is inconsistent with it; and, at the hearing, counsel for the applicant cited three judgments which were alleged to be in conflict with the above decision.\nHeld that the application for leave to appeal should be dismissed as the judgments cited were not rendered \u201cin a like case\u201d and by an \u201cother court of appeal\u201d within the provisions of section 1025 Cr. \u0421.; besides, they were not in conflict with the decision intended to be appealed from: the appellate court had clearly admitted the principle of law above cited; but it had held that section 193 of the Bankruptcy Act was not inconsistent with the provisions of section 417c Cr. \u0421.\nSemble that a single judge, although sitting on appeal from a conviction by a magistrate, is not a \u201ccourt of appeal\u201d within the meaning of section 1025 Cr. \u0421.\nAPPLICATION for special leave to appeal from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, upholding a conviction of the appellant under section 417c Cr. \u0421.\nS. J. Smilovictz, with Alleyn Taschereau K. C. for the applicant.\nV. Bienvenu contra. Rinfret, J.\u2014Les conditions exig\u00e9es par l\u2019article 1025 du code criminel pour qu\u2019un juge de cette cour puisse permettre l\u2019appel sont que\nle jugement dont il est interjet\u00e9 appel (soit) en apposition \u00e0 celui d\u2019une autre cour d\u2019appel dans une cause de m\u00eame nature.\nLa requ\u00eate que l\u2019on m\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e se contente d\u2019all\u00e9guer ce qui suit:\nWhereas the decision of the said Court of Appeal conflicts with the definition of the Criminal Code and that of the Bankruptcy Act, which two acts are in contradiction, and also with the decisions of different courts of equal jurisdiction:\nJe doute que cette all\u00e9gation soit r\u00e9dig\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 54 des R\u00e8gles de cette cour. Dire simplement que la d\u00e9cision dont on entend interjeter appel \u201cconflicts with the decisions of different courts of equal jurisdiction\u201d ne me para\u00eet gu\u00e8re se conformer \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle qui veut que \u201cthe notice of motion shall set out fully the grounds upon which it is based\u201d; et je croirais qu\u2019un avis de motion, pour se pr\u00e9valoir de cet article, devrait n\u00e9cessairement indiquer quels sont les jugements des autres cours d\u2019appel avec lesquels la d\u00e9cision dont on se plaint est en opposition. Cependant le savant procureur de la Couronne ne s\u2019est pas object\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que la requ\u00eate me f\u00fbt pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans la forme o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait; et je me bornerai donc \u00e0 indiquer qu\u2019\u00e0 mon avis cette requ\u00eate n\u2019\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9dig\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8gles de la cour.\nA l\u2019audition, de la part de l\u2019appelant, l\u2019on m\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 trois jugements o\u00f9 l\u2019on pr\u00e9tendait trouver le conflit exig\u00e9 par l\u2019article 1025 pour qu\u2019un appel p\u00fbt \u00eatre permis. Ce sont les causes de Regina v. Rose[1], The King v. Stone[2] et Rex v. Staneley[3].\nL\u2019offense dont l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable est\n* * * que depuis cinq ans ou environ en la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, dans le district de Qu\u00e9bec, un nomm\u00e9 Sam Liebling, faisant affaires \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec sous la raison sociale \u201cLa Maison Lucille\u201d, comme commer\u00e7ant, ayant un passif de plus de mille douars, \u00e9tant incapable de payer int\u00e9gralement ce qu\u2019il doit \u00e0 ses cr\u00e9anciers, n\u2019a point tenu de livres de compte qui, dans le cours ordinaire du commerce ou du n\u00e9goce qu\u2019il a exerc\u00e9, \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires pour faire conna\u00eetre ou expliquer ses op\u00e9rations, contre les dispositions de l\u2019article 417c du code criminel.\nLe conflit, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce que l\u2019on pr\u00e9tend, existerait dans le fait que le paragraphe \u0441 de l\u2019article 417 du code criminel constituerait une l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de faillite et qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 implicitement abrog\u00e9 par l\u2019adoption de l\u2019article 193 de la loi de faillite, qui, suivant le savant procureur de l\u2019appelant, a pour but et pour effet de pourvoir \u00e0 un cas semblable \u00e0 celui qui \u00e9tait jusque-l\u00e0 couvert par le sous-paragraphe \u0421 de l\u2019article 417. La Cour du Banc du Roi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, en confirmant la conviction de Liebling, aurait donc refus\u00e9 de reconna\u00eetre le principe bien \u00e9tabli qu\u2019une loi sp\u00e9ciale post\u00e9rieure abroge la disposition incompatible qui se trouve dans une loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ant\u00e9rieure; Maxime qui nous vient du vieux droit romain: \u201cLeges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant\u201d (2 Inst. p. 685).\nL\u2019appelant ne saurait obtenir la permission d\u2019appeler \u00e0 raison des jugements qu\u2019il m\u2019a cit\u00e9s.\nEt d\u2019abord, ces jugements n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus dans une cause semblable, ni par une autre cour d\u2019appel, au sens de l\u2019article 1025 du code criminel.\nDans Regina v. Rose[4], il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un habeas corpus pour obtenir l\u2019\u00e9largissement d\u2019un prisonnier qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable de \u201cpersonation\u201d, en vertu des dispositions de The Consolidated Municipal Act\u20141892 d\u2019Ontario. La requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, non pas \u00e0 une autre cour d\u2019appel, mais \u00e0 Boyd \u0421. Sa d\u00e9cision fut:\nWhere a clause in a statute prohibits a particular act and imposes a penalty for doing it, and a subsequent clause in the same statute imposes a different penalty for the same offence, which cannot be reconciled either as cumulative or alternative punishment, the former clause is repealed by the latter.\nNous n\u2019avons donc ici ni une \u201ccause de m\u00eame nature\u201d, ni le jugement \u201cd\u2019une autre cour d\u2019appel\". En plus, comme nous le verrons plus loin, le jugement n\u2019est pas en opposition avec celui de la Cour du Banc du Roi dont on se plaint.\nDans The King v. Stone[5], il s\u2019agissait encore d\u2019une requ\u00eate pour habeas corpus pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 M. le juge Trenholme,\nto review the decision of Extradition Commissioner Choquet, who decided that the prisoner, Isaac Stone, alias Schwartz, be surrendered on application by the United States Government on the charge of having committed an offence against the bankruptcy law of the United States, section 26b, United States Bankruptcy Act.\nSi le juge Trenholme, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, pouvait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant \u201cune autre cour d\u2019appel\u201d conform\u00e9ment aux exigences de l\u2019article 1025, il ne s\u2019agissait pas, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, d\u2019une cause semblable; et le procureur de l\u2019appelant a admis qu\u2019il ne me citait cette cause que pour signaler que le juge avait assimil\u00e9 l\u2019article 417 du code criminel \u00e0 une l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de faillite.\nEnfin, dans Rex v. Stane\u0142y[6], il s\u2019agissait, l\u00e0 encore, seulement d\u2019une requ\u00eate \u00e0 un juge (Boyle J.) pour faire annuler une conviction par un magistrat en vertu de The Government Liquor Control Act, 1924, de l\u2019Alberta.\nIci encore, je doute fort que, par le seul fait que le juge Boyle si\u00e9geait en appel de la conviction prononc\u00e9e par un magistrat, il pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant une cour d\u2019appel teille que l\u2019envisage l\u2019article 1025 C.Cr. Mais je n\u2019ai pas besoin de m\u2019arr\u00eater \u00e0 la discussion de ce point, puisqu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une cause semblable, et surtout parce que cette d\u00e9cision n\u2019est pas en conflit avec cesile dont l\u2019appelant veut interjeter appel.\nEn effet, il n\u2019est pas exact de dire que, dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, la Cour du Banc du Roi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du principe bien connu qu\u2019une l\u00e9gislation sp\u00e9ciale post\u00e9rieure a pour effet d\u2019abroger une l\u00e9gislation ant\u00e9rieure sur le m\u00eame sujet et avec laquelle elle est incompatible. Au contraire, chacun des juges qui a \u00e9crit des notes tient ce principe pour acquis et s\u2019applique \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu de le suivre en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, parce que l\u2019article 193 de la loi de faillite n\u2019est pas, \u00e0 son avis, incompatible avec l\u2019article 417c du code criminel.\nVoici, en effet, ce que dit M. le juge Tellier:\nComme on le voit, ledit article. 193 et ledit article 417 ne sont pas faits pour le m\u00eame cas. Ils peuvent donc exister simultan\u00e9ment, l\u2019un et l\u2019autre; et l\u2019accus\u00e9 a tort de pr\u00e9tendre que ledit article 193, parce qu\u2019il est de date plus r\u00e9cente que ledit article 417, a implicitement abrog\u00e9 ce dernier.\nVoici maintenant ce que dit M. le juge Rivard:\nIl est vrai que l\u2019un et l\u2019autre article font une contravention du d\u00e9faut de tenir des livres de compte; mais ila s\u2019arr\u00eate la similitude entre les deux dispositions. Ce n\u2019est pas pour si peu que, de deux lois inscrites dans les statuts et conserv\u00e9s dans leur refonte, on peut dire que l\u2019une d\u2019elles se trouve implicitement rappel\u00e9e. Entre 193 de la Loi de faillite et 417 du code \u2018criminei, il n\u2019y a rien d\u2019incompatible, rien qui r\u00e9pugne. Ce sont deux contraventions distinctes.\nEt voici c\u0435 que dit M. le juge Galipeault:\nIl s\u2019agit donc, encore une fois, de deux recours distincts qui ne s\u2019excluent pas. Il serait donc oiseux de discuter, si la Loi de Faillite \u00e9tant post\u00e9rieure au code criminel, et si \u00e9tant une loi sp\u00e9ciale, alors que le code criminel est une loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, si la peine pr\u00e9vue par l\u2019Acte de Faillite est moins lourde que celle port\u00e9e au code criminel, il y avait Heu de poursuivre en vertu de la Loi de Faillite.\nBien loin de r\u00e9pudier le principe, comme on le voit, chacun de ces honorables juges s\u2019en inspire, mais fait remarquer qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un cas o\u00f9 le principe s\u2019applique et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il ne peut servir de base au jugement.\nBien entendu, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de me citer un jugement d\u2019une autre cour d\u2019appel qui d\u00e9cidait que l\u2019article 193 de la Loi de faillite \u00e9tait incompatible avec l\u2019article 417c du code criminel, et que, par cons\u00e9quent, le premier devait pr\u00e9valoir. Une d\u00e9cision dans ce sens e\u00fbt fait tomber la requ\u00eate actuelle strictement dans les conditions pr\u00e9vues par l\u2019article 1025 du code criminel.\nL\u2019appelant n\u2019avait m\u00eame pas besoin de se trouver dans une situation aussi claire. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire que l\u2019arr\u00eat \u2018d\u2019une autre cour d\u2019appel f\u00fbt dans une cause identique, pourvu qu\u2019il e\u00fbt soulev\u00e9 une question de droit analogue tranch\u00e9e dans un sens diff\u00e9rent. (The King v. Boak[7]; Barr\u00e9 v. The King)[8]. Mais ici non seulement il n\u2019y a pas conflit entre les d\u00e9cisions; l\u2019on est, au contraire, en pr\u00e9sence de cours qui, partant du m\u00eame principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qu\u2019elles admettent toutes, font la distinction entre des cas o\u00f9 l\u2019application du m\u00eame principe entra\u00eene des r\u00e9sultats diff\u00e9rents.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec a admis sans discussion le principe invoqu\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant; mais elle d\u00e9clare dans son jugement que ce principe ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause. En d\u00e9cidant ainsi, le jugement qu\u2019elle a rendu n\u2019est certainement pas en opposition \u00e0 ceux des autres cours que l\u2019on m\u2019a cit\u00e9s, et il se conforme exactement \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle telle qu\u2019elle est exprim\u00e9e dans Beale\u2019s Cardinal Rules of Legal Interpretation, 3rd ed., p. 525:\nEvery affirmative statute is a repeal by implication of a precedent affirmative statute, so far as it is inconsistent or repugnant thereto and no further.\nJ\u2019arrive donc \u00e0 la conclusion que la requ\u00eate pour permission d\u2019appeler doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nApplication dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1897] 27 Ont.

Thomas Respondent.\n1931: October 8; 1932: February 2\nPresent at hearing: Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ.; Newcombe J. took no part in the judgment, having died before the delivery thereof.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nMaster and servant\u2014Negligence of servant\u2014Liability of master\u2014Scope of employment\u2014Motor vehicle driven by servant\u2014Deviation from route\u2014Evidence\u2014Whether servant on \"frolic of his own.\"\nThe defendant C., who was in the employ of his father, co-defendant and respondent, as a truck-driver, was instructed on Christmas Day to drive a load of milk from Lulu Island, where they lived, to the Fraser Valley Dairies, whose place of business was in the city of Vancouver but farther south than was the down-town section of the city; and he had orders to return home with the empty cans at three o'clock in the afternoon, to be in time to have dinner with the family. Instead of returning home from the dairy as soon as he had delivered the milk, C. went to the basement of the dairy, changed his working clothes for a better suit and proceeded in the truck to a down-town cafe. After having his dinner, he picked up a friend and they spent the afternoon together. Shortly after five o'clock, they decided to go to visit a friend who was not at home and so they turned to come back. As they were driving back, C. ran down and severely injured the appellant. At the time the accident occurred, C. was driving west headed for the hotel where he had picked up his friend, intending to take him home; and after leaving the latter at the hotel, C. drove to his father's farm. The trial judge held that the proximate cause of the accident was the negligence of C.; but the appellant was to some degree at fault in not having looked up the street before attempting to cross and was assessed in one-fifth of the damages awarded; and the trial judge also held that at the time of the accident C. was on his way home and therefore acting within the scope of his employment and his father was liable. The Court of Appeal reversed that decision, holding that C. was \"going on a frolic of his own without being at all on his master's business\" and the action as against the master was dismissed.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (44 B.C. Rep. 188), that, under the circumstances of this case, C. was not, at the time of the accident, in the course of his employment as his father's truck driver, but was \"on a frolic of his own\"; and that therefore the master was not liable.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge McDonald J.[2], and dismissing the appellant's action for damages resulting from the alleged negligent driving of an automobile by the respondent Claude Thomas.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are sufficiently stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nJ. A. MacInnes for the appellant.\nF. J. Hughes K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014In this case the facts are simple and are not in dispute.\nThe respondent, Morgan Thomas, lives at Steveston, on Lulu Island, an hour's drive south of Vancouver. He had a contract to deliver milk to the Fraser Valley Milk Producers Association, whose place of business (dairy) was in the city of Vancouver, but farther south than was the down-town section of the city. This milk he gathered up in cans from the neighbouring farmers, took it to the dairy in a motor truck, exchanged the full cans for empty cans and distributed the empty cans either the same day or the following morning, to the farmers. He employed his son Claude Thomas to drive the truck and deliver the milk.\nOn Christmas day, 1929, Claude drove his truck load of milk to the city and delivered it at the dairy, where he finished unloading about one o'clock. He had orders to be back home at 3 p.m., when the family intended having their Christmas dinner. Instead of returning home from the dairy as soon as he had delivered the milk, as was his custom, Claude went to the basement of the dairy and there changed his working clothes for a better suit (dressed up) and then proceeded to drive north to the down-town section of the city, having in his truck the empty milk cans. He drove to the Cascade Cafe where he had his dinner. After dinner he drove to the Dominion Hotel to see his friend Fred Reggy, who lived there. They remained at the hotel a short time and then spent two or three hours driving around the city, after which the two boys went to the Pantages Theatre. After the theatre they decided to go to visit a friend, Smith by name, on the other side of the Union Oil Company's premises. Smith was not at home, so they turned to come back. As they were driving back Claude Thomas ran down and severely injured the appellant. At the time the accident occurred Claude was driving west on Union Street headed for the Dominion Hotel, taking Fred Reggy home. After leaving Reggy at the hotel Claude drove to his father's farm.\nThe sole question in this case is: Was Claude Thomas at the time of the accident, in the course of his employment as his father's truck driver, or was he, as it is put in some of the cases, \" on a frolic of his own?\"\nThe contention of the appellant is that when Claude found that his friend Smith was not at home and turned to come back, with the intention of leaving Fred Reggy at the Dominion Hotel and then going on home himself, he was in the course of his employment from the moment he started back from Smith's house, and that his going to the Dominion Hotel was a mere deviation from the direct route home, which does not relieve the respondent of liability.\nOn the other hand the respondent's contention is that Claude was on a frolic of his own from the time he dressed up and drove down town until he arrived back at the Dominion Hotel from Smith's, as all his actions during that time are totally inconsistent with his being engaged on his employer's business.\nIn cases of this kind the law is well settled. A master is responsible for the consequences of his servant's negligent act only while the servant is on his master's business. That is to say, the master is responsible for the result of the negligent acts of his servant committed in the course of the servant's employment. The difficulty, however, is to determine when the master's employment has ended and the servant's frolic has begun, or, as in this case, to determine when the servant's frolic ended and he again entered upon his master's business.\nIn the well known case of Mitchell v. Crassweller[3], it was the duty of the defendants' servant, after having delivered his masters' goods, to return to their house, get the key of the stable and put their horse in the mews in an adjoining street. On returning one evening the servant got the key, but, instead of going to the mews, he, without the defendants' leave, drove a fellow-servant in an opposite direction and, on his way back, injured the plaintiff by his negligent driving. It was held that the defendants were not liable. In his judgment, Jervis C.J., said:\u2014\nEach case must depend upon its own particular circumstances, and no doubt there may be cases in which the master is liable if the servant drives extra viam, but I do not think this is one of them. It cannot be denied that, although the servant was on his master's service up to the time that he arrived first in Welbeck street, he started from thence on a new journey, and not with the intention of performing his masters' busi-business, but, as it were, upon a frolic of his own; in which case, as said by Parke B. in Joel v. Morison[4], his masters would not be liable. If he had started to go to the stables, and had merely deviated from the direct road to them, possibly, the defendants would have been liable for his negligent driving during the deviation. But I think that to make them liable, he must have originally started upon, and have been at the time of the committing the grievance in the course of following, his masters' employment.\nAnd Maule J. said:\u2014\nThis is not a case in which the servant went a rcundabout way to perform his masters' business; it cannot be said that his journey to Euston Square was a mere detour from Welbeck Street to the stable. *** The servant here did something contrary to, and inconsistent with his masters' business; the journey to Euston Square had no connexion with it whatever, and the servant only, not his masters, is liable.\nIn St. Helens Colliery Company v. Hewitson[5], Lord Atkinson, at page 71, suggested as a test for determining when a workman was in the course of his employment, the following:\u2014\nA workman is acting in the course of his employment when he is engaged \"in doing something he was employed to do.\" Or what is, in other and I think better words, in effect the same thing\u2014namely, when he is doing something in discharge of a duty to his employer, directly or indirectly, imposed upon him by his contract of service. The true ground upon which the test should be based is a duty to the employer arising out of the contract of employment, but it is to be borne in mind that the word \" employment\" as here used covers and includes things belonging to or arising out of it.\nAnother way of stating the same test is found in Salmond on the Law of Torts, 7th ed., page 115, where the author says:\u2014\nOn the other hand, if the unauthorized and wrongful act of the servant is not so connected with the authorized act as to be a mode of doing it, but is an independent act, the master is not responsible; for in such a case the servant is not acting in the course of his employment, but has gone outside of it. He can no longer be said to be doing, although in a wrong and unauthorized way, what he was authorized to do; he is doing what he was not authorized to do at all.\nCan it reasonably be said that Claude Thomas, at the time of the accident, was doing something in the discharge of his duty to his employer directly or indirectly imposed upon him by his contract of service, or arising out of it? Or, was his driving west on Union Street so connected with his duty to his employer as to be a mode of performing that duty? The evidence, in our opinion, shews the very opposite to have been the case. When the two boys set out from the Dominion Hotel and drove around the streets for two or three hours, they were clearly on a frolic of their own. So were they also when they went out to visit Smith. And, as in Mitchell v. Crassweller[6], it was on the return journey (in this case from Smith's to the hotel), that the accident happened. In our opinion this frolic cannot be said to have ended until they returned to the Dominion Hotel from whence they started. When they started out, Claude was on a journey separate and distinct from that which he had been employed to perform by his father. In coming back to the hotel he was not going in the direction of his father's farm at all, but away from it. In order to have the visit to Smith's house brought within the principle of the \"detour\" cases, Claude must have been on his father's business at the time he started to go to Smith's. This clearly was not the case. For several hours before setting out to make the visit the boys had been driving around town, or at the theatre, neither of which pastimes was in any way connected with the business of the respondent. The appellant advanced the argument that it was Claude's duty to take the truck home and that he was in the performance of that duty when he started back from Smith's. This argument is founded on two answers made by Claude to questions put to him: he was asked if he was in the course of his employment at the time of the accident, to which he answered, \"Yes.\" As that was a mixed question of law and fact and the very question which the court had to decide, the pronouncement of Claude on the question could not be very helpful. The other answer referred to what he was doing on Union Street. The evidence is as follows:\u2014\nThe court: Q. You were on Union street going west. What was your course?\u2014A. Well, I was going home then.\nMr. Farris: Q. Well, were you going actually home then or were you going down to the Dominion Hotel to get your friend Reggy home?\u2014A. Well, I was going to take Reggy home, Yes.\nQ. And that was not in the direction of your home?\u2014A. No.\nQ. And so you were not going home at that time at all?\u2014A. No.\nQ. You were going in an opposite direction from going home at that time?\u2014A. Yes.\nThe learned trial judge stated that he did not accept Claude's evidence that he was going to the Dominion Hotel, but did believe that he was going home. Of course he was going home in the sense that he intended eventually to arrive there, but, in our opinion, the evidence that he was at the time of the accident taking Fred Reggy back to his hotel is too strong to permit of its being gainsaid. This is not a case of deciding as between the credibility of different witnesses; it is only the credibility of Claude Thomas that is in question. and, as for deciding which part of his story is the more probable, an appellate judge is in as good a position as the judge at the trial. In his judgment in the court below, Mr. Justice Martin called attention to a recent English case, Harrington v. Shuttleworth & Co., which is not reported, but of which a note appears in 171 L.T. Jo. (24th January, 1931), which seems to us to uphold the principle laid down in Mitchell v. Crassweller[7]. There the chauffeur had driven the company's managing director to the Carleton Hotel and, on his way back to the garage, instead of taking one of the orthodox routes, he made a detour of two miles out and two miles back to pick up the young lady to whom he was engaged. During the course of that detour he injured the plaintiff through his negligent driving. Lord Justice Scrutten held that the detour was not in the course of the man's employment and was a frolic for which the employer could not be held liable.\nIn the case before us the duty of Claude Thomas was to drive the truck home after delivering the milk. Instead of doing that he made an independent journey out to Smith's and back, in the course of which the appellant was injured by his negligent driving. For the consequences of that negligent act, the respondent, in our opinion, cannot be held liable. We, therefore, agree with the court below and dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacInnes & Arnold.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Farris, Farris, Stultz & Sloan.\n[1] (1931) 44 B.C.

Smith and Cannon JJ.; Newcombe J. took no part in the judgment, as he died before the delivery thereof.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nPromissory note\u2014Company\u2014By-law\u2014Resolutions\u2014Persons authorized to sign\u2014Absence of signature\u2014Person taking note\u2014What is his duty\u2014Companies Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 27, ss. 37, 100, 106d, 108.\nThe Almur Fur Trading Company was incorporated by Dominion Letters Patent on May 25, 1927, and went into liquidation in June, 1929. The appellant bank filed its claim in respect of five promissory notes made by S., as president, on behalf of the company and amounting to $28,768.02. The liquidator called upon the bank to prove its claim before the Superior Court. The notes were signed in blank by S. alone and were handed to L., the New York buying agent of the company, to be filled in and used by L. in payment of goods bought or to be bought by the company. L. filled the blank note forms with the names of two other companies owned and controlled by him, being also at that time the owner of all the shares of the insolvent company. The notes were endorsed to the appellant bank, and it is admitted that the bank was a holder in due course. S. was the only witness at the trial; he produced a by-law of the insolvent company providing inter alia that \u201call cheques, * * * notes * * * shall be signed by such officer * * * of the company and in such manner as shall from time to time be determined by resolution of the Board of Directors,\u201d and he also produced a resolution of the directors pursuant to the by-law which provides \u201cthat all notes * * * be signed by the president and countersigned by the auditor * * *,\u201d of which resolution the appellant bank had no knowledge.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 50 K.B. 204) that the appellant bank, being a holder in due course, was entitled to rank as a creditor of the insolvent company. The notes were made in general accordance with the authority of the president under the by-law of the company and it was not necessary for the appellant bank to inquire into the authority of the president to sign the notes on behalf of the company. Under section 106d of the Dominion Companies Act, the president had to be one of the directors; and, under section 37, the only persons who could make notes on behalf of the company would be those designated in the by-law. Persons dealing with a company are presumed to have notice of what is contained in the Act under which the company was incorporated and the Letters Patent; and, in a case like the present, where the Act refers specifically to the by-laws as the place where the authority of an officer or an agent to sign promissory notes is to be found, the person taking a note made by an officer is under obligation to ascertain from the by-laws that the officer who signed the note might have been authorized to make such note in the course of the company\u2019s business; but he is not obliged to go further and inquire whether the directors passed the resolution which would give the officer express authority. That constitutes part of the company\u2019s \u201cindoor management.\u201d If the officer might, under the by-laws, have been authorized to make the note, the making of it was within his ostensible powers and was \u201cin general accordance with his powers as such under the by-laws.\u201d\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Coderre J., and disallowing the appellant bank\u2019s application to rank as a creditor of the insolvent company in respect of five promissory notes amounting to $28,768.02.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported. \u0422. \u0412. Heney K.C. for the appellant.\nW. F. Chipman K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014The question involved in this appeal is whether or not the appellant bank (hereinafter called the Bank), is entitled to rank as a creditor against the assets of the Almur Fur Trading Company in liquidation in respect of five promissory notes made by Murray H. Smith, as president of the company, and amounting in all to $28,768.02 The notes were signed in blank by Smith, as follows: \u201cAlmur Fur Trading Company, Limited, per Murray H. Smith, President,\u201d and were handed to H. Licht, or H. Licht, Incorporated, the New York buying agent of the company, to be filled in and used by Licht in payment of goods for the Almur Fur Trading Company, some of which had already been purchased by Smith and the balance were to be purchased by Licht or his company. Licht filled in one of the blank note forms with the name of H. Licht, Incorporated, and the others with the name of The Pacific Fur Trading Corporation. Both these companies were owned or controlled by Licht who, at the time the notes were given was the owner of all the shares in the Almur Fur Trading Company, Limited. The notes were indorsed to the Bank and it is admitted that the Bank is a holder in due course.\nThe Almur Fur Trading Company was incorporated by Dominion Letters Patent on May 25, 1927, and went into liquidation in June, 1929.\nAfter the winding up order was made the Bank filed its claim, in respect of these notes, with the liquidator, who called upon the Bank to prove its claim before the Superior Court. The trial judge disallowed the claim on the ground that the notes on which the claim was based were signed by the president of the company alone, and were not countersigned by the auditor as required by the resolution of the directors adopted pursuant to the by-laws of the company. On appeal the Court of King\u2019s Bench maintained the judgment of the Superior Court (Justices Guerin and Tellier dissenting). The majority of the court based their opinions on the same ground as that taken by the trial judge, but Mr. Justice Bernier went further and found that there was no intention on the part of the company that the documents signed by Smith should form the basis of promissory notes. The two dissenting justices were of opinion that it was not necessary for the Bank to inquire into the authority of the president to sign the notes on behalf of the company; that the notes were made in general accordance with the authority of the president under the by-laws and that the appellant, being a holder in due course, was entitled to rank as a creditor of the company. From the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench an appeal is now brought to this court.\nAt the trial the only witness to give evidence was Murray H. Smith, president of the company. He produced bylaw no. 15 of the company\u2019s by-laws, passed June 13, 1927, which in part reads as follows:\u2014\nAll cheques, bills of exchange * * * notes, * * * shall be signed by such officer, or officers, agent or agents, of the company and in such manner as shall from time to time be determined by resolution of the Board of Directors.\nHe also produced a resolution of the directors pursuant to the by-law, which provides:\u2014\nThat all notes, cheques, drafts and other commercial documents of the company be signed by the president and countersigned by the auditor, such countersignature to be on the left side of said note, draft, cheque or commercial document preceded by the words \u201cPayment approved by,\u201d or other words having a like effect and meaning.\nThe auditor appointed was A. H. Lippman, the sales manager of the company. Smith also produced the notes in question, none of which had been countersigned by the auditor.\nIn the early part of 1929 Smith was in New York on his way to Europe, and in his evidence he says:\u2014\nMr. Lich\u0165s bookkeeper came to me the day before I left for Europe with several notes, and asked me to sign them in blank, which I did, and which I gave to her on the condition that these notes would be used as previously stated, in payment of purchases made either by me in New York or by H. Licht, Incorporated, while acting, and who did act, as our New York buying agents.\nAt that time I had made, as previously stated, a few purchases, and the merchandise was shipped direct to Montreal, and the invoices were sent to H. Licht, Incorporated, as the vendors of this merchandise required Mr. Lich\u0165s guarantee, since they knew he was the financial man behind the Almur Fur Trading Company, Limited.\nQ. You signed these notes, Mr. Smith, to be used in payment of these goods which you had purchased? A. Yes. As well as for any additional orders which I could not fill, and which Mr. Licht had instructions to fill, * * *\nQ. As I understand it, you signed these blank notes and gave them to Mr. Lich\u0165s bookkeeper with the intention they should be used as promissory notes to cover these particular commitments you had made and any future commitments?\nA. Any future orders that Mr. Licht would fill on behalf of the Almur Fur Trading Company, Limited, and for which we would receive the goods.\nAs to the receipt of the goods, he says:\u2014\nThe purchases I made while in New York and for which the invoices were sent to Licht were sent direct to us, but whether we received the other orders he had instructions to fill I have no knowledge of, because I left for Europe.\nThe above evidence makes it abundantly clear that Smith intended Licht to convert the documents signed by him into promissory not\u00e9s binding on the company and to use the same or the proceeds thereof in payment of the goods which Smith himself had already purchased and of those which Licht or his firm were to buy for the Almur Fur Trading Company. The purchasing of these goods was part of the ordinary business of the company. Whether Licht filled the order given to him by Smith on behalf of the Trading Company does not appear, nor do I see how the application of the proceeds of the notes can be material in this case. If the notes would have been binding on the company in the hands of a holder in due course provided Licht used the proceeds as instructed by Smith, they must, in my opinion, be equally binding if Licht misappropriated the proceeds after receiving them, although, in such case, he might have to account to the liquidator for the proceeds of the notes. That, however, cannot affect the Bank. The one question here is, can the Bank\u2019s claim to rank as a creditor be defeated because the notes were not countersigned by the auditor?\nIt is to be noted at the outset that the Almur Fur Trading Company, being a limited company, was capable of speaking and acting only through agents duly authorized in accordance with its constitution. When the notes were tendered to the Bank for discount, the duty of the Bank was to ascertain if they were binding on the company on whose behalf they purported to be made by the company\u2019s president. The Bank was bound to see that Smith, as president, had, under the constitution of the company, power to execute promissory notes on its behalf. The company, being incorporated by Letters Patent under the Dominion Companies\u2019 Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 27), its constitution was to be found in the Act and in the Letters Patent. An examination of the Act shews that the president had to be one of the directors (s. 106d); that the affairs of the company were to be managed by a board of not less than three directors (s. 100); that the persons named in the Letters Patent were to be the directors of the company until others were appointed in their stead, and that the directors had power to\nadminister the affairs of the company in all things, and make or cause to be made for the company, any description of contract which the company may by law enter into.\n(s. 108). The Act also provides (s. 37) that:\u2014\nEvery promissory note or cheque made, drawn or endorsed on behalf of the company by any agent, officer or servant of the company in general accordance with his powers as such under the by-laws of the company shall be binding upon the company.\nUnder this section the only persons who could make notes on behalf of the company would be those designated in the by-law; and the by-law provided that the persons who might sign notes which would bind the company were\nsuch officer or officers, agent or agents as the directors would determine by resolution.\nThe resolution required the notes to be countersigned by the auditor, but of this the Bank had no knowledge and what has here to be determined is, was the Bank justified in assuming that, as the directors might, under the by-laws, have authorized the president to sign notes on behalf of the company, the necessary resolution for that purpose had been duly passed? In my opinion it was. In Dey v. Pulling er Engineering Company[2], the articles of association of a company empowered the directors to authorize one of their body as managing director to draw bills of exchange on behalf of the company. The managing director drew a bill on behalf of the company without having in fact received any authority from the directors to draw bills. In an action on the bill against the company as drawers it was held that the managing director, in drawing the bill on behalf of the company, was a \u201cperson acting under its authority\u201d within the meaning of s. 77 of the Companies\u2019 (Consolidation) Act, 1908, and that the company was liable. The section of the English Act in question in that case read as follows:\u2014\nA bill of exchange or promissory note shall be deemed to have been made, accepted, or endorsed on behalf of a company if made, accepted or endorsed in the name of, or by or on behalf or on account of, the company by any person acting under its authority.\nIn his judgment Bray J., at page 79, said:\u2014\nIt is clear, therefore, that anyone looking at the Memorandum and Articles of Association would see that the managing director might ha 7e the power to draw and indorse this bill. * * *.\nA holder in due course cannot as a rule be expected to know what goes on in the company\u2019s board room, and if he has to take the risk of its turning out that the persons signing had no authority, and much more so if he has to prove that they had authority, people in business would be very shy in dealing with such bills. * * *\nAn \u201cauthority\u201d may be express, or implied, or apparent, and I can see no reason for inserting the word \u201cexpress\u201d before it in s. 77.\nIn Biggerstaff v. Rowatt\u2019s Wharf, Limited[3], the question was whether an assignment of debt by the company to the plaintiff was valid. The assignment was executed by the managing director, one Davy. By the articles of the company the directors were authorized to appoint a managing director and to delegate to him such of the power of the board as they thought fit. The company had power to assign the debts but there was no minute shewing what powers had been delegated to the managing director, nor his powers as such, although he had acted in that capacity. It was held that the assignment was valid. Lindley L.J., in his judgment, at page 102, said:\u2014\nThe persons dealing with him must look to the articles, and see that the managing director might have power to do what he purports to do, and that is enough for a person dealing with him bona fide.\nThe authority of an officer to bind a company by contract entered into on its behalf was considered by this court in the case of McKnight Construction Co. v. Vansickler[4]. There the respondent made an offer in writing to purchase certain lands belonging to the appellants. The offer was accepted by Douglas, the secretary-treasurer of the company, who was also assistant manager, but he signed as secretary-treasurer. There was no evidence that Douglas had ever been authorized to accept any offer for the company\u2019s lands. It was held that in accepting the offer he was acting within the apparent scope of his authority, and that was sufficient to protect a person dealing with him bona fide. In his judgment Duff J., at pages 382 and 383, said:\u2014\nThe secretary-treasurer was the apparent agent of the company for the transaction of the kind of business he undertook to do. That being so, the case is within the principle very satisfactorily stated in Palmer\u2019s Company Law, 9th ed., 1911, p. 44, in the following words:\u2014\n\u201cThis rule is that where a company is regulated by an Act of Parliament, general or special, or by a deed of settlement or memorandum and articles registered in some public office, persons dealing with the company are bound to read the Act and registered documents, and to see that the proposed dealing is not inconsistent therewith; but they are not bound to do more; they need not inquire into the regularity of the internal proceedings\u2014what Lord Hatherly called \u201cthe indoor management.\u201d They are entitled to assume that all is being done regularly. See also Mahony v. East Holyford Mining Co.[5]; Bargate v. Shortridge[6]); In re Land Credit Co. of Ireland[7]; Premier Industrial Bank v. Carlton Manufacturing Co.[8], is not easily reconcileable with the rule.\nThis rule is based on the principle of convenience, for business could not be carried on if a person dealing with the apparent agents of a company was compelled to call for evidence that all internal regulations had been duly observed.\u201d\nAnd Anglin J. (now Chief Justice), at page 387, laid down the rule as follows:\u2014\nFor any lack of formality in the steps leading to the authorization of Douglas the plaintiffs should not suffer. They were not called upon to ascertain that proper steps had been taken to clothe him with authority to execute the contract with them on behalf of the company. They acted with perfect good faith. The power which Douglas purported to exercise was such as under the constitution of the company, he might possess, and \u201cthat is enough for a person dealing with him bona fide.\u201d\nThe law, therefore, seems to be that persons dealing with a company are presumed to have notice of what is contained in the Act under which the company was incorporated, and the Letters Patent. Also in a case like the present, where the Act refers specifically to the by-laws as the place where the authority of an officer or an agent to sign promissory notes is to be found, I am of opinion that the person taking a note made by an officer is under obligation to ascertain from the by-laws that the officer who signed the note might have been authorized to make such note in the course of the company\u2019s business. He is not, however, obliged to go further and inquire whether the directors passed the resolution which would give the officer express authority. That constitutes part of the company\u2019s \u201cindoor management.\u201d If the officer might, under the by-laws, have been authorized to make the note, the making of it was within his ostensible powers and was \u201cin general accordance with his powers as such under the by-laws.\u201d\nEven if Smith had not any authority to sign the notes who, in this case, can question his right to do so? Certainly not the liquidator, for he stands simply in the place of the company. Now the man who had acquired all the shares in the company at the time the notes were made, and who was in fact the company, not only approved of their being made, but it was at his request and under his direction that they were made. Where all the shareholders of the company have ratified or are estopped from objecting to the making of the notes by the president, it is not, in my opinion, open to the liquidator to question his authority. If it was thought that the making and discounting of these notes was part of a scheme on the part of Smith and Licht to defraud the creditors of the company, the creditors might, by appropriate action, inquire into the matter. That, however, cannot affect the rights of a holder of the notes in due course. I am, therefore, of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and the Bank permitted to rank as a creditor.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cook & Magee.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\n[1] (1931) Q.R. 50 K.B. 204.\n[2] [1921] 1 K.B. 77.\n[3] [1896] 2 Ch. 93.\n[4] (1915) 51 Can.

Brown (Provincial Assessor) (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1932: February 3 ; 1932: February 9.\nPresent: Duff, Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nTaxation\u2014Provincial income tax\u2014Real estate company\u2014All shares but two owned by one person\u2014Profits of company\u2014Whether accretions to capital or income.\nA practising dentist incorporated a company with power inter alia to buy, hold and sell real estate and to carry on the business of real estate agents. He held all but two shares and he contended that his purpose was that the company manage his own property and control real estate for the investment of his own money, not for speculation. He conveyed his real estate property to the company in exchange for shares. These lands increased considerably in value and were sold at a profit. He contended that such profits were accretions to capital and not income made in the business of buying and selling real estate and, therefore, not subject to assessment as such.\nHeld that these profits were profits acquired in a scheme for profit making, which the appellant company was putting into effect as part of its business, and, therefore, were liable to assessment under the provincial Income Tax Act. Upon the facts of the case, the properties in which the company dealt were acquired for the purpose of turning them to account to the profit of the company, by sale, if necessary; and it had been verbally admitted that the possibility of turning its properties to account by selling them at a profit was contemplated by the company from the beginning. Ducker v. Rees ([1928] A.C. 127) and Anderson Logging Co. v. The King ([1925] Can. S.C.R. 49) applied.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of the Court of Revision at Vancouver, W. H. S. Dixon J., and confirming the assessment made by the respondent as provincial assessor of $15,242.18 as income tax for the years 1926, 1927 and 1929.\nIn 1919 Dr. Gilbert, a practising dentist, incorporated a private company with power inter alia to carry on the business of buying, holding, managing, and selling real estate. He claimed that he intended the company to control real estate for investment of his own money and the management of his own property, not for speculation. He conveyed certain real estate to the company in return for shares all of which except two belonged to him. He conveyed certain of his lands to the company which thereafter increased substantially in value and were sold at a considerable profit. The company bought other lands with the money and in this way dealt with the lands and property which it acquired, selling each time at a profit. The company claimed that these profits were accretions to capital and objected to pay income tax thereon. They were, however, assessed by the government for income tax and on appeal to the Court of Revision the judge upheld the assessment. From that judgment an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal and the decision was affirmed.\nR. S. Robertson K.C. for the appellant.\nA. M. Harper for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014The principle of law governing this appeal is not in dispute or doubt. In Californian Copper Syndicate v. Harris[2], it was laid down that the test to be applied is whether the sum in dispute was \"a gain made in an operation of business in carrying out a scheme.for profitmaking.\" That test was adopted by the Judicial Committee in Commissioners of Taxes v. Melbourne Trust, Limited[3], which decision was followed in this court in Anderson Logging Company v. The King[4], the decision of this court being subsequently affirmed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council[5]. The test was reaffirmed by the Houses of Lords in Ducker v. Rees[6].\nI see no reason for disagreeing with the finding of the Court of Revision, affirmed by the Court of Appeal, that the profits in question were profits acquired in a scheme for profit-making, which the appellant company was putting into effect as part of its business. When the facts proved are taken into consideration, there seems to me no real ground for doubting that the properties in which the company dealt were acquired for the purpose of turning them to account to the profit of the company, by sale, if necessary. Indeed, I think it is virtually admitted that the possibility of turning its properties to account by selling them at a profit was contemplated by the company from the beginning. This, in itself, is sufficient to bring the case within the decision in Anderson Logging Company v. The King (1), as well as the judgment of Lord Buckmaster in Ducker v. Rees (2).\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mackay & Fraser.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Harper & Sargent.\n[1] [1932] 1 W.W.R. 234.\n[2] (1905) 5 Tax Cases 159\n[3] [1914] A.C. 1010.\n[4] [1925] Can.

Therefore, a judgment on a demurrer, striking out material allegations of pleadings, is a \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d Dominion Textile Company v. Skaife ([1926] S.C.R. 310) disc.\nMOTION to quash an appeal, for want of jurisdiction, from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of P. Cousineau J., in the Superior Court and dismissing an exception to the form presented by the appellant. The material facts of the case and the question in issue are stated in the head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the motion.\nW. F. Chipman K.C. and W. K. McKeown K.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014On October 28, 1897, the late Sir Mortimer Davis entered into a marriage contract with the mise-en-cause, Dame Henriette Marie Meyer, under the sixth clause of which he gave to her and to\nhis child or children * * * by way of donation inter vivos and irrevocably * * * the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable at his death,\nin the manner and subject to the conditions therein provided.\nBy the seventh clause of the marriage contract, the future husband stipulated\nthe right to name trustees either during his lifetime by notarial acts or by his last will and testament: to whom such payments may be made for the administration and management thereof.\nThe eighth clause of the marriage contract defined the powers of the trustees and provided for the disposition of the trust under certain conditions.\nThe ninth clause of the marriage contract reads in part as follows:\nUnless otherwise provided by the instrument appointing the trustees, there shall be always three trustees.\nShould the future husband neglect to appoint them during his lifetime or by will, they shall be appointed on petition by any interested party by a judge of the Superior Court in the district of Montreal on the advice of a family council: two being chosen by the relatives and friends of the future husband and one by the relatives of the future wife.\nThe respondents were respectively appointed trustees of the donation by judges of the Superior Court of Montreal. By their action, they demand judgment for the balance of the $25,000 claimed to be unpaid under the donation, and for a further sum representing the alleged present value of the 750 shares of American Tobacco Company of Canada, assigned and transferred to the future wife by the marriage contract to secure the fulfilment of the future husband\u2019s obligations. In the writ of summons, the respondents describe themselves as follows:\n* * * all three acting in their quality of trustees and duly appointed under the provisions of the contract of marriage between the late Sir Mortimer Davis and Miss Henriette Marie Meyer, passed before W. de M. Marler, notary, on the 20th day of October, 1897.\nThe action was directed against the testamentary executors and trustees of the late Sir Mortimer Davis, described in the writ of summons as follows:\nThe Right Honourable Lord Shaughnessy (William James Shaughnessy), of the city and district of Montreal, Alexander M. Reaper, of the city and district of Montreal, and Lady Davis (Dame Eleanor Curran), of the city and district of Montreal, widow of the late Sir Mortimer Barnet Davis, Knight, all three in their quality of testamentary executors and trustees of the late Sir Mortimer Barnet Davis.\nThe appellant filed a preliminary exception in the nature of an exception to the form and urged that, no trustees having been appointed by the late Sir Mortimer Davis, the appointment of the respondents made since his death by the judges of the Superior Court were void for want of jurisdiction. Accordingly, he demanded the dismissal of the respondents\u2019 action.\nJudgment was rendered by Cousineau J., holding that the respondents were qualified to bring the action, and dismissing the exception to the form.\nAll three co-executors respectfully excepted to the judgment and made express reservation of all rights of redress by way of appeal or otherwise. The appellant alone, and without the concurrence of her co-executors, inscribed in appeal before the Court of King\u2019s Bench. That court confirmed the judgment of the Superior Court. Bond J., was for dismissing the appeal upon the ground that the appellant had no right to appeal alone. Hall J., was for confirming for the reasons given in the Superior Court. Rivard J., adopted the reasoning of both of his colleagues. Howard and L\u00e9tourneau JJ. did not prepare any notes.\nThe appellant then gave notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the respondents now move to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nTwo points are raised by the respondents in support of the motion to quash.\n1. The judgment appealed from is not a final judgment;\n2. The appellant cannot appeal without the concurrence of her co-executors. Article 174 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the province of Quebec provides that\nthe defendant may invoke any of the following grounds, by way of exception to the form, whenever they cause a prejudice:\n* * *\n3. Absence of quality in the plaintiff or in the defendant.\nThe respondents sued in their quality of trustees under the marriage contract.\nThe appellant and her co-executors availed themselves of the provision of the Code of Civil Procedure above quoted and, by way of exception to the form, they invoked the absence, in the respondents, of the quality assumed by them in bringing the suit. The respondents now claim that the judgment dismissing that exception is not a final judgment within the meaning of section 36 of the Supreme Court Act (c. 35, R.S.C., 1927).\nUnder the Supreme Court Act, \u201cfinal judgment\u201d means\nany judgment, rule, order or decision which determines, in whole or in part, any substantive right of any of the parties in controversy in any judicial proceeding (Section 2 (e)).\nIn that definition, the word on which we desire to lay emphasis is the word \u201cdetermines.\u201d In order that a judgment may come under the definition, it must have, \u201cin whole or in part,\u201d determined or put an end to the issue raised and in respect to which the judgment was rendered.\nNow, it is a fundamental principle in the province of Quebec that, as a general rule, interlocutories do not determine the issue raised and that they are open to revision by the final judgment.\nOn this point, the decision in Wilson v. Shawinigan Carbide Company[2] is conclusive.\nThe action in that case was brought by the company for a declaration that certain letters patent of invention should be declared invalid, to have a contract in respect thereto resiliated, and for the return of the consideration paid by the company to the defendant under the contract. The defendant, by declinatory exception, objected to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to hear or adjudicate upon the plaintiff\u2019s demand, on several grounds which it is unnecessary to state here. In the Superior Court, Taschereau J. maintained the declinatory exception and dismissed the action with costs. On appeal, the Court of King\u2019s Bench dismissed the exception and ordered that the case should be proceeded with in the Superior Court and disposed of on the merits. The respondents moved to quash a further appeal by the plaintiff to the Supreme Court of Canada, alleging that the judgment complained of was not a final judgment within the meaning of the Supreme Court Act.\nThe motion to quash was granted on the ground that the objection as to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court might be raised, on a subsequent appeal from the judgment on the merits.\nIn the course of delivering his judgment, Girouard J. said:\nThe reason for this ruling is that an appeal on the merits opens all the interlocutories, especially if a reservation or an exception be filed immediately after the rendering of the interlocutories. Such has been the well settled practice and jurisprudence of the province of Quebec. Renaud v. Tourangeau[3]; Jones v. Gough[4]; Goldring v. La Banque d\u2019Hochelaga[5]; Benning v. Grange[6]; Archer v. Lortie[7]; Metras v. Trudeau[8].\nThis court expressed the same views on several occasions and especially in Molson v. Barnard[9]; Hamel v. Hamel[10]; Griffith v. Harwood[11].\nThe only difference between that case and the present one is that, there, the exception was declinatory, while here it is an exception to the form.\nThe amendments to the Supreme Court Act do not alter the argument relied on in that case on the particular point we are now dealing with.\nIn the case of Metras v. Trudeau[12], referred to by Girouard J., the holding of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, composed of Sir A. A. Dorion C.J., and Monk, Tessier, Cross and Baby JJ., was:\nQue \u013eappel du jugement final de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure soul\u00e8ve de nouveau tous les jugements interlocutoires rendus dans la cause, et que le d\u00e9faut par un d\u00e9fendeur d\u2019exciper ou d\u2019appeler d\u2019un jugement interlocutoire renvoyant son exception \u00e0 la forme, ne l\u2019emp\u00eache pas de discuter ce jugement sur l\u2019appel du jugement final, l\u2019interlocutoire n\u2019\u00e9tant pas chose jug\u00e9e sur les questions soulev\u00e9es par son exception \u00e0 la forme.\nThe rule thus laid down was invariably followed since then by the Court of King\u2019s Bench in Quebec. Bayard v. Dinelle[13]; Perrault v. Grand Trunk Ry.[14]; Longpr\u00e9 v. Dumoulin[15]; Levine v. Serling[16]; Compagnie des Champs d\u2019or Rigaud-Vaudreuil v. Bolduc[17].\nIn Canadian Car & Foundry v. Bird[18], Brodeur J. said at page 262:\nDans cette province (de Qu\u00e9bec), \u013einterlocutoire ne lie pas le juge * * * Lors du jugement final, ces interlocutoires peuvent \u00eatre modifi\u00e9s et renvers\u00e9s.\nIt follows that the judgment a quo is only provisional and has not determined, in whole or in part, any substantive right of the appellants in the controversy.\nIt may be, now that the Court of King\u2019s Bench has pronounced upon the point concerning the absence of quality of the respondents, that the Superior Court and the Court of King\u2019s Bench itself will be inclined to follow the ruling already made, when the question comes again for decision on the merits of the case. This will not be, however, because of lack of power to decide otherwise. It will be rather the effect of the application to the particular instance of the maxim Stare decisis. But we entertain no doubt that if the appellant ever comes before a higher court upon the merits, she will be at liberty to take up the point again and have it revised, should the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench be erroneous[19].\nMore particularly is this true of this case, for the contention that the plaintiffs-respondents are not the true creditors of the debt and are not qualified to recover it is obviously a ground open to the appellant on the merits. (Levine v. Serling[20]; City of Montreal West v. Hough[21].\nAt the hearing, the appellant relied mainly on the judgment of this court in Dominion Textile Company v. Skaife[22], in which the court unanimously reversed the decision of the Registrar refusing to affirm jurisdiction upon the defendant\u2019s appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court striking out a part of the defence on a demurrer. Judgments maintaining demurrers, in whole or in part, are not analogous. If the demurrer be to the whole action and if it be maintained, the action is dismissed and cadit questio. In all other cases, the allegations struck out upon demurrer disappear from the record and no evidence whatever can be adduced in respect thereof at the trial. The trial judge is therefore powerless, and any attempt by him to remedy the situation by the final judgment would be ineffective and inoperative. The result is that judgments on demurrers striking out part of the allegations stand in a class by themselves and must be treated as final judgments.\nThe judgment in Ville de St. Jean v. Molleur[23], proceeds on that principle. The point is brought out forcibly by Fitzpatrick C.J., delivering the decision of the court. The learned Chief Justice first recalled the difference between a \u201cjugement d\u00e9finitif\u201d and the \u201cjugement provisoire, jugement pr\u00e9liminaire et jugement interlocutoire,\u201d all of which come under the general classification of \u201cjugements avant faire droit.\u201d He then points out that, in that case,\nThere was one conclusion only; but there were several counts, each putting forward an independent title to the relief claimed; and the effect of the judgment appealed from was, as regards the counts in respect of which the demurrer was allowed, precisely the same as if the action had gone to trial and judgment had been given. The controversy regarding the matters raised by them is as effectually and conclusively disposed of. And it is this quality of conclusiveness which determines the character of a judgment as a final judgment, not its relation in point of time to other proceedings. When, by a judgment, a distinct and separate ground of action is, to use Lord Halsbury\u2019s words, \u201cfinally disposed of,\u201d it is, in the ordinary use of the words, a final judgment with respect to that ground of action.\nIt will thus be seen that, in La Ville de St. Jean v. Molleur23, this court held a judgment on demurrer striking out material allegations of the declaration to be a \u201cfinal judgment with respect to that ground of action and it is for that reason that jurisdiction was entertained. The same principle underlies the judgment in Dominion Textile Co. v. Skaife[24], and all other similar judgments upon demurrers.\nOur conclusion is that the judgment appealed from on the appellant\u2019s exception to the form was not a final judgment within the meaning of the Supreme Court Act and that this court has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal from that judgment.\nHaving come to that conclusion upon that part of the appeal, it would not be competent for us to express any opinion upon the remaining question.\nThe motion to quash should be granted with costs.\nMotion granted with costs.\n[1] (1931) Q.R. 52 K.B. 59.\n[2] (1906) 37 Can.

V, \u0441. 10\u2014Canadian National Montreal Terminals Act, (D) 19-20 Geo. V, c. 12.\nThe Canadian National Railways, a railway company within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, applied to the Board of Railway Commissioners for the approval of plans and profiles for carrying its tracks across certain highways. The Board, in final Orders granting the applications, authorized the construction of subways or other structures in connection with the highway crossings and, at the same time, directed the present appellants, amongst others, to move such of their utilities as may be affected by the construction or changes so authorized. The appellants urged that the Board was without jurisdiction to make the Orders in so far as it directed the appellants to move their utilities; that, in any event, the orders were made irregularly and not in accordance with the rules binding upon the Board; that sections 255, 256 and 257 of the Railway Act were not applicable to the Canadian National Railways and that the Board had not the power to compel public utilities companies to remove their facilities without previous compensation.\nHeld that these Orders were made within the exercise of the powers vested in the Board by the Railway Act, and more particularly by the provisions of sections 39, 255, 256 and 257 of that Act.\nPer Duff, Rinfret and Lamont JJ.\u2014The powers of the Board, under the sections above mentioned, are set in motion not alone at the request of the railway companies, but equally at the request of the Crown, of any municipal or other corporation or of any person aggrieved; or the Board may act proprio motu. The primary concern of Parliament in this legislation is public welfare, not the benefit of railways. With that object in view, almost unlimited powers are given the Board to ensure the protection, safety and convenience of the public, and it may prescribe such terms and conditions as it deems expedient, its decisions being conclusive as to the expediency of the measures ordered to be taken.\nPer Duff, Rinfret and Lamont JJ.\u2014The appellants fall within the class of companies or persons \u201cinterested or affected\u201d by the Orders, within the meaning of section 39 of the Railway Act, and, therefore, could competently be ordered to do the works in the manner specified in these Orders, unless it be \u201cotherwise expressly provided\u201d in some other part of the Act. But there is no other section of the Act which provides that the Board may not order a subway or any other work contemplated by sections 256 and 257 to be constructed in whole or in part by a person other than a railway company.\nPer Duff, Rinfret and Lamont JJ.\u2014Sections 39, 252, 255, 256 and 257 of the Railway Act apply to the Canadian National Railways, as there are no other provisions, either in the Special Act or Terminals Act of the Canadian National Railways which are inconsistent with these sections of the Railway Act. Moreover, that being so, it is unnecessary to inquire whether they are inconsistent with the Expropriation Act, as that Act cannot prevail against the provisions of the Railway Act relating to highway and railway crossing plans.\nPer Duff, Rinfret and Lamont JJ.\u2014Applications under sections 252, 255, 256 or 257 of the Railway Act are not complaints within the meaning of subs, (a) of section 33 and the Board may conduct its proceedings in these matters in such manner as may seem to it most convenient. The Board itself is the proper judge of the circumstances under which section 59 of the Act and Rule 6 of its Regulations should be acted upon.\nPer Duff, Rinfret and Lamont JJ.\u2014Sections 367 to 378 of the Railway Act deal with telephones or telephone companies qua telephones or telephone companies; but there is nothing in them to detract from the authority of the Board to exercise its powers over telephone companies qua companies or persons, in the same manner and with the same effect as against any other company or person.\nAPPEALS by The Bell Telephone Company of Canada, The Montreal Light, Heat & Power Consolidated, The Montreal Tramways Company and The Montreal Tramways Commission, by leave of a judge of this court, from Orders of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada.\nThe Canadian National Railways, a railway company within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, applied to the Board of Railway Commissioners for the approval of plans and profiles for carrying its tracks across certain highways, and the Board, in the final Orders granting the application, authorized the construction of subways, or other structures in connection with the highway crossings and, at the same time, directed the appellants, amongst others, to move such of their utilities as may be affected by the construction or changes so authorized.\nThe Canadian National Railways, acting in pursuance of the provisions of the Canadian National Terminals Act, was constructing a line of railway from Victoria Bridge, in Montreal, to its new Terminal Station on Lagaucheti\u00e8re street. That line of railway was crossing St. Antoine street and \u010fArgenson street at a point where was located the underground conduit system of The Bell Telephone Company of Canada and of The Montreal Light, Heat & Power Consolidated. The railway line would be carried over St. Antoine street on a bridge and St. Antoine street would be carried under the tracks by means of a subway, the construction of which would involve the lowering of the grade of the street. Also, the elevation of the railway line running from St. Henri to Point St. Charles, crossing \u010fArgenson street, necessitated the reconstruction of the existing subway at that place.\nIn 1913, The Bell Telephone Company of Canada constructed an underground conduit system under the surface and within the limits of St. Clair Avenue, in Toronto and placed its telephone lines and cables therein; and, in 1930, the Canadian National Railways applied to the Board of Railway Commissioners for authority to divert its Newmarket Subdivision line to the west and to construct a subway under the diverted line where it crosses St. Clair Avenue, and for an order directing the Bell Telephone Company to make such changes in its facilities as may be necessary.\nThe Bell Telephone Company of Canada owns and maintains telephone lines constructed upon and under certain streets in the city of Hamilton. The Canadian National Railways, for the purpose of elevating and diverting its line of railway running through that city, made an application to the Board of Railway Commissioners, in which the city of Hamilton joined as an applicant, for, inter alia, the approval of the plans, for the diversion and other works incidental thereto, and for an order directing the Bell Telephone Company to reconstruct, alter or change its works in order to carry out the changes planned by the railway company.\nPierre Beullac K.C. and N.A. Munnoch for the appellant The Bell Telephone Company of Canada.\nGeo. H. Montgomery K.C. for the appellant The Montreal Light, Heat & Power Consolidated.\nThomas Vien K.C. for the appellant The Montreal Tramways Company.\nF. B\u00e9ique K.C. for the appellant The Montreal Tramways Commission.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and Geo. F. Macdonnell K.C. for the respondent The Canadian National Railways.\nG. W. Mason K.C. and A. J. Poison for the respondent The City of Hamilton. W. N. Tilley K.C. and J. A. Soule for the respondent The Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company.\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the carefully prepared opinion of my brother Rinfret, and agree in his conclusions.\nHis reasoning, speaking generally, strikes me as being forcible, especially in the early part of his judgment. Taking everything into account, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Duff, Rinfret and Lamont JJ. was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014These appeals were heard together. There are in each case special features with which it will be necessary to deal separately, but the main point involved is common to all the appeals and may be conveniently disposed of by a single set of reasons.\nIn all the cases a railway company within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada applied to the Board of Railway Commissioners for the approval of plans and profiles for carrying its tracks across certain highways, and the Board, in the final order granting the application, authorized the construction of subways or other structures in connection with the highway crossings and, at the same time, directed the appellants, amongst others, to move such of their utilities as may be affected by the construction or changes so authorized.\nThe point raised by the appellants is that the Board of Railway Commissioners was without jurisdiction to make the orders in so far as it directed the appellants to move their utilities. There is a further point that, in any event, the orders were made irregularly and not in accordance with the rules binding upon the Board.\nThe appellants got leave to bring these matters before the court pursuant to subsection 2 of section 52 of the Railway Act.\nWe shall now proceed to discuss the first point.\nThe applications of the railway companies and the orders of the Board professed to be made under sections 255, 256 and 257 of the Railway Act. It is in those sections and, of course, in the enabling enactment contained in s. 39, that the authority of the Board to pronounce the Orders must be found, if at all\u2014and we did not understand the respondents to contend otherwise, nor that the impugned Orders were sought to be supported by any other legislation. The logical way to approach these cases therefore is to begin by an examination of the powers conferred on the Board by the several sections just mentioned.\nIn the Railway Act, sections 255, 256 and 257 form part of a series of sections grouped under the heading: Highway Crossings. They provide for what is to be done in the case of a railway crossing a highway or vice versa. The first two sections deal with projected crossings and the other deals with existing crossings. Under section 255, before the railway may be carried upon, along or across an existing highway, leave therefor must first be obtained from the Board. There is a proviso that \u201cthe company shall make compensation to adjacent or abutting landowners,\u201d but only \u201cif the Board so directs\u201d in which case the compensation is to be determined under the arbitration sections of the Railway Act. Special provisions are made where the railway is to be carried along a highway, and also to take care of traffic on the highway during the construction of the railway. The highway must be restored \u201cto as good a condition as nearly as possible as it originally had.\u201d\nOn account of their bearing on the present cases, sections 256 and 257 ought to be quoted in extenso:\n256. Upon any application for leave to construct a railway upon, along or across any highway, or to construct a highway along or across any railway, the applicant shall submit to the Board a plan and profile showing the portion of the railway and highway affected.\n2. The Board may, by order, grant such application in whole or in part and upon such terms and conditions as to protection, safety and convenience of the public as the Board deems expedient, or may order that the railway be carried over, under or along the highway, or that the highway be carried over, under or along the railway, or that the railway or highway be temporarily or permanently diverted, or that such other work be executed, watchmen or other persons employed, or measures taken as under the circumstances appear to the Board best adapted to remove or diminish the danger or obstruction, in the opinion of the Board, arising or likely to arise in respect of the granting of the application in whole or in part in connection with the crossing applied for, or arising or likely to arise in respect thereof in connection with any existing crossing.\n3. When the application is for the construction of the railway, upon, along or across a highway, all the provisions of law at such times applicable to the taking of land by the company, to its valuation and sale and conveyance to the company, and to the compensation therefor, including compensation to be paid to adjacent or abutting landowners as provided by the last preceding section, shall apply to the land exclusive of the highway crossing, required for the proper carrying out of any order made by the Board.\n4. The Board may exercise supervision in the construction of any work ordered by it under this section, or may give directions respecting such supervision.\n5. When the Board orders the railway to be carried over or under the highway, or the highway to be carried over or under the railway, or any diversion temporarily or permanently of the railway or the highway, or any works to be executed under this section, the Board may direct that detailed plans, profiles, drawings and specifications be submitted to the Board.\n6. The Board may make regulations respecting the plans, profiles, drawings and specifications required to be submitted under this section.\n257. Where a railway is already constructed upon, along or across any highway, the Board may, of its own motion, or upon complaint or application, by or on behalf of the Crown or any municipal or other corporation, or any person aggrieved, order the company to submit to the Board, within a specified time, a plan and profile of such portion of the railway, and may cause inspection of such portion, and may inquire into and determine all matters and things in respect of such portion, and the crossing, if any, and may make such order as to the protection, safety and convenience of the public as it deems expedient, or may order that the railway be carried over, under or along the highway, or that the highway be carried over, under or along the railway, or that the railway or highway be temporarily or permanently diverted, and that such other work be executed, watchmen or other persons employed, or measures taken as under the circumstances appear to the Board best adapted to remove or diminish the danger or obstruction in the opinion of the Board arising or likely to arise in respect of such portion or crossing, if any, or any other crossing directly or indirectly affected.\n2. When the Board of its own motion, or upon complaint or application, makes any order that a railway be carried across or along a highway, or that a railway be diverted, all the provisions of law at such time applicable to the taking of land by the company, to its valuation and sale and conveyance to the company, and to the compensation therefor, shall apply to the land, exclusive of the highway crossing, required for the proper carrying out of any order made by the Board.\n3. The Board may exercise supervision in the construction of any work ordered by it under this section, or may give directions respecting such supervision.\nLet it be observed that, under the sections quoted, the powers of the Board are set in motion not alone at the request of the railway companies, but equally, as occasion requires, at the request of the Crown, of any municipal or other corporation or of any person aggrieved; or the Board may act proprio motu. The primary concern of Parliament in this legislation is public welfare, not the benefit of railways. With that object in view, almost unlimited powers are given the Board to ensure the protection, safety and convenience of the public. It may prescribe such terms and conditions as it deems expedient. It may order that such work be executed or that such measures be taken as, under the circumstances, appear to it best adapted to remove the danger or obstruction; and, amongst the things that the Board may do, the following are particularly mentioned: it may order that the railway be carried over, under or along the highway, or that the highway be carried over, under or along the railway, or that the railway or highway be temporarily or permanently diverted. As to the expediency of the measures so ordered to be taken, the Board is given the entire discretion to decide, and its decision is conclusive (Section 44-3 of the Railway Act).\nIn the cases now before this court, four distinct undertakings are involved: 1. The St. Antoine street subway, in the city of Montreal. In connection with a comprehensive scheme for readjusting its terminal facilities in that city, the Canadian National Railway Company applied to the Board for the approval of a plan showing inter alia, the proposed crossing of St. Antoine street by its railway. Up to that time, the street was not crossed by the tracks of the railway and the plan was to carry the street under the railway by means of a subway.\nPursuant to subsection 5 of section 256 of the Railway Act, the Board directed that detailed plans be served upon the appellants and other interested parties, some of whom filed written answers to the application. The Board subsequently made the order, approving the plan and the construction of the subway and making the directions the validity of which is challenged by The Bell Telephone Company of Canada, The Montreal Light, Heat & Power Consolidated, The Montreal Tramways Commission and The Montreal Tramways Company.\n2. The d\u2019Argenson street subway, in the city of Montreal. This work is part of the same general scheme of the Canadian National Railway Company. The circumstances are similar, except that there was already a subway at \u010fArgenson street, and the Order provides for its reconstruction on a wider scale. The parties opposing the Order are the same as in the St. Antoine street appeal. 3. The St. Clair avenue subway, in the city of Toronto. In this case, the order of the Board came as a result of an application made by the city of Toronto. The application was that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Canadian National Railways be required to collaborate with the city in the preparation of a joint plan for the separation of grades in the northwest portion of the city. It is unnecessary to recite the successive proceedings that took place. The outcome was a judgment ordering, inter alia, the construction of a subway under the Newmarket subdivision of the Canadian National Railways at St. Clair Avenue. No steps were taken for some time, but later the procedure already outlined under subsection 5 of section 256 was followed and an Order was made by the Board, similar in character to that in the St. Antoine and \u010fArgenson streets cases, directing The Bell Telephone Company of Canada and other public utilities\u2019 companies\nto move such of their facilities as may be affected by the construction of the said subway, when requested to do so by the chief engineer of the applicants.\nIn this matter, The Bell Telephone Company is the sole appellant.\n4. The Toronto, Hamilton & Buffalo Railway Company\u2019s lines in the city of Hamilton. This was a joint application of the railway and the corporation of the city of Hamilton for an order approving and sanctioning plans and profiles showing deviations and alterations in the railway company\u2019s lines between certain points in the city of Hamilton, and authorizing the railway company to construct, maintain and operate that portion of its railway between the points described in accordance with the change in grades shown in these plans and profiles, to carry its elevated tracks over certain highways therein designated by means of bridges, and to carry the highways beneath the tracks by means of subways, also directing the city to close certain streets, and authorizing a new location of the railway company\u2019s station and terminals building, at the same time directing the Hamilton street railway to reconstruct its tracks through and at each side of the subway at James street, and all public utility companies affected to\nreconstruct, alter or change the respective works of each in order to carry out the changes of the railway shown on said plan and profile. In this case, as in the former one, The Bell Telephone Company is the sole appellant. The Toronto, Hamilton & Buffalo Railway Company and the city of Hamilton are the respondents.\nThe short description just given of the nature of the works forming, in each case, the subject-matter of the orders, is sufficient to establish\u2014and, if necessary, a more complete reference to the text of the formal orders themselves, as well as the proceedings leading thereto, would demonstrate\u2014the following propositions:\nThe whole works,\u2014or at least the constructions or with which the appellants are concerned\u2014were designed\nto remove or diminish the danger or obstruction, in the opinion of the Board, arising or likely to arise in respect of the granting of the applications in whole or in part in connection with the crossings applied for, or arising or likely to arise * * * in connection with existing crossings.\n(Railway Act, sections 256 and 257.)\nThe orders, subject to what remains to be said of the directions affecting the appellants,\u2014were made in the-exercise of the powers vested in the Board by the Railway Act, more particularly sections 255, 256 and 257. In fact, the appellants did not take exception to the authority of the Board to pronounce orders of that kind in matters concerning railway companies governed by the Railway Act.\nWhat they disputed was the applicability of the sections relied on to the Canadian National Railway Company and the power to compel the public utility companies to remove their facilities without previous compensation.\nWe shall deal first with the last of these two objections of the appellants, which is common to all the appeals.\nIn the exercise of the powers vested in the Board, it is not clear, under the sections referred to, on whom it may impose the terms and conditions which, in its discretion, it finds expedient to insert in the orders it makes, nor by whom it may order the prescribed measures to be taken or the prescribed works to be executed. Whatever be the construction of those sections, any doubt on the point just mentioned is removed beyond question by section 39 of the Railway Act, which reads as follows:\n39. When the Board, in the exercise of any power vested in it, in and by any order, directs or permits any structure, appliances, equipment, works, renewals, or repairs to be provided, constructed, reconstructed, altered, installed, operated, used or maintained, it may, except as otherwise expressly provided, order by what company, municipality or person, T interested or affected by such order, as the case may be, and when or within what time and upon what terms and conditions as to the payment Conditions as to the compensation or otherwise, and under what supervision, the same shall be provided, constructed, reconstructed, altered, installed, operated, used and maintained.\n2. The Board may, except as otherwise expressly provided, order by (3 appeals) whom, in what proportion, and when, the cost and expenses of providing, constructing, reconstructing, altering, installing and executing such structures, equipment, works, renewals, or repairs, or of the supervision, if any, or of the continued operation, use or maintenance thereof, or of otherwise complying with such order, shall be paid. v.\nThe effect of this section was the subject of several pronouncements on the part of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. It is now settled that the section applies to every case in which the Board by any order directs works and gives it power to order by what company, municipality or person interested in or affected by such order they shall be constructed.\n(Toronto Railway Company v. City of Toronto[1]; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Toronto Transportation Commission[2].\nThere is, of course, the decision in British Columbia Electric Ry. Co. v. Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Ry. Co.[3] relied on by the appellants. But, as pointed out by co. Viscount Finlay in Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[4], the order of the Board in the British Columbia case was\nnot regarded as proceeding on any consideration of danger arising from the level crossing or as having anything to do with the railways as such. The matter was treated as one merely of street improvement for which a permissive order was given by the Railway Board, and as such not falling within either s. 59 (now 39) or s. 238 (now 257) of the Railway Act; indeed the latter section is not even mentioned in the \" judgment.\"\nAnother point of distinction which should be emphasized is this: In the Vancouver case[5], the Board's order was held merely permissive and as former section 59 was interpreted as applying only in cases where the order was \" in substance mandatory,\" the discussion centred (as it did also to a certain extent in the Toronto case[6] ), on the question whether the terms of the impugned order satisfied the words of the enactment as it then was. The point is no longer open for discussion now that the provisions of the new section 39 have, by amendment, been declared to extend both to an order which \u201cdirects\u201d and to an order which \u201cpermits.\u201d Further, we would add, applying the reasoning of the Privy Council in Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[7], that there can be no question here that the orders appealed from are mandatory.\nWe have it so far that the works involved in the orders now before us are works which the Board, in the exercise of the powers vested in it by the particular sections of the Railway Act, could competently direct or permit to be done, and to which accordingly section 39 of the Railway Act applies. It follows that the works in question were in the nature of those where the Board may\norder by what company, municipality or person, interested or affected by such order, as the case may be * * * the same shall be provided and constructed;\nand, consequently, that the appellants could competently be ordered to do the works, unless it be \u201cotherwise expressly provided\u201d somewhere else in the Railway Act.\nWe have no doubt that the appellants fall within the class of companies or persons \u201cinterested or affected\u201d by the orders, within the meaning of section 39. In terms, the orders are directed against the companies only so far as \u201caffected\u201d by the words or changes therein involved; and the consequence would be either that the appellants are \u201caffected\u201d and therefore they come within the section, or they are not \u201caffected\u201d and the orders do not concern them.\nBut it seems evident that the appellants are companies \u201caffected\u201d as contemplated by the section. In Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Toronto Transportation Commission[8], Lord Macmillan, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, made the following observation at page 697:\nSect. 89 does not indicate any criterion by which it may be determined whether a person is interested in or affected by an order of the Railway Board. It does not even prescribe that the interest must be beneficial or that the affection must not be injurious. The topic has in a number of cases in the Canadian Courts been much discussed but inevitably little elucidated. Where the matter is so much at large, practical considerations of common sense must be applied, especially in dealing with what is obviously an administrative provision.\nThe question is primarily one of fact and the decisions herein carry the full weight that attaches to the finding of the Board on any question of fact (Railway Act, ss. 33-5, and 44-3). Nevertheless, we apprehend that we are called upon to consider the point on appeal as a question of law so as to determine the jurisdiction of the Board in the premises[9]. In the Toronto Transportation case[10], the test was laid down in this way:\nThe question is * * * whether the company was interested in or affected by the engineering works designed for the removal of the level crossing.\nIf that test be applied here, the answer is plainly in the affirmative. In the present case, the alteration of the appellants\u2019 facilities is necessitated by the construction orders and they are obviously within the meaning of the statute.\nIn coming to that conclusion, we are further influenced by the consideration that, as was authoritatively decided in Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[11], the class of persons who may be ordered to contribute towards the cost and expenses under subs. 2 of section 39 is the same exactly as the class of persons who may be ordered to do the works under subs. 1. So far as we know, the question as to what constitutes a person \u201cinterested or affected\u201d under subs. 1 comes before the courts for the first time, but it has been discussed in a number of cases under subs. 2; and, although fully aware that any decision on that point must depend largely on the particular circumstances of each case, we are satisfied that if we should apply to the present instances the line of reasoning which obtained, amongst others, in the two Toronto cases[12], the conclusion is inevitable that the appellants fall within the relevant provisions of section 39.\nIf therefore, by force of sections 256 and 257, in respect of the highway crossings and so far as material here, the works were\u2014as we decide they were\u2014competently ordered by the Board, it may not be denied that the orders could be made on the railway companies or on the municipal corporations interested; and, as a mere matter of jurisdiction, we must hold that the orders could also be made with equal competence on any company or persons affected by the orders and, therefore, on the appellants. Now there is nothing in section 39 to indicate that the Board must direct the whole of the works to be provided or constructed by the same company or person. We see no reason to doubt that, in the exercise of the powers therein given, the Board may direct part of the work to be executed by one person and another part to be executed by another person. The moving of the utilities of the appellants as directed would obviously be part of the works designed and which could competently be ordered. It would seem, moreover, that the moving could be done much more advantageously by the companies owning and operating the utilities. So that, in the carrying out of the present orders, each company is called upon to contribute its part of the work in the manner best calculated to suit the convenience of all concerned. Nor are we impressed by the contention that the relevant sections of the Act so interpreted are likely to work hardship. It need not be repeated that this is a matter for Parliament\u2019s concern, which must not influence the construction of statutes where the intention is clear. But it may not be out of the way to point out that section 39 gives ample scope to the Board for making such provisions as to time, terms, conditions, and \u201cas to the payment of compensation or otherwise,\u201d as may be found necessary to meet all situations, and for clothing the orders it makes under it with all the guarantees of fairness. In our view, the enactment as framed allows for directions that advances in money be made on account, by all or some of the parties interested or affected, towards the cost of construction ordered executed by one or more of them[13], or that compensation, if any, be previously paid. We should not assume that in these, or in any other instances, the Board will make use of its powers in a way that would be unreasonable. At all events, this court has only to decide whether the Board has jurisdiction t\u00f2 require the appellants to contribute to the works as it did. The propriety of requiring them to do so is entirely a matter for the Board[14].\nIt remains to consider whether, as the appellants contend, these are cases where the Railway Act \u201cotherwise expressly provided\u201d so as to take them outside the application of section 39.\nLet it be first observed that in the section, the words \u201cexcept as otherwise expressly provided\u201d are inserted in the following sentence:\nit (i.e., the Board) may, except as otherwise expressly provided, order by what company, municipality or person, interested or affected by such order * * * the same (i.e., the structure or works) shall be provided, constructed, etc.\nThe meaning of the words, in the place in which they are found, is to the effect that the Board may order the works to be constructed by any company interested or affected, unless it be otherwise expressly provided in some other part of the Railway Act. We know of no other section of the Act, and none was pointed out to us, which expressly provides otherwise, that is: which provides that the Board may not order a subway or any other work contemplated by sections 256 and 257 to be constructed in whole or in part by a person other than a railway company.\nSections 162 and following are nothing but an enumeration of the several powers of a railway company under the Act. They provide for what the company may do \u201cfor the purposes of its undertaking,\u201d and how it may do it and for its obligations in the way of avoiding damage and making compensation. But section 162 is only permissive. That and the sections immediately following (which are only corollary thereto) apply where the railway, for itself and of its own volition, does the work or exercises the powers granted therein. Besides, under section 162, the powers are granted and may be exercised only \u201csubject to the provisions in this and the Special Act contained\u201d; and thus we are carried back to section 39.\nThen, there are in subs. 3 of section 256 and in subs. 2 of section 257, certain provisions in regard to the taking of land. The appellants urge that the Board has no jurisdiction in matters of expropriation or of obtaining possession of lands; that the utilities ordered removed are in the nature of lands, and that the Board cannot make orders dispensing with the taking of proper expropriation proceedings, nor can it determine the compensation to be paid for the lands taken, nor can it order the owner thereof to vacate and deliver them up to the respondent railway companies; and the conclusion follows that the orders to remove the facilities are therefore invalid.\nThe fallacy of the foregoing proposition lies in the fact that it is altogether predicated on the assumption that orders of this kind call for the taking of lands by the railway company. Of course, the orders appealed from do not. They provide for the works to be executed partly by the railway company and partly by the utilities companies\u2014since removing the utilities is just as much part of the works as would be, for example, the removing of the earth in the subways. In the carrying out of the orders as framed, the railway company is not supposed to even touch the facilities of the appellants. So that, assuming the appellant\u2019s interest is in the natur\u0119 of lands, the orders here do not call for the taking by the railway company of the lands of the appellants.\nBut the appellants say that the orders are not as they should be, and that orders of that nature properly made under sections 255, 256 and 257 necessarily involve the taking of lands by the railway company. We do not think they do. It is not difficult to imagine cases where the measures directed to be taken under these sections would necessitate the taking of lands by the railway. Subs. 3 of 256 and subs. 2 of 257 are there to take care of such cases. But an order, without more, that the railway be carried over or under a highway or that a highway be carried over or under a railway is hardly one of these cases. The orders with regard to the subway at St. Antoine or \u010fArgenson streets, in Montreal, are not; nor is the order in respect of the subway at St. Clair Avenue in Toronto. As for the Hamilton order, we have the admission of the appellant, The Bell Telephone Co. that\nthe changes in the appellant\u2019s plant are only necessitated by the construction of the, subways and the closing of the streets authorized by\nthe order. We shall take up later the question about the closing of streets. For the moment, we deal only with the matter of subways, with which all the appeals herein are concerned.\nNow, \u201cthe provisions of law * * * applicable to the taking of land by the company\u201d referred to in subs. 3 of 256 and in subs. 2 of 257 plainly mean the provisions applicable to the taking of land for the purposes of the railway or for the undertaking of the railway. It may be said generally that an order such as those we are now discussing is not made \u201cfor the purposes of the railway proper.\u201d The fact that the railway comes across a highway is no doubt the occasion for the order, but the reason or the purpose of the order is the protection or convenience of the public. All the railway needs is to cross the highway. But there are cases where this may not be done without danger or obstruction. Hence the order to carry the highway over or under the railway. As a result, the utilities are not to be removed in order to allow the railway to pass. They must be removed because, for motives of public safety and convenience, the highways are to be lowered or carried above. It is idle to say that lowering a highway will not make it part of the railway undertaking, and neither will its being carried over the railway. This very question is dealt with by Viscount Dunedin delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Boland v. Canadian National Railway Company[15]. The noble lord puts the question: \u201cIs the subway part of the undertaking of the railway?\u201d And the answer is:\nTheir Lordships consider that it is not. The expression \u201csubway\u201d has been used, and it is convenient, but in fact, what has been done is merely a lowering of the road and the construction of a new railway bridge. Their Lordships do not doubt that the lowered road still remains, as it was, part of the road belonging to the municipality. They might put sewers under it or gas pipes along it, and could not be restrained by the railway authorities\u2014assuming, of course, that those things so done did not interfere with the position of the railway proper.\nWhether, in matters of railway crossings, the subsections invoked by the appellants apply to land at the crossing proper,\u2014and the provision therein inserted: \u201cshall apply to the land exclusive of the highway crossing\u201d might indicate that they do not\u2014it is not necessary, for the moment, to consider. We are of opinion, for the reasons stated, that the works ordered, by their very nature and quite independently of the direction concerning the appellants, do not call for the taking of land by the railway company, or for the undertaking of the railway. There is, in the present cases, no occasion for the application of subs. 3 of 256 or subs. 2 of 257; and those subsections do not, in these instances at least, preclude the application of section 39. Incidentally it may be added that the provisions in subs. 4 of 256 and subs. 3 of 257 fully authorized the direction made in the impugned Orders to the effect that the works shall be carried out under the supervision of \u201cthe Chief Engineer, Operating Department of the Applicant.\u201d\nThe only other sections of the Railway Act invoked by the appellants were sections 259 and 260. It was expressly held in Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[16], that section 259 (or subs. 3 of section 238 as it then was) does not exclude section 39, in respect to the costs and expenses of providing the works. Of section 260, before it is said to have any application at all to the cases herein, it may be asked whether it is meant to cover any new construction made by any railway after the 19th of May, 1909, or whether it affects only railway lines or possibly railways wholly constructed after the date mentioned; whether the application of the whole section is or is not \u201csubject to the order of the Board,\u201d and whether the section does not refer solely to level crossings (as a close analysis of the language used in section 260 compared with the language in sections 256 and 257 might show). Section 260 is not even mentioned in the judgments in the two Toronto cases[17].\nBut it is sufficient to say that sections 259 and 260 deal with quite a different thing from that with which we are now concerned. They deal with the apportionment of cost\u2014a question which, in the orders appealed from, the Board did not pretend to decide and which, on the contrary, it expressly reserved for future consideration. The applicability of the two sections will therefore properly come up for discussion when the question of the apportionment of costs stands to be considered. It may have a bearing on subs. 2 of section 39, it has none on subs. 1. In our view, there is nothing in sections 259 and 260 to put an end to the application of section 39 subs. 1[18].\nHaving now dealt with the main objection of the appellants, we come to the other point about the regularity of the proceedings and the contention that the applications were not brought in conformity with the rules binding upon the Board. The question submitted has to do with the absence or sufficiency of notice to the appellants, who urge that they were not accorded the hearing to which they were entitled.\nAssuming the objection raises a question of jurisdiction\u2014and our present view would be that it does not, but that it is rather a question of practice and procedure\u2014the fact is that the Orders in each case were not issued until some time after the appellants had had an opportunity\u2014of which they availed themselves\u2014of filing their submissions in writing, although there was afterwards an oral argument before the Board. We feel confident that the Board must have given proper consideration to the written submissions so made and have taken them into account in drafting the orders subsequently issued. In an earlier part of this judgment, attention was drawn to the fact that in these matters\u2014as well as in any number of similar matters constantly coming before it\u2014the Board is \u201cdealing with what are obviously administrative provisions\u201d of the Railway Act. Circumstances imperatively required that these matters may be disposed of with expedition and simplicity of procedure. For that reason, no doubt, the Railway Act provided that\nthe commissioners shall sit at such times and conduct their proceedings in such manner as may seem to them most convenient for the speedy despatch of business. (Section 19.)\nThey may sit either in private or in open court. The only exception is\nthat any complaint made to them shall, on the application of any party to the complaint, be heard and determined in open court.\nWhat is meant by a complaint is shown, we think, in section 33 of the Act. Complaints are the applications described in subparagraph (a) of that section. The applications leading to the orders we are now discussing were not complaints. They were requests of the kind described in subparagraph (b) of the section. They were applications in respect of which, under the Act, the Commissioners were at liberty to \u201cconduct their proceedings in such manner as may seem to them most convenient.\u201d\nThe Board made and published rules regulating its practice and procedure, as it was authorized to do under the Act (sections 20, 50 and 53). One of those rules reads in part as follows:\u2014\nWhen the Board is authorized to hear an application or make an order, upon notice to the parties interested, it may, upon the ground of urgency, or for other reason appearing to the Board to be sufficient, notwithstanding any want of or insufficiency in such notice, make the like order or decision in the matter as if due notice had been given to all parties; and such order or decision shall be as valid and take effect in all respects as if made on due notice; but any person entitled to notice, and not sufficiently notified, may, at any time within ten days after becoming aware of such order or decision, or within such further time as the Board may allow, apply to the Board to vary, amend or rescind such order or decision; and the Board shall thereupon on such notice to all parties interested as it may in its discretion think desirable, hear such application, and either amend, alter, or rescind such order or decision, or dismiss the application, as may seem to it just and right.\nThe above rule is the reproduction practically verbatim of section 59 of the Railway Act We need not say that the Board itself is the proper judge of the circumstancies under which the rule and the section should be acted upon; and we do not think that the orders, upon their face, need show the existence of the circumstances which prompted the action of the Board. (See section 48.)\nIn our view, the rules and sections of the Railway Act to which we have referred are conclusive of the appeals on this point. We apprehend, however, that the appellants may yet find in the remedial parts of rule 6 and of section 59, the remedy to which they may be entitled\u2014although of course it is not our province to express any opinion in regard to it.\nThat disposes of both of the appellants\u2019 points common to all the appeals. Incidentally, it also finally disposes of the appeal in the Hamilton case, for whatever remains to be considered is peculiar to the Canadian National Railways, who are not concerned in the Hamilton appeal.\nWe do not forget that The Bell Telephone Company raised the contention that, by force of subs. 12 of section 375 of the Railway Act, sections 256 and 257 thereof do not apply to telephone companies. We are not pressed by that objection. Section 375 appears in the Act in a fasciculus of sections (ss. 367-378) under the heading \u201cTelegraphs, Telephones, Power and Electricity.\u201d Those sections deal with telephones or telephone companies qua telephones or telephone companies. There is nothing in them to detract from the authority of the Board to exercise the powers vested in it under sections 39 or 256 or 257 or under any section of the Railway Act, over telephone companies, qua companies or persons, in the same manner and with the same effect as against any other company or person.\nBut we should not part with the Hamilton appeal without making one more observation. The order provides for the closing of certain streets in the city of Hamilton. The Bell Telephone Company objects that the Board has no jurisdiction to order the closing of a highway. There is much to be said in favour of the proposition that\nthe power vested in the Board to order that a highway be temporarily or permanently diverted and the wide power to order such measures to be taken as under the circumstances appear to the Board best adapted to remove or diminish the danger or obstruction in the opinion of the Board arising or likely to arise in respect of such portion or crossing, if any, or any other crossing directly or indirectly affected, confers authority upon the Board to order that part of a highway be closed or, at all events, authority to require the proper municipal authority to close it.\n(See Brant v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company[19]. But the point does not come up for decision here. The Board did not order the closing of the streets in Hamilton. The city agreed to close them. All that the Board did, so far as that point is concerned, was\nconfined entirely to the extinguishment of the public right to cross the railway company\u2019s right-of-way.\n(In re Closing Highways at Railway Crossings[20]), to \u201cpermit\u201d the closing by the city, so far as that was necessary; (Railway Act, sect. 39),\u2014and the incidental authority to make the orders, so far as concerned the utility companies, is amply provided for in section 39 of the Railway Act. The Order comes as the result of an agreement between the railway company and the city. The city submits to it; it joined with the railway in the application to the Board; it was a party to all the proceedings before the Board and it is now respondent in this appeal, supporting the Order with the railway company. Under the circumstances, we do not think the point is open to the Bell Telephone Company. There is however a statement made in the factum of that company which reads as follows:\nThe closing of Hughson street was only agreed upon and ordered to enable the respondent railway to build its new station upon the portion to be closed. So far as we can remember, in these rather involved and complicated appeals, no particular argument was addressed to us on that special point. Were it not that the appeal is on a question of jurisdiction, the point should be dismissed on the simple ground that it was not taken at bar. But if the situation be as represented in the factum, the powers of the Board to make the direction complained of, so far at least as concerns the rights of the appellant in respect of that particular work, may have to be inquired into. The result may not be the same as in the case of works ordered in connection with the crossings. However, we have no facts or admissions on which to decide that issue. It was apparently lost sight of in the midst of the numerous other points submitted. It may be that it does not arise. If it does, when properly and rightly taken, it is no doubt susceptible of redress by the Board itself under subs. 2 of section 59 of the Railway Act. As for this court, it would have to be brought back before it upon a new statement of facts specially addressed to that feature. If the parties wish their rights to be reserved for that purpose, the point may be spoken to. Subject to that, the appeal of The Bell Telephone Company of Canada from Order No. 45813 of the Board of Railway Commissioners, and wherein the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company and The Corporation of the City of Hamilton are respondents, should be dismissed with costs.\nWe may now turn our attention to the special features involved in the other appeals. They are of the same character in each case and they may be discussed together.\nThe main feature concerns what we would call the railway status of the Canadian National Railway Company, the sole respondent in each of the remaining appeals;\u2014and what is to be discussed is whether sections 39, 255, 256 and 257 of the Railway Act apply to the Canadian National Railways.\nThe Canadian National Railway Company was incorporated by a special Act of the Parliament of Canada now known as the Canadian National Railways Act (c. 172 of R.S.C., 1927). The application of the Railway Act to the undertakings of the company was provided for in section 17 of the Act, and the power to construct and operate railway lines was covered by section 21 thereof. Section 21 remained as it was up to the institution of these proceedings; but section 17 was replaced (section 2 of c. 10, 19-20 Geo. V) by a new section. The new section 17 is what falls to be considered. It runs in part as follows:\n17. (1) All the provisions of the Railway Act shall apply to the Company, except as follows:\n(a) such provisions as are inconsistent with the provisions of this Act;\n(b) the provisions relating to the location of lines of railway and the making and filing of plans and profiles, other than highway and railway crossing plans;\n(c) such provisions as are inconsistent with the provisions of the Expropriation Act as made applicable to the Company by this Act.\n(2) (a) All the provisions of the Expropriation Act, except where inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, shall apply mutatis mutandis to the Company.\nThe first point to be noted in the section is that \u201call the provisions of the Railway Act\u201d apply to the company, unless they are excluded by what follows. Now, if we look at what follows, we find that, by subs. (6) some provisions of the Railway Act are specially excepted. They are: \u201cthe provisions relating to the location of lines of railway and the making and filing of plans and profiles, other than highway and railway crossing plans.\u201d The effect of the enactment is that the provisions of the Railway Act relating to \u201chighway and railway crossing plans\u201d are applicable to the Canadian National Railways. That was plainly the intention of Parliament, as otherwise there would be no conceivable explanation why those provisions should be expressly excepted from the exclusion prescribed in subs. (b). To appreciate the full meaning of this exception, it will be useful to consider the manner in which the provisions referred to are grouped in the Railway Act. \u201cLocation of Line\u201d is the heading of a series of sections beginning with section 167 and ending with section 188. They deal with the map showing the general location of the proposed line of railway, the plan, profile and book of reference, the deviations, the branch lines, the industrial spurs and the location of stations. Then, passing a number of sections, we come to another series grouped under the heading \u201cMatters incidental to construction\u201d beginning with section 244 and ending with section 275. In that group, under subheading \u201cCrossings and Junctions with other railways,\u201d are sections 252 to 254 inclusive, and, under the sub-heading \u201cHighway crossings,\u201d are sections 255 to 267 inclusive. It seems obvious that what subs. (b) of 17(1) intends to exclude is the series of sections of the Railway Act (167-188) under the heading \u201cLocation of line\u201d; and what it intends to preserve is the series of sections (252-267) under the sub-headings \u201cCrossings and Junctions with other railways\u201d and \u201cHighway crossings.\u201d It follows that sections 252, 255, 256 and 257 are preserved in any event and also, by way of consequence, section 39; and that they apply to the respondent, the Canadian National Railways. If that be so, we have not to inquire further whether they are inconsistent with the Expropriation Act.\nWe should add however that we are unable to find in the Special Act of the Canadian National Railways provisions inconsistent with the sections of the Railway Act just referred to. As for the Expropriation Act, plainly it cannot prevail against them. The effect of section 17-2 (a) is to make the Expropriation Act applicable, \u201cexcept when inconsistent with the provisions of this Act,\u201d i.e., the Canadian National Railways Act. It is part of \u201cthis Act\u201d (to wit: the Canadian National Railways Act) that the provisions of the Railway Act relating to \u201chighway and railway crossing plans\u201d should apply in any event (section 17-1-b). Therefore, so far as they apply, they exclude the Expropriation Act. This is further supported by section 17-1-(c). The only provisions of the Railway Act thereby excluded are those that are inconsistent with the Expropriation Act \u201cas made applicable,\u201d and this carries us back to the reasoning we have just made.\nNow, it would be interpreting the words \u201chighway and railway crossing plans\u201d too strictly if they were held to apply only to that part of the relevant sections dealing with the plans proper, as was argued by The Montreal Tramways Company. That point was discussed by Viscount Dunedin in the Boland case[21]. He said:\nIt does not seem to matter whether you read the expression \u201cplans\u201d and \u201crailway crossing plans\u201d as including the authorization of the construction of the crossing indicated by the plans, or if you confine the word \u201cplans\u201d to the meaning of a piece of paper with a drawing on it. In the latter view authorization of a railway crossing is not included in the enumerated exceptions. In the former it is included in the exception upon the exception, so that in either case the matter remains subject to the Railway Acts.\nThe section so construed by the Judicial Committee was the former section 17, before the amendment of 1929, but there was no material change, at least so far as concerns the present appeals, and the interpretation there given is conclusive on the matter: \u201cThe matter remains subject to the Railway Acts.\u201d And the same should be said about the Canadian National Montreal Terminals Act, 1929 , which has reference to the two Montreal subways. We do not agree with the appellants that the Terminals Act is an Act by itself, nor that the whole power of the company to carry out the Terminals scheme of development must be found exclusively in the Terminals Act. In considering the question how far an enactment in a general statute is varied or excepted by the Special Act, Lord Chancellor Westbury laid down the following rule: that if the particular Act gives in itself a complete rule on the subject, the expression of that rule would undoubtedly amount to an exception of the subject-matter of the rule out of the general Act. (Ex parte St. Sepulchre, In re The Westminster Bridge Act[22]; London, Chatham & Dover Ry. v. Board of Works for the Wandswork District[23].\nThe Terminals Act, 1929, does not in any way give \u201ca complete rule\u201d on the subject matter of the present appeals. It merely authorizes the Governor in Council to provide for the construction and completion by the Canadian National Railway Company of certain works described in a schedule attached to the Act. The St. Antoine street subway and the \u010fArgenson street subway are part of the works so described. The following provision is to be found at the end of the schedule:\nNothing in this schedule is to be taken to restrict the general powers of the company as expressed in the foregoing Act or other Acts relating to the Company.\nIn no respect is the Act self-contained. The powers therein referred to could never be carried out unless they were implemented by the Canadian National Railways Act and by the provisions of the other Acts applying under section 17 thereof. Far from detracting from the powers of the Board of Railway Commissioners under sections 252, 255, 256 and 257, the Act, on the contrary, implicitly confirms those powers, as will be apparent by a reference to section 8:\n8. Where streets or highways are affected by the said works but are not crossed by the Company\u2019s tracks or diverted incidental to any such crossing and by reason thereof the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada has no jurisdiction under the Railway Act with respect thereto, etc.\nThe necessary inference is that the Board has jurisdiction with respect to the crossings under the relevant sections of the Railway Act.\nThe reference to crossings in section 8 is of the same order as the exception in regard to crossings in section 17-1 (b) of the Canadian National Railways Act previously discussed. It is consistent with it. It shows on the part of Parliament continuous intention of preserving the jurisdiction of the Board in matters of crossings. There is nothing to the contrary in section 9 of the Terminals Act. It deals in a general way with the vesting in His Majesty of the lands required for the undertaking and specifies out of what funds the compensation, if any, is to be paid. Obviously it does not give the \u201ccomplete rule on the subject\u201d which Lord Westbury said was the test as to whether \u201ca general statute is varied or excepted by the Special Act.\u201d Section 9 does not deal with highway or railway crossings and leaves untouched all that we have said in regard to the application of sections 256, 257 and 39 of the Railway Act. It would be a question how far section 9 may be resorted to as being \u201cthe provisions of law at such time applicable to the taking of land by the company\u201d referred to in subs. 3 of 256 and subs. 2 of 257. But we have already indicated that the occasion does not arise here.\nOur conclusion is that the appellants fail in their contention that there is, in any of the Acts they invoked, anything to put an end to the application of sections 255, 256, 257 and 39 of the Railway Act; and as, in our view, those sections support the impugned Orders, the appeals should be dismissed.\nWe need not add that the Orders were competently issued notwithstanding that three of the appellants affected are provincial companies. The point is conclusively settled by several decisions of the Judicial Committee (Toronto Corporation v. Canadian Pacific Railway[24]; Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[25]; Canadian Pacific Ry. v. Toronto Transportation Commission[26].\nIn the course of the judgment, in dealing with the matter of crossings, we have referred throughout to sections 255, 256 and 257 of the Railway Act as giving the law applicable in the circumstances. With regard to the Montreal Tramways Company, the orders are further supported by sections 252 and following relating to railway crossings. They apply to the Tramways Company by force of section 8 of the Railway Act. They are similar in all material respects to the sections relating to highway crossings. If anything, the provisions therein conferring jurisdiction on the Board are even more direct and decisive.\nAs for The Montreal Tramways Commission, it may have a distinct interest in these appeals, but from the legal viewpoint its position does not differ from that of The Montreal Tramways Company.\nThe appeals are dismissed with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant, The Bell Telephone Company of Canada: Pierre Beullac.\nSolicitors for the appellant The Montreal Light, Heat & Power Consolidated: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitors for the appellant The Montreal Tramways Company: Vall\u00e9e, Vien, Beaudry, Fortier & Mathieu.\nSolicitors for the appellant The Montreal Tramways Commission: B\u00e9ique & B\u00e9ique.\nSolicitor for the respondent The Canadian National Railways: Alistair Fraser.\nSolicitors for the respondent The Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company: J.

Newcombe J. took no part in the judgment, as he died before the delivery thereof.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nNegligence\u2014Landlord and Tenant\u2014Fire in apartment building\u2014Tenant of suite killed and his wife injured, in escaping; and property loss\u2014Claim by wife against owner of building for damages\u2014Negligence alleged,\u2019 and found by jury, in owner of building, in arrangement existing for garbage disposal\u2014Insufficiency of alleged negligence, under the circumstances, to constitute actionable negligence in law.\nPlaintiff\u2019s busband leased from defendant a suite in defendant\u2019s apartment building. On each floor, beside the freight elevator, and separated from the hall by swinging wooden doors, was a platform on which were garbage receptacles. A fire occurred in the building and in efforts to escape the plaintiff was injured and her husband was killed. For this and for property loss, the plaintiff sued for damages. The jury found that defendant was negligent in that it caused or allowed inflammable refuse to be deposited beside the elevator shaft and failed to safeguard such refuse against the danger of fire; that such condition amounted to a trap or concealed danger created by defendant and caused the injuries, death and loss; and judgment was entered for damages. The judgment was set aside by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba. Plaintiff appealed.\nHeld, affirming judgment of the Court of Appeal (39 Man. L.R. 399), that plaintiff could not recover (Anglin C.J.C. dubitante).\nThe principle of Rylands v. Fletcher (L.R. 3 H.L. 330) held not applicable.\nThe mere deposit and accumulation of inflammable material on an owner\u2019s premises does not make him responsible for damages resulting from a fire started in that material by some one else without his knowledge (Laidlaw v. Crow\u2019s Nest Southern Ry. Co., 42 Can. S.C.R. 355).\nPlaintiff could not recover for her husband\u2019s death unless he would have had a right of action arising out of the wrong complained of, had he lived (C.P.R. v. Parent, 51 Can. S.C.R. 234; [1917] A.C. 195).\nA tenant takes the premises as they are and at his own risk, no matter what condition of visible danger there may be (Robins v. Jones, 15 C.B., N.S., 221; Lane v. Cox, [1897] 1 Q.B. 415, at 417; Taylor v. People\u2019s Loan & Svgs. Corp., [1930] Can. S.C.R. 190). Defendant\u2019s obligation to plaintiff\u2019s husband was a contractual one, under which the latter leased the premises and the approaches by which he had access to them, as they were. During his occupancy prior to, at the time of, and subsequent to the making of the lease, the arrangement for garbage disposal existed the same as at the time of the fire, and he and plaintiff knew of the condition and made use of the facility provided. Any danger therefrom was not a hidden danger, but one as obvious to the tenant and plaintiff as to defendant.\nFor plaintiff to succeed in her action for personal injuries and loss, she must establish the existence of some concealed trap; and there was no evidence of such. The negligence found by the jury did not in law constitute actionable negligence. (Cavalier v. Pope, [1906] A.C. 428; Groves v. Western Mansions Ltd., 33 T.L.R. 76; Lucy v. Bawden, [1914] 2 \u041a\u0411. 318; Fairman v. Perpetual Investment Bldg. Soc, [1923] A.C. 74, cited. Indermaur v. Dames, L.R. 1 C.P. 274, explained and distinguished).\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] allowing the defendant\u2019s appeal from the verdict of the jury at the trial and the judgment entered pursuant thereto for damages to the plaintiff for the death of her husband and for personal injuries and property loss. The Court of Appeal set aside the verdict and judgment at trial and ordered judgment to be entered dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s actions.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s claims were for damages for the death of her husband and for personal injuries and loss of property, as the result of a fire which occurred in an apartment building owned by the defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s husband was tenant of a suite in the building. At the time of the fire the plaintiff and her husband were in the building, and in endeavouring to escape the husband suffered injuries from which he died and the plaintiff suffered injuries. The plaintiff claimed that the fire and the resulting death, injuries and loss of property were caused by negligence of the defendant.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nF. M. Burbidge K.C. for the appellant.\nH. A. Bergman K.C. for the respondent.\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014While gravely doubtful as to the proper result in this case, I am inclined rather against the respondent but shall not formally dissent from the judgment of my learned brothers who constitute the majority of the court. On the whole case, I do not feel so strongly in favour of the appellant as to justify my so dissenting, without further research, from the judgment dismissing the appeal.\nThe judgment of Duff, Rinfret and Smith JJ. was delivered by\nSmith J.\u2014The respondent (defendant) was the owner of a five-story apartment building in the city of Winnipeg, known as the Casa Loma Block, the four upper floors of which are divided into suites, which are let to tenants for residential purposes. There was a passenger elevator with a front stairway adjoining, and a freight elevator with a back stairway adjoining, affording access to and from the various suites.\nThe freight elevator was separated from the hall by swinging wooden doors opening outwards into the hall. Behind these doors, and within the shaft, there was a platform approximately four feet wide, extending across its full width, and in front of the platform was the opening in which the elevator ran, which extended from the basement to the roof. On the platform, at each side of the doorway closed by the swinging doors, were garbage cans, The plan, Exhibit 5, filed, shows two cans at each side.\nThe appellant (plaintiff) and her husband moved into suite 58 in this Casa Loma Block on the fifth floor, first taking over the unexpired part of a former tenant\u2019s lease. On August 25, 1927, after having lived in the suite for over two months, the appellant\u2019s husband took a written lease of this suite for a term of one year, commencing October 1, 1927. While occupying the premises under this lease, the fire which gave rise to this action occurred, about two o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the 14th of April, 1928. The appellant and her husband were asleep when the fire broke out, and when they were roused the fire had gained such headway that they felt that they could not escape by the door leading into the hall, and jumped from the window. The husband was killed, and the appellant sustained the injuries complained of in this action.\nThe appellant sues for the damage resulting from the injuries sustained by herself, for loss of property and for damages for loss of her husband, under the Manitoba Act which is the equivalent of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act. The alleged ground of action is the negligence of the defendant in allowing refuse and inflammable material to be deposited and to accumulate in or at the elevator shaft, where the defendant knew or ought to have known that the same would be in danger of causing a fire. There were other allegations of negligence, such as the lack of fire escapes and fire-fighting apparatus, but all were abandoned at the trial except the allegation of negligence just mentioned.\nAt the trial, the vice-president of the defendant company testified that,\nThere were on each floor two cans, and possibly a box for the small cans like fruit cans that we did not want to get mixed with the garbage, because we had to burn the garbage. The tenants were requested to wrap the garbage and deposit it in the cans.\nHe says that there may have been only one can, and that in the first place there were covers for them. Some of these were found after the fire, and some were found in the basement.\nThe appellant (plaintiff) testifies that the garbage, paper, and stuff like that, would be taken by the tenants to the freight elevator shaft, and left in any of the containers there. She further testifies as follows:\nI have taken magazines, newspapers, and stacked them up on the platform there, and there was no other place to put them, in a wooden box or a cardboard box the things were delivered in. There was a bushel basket there as a container.\n* * *\nQ. There was a garbage tin, a bushel basket and a wooden barrel?\nA. Yes, and a wooden box.\nQ. And there was no cover on the tin?\nA. No, sir.\nArthur H. Sutherland, a policeman, testifies that he was coming along the hallway on the second floor, and saw flames coming out from underneath the swinging doors of the elevator shaft referred to, and, opening the door, found it on fire on the inside; and he says:\nI looked around at the back, and it looked like there was some waste paper in a basket burning.\nHe says the door itself was on fire, and the flames and smoke were coiling up to the ceiling. There were cinders flying, and what appeared to be charred paper or something like that. He yelled \u201cFire,\u201d and ran out to the fire alarm box, and from there saw fire coming out at the eaves at the top of the building. The jury found, as to the claim for death of the husband,\n(1) that the defendant caused or allowed inflammable refuse to be deposited beside the elevator shaft and failed to safeguard such refuse against the danger of fire;\n(2) that the defendant was thereby guilty of negligence causing the death of the plaintiff\u2019s husband;\n(3) that the defendant assumed a contractual obligation expressed or implied, to the plaintiff\u2019s husband, to provide reasonably adequate provision for the deposit of refuse;\n(4) that the defendant, in breach of such contractual obligation, was guilty of negligence causing the death of the plaintiff\u2019s husband;\n(5) that such condition amounted to a trap or concealed danger created by the defendant and caused the death of the plaintiff\u2019s husband.\n(6) that the plaintiff\u2019s husband was not guilty of contributory negligence.\nThey assessed the damages at $10,000.\nAs to the claim for personal injuries, the jury made the same findings as those set out above in numbers 1 and 2, and found that the condition amounted to a trap or concealed danger which caused the plaintiff\u2019s injuries and loss; and that the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence; and that her damages were $5,000, and expenses to date, $2,300, and judgment was entered for the plaintiff accordingly.\nThis judgment was set aside by the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal[2].\nThe first argument in the appellant\u2019s factum is that the principle of Rylands v. Fletcher[3] applies. In that case, the defendant constructed a reservoir on his own land, and the water escaped into an adjoining mine, and flooded the mine. The defendant was held liable. The principle laid down is as follows:\nWe think that the true rule of law is, that the person who, for his own purposes, brings on his land and collects and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes, must keep it in at his peril; and if he does not do so, is prima facie answerable for all the damage which is the natural consequence of its escape. This principle has no application here, because the garbage brought to the cans did not escape and do the damage complained of.\nMusgrove v. Pandellis[4] likewise has no application. There, petrol in the carburettor of an auto for an unknown reason took fire when the unskilled operator of the auto started the engine. The operator negligently omitted to turn off the tap to prevent further petrol flowing from the tank to the carburettor; and the fire spread and did damage to the plaintiff. The ground of the decision was the negligence of defendant\u2019s servant in failing to control the fire after it started, which he could easily have done.\nIn Job Edwards Limited v. Birmingham Navigations[5], there is nothing that in any way assists the appellant, as the question was as to control of a fire after it had started accidentally.\nIn Smith v. London and Southwestern Railway Company[6], workmen employed by a railway company in cutting grass and trimming the hedges bordering the railway, placed the trimmings in heaps near the line and allowed them to remain there fourteen days, during very hot dry weather in the month of August. Fire from a passing engine of defendant company ignited one of these heaps and spread to the dry hedge, and was thence carried by a high wind across a stubble-field and a public road and burned the goods of the plaintiff in a cottage. It was held that the defendants were liable, although there was no suggestion that the engine was improperly constructed or driven. This, of course, is the case of a fire started by the defendants, and the negligence was that it was known to the defendants that their engine emitted sparks, and that they might, under the circumstances, have contemplated the probability of these sparks igniting the dry heaps of refuse and the hedge, and thus spreading, so as to cause damage.\nLaidlaw v. Crow\u2019s Nest Southern Railway Company[7], is a case in this court where it was held that, where the railway company had no knowledge of the existence of a fire on their right of way not caused by the operation of the railway, the fact that the condition of the right of way, covered with fallen timber and dry brush of a very inflammable character, which facilitated the spread of the fire to adjoining property, did not constitute actionable negligence. This case seems to apply here, as it holds that the mere deposit and accumulation of inflammable material on an owner\u2019s premises does not make him responsible for damages resulting from a fire started in that material by someone else without his knowledge, though he might become responsible, after becoming aware of the existence of the fire, for neglecting to prevent its spread to the property of another. In the present case there is no pretence that the fire was started by the respondent proprietor, or that the proprietor was negligent in failing to prevent its spread.\nSo far as the appellant\u2019s action for damages for the death of her husband is concerned, it is perfectly clear, under the authorities, that she cannot recover unless the husband would have had a right of action arising out of the wrong complained of if he had lived. C.P.R. v. Parent[8]. The plaintiff\u2019s husband, at the time of the fire, was the tenant of the respondent company under a written lease, and it is settled law that a tenant takes the premises as they are and at his own risk, no matter what condition of visible danger there may be. Robins v. Jones[9].\nIn Lane v. Cox[10], Lopes, L.J., has the following:\nA landlord who lets a house in a dangerous or unsafe state incurs no liability to his tenant, or to the customers or guests of the tenant, for any accident which may happen to them during the term, unless he has contracted to keep the house in repair. * * * There cannot be a liability for negligence unless there is a breach of some duty; and no duty exists in this case to the tenant, and none can be alleged to strangers.\nSee also Taylor v. The People\u2019s Loan and Savings Corporation[11].\nThe obligation of the respondent to the appellant\u2019s husband was a contractual obligation, under which he leased the premises and the approaches by which he had access to them, as they were. From his residence there prior to, at the time of, and subsequent to the making of the lease, the arrangement for the disposal of garbage existed just as it did at the time of the fire, and he and the plaintiff knew of that condition, and made use of the facility provided for the disposal of garbage, just as other tenants did, and, according to her evidence, the plaintiff herself was a chief offender in creating the condition of danger that she complains of. If this garbage, deposited as it was, constituted an evident danger, it was not a hidden danger, but a danger that was as obvious to the tenant and his wife, the appellant, as to the landlord. The suggestion is that the fire occurred through the negligence of some of the other tenants. If so, the appellant\u2019s husband in his lease contracted that the landlord should not be liable to him for such negligence.\nNumerous decided cases make it abundantly clear that the plaintiff under the circumstances is not entitled to recover damages for her own injuries and loss. In Cavalier v. Pope[12], the owner of a dilapidated house covenanted with his tenant for repair, but failed to do so. The tenan\u0165s wife, who lived in the house and was well aware of the danger, was injured by an accident caused by the want of repair. Held, that the wife, being a stranger to the contract, had no claim for damages against the owner. Lord Macnaghten, at page 430, makes the following statement:\nThe wife, who was not the tenant, cannot be in a better position to recover damages than a customer or guest.\nIn Groves v. Western Mansions Limited[13], the plaintiff was the wife of the tenant of a room on the first floor of a building which was let by the defendant in separate tenements. Several of the tenements, including that of the plaintiff, were approached by a common staircase. The plaintiff went out of her room to the landing in order to draw water from a tap on the landing. She found that a tap on the landing immediately above had been left running, and she went to the upper landing to stop it. On the way down she slipped on a defective step and suffered per injuries. She sued the defendants for damages for negligence. Held, that proof of the existence of a concealed trap was essential to the cause of action, and, as the plaintiff could not show that, it was held that she was not entitled to damages. In Lacy v. Bawden[14], the defendant was the owner of a house which consisted of a basement and two upper floors, the rooms on each floor being separately let. The house was entered by a front door on the ground floor level, which was approached from the street by a flight of six or seven steps protected on each side by a coping about eight inches high. On either side of the steps was an area. The steps remained in the defendant\u2019s possession and control. The plaintiff, wife of one of the tenants occupying the house, slipped on the steps and fell into the area, sustaining injuries. The jury found that the defect in the steps consisted in the absence of a railing, which was due to the negligence of the defendant, and that both plaintiff and defendant knew before the accident of the existence of the defect. It was held that, as the danger was patent, the landlord was not liable.\nIn F airman v. Perpetual Investment Building Society[15], the defendants owned a block of flats, which they let to various tenants, the defendants keeping control of the staircase giving access to the flats. The stairs were made of cement reinforced by iron bars embedded in the cement. Owing to wear, the cement became scooped out, and the plaintiff, who lodged with her sister in a flat on the fourth floor, of which the sister\u2019s husband was tenant, while descending the stairs, caught her heel in a depression so formed, and was injured. It was held that the only duty owed by the defendants to the plaintiff was not to expose her to a concealed danger or trap, all of the five judges agreeing in this view of the law. Two of them, however, dissenting from the majority, were of opinion that the defect in fact constituted a trap. The previous cases are reviewed, and Miller v. Hancock[16] is held to be incorrect, unless upon the assumption that there was in that case a concealed trap, the existence of which is not stated in the case. At page 84, Lord Buckmaster says:\nI have only to add that the plaintiff was a lodger to one of the defendants\u2019 tenants; she had therefore a material interest in the use of the premises and could not be regarded as a mere guest or casual visitor. Lord Atkinson points out that, as between the plaintiff and the tenant, the plaintiff had an interest, but goes on to state (p. 86) that,\nThe plaintiff, being only a licensee, was therefore bound to take the stairs as she found them, but the landlord was on his side bound not to expose her, without warning, to a hidden peril, of the existence of which he knew, or ought to have known. He owed a duty to her not to lay a trap for her. But even if the plaintiff was in the position of an invitee of the defendants, her rights and duties in that character would be those described and measured by the well-known passage from Willes J.\u2019s judgment in Indermaur v. Dames[17].\nIn the latter case, upon the premises of the defendant, a sugar refiner, was a hole or chute on a level with the floor, usual and proper in the defendant\u2019s business. When not in use, it was necessary that it should be open for the purpose of ventilation, but it was not necessary, when so open and not in use, that it be unfenced. The plaintiff was a gas-fitter in the employ of a patentee who had fixed a patent gas regulator on defendant\u2019s premises, for which he was to be paid if it effected a saving in the consumption of gas. He went upon the premises with his employer\u2019s agent to test the new apparatus. Without negligence on his part, as the jury found, he fell through the hole and was injured. Held, that as plaintiff had a right to go there, defendant was guilty of a breach of duty towards him in suffering the hole to be unfenced. At page 289, the plaintiff is given a right to amend the declaration by stating the facts as proved:\n* * * in effect, that the defendant was the occupier of and carried on business at the place; that there was a shaft, very dangerous to persons in the place, which the defendant knew and the plaintiff did not know; that the plaintiff, by invitation and permission of the defendant, was there near the shaft, upon business of the defendant, in the way of his own craft as a gas-fitter, for hire, etc.\nI make this quotation because it shows that a necessary allegation was that the defendant knew of the dangerous condition, and the plaintiff did not know.\nIt is clear, therefore, that in order to succeed in her action for personal injuries and loss it was necessary that the appellant should establish the existence of some concealed trap. There is no evidence of anything of the sort; and the negligence on the part of the defendant found by the jury does not in law constitute actionable negligence. There was, of course, no evidence of the contractual obligation found in the answers to Questions 3 and 4.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Alex.

Code, s. 498 (1) (a) (b) (d)\u2014Sufficiency of findings to establish guilt\u2014Findings of participation in original scheme, but not of participation in subsequent overt acts\u2014Misdirection of himself by trial judge\u2014Appeal by Attorney-General from acquittal at trial\u2014Cr. Code, s. 1013 (4), as enacted in 1980, c. 11, s. 28\u2014\u201cQuestion of law\u201d\u2014Objection to form of indictment and conviction.\nAppellants were acquitted by Wright J., [1931] O.R. 202, on charges of offences against the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 26, and of conspiracy, in violation of s. 498, subs. 1 (a), (b) and (d), of the Cr. Code, but, upon appeal by the Attorney-General under s. 1013 (4) of the Cr. Code, as enacted in 1930, c. 11, s. 28, they were convicted by the Appellate Division, [1931] O.R. 699. They appealed.\nHeld: The appeals should be dismissed.\nThe trial judge\u2019s material findings of fact were fully justified on the evidence and established appellants\u2019 guilt. The trial judge misdirected himself, in that, while finding that appellants had taken an active part in the original scheme\u2014the formation of the organizations in question which, as found, amounted to the formation of an illegal combine, and to a conspiracy within s. 498, Cr. Code\u2014yet he acquitted them on the ground that they were not proved to have taken part in subsequent overt acts. The original scheme constituted the conspiracy which formed the basis for the prosecution; the overt acts were not the conspiracy, though evidence of its existence. It was not essential to a finding of appellants\u2019 guilt, that they be held to have had actual knowledge of, or to have actually participated in, the subsequent overt acts. Once it is established that a combine or conspiracy existed, it is unnecessary, to warrant conviction for the formation of a combine, or of the agreement to conspire, to shew accused\u2019s complicity in subsequent illegal acts done by, or with the connivance of, the body against members of which conspiracy or unlawful combine is charged; provided there is sufficient proof of their complicity in the original formation of the combine, or in the agreement charged as conspiracy.\nWhile the Attorney-General\u2019s right of appeal, conferred by s. 1013 (4), is confined to \u201cquestions of law,\u201d this does not exclude the appellate court\u2019s right, where a conclusion of mixed law and fact, such as is the accused\u2019s guilt or innocence, depends, as in the present case, upon the legal effect of certain findings of fact made, to enquire into the soundness of that conclusion, which must be regarded as a question of law\u2014especially where, as in this case, it is a clear result of misdirection of himself in law by the trial judge.\nHeld, further, that appellants\u2019 objection to the form of the indictment, based on the ground that there were several offences charged in the alternative, and to the form of the convictions (which strictly followed the form of the indictment), could not be sustained; they expressed the offences in the very terms of the statutes. (Cr. Code, ss. 852 (3), 854, 1010 (2), cited).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], which allowed the appeal of the Attorney-General of Ontario from the judgment of Wright J.[2] acquitting the present appellants on charges of offences against the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 26, and of conspiracy contrary to the provisions of s. 498, subs. (1) (a), (b) and (d), of the Criminal Code. The Appellate Division set aside the acquittal of the present appellants and adjudged them guilty.\nW.F. O\u2019Connor K.C. for the appellants.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and J.C. McRuer K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014These two appeals were heard together.\nThe appellants, Belyea and Weinraub, were both acquitted2 on trial before Wright, J., without a jury, (R.S.C., 1927, ch. 26, s. 39; Cr. C., s. 581); but, upon appeal by the Attorney-General under s. 1013 (4) of the Criminal Code, as enacted by c. 11, s. 28, of the Statutes of Canada, 1930, the Appellate Division1 was of the opinion that the learned trial judge had misdirected himself, in that he held that, although it was proven, if not admitted, that they (the appellants) \u201ctook an active part in the original scheme,\u2014the conspiracy which formed the basis for the prosecution, * * * because (they) were not proved to have taken part in subsequent overt acts,\u201d they should be acquitted, saying of one of the respondents, \u201cThere is no evidence that connects him with any of the illegal operations.\u201d The Appellate Division found that\nBelyea and Weinraub were most active in carrying out the projects of the conspiracy; were originally united with Singer himself in the conspiracy of which the latter was found guilty. They should have been convicted as were Singer, Paddon and Ward. Their part in the illegal acts was much greater than that of Paddon and Ward, but less than that of Singer.\nHaving found them guilty, that Court then proceeded to fine each of them one-half the amount of the fine imposed upon Singer.\nAfter careful consideration of the evidence, of the very lengthy argument before this Court, which lasted more than two days, and of the \u201cmemorandum of points\u201d and the supplementary factum of the appellants, we are of opinion that the appeals fail and must be dismissed.\nIn the course of the trial, the learned judge refused the accused leave to move to quash the indictment under s. 898 of the Cr. C., on the ground that ss. 854 and 855 applied to it, and that s. 891 of the Code was directly relevant. No motion under the latter section was made on behalf of the accused. Here, this refusal of leave, although approved by the Appellate Division, was made a substantial ground of complaint. We are of opinion that the objection is ill-founded, being based, as it was, on the ground that there were several offences charged in the alternative. As the Appellate Division said, the indictments \u201cfollow the Statutes under which they are laid, and their form is sanctioned by ss. 852, 954 (sic.) and 1010 (2) of the Code.\u201d Having regard to ss. 852 (3), 854 and 1010 (2), the position taken by the accused is hopeless. By s. 1010 (2) it is provided that\n* * * the indictment shall, after verdict, be held sufficient, if it describes the offence in the words of the statute creating the offence, or prescribing the punishment, although they (sic.) are disjunctively stated or appear to include more than one offence, or otherwise. Upon this statutory provision being stressed by the Court, however, counsel for the appellants sought to turn his objection into a present objection to the form of the convictions which had strictly followed the form of the indictment. It was pointed out to him that, in our opinion, it was not open for him to do so. No doubt s. 852 deals with objections to an indictment; but, as the convictions here strictly follow the form of the indictment, and express the offences of which the accused were found guilty in the very terms of the statutes, this point seems now to be concluded against the appellants. (S. 1010 (2)). As Mr. McCarthy (counsel for the Crown) put the matter to the Court, the convictions by the Appellate Division are in the words of the statutes themselves, the offences of which the accused were found guilty being the formation and operation of an illegal combine contrary to the provisions of the Combines Investigation Act, as therein defined, and conspiracy in violation of s. 498, subs. 1 (a), (b) and (d), of the Criminal Code. The words \u201cor of services,\u201d etc., in the indictment are introduced merely as illustrative of the methods employed by the accused in operating the combine, and in carrying out the conspiracy in question. We are, accordingly, of the opinion that any objection based on the form of the indictment, or of the convictions, cannot now be upheld.\nCounsel for the appellants at the outset of the argument stated that the question he intended to raise was whether there was any evidence in the record to warrant the findings of the trial judge; and not at all as to the weight of such evidence. We are, however, of the opinion that\u2014although, no doubt, the position so taken is sound\u2014it is unnecessary to rely upon that as an answer to the appeal, being of the view that the weight of evidence fully justified, if, indeed, it did not require, all the material findings made by the learned trial judge.\nThe following findings of Wright J., in the course of his judgment, seem to us to be vital and leave no doubt as to the appellants\u2019 guilt. Moreover, they are all supported by the evidence. Indeed, as stated by counsel for the appellant in his memorandum, the fact-finding of the learned trial judge was good. After setting out the indictment, and the circumstances leading up to the trial, and discussing the application for leave to move to quash the indictment, the learned judge said that, in the prosecution of this case, being the first case in the province under the Combines Investigation Act, the whole question should be fully considered. We take the following somewhat copious extracts from the judgment of the learned judge. They contain the findings which we consider material:\nPrior to March, 1927, there was in existence in Ontario, an Association known as the Ontario Society of Domestic Sanitary and Heating Engineers. This Association had been somewhat dormant for years, but at a Convention held in Guelph in March, 1927, it was resolved to revive the Association with a view to extend its usefulness.\nAt that Convention the accused Belyea and Weinraub were elected as directors * * * Plans were then laid to hold a meeting at a subsequent date, in order to get all the allied trades into one organization. It was also suggested that a Commissioner with plenary power should be appointed as head of the organization.\nNext followed a letter dated March 22, 1927, from Singer to Belyea in which suggestions were made by the former as to holding a conference to discuss the proposed new organization.\nOn April 9th a meeting was held in the office of Singer at which both Weinraub and Belyea were present. At this meeting it was temporarily arranged that Singer be paid $7,500 to organize and incorporate a new organization. Following this meeting a letter was written by Singer to Belyea under date of April 11, 1927, outlining the proposed objects of the organization.\nNext followed a series of speaking tours throughout the Province in which Belyea and Weinraub took a leading part. This was to interest the members of the different trades affected or proposed to be affected by the formation of the new organization.\nWindsor, among other centres was visited and a meeting was held of those interested at which the accused, Belyea and Weinraub, were present.\nThe only objection taken at bar by counsel for the appellants to the accuracy of this set of findings is that he contended that Weinraub was not present at the Windsor meeting. This, however, seems to us to be not very material.\nAs a result of this campaign a largely attended convention was held at Hamilton on June 11th, 1927, at which * * * it was decided to proceed to form a new association and to have a Commissioner appointed to guide and govern its affairs.\nLetters of Incorporation of the Canadian Plumbing and Heating Guild were granted on June 30th, 1927.\nIt should here be noted that this incorporation is not an incorporation as a trade union under the Trade Unions Act. Prior to the granting of this charter, the sum of $7,500 was paid to Singer as his charges for his services in connection with the organization and incorporation of the Guild.\nThe purposes and objects of the Guild as set forth in the Letters of Incorporation did not disclose the real purposes or objects as shown by the future operations of the Guild. Two of the accused, namely, Belyea and Weinraub, were among the incorporators of this Guild.\nThe membership in the Guild included manufacturers and wholesalers of plumbing supplies, but shortly after the incorporation these parties became restless owing * * * to a legal opinion received by them to the effect that it was illegal for them to be in the same organization as the Master Plumbers, * * *\nAt a meeting held on the 24th of August, 1927, by the wholesalers and manufacturers, the following resolution was passed:\nThat this meeting of manufacturers and jobbers recommend to manufacturers and jobbers of plumbing and heating goods that they become members of the Dominion Chamber of Credits Limited without any further obligation than their subscription.\nThis incorporation was, likewise, not effected under the Trade Unions Act.\nIt was also arranged that the application fees already paid by manufacturers and jobbers to the Guild should be transferred to the new organization.\n* * * From what appeared in the evidence at the trial, and the subsequent operations of the two organizations, it is quite clear that the new organization was formed for the purpose of having two organizations,\u2014one consisting of Master plumbers, and the other of manufacturers and jobbers, acting under the direction of one Commissioner and in close contact and co-operation with each other.\nA Convention was held at Toronto on January 26th and 27th, 1928, which was addressed by O\u2019Connor at considerable length * * *\nThe only objection taken at bar to the accuracy of this finding was that Singer was not actually named as \u201cCommissioner\u201d for the new, or second, organization. There was, in fact, no \u201cCommissioner\u201d of that body; but Singer was in charge of, and responsible for, its operations throughout, and the burden of his $25,000 salary was equally borne by each body.\nShortly after this meeting, Singer conceived the idea of another organization, and on April 13th, 1928, it was arranged that a new organization to be known as the Amalgamated Builders Council should be registered under the Trade Unions Act, and the same was duly registered on the 8th day of June, 1928, with the Deputy Registrar General of Canada, as required by the Trade Unions Act. Of this organization, the accused Belyea was appointed President, and Weinraub as Secretary.\nThe President, on the 9th July, 1928, appointed Singer as Commissioner under rule 3 of the By-laws of the new organization.\nOn July 19th, 1928, Singer and O\u2019Connor interviewed the Department of Labour at Ottawa and submitted in writing a document known as Canadian Cartels * * * The document is important not for that reason but for certain statements contained in the draft Cartel relating to the activities of Singer and O\u2019Connor in connection with the formation and operation of the organization.\nCertain Master Plumbers residing in Windsor * * * made application for a charter for a local section of the Amalgamated Builders Council and on September 25, 1928, a charter was granted to the branch at Windsor to be designated as Local Section No. 112. * * *\nThis organization continued to function until the 31st day of December, 1929, when, after an investigation under the Combines Investigation Act, the certificate of registration of the Amalgamated Builders Council was cancelled by the Secretary of State and Registrar General of Canada.\nThe evidence disclosed that the organizations were the creation and creatures of Singer.\nHis (Singer\u2019s) was the guiding hand throughout the entire operation of the different organizations.\nUnder the terms of the by-law which will be referred to, he was invested with wide powers, and the evidence disclosed that he exercised them to the limit.\n* * *\nThe Canadian Plumbing and Heating Guild was the first to be incorporated. By reference to its charter it will appear that its purposes or objects were very wide and embraced almost every conceivable subject relating to the plumbing industry.\n* * *\nOf these organizations Singer was the Commissioner, Belyea was President, and Weinraub was secretary. * * *\n* * * The powers of the Commissioner (were) defined in clauses 2 and 3 of By-law No. 1 (of the Guild) which read as follows:\n\u201c(2) The general management shall be entrusted to a Commissioner, who shall establish and maintain the Guild and supervise and control its policies and affairs according to his best judgment, and in that behalf shall do and cause to be done such acts and things as he may from time to time think necessary or desirable and shall employ such help as he may deem necessary. He shall investigate prevailing conditions in the plumbing and heating industry and shall oversee the gathering and distribution of information. He shall examine prospective members as to their eligibility and shall admit to membership those who are eligible and shall expel from membership those who become ineligible.\n\u201c(3) The Commissioner shall have the right to veto any resolution or by-law of the Board of Directors or any decision of any officer.\u201d\nThis organization had officials known as Zone Chairmen in the various centres. In Windsor, one Pragnell was the first of such Chairmen, * * *\n* * * The evidence clearly established that the Windsor group was composed solely of members of the Guild and Singer, in his capacity of Commissioner, attended some of the meetings, and delivered addresses to the members. * * * It is quite clear this (Windsor) group was recognized by the chief executive officers of the Guild as a constituent though informal branch of the organization.\nNext in chronological order is the Dominion Chamber of Credits, of which Singer was one of the incorporators, and one of the directors. No minutes of this organization were produced at the trial * * * The following significant clause appears among (its) objects: \u201c(g) To subscribe to, become a member of, become associated and co-operate with any other association or corporation whether incorporated or not, whose objects or purposes are altogether or in part similar to those of the company and to procure from and communicate to any such corporation such information as may be likely to further the objects of the company.\u201d\nAs already indicated, this organization was formed so as to permit the manufacturers and jobbers who were members of the Guild, to retain their connection with it under the guise of another body. The fees already paid by them to the Guild were to be transferred to the new organization.\nThe last organization to be formed was the Amalgamated Builders\u2019 Council * * * Had it confined its operations to those authorized by (the Trade Unions) Act, no objection could well be taken, but from its operations it is clearly evident that the purpose of those responsible for its creation and operation was to avail themselves of any immunity provided by this Act, and, if possible, evade the provisions of the Combines Investigation Act, and the Criminal Code.\nCounsel for the appellants fully accepted this finding at bar; indeed, he rather gloried in the attempt so made to evade the law.\nOf this organization Singer was the duly appointed Commissioner. Belyea was the first president, and Weinraub was the first secretary-treasurer. * * *\nAt the convention of September 3rd, 1928, it was decided unanimously that henceforth only members of Amalgamated Builders\u2019 Council actually engaged in the plumbing and heating industry should be eligible to be or to continue members of the Guild. This policy was also stated in a circular letter of September 7th, 1928, by Singer in his capacity as Commissioner, in the following words:\n\u201cNo member will be admitted to Amalgamated Builders\u2019 Council unless he is a member of the Guild. Membership in the Guild will be conditional upon membership in the Amalgamated Builders\u2019 Council.\u201d\nMany of the foregoing findings were referred to by counsel for the appellants, in the course of the argument, as historical in their character. This, however, does not prevent them being findings of fact, fully supported by evidence, and many of them material to the existence or nonexistence of the combine or conspiracy charged.\nSummarizing the essential findings of fact contained in the foregoing, they include the following:\n(a) That the Canadian Plumbing and Heating Guild was formed as the result of an effort, in March, 1927, to revive a dormant body, called the Ontario Society of Domestic and Sanitary Heating Engineers, of which Belyea and Weinraub were elected as directors; the former becoming President, and the latter, Secretary-Treasurer of the new body; (b) That Singer was the prime mover in this and subsequent matters, being paid $7,500 by Belyea and Weinraub and their associates as a fee for the organization and incorporation of the new body known as the Canadian Plumbing and Heating Guild;\n(c) That, as a result of a speaking tour, in which Belyea and Weinraub took a leading part, many Master Plumbers and others were interested in the organization, Windsor being amongst the centres visited;\n(d) That Singer was appointed Commissioner of the new body in 1927, with absolute powers and to act as the alter ego of the directors;\n(e) That the real purposes of the Guild were not those stated in its incorporation; and that Belyea and Weinraub were among the incorporators thereof;\n(f) That the Guild membership originally included manufacturers and wholesalers as well as master plumbers; that the former became dissatisfied, and transferred their membership to another organization formed under Singer\u2019s auspices, called the \u201cDominion Chamber of Credits,\u201d of which all the wholesalers and manufacturers were urged to become members; their subscriptions being transferred from the Guild to the Dominion Chamber of Credits;\n(g) That the new organization was formed for the purpose of having two organizations,\u2014the one for master plumbers, the other for wholesalers and manufacturers, both under the full control of Singer, and acting in close co-operation one with the other;\n(h) That Singer conceived the idea of a third organization, called the Amalgamated Builders\u2019 Council, to be registered under the Trade Unions Act; of this organization Belyea was elected President and Weinraub Secretary-Treasurer. On the 9th of July, 1928, Belyea, as President, appointed Singer \u201cCommissioner\u201d of this third organization with plenary powers;\n(i) That Singer\u2019s was the guiding hand in all three organizations and that he was invested with the widest possible powers, which he exercised to the limit;\n(j) That membership in the Guild was essential to membership in the Amalgamated Builders\u2019 Council;\n(k) That from the operations of the A.B.C. it was evident that its real purposes were to avail itself of any immunity provided by the Trade Unions Act, and, if possible, to evade the provisions of the Combines Investigation Act and s. 498 of the Criminal Code.\n(I) That, at a Convention of the A.B.C., on September 3, 1928, it was unanimously decided that, henceforth, only members of the A.B.C. should be eligible to membership in the Guild; and membership in the A.B.C. should be conditional upon membership in the Guild;\n(m) That the Windsor group was recognized by the Guild as a constituent, though informal, branch of the organization.\nHaving made the foregoing findings, the learned judge proceeds to sum up the situation as follows:\nFrom the foregoing it is manifest that these three organizations were formed and operated for the express purpose of controlling the plumbing and heating industry in its various branches, including manufacturing and jobbing, and to further that end absolute control and direction of these organizations were vested in one individual styled \u201cCommissioner,\u201d which in itself was a vicious and indefensible system.\nExcept as to styling Singer \u201cCommissioner\u201d of the three organizations, an office actually held by him only in two of them, although, in respect to the other, the Dominion Chamber of Credits, he exercised all the powers of \u201cCommissioner,\u201d the accuracy of this finding as to the purposes for which the organizations were formed and operated was not challenged at bar.\nThe learned judge then proceeds to deal with a number of overt acts which, as Mr. McCarthy informs us, were put into the record merely to show the methods by which the conspiracy and combine was worked out, and not at all to show the existence of the conspiracy or combine, of which, he contends, there was abundant evidence apart from the proof of any such overt acts.\nThis finding may be regarded as a further summarizing of the nature of the purpose of the combine and conspiracy charged and found to have existed. The evidence supports it and objections, if any, taken to its accuracy would be futile.\nThe acts complained of in connection with the Windsor group may be summarized as follows:\n(a) There was a fixing of a common price both of material and labour, as the method of computing prices of material was standardized and the cost of labour was fixed; and also a fixing of a rate of profit to be added to cost;\n(b) That the public was forced to pay tribute to the Guild.\nThe learned judge proceeds:\nThe evidence established that at one stage of the operations of this organization schedules were adopted by the members whereby 30 per cent. was to be added to the cost of the materials for labour and to the total cost of labour and materials a further addition of 30 per cent. was to be added as profit.\nThere is also proof of action by the Windsor group towards creating a monopoly or limiting competition in the plumbing and heating industry.\nAt a meeting of Local Section 112, held on October 4, 1928, at Windsor, a resolution was adopted in the following terms:\n\u201cResolved that the members of this Local ought not to purchase and after communication of this resolution will not purchase from any supplier who directly or indirectly sells plumbing, heating or radiation fixtures, goods, materials or systems in or about or for installation or use in or about the border cities to persons, firms or corporations other than members of this Local.\u201d\nThe minutes show that the secretary-treasurer was directed to communicate the foregoing resolution to such suppliers as customarily sell within the territory of the local, and this was done accordingly.\nThis resolution was either drafted by Singer or submitted to him for approval, * * *\nThe evidence established that this resolution was acted upon in many instances and non-members of the Amalgamated Builders\u2019 Council at Windsor found great difficulty in procuring supplies and were greatly embarrassed in their business operations.\nFrom time to time manufacturers and wholesalers of plumbing and heating supplies were furnished with lists of members of the local Section 112 of the Amalgamated Builders\u2019 Council and there was a tacit, if not an express agreement, that the dealers would refuse to sell to non-members and this was actually done in many instances.\n* * *\nIn order to finance those organizations, a levy was made upon the members * * * If default was made by a member in payment of his assessment, he was liable to expulsion by the Commissioner, Singer, and this power was exercised in several instances. The resulting effect was that the expelled member was precluded from obtaining labour or supplies wherewith to carry on his operations.\nThese various activities built up an autocratic and despotic organization of the plumbing and heating industry in Windsor, * * *\nThat the learned judge had in mind the nature of the indictment to which the accused were called upon to answer is evidenced in the following reference. He says:\nSection 32 of the Combines Investigation Act, (R.S.C., 1927, c. 26) declared it to be an indictable offence on the part of anyone who is a party or privy to or knowingly assists in the formation or operation of a combine within the meaning of the Act. He concludes by saying:\nI have no hesitation in holding that the evidence in this case established that there was a combine.\n* * *\nThe deductions I have already drawn from the evidence clearly establish that the combine in this case falls within the class indicated in this subsection (s. 2 (1)).\n* * *\nTo come within the Statute, the combine must also be a merger, trust or monopoly so\u2011called, or (a) result from any actual or tacit contract, agreement, arrangement or combination which has or is designed to have the effect of any of the results set forth in subsections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 of sec. 2.\n* * *\nThe indictment * * * alleges that the combine resulted from an actual or tacit contract, agreement, arrangement or combination which has or is designed to have the effects set forth in subs. 1, 3, 4 and 5 of s. 2.\nThe evidence in my view, as already indicated, clearly establishes that there was an actual or tacit agreement, arrangement or combination, but it is still open for decision as to the actual or designed effect of such combine.\nIn my opinion the evidence establishes, and I so find, that the combine did have or was designed to have the following effects:\n(a) limiting facilities for supplying or dealing in plumbing and heating supplies within the purview of ss. 1.\n(b) fixing a common price within the meaning of ss. 2.\n(c) enhancing the price or cost of articles within the meaning of ss. 4.\n(d) preventing or lessening competition or substantially controlling within the City of Windsor and adjoining district the purchase, sale or supply of plumbing and heating materials.\nSummarizing these findings, the result is that I hold the combine disclosed in the evidence falls within the class of combines prohibited by s. 2 of this Act.\nThe learned judge then proceeds to deal with the Trade Unions Act and makes the following comment (with which we fully agree):\nIt would be a travesty on justice if acts and transactions such as those disclosed in the evidence in this case could be justified or excused merely because the offenders were members of a Trade Union.\nTaking up the conspiracy charges (counts nos. 5, 6 and 7) under clauses (a), (b) and (d) of subs. 1 of s. 498, the learned judge proceeds:\nThe evidence applies to these charges as well as to those already reviewed, and the findings of fact will also apply to these counts.\nThe evidence establishes a conspiracy to unduly limit the facilities for supplying and dealing in plumbing and heating supplies.\nI need only refer to the evidence as to the arrangement restricting the sale or supply of materials to members of the organization in question, which clearly establishes an offence under this section. The evidence also establishes a conspiracy to unduly prevent or lessen competition in the sale or supply of plumbing and heating materials within the meaning of ss. (d) of s. 498.\nI find upon the evidence that there was a conspiracy to restrain or injure trade or commerce as defined in ss. (b).\n* * *\nIt is strenuously argued that the provisions of s. 497 apply to the situation in this case.\nIt was contended by counsel for the Crown, and I think properly, that the provisions of s. 497 relate only to offences charged under clause (b) of s. 498 (1).\n* * *\nIt is quite evident that it was never intended by Parliament that s. 497 should operate as a complete defence to all the offences created by s. 498 of the Code.\n* * *\nHaving arrived at the conclusion that offences were committed against both the Combines Investigation Act and the Criminal Code, it now becomes necessary to decide as to the complicity or participation of the accused in the offences established.\nAfter disposing of the cases of Singer, Paddon and Ward, whom he found guilty on all the counts in the indictment, the learned judge proceeds to discuss the cases of the other accused who were before him. He says:\nThe case of the accused O\u2019Connor rests upon a different basis. He was retained by Singer as his counsel and from time to time advised the latter in reference to Guild matters. He gave two written opinions * * *\n* * * He also addressed a meeting of the Canadian Plumbing and Heating Guild at its annual convention at Toronto on January 25th, 1928, in which he made an attack upon The Combines Investigation Act and also on section 498 of The Criminal Code but did not directly advise evasion or disregard of the provisions of these Acts. In that address he stated, among other things, that the Commissioner Singer had explained to him his conception of the Guild and further stated he had an intimate connection with the Commissioner and had been since the birth of the Guild in daily contact with its affairs. He further stated that as the result of close scrutiny of the charter documents and actions of the Guild since incorporation, it was a lawful association, lawfully organized, lawfully conducted and that every action thereof up to that time could be shouted from the housetops without fear.\nIn conjunction with Singer he also appeared before the Department at Ottawa and presented a draft document known as the Canadian Cartels. In that document it was stated that Singer and O\u2019Connor in the beginning conceived and elaborated the idea which Amalgamated Builders\u2019 Council exemplified.\nFor these statements and declarations by O\u2019Connor the Crown seek to hold him liable as a party or privy to or knowingly assisting in the formation or operation of these combines.\nI am of the opinion, however, and so hold, that where the formation of an organization is for professedly legitimate objects but the organization or its members afterwards participate in unlawful operations, the party to the original formation is not criminally liable unless and until he participates either as party or privy to or knowingly assists in the illegal operations of the organization and I cannot find on the evidence here any participation by O\u2019Connor in the illegal operations of these organizations or of the members of same.\nIn arriving at this conclusion I have in mind the provisions of s. 69 of the Criminal Code, but, notwithstanding that section, I cannot find upon the evidence that there was any participation or complicity by O\u2019Connor in the offences established in evidence and therefore a verdict of not guilty must be found in this case.\nThe provision of s. 70, Cr. C., is also of value in this connection.\nThese findings are relevant only because they are incorporated by the learned trial judge in the part of his judgment dealing with the present appellants.\nThe report of the Guild Convention held on the 25th and 26th of January, 1928, was sent out by Belyea. It contained the following significant passage:\nACTING COMMISSIONER: During your Commissioner\u2019s enforced absence through sickness, your President will, at the Commissioner\u2019s request, act in his stead under the guidance and direction of Mr. W.F. O\u2019Connor, K.C.\nIn the course of dealing with the case against the defendant W.F. O\u2019Connor, the learned judge refers to \u201can organization * * * for professedly legitimate objects,\u201d thereby implying that the actual objects of the organization, as established by the evidence, were not legitimate.\nThe learned judge then proceeds to deal with the cases of Belyea and Weinraub. It is true he goes on to speak of subsequent unlawful operations, to which it was necessary, in his opinion, to show that the appellants were either parties or privies, or that they knowingly assisted therein. At the very outset he makes the momentous finding that\nUndoubtedly these men took an active part in the formation of the organization under review.\nThis very important finding may have escaped the attention of counsel because it occurs in the body of a paragraph dealing with other matters. Its significance, however, is too marked to permit of its being overlooked by us. It stands unchallenged and unmet. Presumably on the ground that the purpose of the organization was \u201cprofessedly\u201d (i.e., ostensibly) lawful, and that there is not sufficient evidence that the appellants participated in, or were privy to, the subsequent admittedly illegal acts of the Windsor group, the learned judge acquitted them. Counsel for the appellants, in his memorandum of argument, which is really a long factum of seventy-six pages, has seen fit to divide his argument under some nine heads. I have read the \u201cfactum\u201d through and find it unnecessary to follow him in that division. In his supplementary factum (consisting of one hundred closely typewritten pages) counsel proceeds to discuss at inordinate length, though, no doubt, skilfully from his point of view, all the evidence, oral and documentary, in the record. He deals lengthily with many matters quite immaterial, his point of view apparently being that it would aid his clients if he could succeed in showing their innocence regarding matters not really vital to the charge against them; whereas, if the facts found by Wright, J., were true, and the evidence supports such findings, and those findings fairly lead to the conclusion of the guilt of the appellants, all the rest must indeed be immaterial.\nIn respect to the only finding of fact by Wright, J., in regard to which anything approaching error was shown to have been made by that learned judge, in his supplementary factum counsel for appellants apparently demonstrates that Wright, J., was wrong in holding that, after the institution of the Zone System, all the meetings of \u201cthe Windsor Group\u201d were presided over by the Zone chairman.\nBut it will be noted that, in setting out the material findings of the trial judge above, no allusion has been made to this particular finding. That was because we regarded it as quite immaterial and beside the question. Of course, much is made by counsel for the appellants of this alleged error, but it cannot affect the issue before us, and we allude to it merely to show that the matter has not been overlooked.\nNeither do we accede to the argument of counsel for the appellants that, if there be evidence that the accused were not implicated in some particular matters in which Singer or others were involved, that fact would afford an answer to the opinion of the Appellate Division that the findings of the learned judge, and facts admitted by the appellants themselves, sustain the holding\nthat these respondents (Belyea and Weinraub) took an active part in the original scheme,\u2014the conspiracy which formed the basis for the prosecution,\u2014is admitted; That view was not seriously controverted at bar, counsel insisting rather that there was no evidence of actual complicity of the appellants in, or of their privity to, the admittedly illegal acts done by the Windsor group, alleged by the Crown to be merely illustrative of the ways and means adopted\u2014if not directed by the head office (in Toronto) of Singer and the two appellants\u2014to carry out the objects of the organization, which they controlled and over which they presided. On the contrary, if there be evidence to warrant convictions of the appellants for breach of the Combines Investigation Act by actual participation in the formation of a combine within the meaning of that statute, and evidence to justify convictions for conspiracy under s. 498 of the Criminal Code\u2014and we think there was abundant evidence to support the convictions for both offences\u2014we cannot understand the materiality to the validity of the convictions of evidence bearing upon such other matters.\nMoreover, we think the Appellate Division was entirely right in its conclusion that the trial judge had misdirected himself when, although it was his opinion that both Belyea and Weinraub had \u201cundoubtedly * * * (taken) an active part in the formation of the organization,\u201d he held that, because there was not sufficient evidence to warrant his finding that they had also actually taken part in the Windsor operations, or were parties or privies thereto, they were not implicated in the conspiracy charged, or in the formation of the illegal combine. We are in accord with the view of the Appellate Division expressed in these words:\nThat these respondents took an active part in the original scheme,\u2014the conspiracy which formed the basis for the prosecution,\u2014is admitted; the error in law into which the learned judge fell was in not distinguishing between the conspiracy itself and overt acts which, while not themselves the conspiracy, were evidence of the existence of the conspiracy. Because these respondents were not proved to have taken part in these subsequent overt acts, the learned judge acquitted them, saying of one of the respondents, \u201cThere is no evidence that connects him with any of the illegal operations.\u201d\nWe are of opinion that the appeal of the Crown must succeed. Belyea and Weinraub were most active in carrying out the projects of the conspiracy; were originally united with Singer himself in the conspiracy of which the latter was found guilty. They should have been convicted as were Singer, Paddon and Ward. Their part in the illegal acts was much greater than that of Paddon and Ward, but less than that of Singer. If sitting as a jury, we should have no hesitation in finding that the illegal acts done at Windsor were a result intended by the defendants and their fellow conspirators when they formed the organizations found to have been a combine and a conspiracy. But we do not proceed on this ground, since to do so would involve making a finding of fact contrary to a finding of the trial judge.\nCounsel for the appellants argued at considerable length that the Appellate Division had exceeded its jurisdiction in this case because it reversed the trial judge on what counsel called a finding of fact, i.e., the innocence of the accused of participation in the formation of an illegal combine and of conspiracy within s. 498, Cr. C. This, it seems to us, involves a clear misconception of the true question in issue.\nHaving determined that the formation of the various organizations in question amounted to the formation of an illegal combine, and to a conspiracy within s. 498, Cr. C., the learned judge proceeded to deal with the questions as to who had incurred criminal responsibility. He convicted Singer, Paddon and Ward on evidence which, in our opinion, clearly implicated Belyea and Weinraub, in much the same manner in which Singer and his companions were involved, in the formation of the combine and conspiracy in question. He fell into error, however, when he proceeded to find that it was essential to a finding of guilt of the accused, that they should be held to have had actual knowledge of, or to have actually participated in, the overt acts at Windsor.\nMr. O\u2019Connor, somewhat ingeniously, argued that, where there is an \u201cinferred conspiracy,\u201d or an \u201cinferred combine,\u201d as he termed them, proof of the existence of which depends largely on certain overt acts, it is necessary to show privity of the accused to, or participation by them in, such overt acts, in order to make them liable for the formation of the combine or the conspiracy. This seems to us to be a fallacy. The moment it is established that a combine or conspiracy existed, it is unnecessary, in order to warrant a conviction of the appellants for the formation of the combine, or of the agreement to conspire, to show their complicity in subsequent illegal acts done by, or with the connivance of, the body against members of which conspiracy or unlawful combine is charged: provided, always, of course, that there is, in the evidence, sufficient proof of the complicity of the accused in the original formation of the combine, or in the agreement charged as conspiracy. Here, the learned trial judge apparently had already found facts from which the conclusion was inevitable that there was participation on the part of Belyea and Weinraub in the formation of the illegal combine and the conspiracy, the existence of which he had already found to be proven. On these findings, coupled with the admissions made by Belyea and Weinraub in their testimony, and the documents of which they were proved to have had knowledge, their convictions, as was held by the Appellate Division, were a necessary consequence.\nAlthough counsel for the appellants devotes one entire part of his Memorandum of Points, viz., Part 4, to alleged \u201cErrors of Fact on the Trial,\u201d i.e., errors of fact to be found in the judgment of the learned trial judge, speaking of the trial judge, he, himself, makes this formal admission, in the Memorandum, \u201cHis fact-finding was sound.\u201d His clients certainly cannot complain if they be held to this admission, especially so since it appeals to us as being, with the one exception above adverted to, entirely correct.\nUpon the material facts found by the learned trial judge, we think that manifestly his conclusion, resulting in the acquittal of the appellants, was erroneous, and that such error was the direct result of a misdirection in law.\nThe right of appeal by the Attorney-General, conferred by s. 1013 (4), Cr. C., as enacted by c. 11, s. 28, of the Statutes of Canada, 1930, is, no doubt, confined to \u201cquestions of law.\u201d That implies, if it means anything at all, that there can be no attack by him in the Appellate Divisional Court on the correctness of any of the findings of fact. But we cannot regard that provision as excluding the right of the Appellate Divisional Court, where a conclusion of mixed law and fact, such as is the guilt or innocence of the accused, depends, as it does here, upon the legal effect of certain findings of fact made by the judge or the jury, as the case may be, to enquire into the soundness of that conclusion, since we cannot regard it as anything else but a question of law,\u2014especially where, as here, it is a clear result of misdirection of himself in law by the learned trial judge. Finally,\u2014a point not raised by counsel for the appellants during his two-and-a-half-day argument, or in his Memorandum of Points, or supplementary factum, but which would seem to call for some notice from us, is this.\u2014By s. 1014 of the Criminal Code, the powers of the Court of Appeal, on hearing a criminal appeal by a person convicted, are defined. These powers, under subs. 3 are, in the event of the appeal being allowed, to\n(a) quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered; or\n(b) direct a new trial;\nand in either case (it) may make such other order as justice requires.\nThis section is made applicable on any appeal by the Attorney-General against an acquittal by the provision of s. 28, c. 11, of the Statutes of Canada, 1930, that mutatis mutandis, on the appeal thereby given, the court shall have the same powers as it has on an appeal by the accused. It does seem rather a strong thing to hold that the effect of the words \u201cmutatis mutandis\u201d is that clause (a) must be made to read, on an appeal (by the Attorney-General) being allowed, to\n(a) quash the acquittal and direct a judgment and verdict of conviction to be entered;\nyet that, apparently, was the construction put upon this provision by the Appellate Division.\nIt occurred to some members of this Court that, under such circumstances as are here present, the correct course would be to apply clause (b) and to direct a new trial. That idea, however, would seem to involve a lurking suspicion that we are, in fact, reversing the trial judge on a question of fact, whereas, in reality, we do nothing of the kind, but, on the contrary, we affirm the facts found by him, and, upon them, we reach the conclusion that the only course open to the Appellate Division was to allow the appeal and convict the present appellants, giving to the words \u201cmutatis mutandis\u201d the effect given them by the Appellate Division, which we certainly are not convinced was wrong.\nFor these reasons, we are of the opinion that the appeals fail and must be dismissed.\nAppeals dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J. Gerald Kelly.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney-General for Ontario.\n[1] [1931] O.R. 699.\n[2] [1931] O.R. 202.\n",

Newcombe J. took no part in the judgment, as he died before the delivery thereof.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nMunicipal corporations\u2014Liability in damages for failure to keep drainage ditches in repair\u2014Land Drainage Act, Man., R.S.M., 1913, c. 56, ss. 45, 46\u2014Flooding of lands\u2014Cause of damage.\nPlaintiffs claimed damages from defendant municipalities for flooding of lands caused, as alleged, by the municipalities failing to keep drainage ditches in repair.\nHeld: Plaintiffs could not recover from the municipalities because, while the municipalities would be liable for loss suffered by their failure to keep the ditches in repair, yet it was not shewn that any of the damage suffered arose from such failure; rather, it appeared that the damage was due to the unprecedented character of the rain storms, the inadequacy of the drainage system (for which the municipalities could not be held liable) to drain lands lying as low as those of plaintiffs, and the damming of the main ditch by the other defendants. (Judgment of the Court of Appeal, Man., 39 Man. L.R. 214, on this ground affirmed.)\nThe Land Drainage Act, R.S.M., 1913, c. 56, ss. 45, 46, imposes on a municipality the legal obligation of keeping the ditches, constructed under the Act, within its border in repair, and an action for damages lies, at the instance of any person for whose benefit the obligation is imposed, for loss sustained by failure to perform it. A different legislative intention is not indicated by the provision for the Municipal Commissioner to keep in repair on the municipality\u2019s failure to do so, or by the history of the legislation.\nHistory of the legislation in question, and the principles as to liability of municipalities for non-performance of statutory duties, reviewed and discussed. Groves v. Wimborne, [1898] 2 Q.B. 402, at 415-416; Mersey Docks Trustees v. Gibbs, L.R. 1 HX. 93, at 110; City of Vancouver v. McPhalen, 45 Can. S.C.R. 194, and other cases, cited.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], which reversed in part the judgment of Adamson J.[2]. The action was for damages for loss of crops and injury to lands from flooding. The plaintiff Maytag was the owner of the lands damaged, the plaintiff McMurdo was his tenant, and the other plaintiffs were sub-tenants. The lands are situated in Drainage District No. 5, part of which district is within the rural municipality of Hanover and part within the rural municipality of de Salaberry. The lands were flooded in July, 1928, and it was claimed that the damage sustained was the result of negligence of the defendant municipalities in failing to keep in repair (as, it was claimed, they were required to do under the Land Drainage Act, R.S.M., 1913, \u0441 56, ss. 45, 46) certain drainage ditches, and the negligence or wrongful act of the other defendants in obstructing the flow of water in the main drainage ditch by constructing blocks or dams therein.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported.\nThe trial judge, Adamson J., allowed the plaintiffs damages against all the defendants, which damages he assessed at $2,750, and he directed that the same be apportioned and paid by the respective defendants as follows: by the R.M. of Hanover, $1,412.50; by the R.M. of de Salaberry, $506.25; by the other defendants, $831.25.\nUpon appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of the defendant municipalities, dismissing the action as against them, but dismissed the appeal of the other defendants, adjudging that the plaintiffs recover from them the sum of $831.25 in accordance with the judgment of Adamson J. The cross-appeal of the plaintiffs to have the amount of the damages increased was dismissed.\nThe plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. (Leave to do so was granted by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba).\nBy the judgment now reported, the appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nH. M. Hannesson for the appellants.\nH. V. Hudson K.C. for the respondent, Rural Municipality of de Salaberry.\nJ. B. Haig for the respondent, Rural Municipality of Hanover.\nNo one for the other respondents. Lamont J.\u2014The plaintiffs brought this action to recover damages from the defendants for injury to certain lands and loss of crop thereon caused by the flooding of the lands in the early part of July, 1928, which flooding, the plaintiffs allege, resulted from (1) the neglect of the defendant municipalities to maintain and keep in repair, as required by statute, the drainage ditches protecting and serving the lands in question, and (2) the wrongful act of the individual defendants in obstructing the flow of water in the main drainage ditch by constructing a dam therein.\nThe plaintiff Maytag is the owner of the lands in question, namely, sections 2, 13 and 23 in Tp. 7, R. 4, E. of the principal meridian; while the plaintiff McMurdo in his tenant, and the plaintiffs Friessen and Thiessen are sub-ten-ants. These lands are situated within Drainage District No. 5, part of which district is within the R.M. of Hanover, and part within the R.M. of de Salaberry. The drainage works affecting these lands are:\n1. Ditch \u201cA\u201d running east and west, which is the main ditch, approximately 24 feet wide and built on the south side of the road allowance which divides the rural municipalities of Hanover and de Salaberry; the R. M, of de Salaberry being to the south. The easterly four miles of this ditch is wholly within the R. M. of Hanover. The ditch was intended to take care of the surface waters coming from Tourond Coul\u00e9e or swamp, which is a large watershed about four miles long stretching southeast, the mouth of which is crossed by Ditch \u201cA,\u201d about the west part of section 36-6-4E. Opposite the place where the waters of the coul\u00e9e entered the ditch, a dyke or embankment, three or three and a half feet high, had been raised on the north side of the ditch to intercept the waters and turn them westward along the ditch.\n2. Ditch \u201cD\u201d parallel to Ditch \u201cA\u201d and three miles to the north.\n3. Ditch \u201cD5\u201d commencing a short distance north of Ditch \u201cA\u201d and running north on the road allowance to Ditch \u201cD.\u201d 4. A ditch called the \u201cSouth Lateral\u201d three miles east of Ditch \u201cD5\u201d, running north and south and connected with the east end of Ditch \u201cD.\u201d\nThese ditches were built by the Government of Manitoba in 1907, and were intended to have, and did have, a capacity of a peak load of 25 or 26 cubic second feet. At the time the ditches were built the country was practically unsettled. With the settlement of the country, however, the cultivation of the land, and the construction of roads and ditches, the flow of the waters into the watershed was greatly accelerated and the volume thereof was also augmented by the Davidson drains, which drained an additional 100,000 acres.\nDuring the last of June and the first part of July, 1928, the section of the country in which Drainage District No. 5 is situate, was subjected to unprecedented rains which were particularly heavy on July 4, 5 and 6. According to the Meteorological Department, the rain falling on July 6 amounted to 1.61 inches, while the total rainfall for June was 3\u215d inches, and for July 4.44 inches. Witnesses state that it was the worst flood in forty-seven years. By July 7 the watershed, of which the mouth was Tourond Coul\u00e9e, was full. Ditch \u201cA\u201d was full and overflowing, but the dyke and the dump of the road on the north side of Ditch \u201cA\u201d were preventing the bulk of the waters from Tourond Coulee from continuing their natural direction to the northwest, with the result that the waters followed the ditch westward for a distance of half a mile and then flowed over it to the southwest on to the lands of the individual defendants. To save their crops from being drowned out, these defendants, on July 7, built a dam across Ditch \u201cA\u201d just west of the mouth of the coul\u00e9e, and also cut a number of openings five or six feet wide and two or three feet deep in the dyke and road grade, so that the water would be able to cross the ditch and the road and continue its natural course to the northwest. The distance of the most easterly of these cuttings from the most westerly was 100 to 150 feet, and one witness testified to seeing a volume of water, 100 feet wide and 5 feet deep, pouring over the road. Some of these waters in the natural course of events would have crossed Ditch \u201cD5\u201d, but the R. M. of Hanover, in order to protect its road grade along the ditch, built up its road, which it had a right to do. This also had the effect of sending more of the water north on to section 23, the most northerly of the plaintiffs\u2019 lands.\nAs to the effect of the damming up of Ditch \u201cA\u201d, we have the evidence of the plaintiff McMurdo, who gave the following testimony:\u2014\nQ. The flooding didn\u2019t take place until after that dam was put in. Now is that correct?\nA. Yes, that is right.\nQ. There was no flooding until after the dam was put in? In 1928, and that is correct?\nA. Yes, surely that is right. Yes.\nThen we have the evidence of Bowman, Chief Engineer of the Provincial Reclamation Branch of the Department of Public Works, and Affleck, District Engineer, who testified that the result of the failure of the municipality to keep the ditches in repair was to lessen their efficiency by 50 per cent. They also gave this further important evidence, that even if the ditches had been properly maintained at their original capacity, they would have been able to take care of only one-tenth of the water coming upon these lands during the flood conditions that existed in July, 1928.\nOn July 11, the R. M. of Hanover blew up the dam which the individual defendants had erected in Ditch \u201cA\u201d, and the evidence is that immediately thereafter the water began to subside. The water, however, had been lying on the plaintiffs\u2019 lands for a sufficient length of time to ruin their crops. The learned trial judge found in favour of the plaintiffs against all the defendants and fixed the loss by flooding at $650 for section 2, and $2,000 for section 23. In addition he allowed $100 for some small items. He held that there was a legal obligation on the defendant municipalities to keep the ditches in proper repair and that they had failed to do so. He also held the individual defendants liable for the damage caused by their blocking up of Ditch \u201cA.\u201d The loss he apportioned as follows: to the individual defendants $831.25; to the R. M. of Hanover $1,412.50; to the R. M. of de Salaberry, $506.25. No apportionment was made among the plaintiffs, as they had informed the court that they would agree among themselves as to their respective shares of any damage awarded. On appeal the Court of Appeal maintained the judgment as against the individual defendants, but reversed it as against the rural municipalities on the ground that it had not been proved that the flooding was due to the failure of the municipalities to maintain the ditches in repair.\nBefore us the main question was as to the liability of the municipalities, under the existing legislation, to maintain the ditches in proper repair, and we were urged to determine that question.\nThe statutory provisions upon which the plaintiffs rely are sections 45 and 46 of the Land Drainage Act, R.S.M., 1913, cap. 56. They read as follows:\u2014\n45. Where a drainage work does not extend beyond the limits of one municipality, it shall be maintained and kept in repair by such municipality in the manner provided for in this Act, and if such municipality fail to do so the Municipal Commissioner may do, or cause to be done, everything necessary to maintain and keep in repair such drainage work, and collect the expense thereof from such municipality from time to time by levies made in accordance with \u201cThe Municipal Commissioner\u2019s Act.\u201d\n46. Any drainage work constructed under the provisions of this Act, or any Act or Acts for which this Act is substituted, which is continued through more than one municipality, or which is commenced in one municipality and continued thence into any other municipality or municipalities, shall, after the completion thereof, be maintained by the former municipality from the point of commencement thereof to a point at which the drainage work crosses the boundary line into another municipality and by every other municipality in like manner through or into which the drainage work is continued, at the expense of the lands in any way assessed for the construction thereof and in the proportion determined by the Minister in his report and assessment for the original construction of the work; and for the purpose of collecting the cost of such maintenance each and every municipality interested shall have all the powers and authority for the levying and collection thereof against the lands liable therefor, as aforesaid, as provided for the levying and collection of ordinary municipal rates by \u201cThe Assessment Act\u201d and amendments thereto, and, in case of default by any such municipality, the Municipal Commissioner may do or cause to be done everything necessary to maintain and keep in repair such drainage work, and collect the expense thereof from such municipality from time to time by levies made in accordance with \u201c The Municipal Commissioner\u2019s Act.\u201d\nI do not find any difference in meaning between the phrase \u201cshall be maintained\u201d in section 46 and \u201cshall be maintained and kept in repair\u201d in section 45, and the question is, do these words impose upon a municipality the legal obligation of keeping the ditches within its border in repair, and, if so, does an action for damages lie at the instance of an individual injured by the failure of the municipality to perform that obligation? It is now well established that the liability of a public body to a person injured by the non-performance of a statutory duty, must, in each case, in the last resort, depend upon the intention of the legislature to be gathered from the statute \u201cas a whole, interpreted in the light of such circumstances as may properly be considered, and according to the canons of construction properly applicable.\u201d Duff J., in City of Vancouver v. McPhalen[3].\nLiability for an omission to do something depends entirely upon the extent to which a duty is imposed to cause that to be done. It may be that the statute clearly imposes the duty or it may be, as pointed out by McCardie J., in Rex v. Marshland Smeeth and Fen District Commissioners[4], that the statute indicates with reasonable clearness that there shall be no civil remedy at all for a person injured by a breach of the statute, or it may be that the statute provides a particular method, otherwise than by action, of claiming damages for breach of the statutory duty. In each case the statute must be examined to ascertain the legislative intention. There are, however, certain general rules which, I think, are applicable to all eases. One is that laid down by Vaughan Williams, L.J., in Groves v. Lord Wimborne[5], where his Lordship says:\u2014\nWhere a statute provides for the performance by certain persons of a particular duty, and some one belonging to a class of persons for whose benefit and protection) the statute imposes the duty is injured by failure to perform it, prima facie, and, if there be nothing to the contrary, an action by the person so injured will lie against the person who has so failed to perform the duty.\nAnother is the rule of construction stated by Blackburn J. in Mersey Docks Trustees v. Gibbs[6], as follows:\u2014\nIn the absence of something to shew a contrary intention, the legislature intends that the body, the creature of the statute, shall have the same duties, and that its funds shall be rendered subject to the same liabilities as the general law would impose on a private person doing the same things.\nThe leading authorities on the point involved in this action, in so far as the liability of the municipalities for non-feasance is concerned, were all reviewed in this court in the case of City of Vancouver v. McPhalen[7]. In that case the statute, in the interest of the public of which the plaintiff was one, imposed a duty upon the municipality to keep its streets in repair. In going along the sidewalk the plaintiff tripped over a loose plank and was injured. The municipality was held liable on the ground stated in the head-note, as follows:\u2014\nWhere a municipal corporation is guilty of negligent default by nonfeasance of the statutory duty imposed upon it to keep its highways in good repair, and adequate means have been provided by statute for the purpose of enabling it to perform its obligations in that respect, persons suffering injuries in consequence of such omission, may maintain civil actions against the corporation to recover compensation in damages, although no such right of action has been expressly provided for by statute, unless something in the statute itself or in the circumstances in which it was enacted justifies the inference that no such right of action was to be conferred.\nOther instructive authorities are the recent cases of Blundy, Clark & Co. v. L. & N.E. Ry. Co.[8] in which the English authorities are again reviewed, and Pierce v. Rural Municipality of Winchester[9], in which the municipality was held not to be liable for the non-repair of its drains under section 740 of the Municipal Act, as the plaintiff was not a person for whose benefit the duty of maintaining the ditch in repair was imposed on the municipality.\nIn the case before us the statute provides for the maintaining of the ditches by the municipality, in clear and explicit language. They are to be maintained for the benefit of the owners of the lands of the drainage district in which the lands are situate. The owners of these lands have, therefore, a special and particular interest beyond the rest of the public in having the ditches maintained, and provision for the securing of adequate means for that purpose is to be found in the statute. If, therefore, the plaintiffs, as the owners of the lands in question or the crops thereon, have suffered loss by the non-performance by the municipalities of their statutory duty, they are, in the absence of anything in the statute shewing a contrary intention, entitled to maintain an action of damages for such loss.\nIs there anything in the statute from which a contrary legislative intention can reasonably be inferred?\nTwo matters are suggested, first, that the statute provides that in case of failure by the municipality to keep the ditches in repair the Municipal Commissioner may maintain them and collect the expenses from the municipality, and second, that the history of the legislation justifies the inference that it was not intended to impose liability on the municipality. I shall deal with these two together.\nBy the Act of 1893 the responsibility for both the construction and the up-keep of drainage ditches rested upon the municipalities and it was expressly enacted that the municipality should be liable in pecuniary damages to the person who, or whose property, was injuriously affected by the municipality\u2019s neglect or failure to keep the drainage works in repair. It was, however, soon apparent that many of the municipalities were unequal to furnishing the money required for necessary drainage purposes and that in many cases a district which it was advisable to drain by a single drainage system was not confined to the lands of one municipality. The Legislature, therefore, in 1895, repealed the Act of 1893 and created drainage districts which commonly included lands in several municipalities. In these districts the drains were constructed by the Provincial Government but at the expense of the lands of the drainage districts, through debentures issued against them. The amount for which each piece of land was liable was fixed by the Minister of Public Works in proportion to the estimated benefits accruing to each from the construction of the works. No provision was made in the Act for maintenance after construction, and the only connection the municipality had therewith was the collection of the debenture indebtedness from the lands burdened therewith.\nApparently realizing the futility of constructing drainage ditches by the Government unless these ditches were kept in reasonable repair, the Legislature, in 1898, imposed the duty of maintaining them upon the municipalities, they being doubtless considered as the most convenient instrumentality at hand for the purpose. The Act, however, provided that the cost of these repairs should be borne by the lands of the drainage district, and it authorized the municipality to levy and collect the pro rata share which the lands situate in the municipality should bear. In its practical working out the legislation did not secure the maintenance of the ditches. In his evidence Mr. Bowman, speaking of the provision imposing the duty of maintenance on the municipalities, said that the clause in the Act had been a dead letter ever since it had been enacted; that the municipalities generally had not carried it out for the reason that they had neither the men nor the equipment to do so. He pointed out that the maintenance of the larger ditches called for dredging machinery which the municipalities did not have. Generally speaking, therefore, where the ditches had been repaired, the repairs had been made by the Reclamation Branch at the request of the municipalities. Whether it was because this state of affairs existed in 1913, or for some other reason, the Legislature in that year amended the Land Drainage Act by adding to sections 45 and 46 the clause giving the Municipal Commissioner a discretionary right to make the repairs.\nAlthough the Act of 1893 contained an express provision giving a right of action for breach of the statutory duty to repair, and the Act of 1898, which reimposed the duty upon the municipality, contained no such express provision, and although the amendment of 1913 gave discretionary power to the Municipal Commissioner to make necessary repairs, I am unable to see in these or any other statutory enactment any indication of a legislative intention that the municipality was not to be held liable for breach of its duty to a person for whose benefit the ditches were to be maintained, and who was injured by such breach. The Act of 1893 was repealed and the drainage system entirely altered by the Act of 1895. The imposition, in 1898, of the duty to maintain the ditches constructed by the Government under the new system was a new obligation placed upon the municipalities which carried with it a liability to the individual, unless something to the contrary appeared. In the legislation of 1898 nothing is found indicating an intention that the municipalities were not to be subject to that liability. In enacting the amendment of 1913 the Legislature had an opportunity of relieving the municipalities from the duty of maintenance and placing that obligation on the provincial government. This it did not do. All it did was to give the Municipal Commissioner a discretionary power to repair if the municipalities failed to do so. Even when the Commissioner exercised his powers and made repairs he was authorized to collect the expense thereof from the municipalities. This, to my mind, is very far from indicating a legislative intention that the municipalities were to be relieved from liability to an individual injured by their failure to perform their statutory duty. In my opinion, therefore, the municipalities are liable for loss suffered by their failure to maintain these ditches.\nWhat portion of the plaintiffs\u2019 loss due to the flooding of their lands resulted from the omission of the municipalities, or either of them, to maintain the ditches in repair?\nIn determining this question we must take into consideration the unprecedented character of the rainfall. Mr. Mueller, the Reeve of the R. M. of Hanover, testified to losing half of his crop, and other farmers testified to losing a considerable part of theirs, as a result of the rains\u2014without any flooding from the ditches. The learned trial judge held that 25 per cent. of the damage was due to the rain alone. Then we must consider the evidence of the engineers that even if the ditches had been in proper repair they could not have carried off more than 10 per cent. of the water during the flood. The municipalities cannot be held liable for the inadequacy of the drainage system. In view of the evidence of the plaintiff McMurdo that, while without the flood he would have lost a certain percentage of his crop due to the rains, the bulk of his loss was due to the flood, and his evidence that there was no flood until after Ditch \u201cA\u201d had been blocked up and a passageway for the waters of Tourond Coul\u00e9e cut across the road; and in view of the finding of the trial judge that, after the damming up of Ditch \u201cA,\u201d \u201cpractically all the water from the coul\u00e9e went north over the plaintiffs\u2019 and other lands while the dam was in, and very little water went down Ditch \u201cA,\u201d from the coulee,\u201d it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the flooding, and therefore the damage, was due to the damming of Ditch \u201cA,\u201d the inadequacy of the drainage system and the unprecedented character of the rain storms, rather than to the non-repair of the ditches. How could the non-repair of Ditch \u201cA\u201d possibly cause the plaintiffs any damage? From the time the dam was erected by the individual defendants until it was blown up on July 11, it could make no difference to the plaintiffs whether the ditch was out of repair or in repair, the waters from the coul\u00e9e could not flow down it on account of the dam. Yet these were the very days in which the damage was done by the flood waters lying on the plaintiffs\u2019 land, and the evidence is that immediately the dam was taken out the waters began to go down. The plaintiffs\u2019 action, therefore, so far as it is founded upon the failure of the municipalities to keep Ditch \u201cA\u201d in repair, must fail, and, as that ditch is the only one within the municipality of de Salaberry, the action against that municipality should be dismissed on that ground alone. Apart from that, however, I agree with the judges of the Court of Appeal in thinking that the plaintiffs have not shewn that any of the damage which they suffered arose from a failure to keep the ditches in repair. Much damage had already been done by the rains but, in my opinion, the evidence is conclusive that the bulk of the damage was caused by the flood from Tourond Coul\u00e9e, caused by the damming up of Ditch \u201cA,\u201d for which the individual defendants are responsible; and by the inadequacy of the drainage system to drain lands lying as low as those of the plaintiffs.\nI also agree that there is nothing in the evidence to shew any obligation upon the Municipality of Hanover, as part of its duty to repair, to fill in the washout on the road south of section 23. The small quantity of water which in any event would get on to the plaintiffs\u2019 land through that opening, as well as the small quantity that might have been carried away by Ditch \u201cD\u201d had it been in proper repair, would be inappreciable in comparison with the volume of the flood waters which did the damage.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Hannesson & Freeman.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Rural Municipality of Hanover: Haig & Haig.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Rural Municipality of de Salaberry: Hudson, Ormond, Hudson & Spice.\nSolicitor for the respondents Audette: W.

Motor Transportation Limited and William Ledbury (Defendants) Respondents.\n1931: October 9, 13; 1932: February\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nNegligence\u2014Motor vehicles\u2014Collision\u2014Responsibility\u2014Action under Families' Compensation Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 85 (Lord Campbell's Act)\u2014Application and effect of Contributory Negligence Act, B.C., 1925, c. 8.\nPlaintiff sued for damages for her husband's death in a collision between his automobile and defendant company's motor bus, on a wet morning, on Connaught Bridge, Vancouver. The trial judge gave judgment for plaintiff, which was reversed by the Court of Appeal, which dismissed her action (44 B.C. Rep. 24). She appealed.\nHeld (Anglin C.J.C. and Cannon J. dissenting): Plaintiff's appeal should be dismissed. Deceased was himself guilty of negligence, and the evidence did not establish negligence, in the bus driver.\nThe question arose whether or not, deceased being guilty of negligence contributing to the accident, plaintiff's action was maintainable under the Families' Compensation Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 85 (\" Lord Campbell's Act\"), having regard to the Contributory Negligence Act, B.C., 1925, c. 8. The judgment of the majority of the court, without deciding the question, assumed, for purposes of the judgment, that the action was maintainable.\nPer Anglin C.J.C., dissenting: On the evidence, both deceased and the bus driver were equally guilty of negligence causing the accident, the fault of each being in driving at a speed which, under conditions existing, was excessive, and the effect of which continued right down to the impact. A case was thus made for the application of the Contributory Negligence Act. That Act is applicable to cases under the Families' Compensation Act for the purposes both of enabling plaintiff to maintain an action under the latter Act notwithstanding contributory negligence of deceased, and of providing for apportionment of the liability for damages; and as, in the present case, the evidence did not satisfactorily establish degrees of fault, the liability should be apportioned equally, and defendants held liable for one half the damages found.\nPer Cannon J., dissenting: On the evidence, the bus driver was guilty of ultimate negligence, in that prior to the impact he did not do everything reasonably required of him to avoid the possible consequence of deceased's loss of control of his car; and the judgment at trial in plaintiff's favour should be restored.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , which reversed the judgment of D. A. McDonald J. in favour of the plaintiff (and of the infant children of the deceased, on whose behalf also she sued) in an action for damages for the death of the plaintiff's husband in a collision which occurred about 8.40 o'clock a.m. on September 1, 1929, on Cannaught Bridge, Vancouver, between his automobile and a motor bus of the defendant company which was driven by the defendant Ledbury. The Court of Appeal set aside the judgment of D. A. McDonald J., and dismissed the plaintiff's action. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs, Anglin C.J.C. and Cannon J. dissenting.\nE.F. Newcombe K.C. for the appellant.\nR. L. Maitland K.C. and W. A. Riddell for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.) was delivered by\nLAMONTJ\u2014The one question in this appeal is, was there evidence on which the trial judge could find the respondents guilty of negligence causing the death of the late A. F. Price, the plaintiff's husband? The injuries received by Price resulted from a collision between a 29 passenger bus belonging to the respondents the B.C. Transportation Limited, driven by the respondent William Ledbury, and a Star touring car driven by Price. The collision took place on Connaught Bridge which connects the north and south shores of False Creek\u2014an arm of the sea\u2014in the city of Vancouver. In the middle of this bridge is a swing span or draw, which opens to permit the passage of water traffic. This span is 264 feet long and the bridge is a little over 57 feet wide. On each side of the bridge is a steel hand railing, 4feet high. Next to the railing on each side is a side-walk, 6 feet 9 inches in width, then a roadway for vehicular traffic, 8 feet 9 inches wide. On the inside of each roadway there is a steel parapet consisting of three horizontal steel girders, 2 feet 4 inches in thickness, with flat steel bar lattice work in between. These parapets extend to a height of from 15 to 20 feet and continue throughout the entire span. In the centre of the span on the top of these parapets is the bridge tenderer's house from which he commands a view of the span. The space between these parapets is 21 feet 6 inches wide and on this space two street car tracks have been laid. It is common ground that if there were no street cars passing along this space both busses and motor cars travel between the parapets. Also that at the time of the accident the bridge was very slippery and it was raining heavily.\nAs the trial judge pointed out, the plaintiff in this case is in the unfortunate position of having to rely upon the evidence of the respondent Ledbury for an account of the manner in which the accident actually happened, as well as of the occurrences immediately preceding it. The deceased, Price, did not recover consciousness after receiving his injuries, and no one, so far as the evidence discloses, other than himself and Ledbury, saw the accident.\nLedbury's story shortly is, that he was on his way north to the Canadian Pacific Railway depot to pick up his passengers and had to cross Connaught Bridge; that when he reached the centre span, there being no traffic on the bridge, he took the inside route on the east side; that he had his right wheels between the most easterly street car rail and the easterly parapet, and his left wheels between the rails of the most easterly track; that when he got to the centre of the span or a little past he saw an automobile coming towards him which was then approximately about 200 feet from the north end of the span but, as it was on the westerly car track and there was room for them to pass each other, he kept on; that when he got almost to the end of the span another car, which he had not seen before, pulled out to the left from behind the automobile, apparently with the intention of passing and getting into the span ahead of it; that it got almost alongside of the automobile when its driver\u2014who later was found to be Price\u2014noticed the bus approaching and evidently put on his brakes to check his speed and get back behind the automobile, with the result that Price's car, which was a light Star touring car, commenced to skid and also to come over to the east. Ledbury says that when he saw the Star turn out he took his foot off the accelerator and put it on the brake; and when he saw it skidding in front of him he applied his brakes, but, notwithstanding the application of the brakes, the bus \" went right on a certain amount ahead \"; that, as the Price car was now over on his side, he realized that a collision was inevitable if he kept going on, so he turned his wheel to the left and \" tramped on everything \" he had in an attempt to get clear but, just as he turned, the impact took place. As to what happened to the Star car he had no knowledge, but he himself with his bus shot ahead and went over the west side of the bridge and fell 50 feet to the flats below. The bus alighted upside down with Ledbury underneath. Fortunately he was not killed but he spent two months in the hospital.\nThe trial judge found that Ledbury had been guilty of negligence causing the accident and gave judgment for the plaintiff. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice M. A. MacDonald dissenting[2] .\nThe learned trial judge states the reasons for his finding as follows:\nI cannot blame him at the immediate moment before the accident for having decided to turn to the right or to the left. One has not the time to give it proper consideration. Nevertheless I fix him with liability in this case and on this ground. I think his car was out of control shortly before the time of the impact. He himself states that even on that day and under those conditions and on that street and with that bus at fifteen miles an hour he could stop in from thirty to thirty-five feet. Later on in his cross-examination, he went further and said that even at twenty-five to thirty miles an hour he could still stop on that street, on a wet street within thirty to thirty-five feet. Now, if so, and accepting his own evidence, in my opinion he ought to have and he could have stopped his car when he saw Price turn out, as Price had a right to do, or at least he ought to have slowed his car down and he could have done so on his own evidence, to such an extent that he had it under absolute control, and if he had done either, I am satisfied that this accident would not have happened. None of the judges of the Court of Appeal found any evidence to support the view that the bus was \"out of control\" shortly before the impact and, in my opinion, there is no evidence upon which that finding can be upheld. I am also unable to agree with the learned trial judge that Price had a right to attempt to pass the car in front of him at the entrance of a narrow passageway (21 ft. 6 inches) without first ascertaining that there would be room to get by, which there would not be if either a bus or a street car were crossing the span to the north and opposite the automobile. The distance from each parapet to the nearest street car rail is 3 feet 3 inches. The rails of the street car are 5 feet apart, which is also the width of the devil strip. Ledbury says the automobile was running with its right wheels just over the westerly street car rail, and that he had his bus in the same position on the east side. The distance between the east and west street car rails is 15 feet. The bus was 8 feet 8 inches wide, while the width of the automobile, although not stated in the evidence, would not be less than 6 feet. With the right wheel of each vehicle just over the street car rail on their respective sides, it is clear that there would be no room for the Star car to get between them. To attempt to pass while both were approaching the entrance of the span, without first seeing that the road ahead was clear, was not the part of a prudent or cautious man.\nPrice being guilty of negligence contributing to the accident, the question arises whether or not the plaintiff's action is maintainable under the Families' Compensation Act. Without deciding the question I will assume that it is.\nIn his dissenting judgment Mr. Justice M. A. MacDonald said:\nAppellant's driven was not called upon to take precautions (beyond ordinary care in driving) until deceased's car drifted' over to his side of the road. He was not obliged to take precautions when he saw deceased turn out to pass the car in front of him as that manoeuvre could and should be executed without danger to any one. If it could not, it should not have been attempted.\nI agree that Ledbury was not called upon to act when he saw the Star car turning out to pass unless it was so close to him as to make a collision probable. Ledbury had\" a right to expect, as he says he did expect, that on seeing the bus the driver of the Star car would check his speed and pull back behind the automobile. It was, therefore, only when he became aware, or should have become aware, that Price did not intend or was not able to get back into line that Ledbury had the duty cast upon him of taking whatever steps he could to avoid a possible collision. The learned judge also said:\u2014\nAfter the deceased skidded in front of the on-coming bus, however, he was helpless: he could not do anything to avoid the accident. His original negligence was exhausted. Only one person could avoid it, viz., appellant's driver fifty or sixty feet away. By his own evidence, as stated, he might easily have stopped within that distance\u2014he said he could stop in thirty or thirty-five feet\u2014and if he had done so the accident would not have occurred.\nAssuming that the bus and plaintiff's car were 50 or 60 feet apart at the time Ledbury realized there was danger of a collision, I am, with deference, of opinion that the conclusion that he had that distance in which to stop his bus is not warranted. It is based on the assumption that Price's car was not skidding south to meet him. Ledbury says it was. The pavement was wet, the car was equipped with hard pressure tires which skid more easily than balloon tires. According to Ledbury the rear end skidded south until the front was pointing east. The question is, at what rate was it skidding south? If it was going south as fast as the bus was going north Ledbury did not have 50 or 60 feet in which to stop his bus, but only 25 or 30 feet. If the Price car was skidding south at a faster rate than that at which the bus was going, he would not have even that distance. Now, it is a well known fact that cars do sometimes skid rapidly and by skidding turn completely around. There is absolutely no evidence as to the rate of speed at which Price's car was skidding south and, in the absence of such evidence, it is, in my opinion, impossible to say that Ledbury, after becoming aware of the danger, could have stopped his bus in time to avoid a collision.\nOn the argument before us, counsel for appellant also contended that there was evidence from which an inference could be drawn that the bus was being driven at an excessive rate of speed. Ledbury says he was driving across the span at 20 or 21 miles per hour; that when he saw Price's car turn out to pass the automobile, it was about 100 feet from the north end of the span. At that moment he was still in the span but almost at the end of it; that he slowed his car to 15 miles per hour; that when he saw Price's car over on the car track on which he was driving, he applied his brakes and had, he thinks, practically stopped before the impact. Ledbury, it is true, makes a number of inconsistent statements: for instance, in one place he states that when the impact took place his bus was half in and half out of the span. In another place he says the collision took place 50 or 60 feet north of the span. He says in one place that at 15 miles per hour he could have stopped the bus in 30 or 35 feet, and, in another place, that at 25 or 30 miles per hour he could have stopped it in 35 feet.\nFortunately, however, we are in a position to fix by independent evidence some of the more material points bearing upon the accident. We have the evidence of Bennett, the bridge tenderer, who heard the crash of the collision while in his house, and immediately looked out. The trial judge accepted Bennett's testimony and we must give it full effect. Bennett did not see the collision, but when he looked out he saw the Star car turning around to the left and it finished by facing in a southerly direction, having made a complete circle. He also saw the gray bus which was on the devil strip. His evidence is:\u2014\nThe COURT: Q. You saw the Gray bus travelling along, going north? \u2014 A. Yes, towards the west side of the road.\nQ. How far, having regard to the west street car tracks? \u2014 A. It travelled right from the east side to the west side, or I might say, from the centre of the span to the west side of the street. When I saw it first it was in the centre of the span.\nQ. Had it got off the span?\u2014A. I wouldn't say whether it was just at the outside edge of the span.\nQ. Just get it clear when you saw it first?\u2014A. It had just gone off the span and travelled to the west side of the road.\nQ. Then pointing north?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And as from east to west where was it, say, with reference to the devil strip?\u2014A. It was on the devil strip when I saw it.\nQ. When you first saw it?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Then what happened?\u2014A. It travelled right to the west side of the road, and the girder-work took it from my sight.\n***\nQ. Did you observe the roadway, the surface of the bridge, rather. Did you look to see if there were any marks on it?\u2014A. Oh, yes, casually I glanced round.\nQ. Were there any marks?\u2014A. I didn't see any marks whatever\u2014oh, yes, I saw where the Star car had swung around.\nQ. Where was that, on the west or east side of the bridge?\u2014A. Around about ten feet away from the gate, lower down on the span on the north end.\nQ. And how far from the sidewalk?\u2014A. About six or eight feet. Bennett's evidence fixes definitely the place of impact at about 10 feet north of the span. This accords with the statement of Ledbury that at the moment of the impact his bus was half way out of the span\u2014his bus being 29 feet long. It establishes also that the Star car spun around to the left and ran against the steel buttress at the end of the west parapet, throwing Price to the sidewalk. At this time the bus was on the devil strip going northwest.\nThen we have the evidence of Caulfield, who, at the time of the accident, was walking north on the sidewalk of the bridge with a Mr. Hill, since deceased. Caulfield says the bus entered the span well over on its own side and was travelling at an ordinary rate of speed. He says he heard a crash and climbed through the girders to the inside of the span to see what had happened. He saw the Star car turn around and then come to \"the west side of the span at a kind of an easterly triangle next the roadway.\" It struck the north end of the parapet on the west side of the bridge, throwing a man to the sidewalk, and bounced back in a northeasterly direction, a distance of 6 feet; that at this time the front of the bus was about the middle of the west street car track and was to the north of the Star car.\nAs the impact took place ten feet north of the span and prior to the time when Bennett saw the bus on the devil strip pointing northwest, and as the Star car swung clear around in a circle to the west side of the bridge, the manner in which the impact took place may, in my opinion, be reconstructed with reasonable certainty. Two witnesses were called by the plaintiff to give their views as to how it must have occurred. The first was K. S. Patrick, the plaintiff's father and a civil engineer. He testified that he had examined the Star car three days after the accident and found that the right fender had been crushed in and the hood dented on its right side and the engine and everything underneath was badly pushed back. He said that he figured the Star car was going southeast and, from the markings on the hood, the bus must have been going north and a little to the east, for the car was hit on the right\u2014hand front corner. His evidence is:\u2014\nQ. That is your theory? \u2014 A. Yes.\nQ. The left side of the front of the bus hit the car on the right-hand corner in front? \u2014 A. There is no doubt about this part of it. Q. Swinging the Star car around to the left in a complete circle? \u2014 A. Yes.\nQ. And the bus proceeding beyond the other car further north and to the west side? \u2014 A. That is the only way it can be explained. ***\nOn cross-examination Patrick said that after the impact the bus would be \"going northwest but more to the west I fancy.\"\nThen we have the evidence of Alexander Bell, a police officer who was at the scene of the accident a few minutes after it occurred and who came to certain conclusions as to how the accident happened from seeing the condition of the Star car and from questioning the people who were present when he arrived, and also by questioning Ledbury in the hospital.\nHe gives the following testimony:\u2014\nQ. From your deductions there from what you saw, the Star car had skidded in front of the bus? \u2014 A. It looked that way.\nQ. Would you draw that conclusion? \u2014 A. In my opinion both cars the bus was travelling on the street car tracks and the car that Price was driving was coming south on the street car tracks, too, and skidded right in front of it, and went over running east, and he got hit a glancing blow.\n***\nQ. Your idea is the Star car skidded before it was hit and was pointing nearly east? \u2014A. Yes, and then carried clean around until the front end was facing south.\nNo witness saw the marks on the bus where it came in contact with the Star car, for, as soon as Ledbury was removed from under it, the owners had it taken away by a wrecking crew as the tide was coming in.\nViewing the evidence as a whole, I think the reasonable conclusion is that Ledbury saw the Star car turn out to pass the automobile when it was about 100 feet from the north end of the span, as he says; that when Price saw the bus he realized the impossibility of passing the automobile and applied his brakes; that on applying the brakes, the pavement being slippery, his car commenced to skid and he went skidding forward and a little to the left until the front of his car was pointing east, or perhaps north of east, when it received a glancing blow either on the side of the car or on the engine from the left front end of the bus and was sent spinning around to the left, while the bus, which a moment before the impact, had been turning to the left, proceeded in a northwest direction until it went over the edge of the bridge. Ledbury's suggestion that the right half of the bus hit the right half of the Star car is not consistent with the facts established by Bennett and other witnesses and must, in my opinion, be disregarded, as I think we must disregard the statement he makes in one place that, just prior to the impact, his front end was facing west. His statements as to what occurred just at the time of the accident shew that he had no clear recollection of the events, and that perhaps is not to be wondered at. He admitted that in the hospital he had been trying to work out in his mind how the accident must have occurred, and it may be that in endeavouring to reconstruct the final scene he failed to keep clear and distinct the line of demarcation between what he actually remembered and what, in his enfeebled condition, he imagined must have happened. As I read Ledbury's testimony, it is not that of a man who is wilfully endeavouring to mislead the court, but is that of a man who, until the moment his mind became affected by the agony of the collision, has a clear recollection of what actually happened, but who from that time has only a confused remembrance of the events which took place, and says so, but in answer to questions states what he thinks happened. Weighing his evidence upon that footing or even disregarding his entire testimony from the moment he became aware that Price was not able to get his car back into line behind the automobile, I am unable to find any evidence that he was at any time driving at an excessive rate of speed.\nThen can any inference be drawn from the events which happened? Taking Ledbury's statement, from which he has never varied and upon which no doubt has been cast, that the Star car turned out to pass the automobile when it was about 100 feet from the north end of the span and that at that time he \" was in the span almost coming out\" or \" practically at the end of the span,\" as he says in another place, we know that Price travelled 90 feet to the point of impact, while the bus travelled the 10 feet from the end of the span plus the distance the front of the bus was back from the north end of the span, at the moment Price turned out. The bus, therefore, must have travelled a much shorter distance than the Star car to the point of impact. The relative distance travelled by the two vehicles supports Ledbury's statement that he had slowed down considerably, and it may be that he had practically stopped, for who can say that if a light car (weighing only 1,190 pounds), skidding rapidly on wet asphalt, comes against a five and a half ton bus almost stationary, the impact would not produce the same result as we have in this case so far as the Star car is concerned? To my mind the result of the collision is just as consistent with the rate at which Ledbury says he was driving as with the suggestion that he must have been going much faster.\nIn my opinion the decision of the Court of Appeal was right and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN, C.J.C. (dissenting).\u2014I have given this case very thorough consideration, having read every word of the record through once at least, most of it twice, and some parts of it, notably the testimony given by Ledbury, three or four times. After carefully digesting the evidence of Ledbury, I am satisfied that he is an utterly unreliable witness, either because of a disinclination to tell the truth, or, more probably, because of inability to recollect the material facts due to his physical condition immediately following the accident. Of this witness, I take much the same view as did the learned trial judge, who appears to have accepted his testimony only when given against himself, or when corroborated, or entirely in accord with facts otherwise proved. In my opinion, therefore, the proper course will be to examine this case on the independent testimony and on Ledbury's evidence where he makes admissions against his own interest, or where his statements are fully corroborated and also, where they are wholly consistent with facts, either admitted, or otherwise satisfactorily proved.\nAdverting to the reasons given for the judgment of the Court of Appeal[3] , I find that of the majority, who allowed the appeal, Macdonald, C.J.B.C., contented himself with stating that \"there is no evidence upon which a judgment can be supported.\" Martin, J.A., merely agrees in allowing the appeal, giving no reasons for his conclusion. Only two judges of the majority give reasons\u2014McPhillips and Galliher, JJ.A. The former said, \"the onus probandi rested upon the plaintiffs to make out their case beyond any reasonable doubt\"[4] . With respect, there is here a clear misdirection (Cottingham v. Langman[5] of himself by the learned judge, practically at the outset of his judgment, on a vital point. He applies to this civil case a rule applicable exclusively to the Crown's case in a criminal prosecution. (Clark v. The King[6] . The learned judge assumes all the facts as deposed to by Ledbury in the defendant's favour. He even goes further. For instance, he says,\u2014\nThe motor car was, when first seen, upon its proper side following another motor car and when the vehicles were somewhere about 50 or 60 feet apart the deceased driving the motor car turned out to pass the motor car ahead of him, etc.\nalthough Ledbury himself says that he did not see the deceased's motor while it was following the preceding car nor, indeed, until it was turning out to pass the preceding car, and adds that there was then about \" 100 feet \" between \" the end of the span \" and the car which preceded the deceased's motor car, which would imply that there must have been well over 100 feet between his omnibus and the deceased's motor car at that time. This latter fact is also asserted in the respondent's factum. From the assumption thus made, the learned judge draws the inference that\nthe driver of the motor bus was placed immediately in the \" agony of collision \" and he vainly in an attempt to avoid a collision turned sharply to the west\u2014but in so doing struck the motor car a glancing blow on its right side.\nThe learned judge continues:\nthe motor bus, in thus attempting to avoid the motor car, mounted the board walk which runs along the west side of the bridge and crashed through the bridge rail,\nignoring the all-important fact, that the omnibus actually went through the bridge rail at a distance of 86 feet north of the point of collision, as will presently appear.\nHaving thus dealt with the facts, the learned judge proceeds:\nUpon these facts must be gleaned some sufficient piece of evidence which can reasonably establish that the driver of the motor bus was reasonably at fault and was guilty of some negligence that can be said to have been the proximate cause of the accident or rather was it upon all the facts inevitable accident produced by the conduct of the driver of the motor car? Mr. Justice Galliher would seem to have based his judgment largely on Ledbury's discredited evidence. Upon it he finds as a fact that Ledbury\nrealized it was getting dangerous when the other car continued coming over in front of him and not straightening out at a time too late to take effective action.\nSpeaking of Ledbury's evidence as to his ability to stop within thirty to thirty-five feet under the circumstances then existing, when going 15 (or even 25) miles per hour, he says:\nHis answer as to stopping within 30 to 35 feet at 15 miles an hour should not be taken with regard to the situation as it had arisen as deposed to but that if called upon to come to a stop ordinarily under the condition of the pavement that morning he could do so in that distance.\nHe adds that\nif liability cannot be fixed upon Ledbury on his own testimony then I consider no case is made out by plaintiff.\nHe finally bases his judgment largely on\nthe view that the learned judge below misconceived the effect that should be given to the answer as to the distance in which Ledbury could have stopped his car.\nOf course, if one should assume all the facts to be as deposed to by Ledbury, the appellant's case would be at an end.\nIn his dissenting judgment, Mr. Justice M. A. Macdonald refers to the testimony at some length and comes to the conclusion that, on the whole case, there was enough to warrant the finding that\naccepting the evidence of appellant's driver *** his negligence *** (was) the substantial cause of the accident.\nHe also finds that it was\nbecause of the negligent driving of the deceased that his car skidded or drifted in front of the motor bus,\nbut, he adds, that after that happened \" he was helpless \" and the only person who could have avoided the accident was the \" appellant's driver (then) fifty or sixty feet away.\" He holds the latter bound by his answer that, on the occasion in question, \" he could stop in thirty or thirty-five feet\" and finds that\nhe negligently adopted a course which did not prevent the accident, a course which if successful would allow him to proceed without loss of time (and there was some slight evidence that he was in a hurry) whereas he might have adopted another course, viz., to stop, that would effectually prevent it. Even if he only reduced his speed the impact would be slight.\nIt is common ground that the collision occurred on the Connaught bridge in the City of Vancouver on the morn- ing of Sunday, the 1st of September, 1929, about 8.40 o'clock, between a Star car driven by Price, the deceased, and a motor bus of the defendant company in charge of one Ledbury.\nThe precise point at which this collision occurred is, however, in dispute, the appellant claiming it was at the exit from the swing span and within the arms or uprights of the latter, the defendants claiming that the actual place of impact was some fifty feet north of that point. The only satisfactory evidence on this particular matter is given by Bennett, of whom the learned trial judge says that he accepts his evidence,\u2014\nI am satisfied, from a view, that Bennett saw what he testified to having seen.\nThe learned judge had, by consent, taken a personal view of the bridge.\nBennett, the bridge tender, who was in his house situated above the middle of the bridge, although he did not see the actual collision at the moment of the crash, tells us that his attention was immediately drawn to the colliding cars. On going down to the bridge below he found marks upon the surface of the bridge indicating where Price's Star car had spun around immediately upon its being struck by the oncoming bus. These marks were at a distance of about 10 feet north of the northern upright of the bridge and indicate fairly closely the actual point of impact. This evidence was substantially corroborated by Caulfield, who said:\nQ. Then what is the next thing you know of the accident? \u2014A. Well, the next thing we heard was the crash. We did not see it.\nQ. What did you do?\u2014A. We went right through the girders into the centre of the span.\n***\nQ. What did you see?\u2014A. At that time the Star car was coming like this, making this turn, and it hit some portion of the bridge and it came back; at that particular moment the man Price went out.\nUpon this evidence, I find as a fact that the impact occurred at a point about 10 feet to the north of the swing span, or draw, of the bridge and some 86 feet south of the place where the motor bus eventually crashed through the rail on the west side, at a point by actual measurement 96 feet north of the north end of the draw-span. Ledbury in at least two places confirmed this view when, in his examination for discovery, he said:\nQ. Did it come into the draw?\u2014A. Yes, it came into the draw. It faced me, and I was paying too much attention to the other car at the time being and I didn't really notice it, but it came into the draw anyway\u2014because he was coming into the draw, and this other car went to go around him to get into the draw\u2014\n***\nand again,\nQ. You were clear of the draw, weren't you, before the impact?\u2014A. I wasn't quite clear of the draw. Half of the car was outside the draw.\nIt is also common ground that, prior to the accident, the motor bus was going north and the Star car going south.\nThe rate of speed of the motor bus, however, is not conceded. Ledbury admits he may have attained a speed of 21 miles per hour:\nQ. Will you swear positively you were not going more than 20 miles an hour?\u2014A. I won't swear positively I was not going more than 20 miles an hour. I might have been going 21 miles an hour.\nOn the other hand, the witnesses, Caulfield and Philp, both called for the defence, do not attempt to fix the precise speed. Caulfield, however, said:\nQ. Cars on the bridge usually travel pretty fast?\u2014A. Pretty sharp. They all do.\nQ. You have observed that yourself?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Was this bus at the time you saw it, holding its own with the general rate of traffic?\u2014A. I don't know. It was travelling no faster than they do when the bridge is full of traffic.\n***\nQ. What speed do they maintain?\u2014A. Across the bridge as best they can, I suppose.\nQ. But you are a man that has observed cars on the bridge, apparently. Do they travel rapidly, or very slowly on the bridge?\u2014A. I don't know. They travel no faster on that bridge than they do on any ordinary highway, I don't suppose.\nBennett gave the following evidence:\nQ. Did you hear anything before you heard the crash?\u2014A. I might say just prior to the crash something came along at what I term a good rate, a high rate of speed.\nThe COURT: Q. You mean by the sound of the engine?\u2014A. Yes, the sound it made at the end of the span. We have cover plates that cover the gap over, and when anything hits that it gives a severe jar. I heard that and then the smash of the crash. That is what brought it to my mind that it was travelling very quick.\n***\nMr. SINNOTT: Q. I am not quite clear, Mr. Bennett, about the large bus. Was that the bus from which you heard the sound?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Was there any other bus there?\u2014A. There was nothing else. I didn't see any other on the street at all.\n***\nQ. But does a heavy vehicle going fast make a different noise to a heavy vehicle going slowly?\u2014A. Yes, it gives a different jar.\nMr. MAITLAND: Q. His lordship has put a suggestion now and I presume that your lordship means that you are going to have a view.\nThe COURT: Yes. Mr. MAITLAND: Q. Then you can demonstrate that to his lordship when he is there, can you?\u2014 A. If we get an example while we are there, you will recognize it yourself.\nUpon the whole case, I am satisfied that Ledbury had actually attained a sped of between 23 and 25 miles per hour and that the Star car was coming towards him about equally fast.\nThere is not a little controversy as to whether or not there was a third car immediately preceding the Star car when Ledbury first looked in its direction. Ledbury speaks of the Star car as turning out behind the other to pass it. It is extraordinary, if this be so, that there is not any corroborative evidence of the presence of this third car. Bennett, Caulfield and notably Philp were each in a position to see such a car, if it were there; but no one of them told of having seen anything of such a car on the bridge at any relevant time. Apart from Ledbury's testimony, there is no evidence whatever of the presence of a third car and, if required to decide upon this issue, I would certainly determine that the presence of this car had not been established.\nMy own idea is that, when giving evidence, Ledbury really thought two cars had been approaching him prior to the accident. That may be accounted for in this way,\u2014 when he first looked he saw only one car, which was in fact the Star car coming straight towards him, at a distance of about 350 feet. His failure to recognize it as such may have been due to the heavy rain then falling, or to his paying insufficient attention to it at the time. When he again looked he saw a car coming towards him at an angle, at a distance of 100 feet beyond the end of the span, and, as he thought, beginning to skid towards his side of the bridge. This was, undoubtedly, the Star car. He is not pressed to say what became of the alleged preceding car after it passed him at about the entrance. He has no idea what became of it. Brooding over the matter during his more than two months in the hospital, as he admittedly did, when he says,\nThe way I had it figured out in the hospital, I had it doped out ***\nhe gradually began to think, and eventually firmly persuaded himself, that he had seen two cars where, in fact, there was only one, which he had noticed in two different positions. But, for the purpose of this judgment, I shall assume that there was a car immediately preceding the Star car, as stated by Ledbury. The case appears to have proceeded on this footing and appellant's counsel at bar seemed to be ready to accept it as correct. If so, it would seem reasonably clear that Price turned out to pass the other car, much as Ledbury says. Ledbury also says that he was paying close attention to this leading car and did not see the Star car following, as he admittedly should have done had he been looking carefully ahead.\u2014\nQ. Why didn't you see the second car?\u2014A. I don't know. I guess I was not looking for it.\nOf this state of facts, however, we have only Ledbury's evidence, there being no other witness. Otherwise, the only way one could account for Price being on the wrong side of the road and in front of the bus, as Ledbury alone says he was, would be that his car had skidded, not improbably on the greasy tram rails, and that it was already out of control when Ledbury says he saw it skid over in front of him.\nWe also have the fact conclusively proven that the motor bus crashed through the west railing of the bridge at a distance of 96 feet from the north end of the north girder of the draw and about 86 feet to the north of the point of impact and fell some 50 feet to the creek below, Ledbury being imprisoned in it.\nIt is also common ground that the bridge was in a very dangerous condition that morning, owing to the first rain of the season having fallen. The pavement of the swing span of the bridge was very slippery, it being made of wood blocks (\" the portions north and south being covered with asphalt\"), so much so that Philp admits these facts. He adds:\nQ. And 25 miles an hour is not a safe rate of speed at which to travel over that bridge under those conditions?\u2014A. Not under those conditions.\nIt is true that, only three questions further on, in answer to the court, Philp said:\nThe COURT: Q. But if anybody was going 25 miles, would you say that was too fast?\u2014A. No, if there was no traffic on the bridge.\nBut this only serves to show the facility with which this witness can accommodate his answers to momentary exigencies. Speaking of the dangerous condition of the bridge on the morning in question, and of the difficulty of driving motor cars occasioned by it, Ledbury himself says:\nQ. What is your average general rate of speed when travelling over the bridge, when you are driving the motor bus?\u2014A. Very seldom over 20 miles an hour, but on really dry pavements we can go 25.\nQ. I suppose your reason for that is that it is rather dangerous driving faster than 20?\u2014A. Very dangerous. It isn't too bad when it is dry, but it is a very dangerous bridge when it is wet.\nQ. So proceeding fast on that bridge would be a dangerous matter on a wet pavement?\u2014A. Yes, yes.\nQ. And it would be particularly dangerous on that portion of the bridge known as the draw\u2014the draw bridge? \u2014A. The span, yes.\nAnd also,\nQ. What condition was the bridge in that morning?\u2014A. Well, that bridge is always a bad bridge on a wet morning. Everybody knows that, that has driven over there.\nand again,\nQ. Question 154. I asked you \" At 15 miles an hour it is very easy to control the speed of the car\u2014with your steering apparatus and your four\u2014wheel brakes?\u2014A. Well I don't know. I doubt it, on that morning, if you could control a car at five miles an hour. You would have difficulty in controlling it to any extent\u2014the control was beyond any person on account of the condition of the bridge that morning.\" Now you said you could not control your car at 5 miles an hour. Is that right?\u2014A. Well, you may have misunderstood me in that statement.\nQ. What is your explanation of it now?\u2014A. My explanation is that I would not\u2014with the condition of the roadway that morning on that bridge, at 5 miles an hour I would not be able to bring my car to a dead stop.\nQ. You said you could not control your car?\u2014A. That is what I meant by controlling.\nQ. At 5 miles an hour you could not bring your car to a dead stop?\u2014A. No.\nThe COURT: Q. You say you could not bring it to a dead stop at 5 miles? What do you mean by that?\u2014A. I mean to say at 5 miles an hour even if you put your brakes on right there, you will skid.\nQ. You mean you cannot stop instantly?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You mean within a foot or two?\u2014A. Yes, within a foot or two.\nand,\nQ. Do you mean to say that a bus cannot, in an emergency be pulled up on these wet pavements of Vancouver, within a distance of 100 feet, or that they are going to skid 80 to 100 feet in an emergency application of the brakes?\u2014A. No, I didn't say so.\nThe COURT: He has already answered that; at 15 miles an hour under these conditions that morning, he could stop in 30 or 35 feet.\nMr. SINNOTT: Yes.\nThe COURT: Then what is the good of pressing it?\nThere is also no dispute that, after describing one complete circle (if not two), the Star car either plunged forward or, still gyrating, struck the draw of the bridge at the north end on the west side and rebounded about 6 feet northward. Caulfield, a very careful witness, deposed to this, and his evidence must be accepted as reliable.\u2014\nQ. You left the sidewalk?\u2014A. We left the sidewalk and went right into the centre of the span.\nQ. Through the girders?\u2014A. Yes, through the girders, into the centre of the span. And as soon as we done that\u2014\nQ. Did you look up the span?\u2014A. We looked up the span.\nQ. What did you see?\u2014A. At that time the Star car was coming like this, making this turn, and it hit some portion of the bridge and it came back; at that particular moment the man Price went out.\nThe COURT: I don't quite get that.\nMr. HUTCHESON: He said it hit a portion of the span, sir, hit a portion of the span, and then went back.\nThe WITNESS: Jumped back as it hit the span, it came back.\nThe COURT: Q. At the north?\u2014A. At the west side of the span.\nQ. And the north end?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. But when you say it jumped back, it jumped towards the west?\u2014A. No, the car came to the west side of the span at a kind of an easterly triangle next the roadway.\nLedbury gave this evidence:\nQ. Draw a line from the nose of his car.\u2014A. He came about here.\nQ. Mark that \"P\" again please.\u2014A. Yes. Then I saw right away that there was no chance, that I would have to hit him. There was no chance of stopping because on account of the wet pavement I knew; he is almost practically in front of me then.\nThe COURT: Q. Are your wheels locked now?\u2014A. No. Then I tramped on everything I've got and swung my wheel right over to the left like that.\nMr. MAITLAND: Q. That would put your car trying to shoot her over to the west?\u2014A. Yes.\nThe COURT: Q. Did you notice that other car any more?\u2014A. No. I never paid any more attention. I don't know where this car went to at all. My vision went all on this car. I swung right over to the left, and just as I turned my wheels, I just had my wheels turned like that, bang he went like that. That is all I know.\nMr. MAITLAND: Q. Well, now, how was the Price car travelling?\u2014A. Well, I would not like to say at what speed or anything like that. He was travelling\u2014the first car was coming towards me just as fast as I was going, if not faster, and he must have been going a little bit faster to try and get around this car into the span.\nLedbury attempts to account in this way for the fact that the bus ran some 86 feet after the impact before plunging into the creek. He says:\nQ. What happened to your car then, do you know?\u2014A. Yes. I felt my end come around almost, and the next thing that loomed up in front of me was the railing of the bridge. The railing of the bridge was practically almost facing me, maybe at a slight angle.\nQ.As your car came right around, or swung, that is what you mean?\u2014A. Yes. Q. In what direction were your wheels pointing?\u2014A. Well, my front wheels would be to the west, but not directly west. I imagine it would not be directly west.\nQ. And then what happened?\u2014A. Well\u2014\nQ. You went over the railing?\u2014A. No. Well, I went over the railing I will admit, but I tried to save myself going over the railing, and to try and save himself when a person gets into a skid, the first thing any driver would do would be to take his foot off the brakes, step on the gas and try and take his car out of the skid.\nQ.That gives you better control?\u2014A. Well, that does not give me better control. It gives me control to try and get her out of the skid.\nQ. Why could you not straighten her out?\u2014A. Because the wheels appeared to be locked.\nQ. What did that?\u2014A. The impact I imagine.\nQ. The collision?\u2014A. Yes. The way I had it figured out in the hospital, I had it doped out, that the fender must have caught on the wheel and held the wheel and I could not bring it back.\nBennett, who, as already stated, was explicitly found by the trial judge to be a very satisfactory witness, and whom we can entirely believe, said:\u2014\nI saw the Gray bus travelling along, and then there was a blind space in the girder work. Ordinarily I should have seen it again.\nThe COURT: Q. You saw the Gray bus travelling along, going north?\u2014A. Yes, towards the west side of the road.\nQ. How far, having regard to the west street car tracks?\u2014A. It travelled right from the east side to the west side, or I might say, from the centre of the span to the west side of the street. When I saw it first it was in the centre of the span.\n***\nQ. Just get it clear when you saw it first?\u2014A. It had just gone off the span and travelled to the west side of the road.\nQ. Then pointing north?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And as from east to west where was it, say, with reference to the devil strip?\u2014A. It was on the devil strip when I saw it.\nQ. When you first saw it?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Then what happened?\u2014A. It travelled right to the west side of the road, and the girder-work took it from my sight.\nQ. And when you caught it again where was it?\u2014A. I thought to myself the thing is gone. It is a most mysterious disappearance. And we have a door on the side, and I opened the door, and there was nothing there, just a gap in the hand rail.\nQ. Where was that gap in the hand rail in regard to the Star car, north of it?\u2014A. North of it, yes.\nQ. How much?\u2014A. About 100 feet. The Star car was right down by the end of the span.\nQ. You saw it turning?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And then it faced north?\u2014A. Faced south.\nQ. Came right around, making a complete circle?\u2014A. Yes. Of course, I am not saying directly south. I wouldn't say directly south, but approximately.\nQ. No, no, but approximately?\u2014A. Yes.\nMr. SINNOTT: Q. I am not quite clear, Mr. Bennett, about the large bus. Was that the bus from which you heard the sound?\u2014A. Yes. Q. Was there any other bus there?\u2014A. There was nothing else. I didn't see any other on the street at all.\n***\nMr. SINNOTT: Q. If any vehicle entering the draw at the north end that morning at that particular time when the bus was there, could it have escaped being hit?\u2014A. That I can't say. According to the position of the bus when I saw it there was no room for anything else.\nCaulfield evidently did not see the bus until later as he only speaks of it as \"facing west and east,\" about the time it crashed through the railings.\nDealing with the question of his speed before and at the moment of the impact, Ledbury says:\nQ. Did you say you maintained a speed of 15 miles an hour until you struck this car driven by Price?\u2014A. No, no.\nQ. You cut down your speed before that?\u2014A. My nose was just at the end of the span.\nQ. Then you were going less than 15 miles an hour when you collided with Price?\u2014A. Oh, yes.\nQ. And much less than that?\u2014A. Oh, yes.\nQ. How much less would you be going than 15?\u2014A. I had practically stopped I guess.\nQ. When you struck Price?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Almost stopped when you struck Price?\u2014A. Yes.\nLedbury was not pressed to say why, if his car was \"practically stopped\" at the moment of the impact, he did not allow it to rest there, but \" tramped on everything \" he had. Ledbury himself, in his earlier evidence, had, in fact, contradicted his statement that his car had \"practically stopped\" before the impact when he said:\nQ. Draw a line from the nose of his car.\u2014A. He came about here.\nQ. Mark that \"P\" again please.\u2014A. Yes. Then I saw right away that there was no chance, that I would have to hit him. There was no chance of stopping because on account of the wet pavement I knew.\nLedbury had, unguardedly perhaps, admitted that his bus was going \" about 15 miles an hour *** right at the moment of the impact.\" He, almost immediately afterwards, made the statement that I have quoted above from his evidence, viz., that he had \"practically stopped,\" etc. But, when one looks at his testimony given elsewhere in the book, it is apparent that his possibly unguarded admission was nearer the truth. Thus, he says on discovery:\nQ. Now, before the impact, did you apply your brakes?\u2014A. Yes, absolutely, my wheels were locked.\nQ. Which brake did you apply?\u2014A. My air brake.\nQ. Your air brake?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. That is the four\u2014wheel brake?\u2014A. That is the brake we always use. Q. Did you apply your emergency brake?\u2014A. No, I didn't need to, because that is absolutely no good under those conditions.\nQ. What made you apply your brakes?\u2014A. Well, I seen that he was coming towards me.\nQ. Yes, and how far were you from the other car when you applied your brake?\u2014A. Well, he was\u2014he had just turned out and he was in front of me when I applied the brake.\nQ. Mr. SINNOTT: When you applied the brake?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And your car didn't stop?\u2014A. No.\nQ. It carried right on?\u2014A. Yes, it carried on a certain amount ahead.\nQ. And you struck the other car? \u2014A. He struck me\u2014or we both struck together\u2014there was no argument about that.\nQ. You both came together?\u2014A. Yes.\nOn examination-in-chief at the trial, he said:\nQ. Mark that \"P\" again please.\u2014A. Yes. Then I saw right away that there was no chance, that I would have to hit him. There was no chance of stopping because on account of the wet pavement I knew; he is almost practically in front of me then.\nThe COURT: Q. Are your wheels locked now?\u2014A. No. Then I tramped on everything I've got and swung my wheel right over to the left like that.\nMr. MAITLAND: Q. That would put your car trying to shoot her over to the west?\u2014A. Yes.\nThe COURT: Q. Did you notice that other car any more?\u2014A. No. I never paid any more attention. I don't know where this car went to at all. My vision went all on this car. I swung right over to the left, and just as I turned my wheels, I just had my wheels turned like that, bang he went like that. That is all I know.\nAnd, on cross-examination:\nQ. Well, you had ample time; you were only travelling at 15 miles an hour; what explanation have you got to offer now for doing what you did on that occasion.\u2014A. If he had done what I imagined he was going to do, I had ample room to pass him, the direction which I turned.\nQ. You began to calculate in your mind and figure things out for yourself? \u2014A. To a certain amount, yes.\nQ. But you did not figure out that it would be a good thing to stop your car dead at that time, at that point?\u2014A. Well no.\nQ. Don't you think that would be the most natural thing for a careful driver to have done?\u2014A. No, because I have run against the same kind of a position practically, before; other times before.\n***\nQ. You said you have\u2014A. I have seen cars doing the same thing.\n***\nQ. That is, you were travelling less than 15 miles an hour?\u2014A. About 15.\n***\nMr. SINNOTT: Q. Did your air brakes lock your wheels?\u2014A. They did at the impact, certainly.\nQ. They did not before that?\u2014A. No, because that is the reason I left the clutch out.\nThe COURT: Q. Just at the moment of the impact?\u2014A. Yes. Mr. SINNOTT: Q. So that your wheels were not locked before the impact?\u2014A. No, the wheels would not be locked.\n***\nQ. Is it good or bad practice to lock the wheels?\u2014A. It is bad practice in bad weather.\nQ. But you locked your wheels?\u2014A. Not at that time.\nQ. Later on?\u2014A. Yes.\nThe COURT: Q. You were up against it then? It did not make much difference what you did then?\u2014A. It is just a matter of putting on everything you have, and turning to try and make a miss if you can. It is just a chance, that is all.\n***\nQ. Did you shut the power off in your bus?\u2014A. No.\nQ. You never did that?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Is that not the proper practice in an emergency?\u2014A. No, no.\nQ. It is not?\u2014A. No.\n***\nQ. So then it would be considerably reduced when it was receiving no gas?\u2014A. It would not be considerably reduced because the momentum carries her.\nQ. You were travelling on your own momentum?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Without the aid of your engine at all?\u2014A. Oh, that is only for a distance of about 25 feet.\nQ. That is for 25 feet?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. What did you do at the end of the 25 feet? You were 25 feet inside the draw?\u2014A. No, I would not be 25 feet inside the draw. I would say half the bus would be over a kind of plate there, and one-half would be in the span, and one-half outside the span. Just then I would put my foot on the gas again.\nQ. What gear were you travelling in then?\u2014A. In high gear, just the same gear.\nFor my part, I do not believe that Ledbury had \"practically stopped\" his car before striking the Star car; otherwise, several facts cannot be accounted for. In the first place, one cannot account for the violent spinning around of the Star car, which, on the evidence of Caulfield and Bennett, occurred immediately after the impact. Moreover, the fact that the bus continued straight ahead, eventually turning west and crashing through the rails some 86 feet further on, is, to me, entirely inconsistent with the idea, as deposed to by Ledbury, that he had his car \" practically stopped \" at the moment of the impact. In my opinion, he had slowed down very little, if at all, and was still travelling at from 15 to 20 miles per hour at the moment of the impact.\nThe fact that the Star car afterwards either had momentum or power sufficient to cause it to run ahead about ten feet, strike the upright of the swing bridge and rebound some six feet, or that, in its gyrating movement, it swung forward sufficiently to strike the northern upright of the draw on the west side, shows that that car also had been travelling at a high rate of speed prior to the impact. This inference may be subject to some doubt\u2014greater than any that can be suggested in regard to that which I have drawn as to the speed of the omnibus. At all events, Ledbury admits that after, as the learned judge said, the Star car was \"in difficulties,\" Price did everything humanly possible to avert a collision. His evidence is:\nQ. From your description that you have given on the map, then I take it that when you realized that he was coming over\u2014do you say whether that was a skid or not, that caused him to come over in front of you; what was it?\u2014A. As a driver I would say he skidded, because my opinion would be that he saw me and he did everything I imagined he would do, or anybody else would do under the circumstances, to put on his brakes, because this car was in his way and he would have to put his brakes on to ease up his car, to get behind this car again, and I imagine him putting on his brakes that must have thrown his car over.\nQ. Was he coming towards you then?\u2014A. Yes, right in my path. He was kind of at an angle. He had just come out.\nThe foregoing circumstances make it perfectly clear to me that both cars had been travelling at a rate of speed quite unreasonable, having regard to the conditions existing on the morning in question. As my brother Smith very pertinently remarked during the argument, Price's duty to stop his car was just as clear and just as urgent as was that of the driver of the motor bus, in order to avoid the impending collision.\nWe must, however, not forget that the Star car was available for examination and inspection after the accident, whereas the bus was immediately dismantled (it may have been necessary to do so) and was put into such a condition that no inspection of it would be of any value for evidential purposes. Moreover, no one deposes to seeing any skid marks on the roadway made by the bus, whereas the marks made by the Star car, as it spun around were plainly visible to Bennett. These circumstances give rise to suspicion against the dependability of the defendants' case. In addition to this is the fact that the emergency brakes on the bus were, to his knowledge, to quote Ledbury, \"no good\" to stop the car in an emergency.\nBoth drivers would seem to have been in somewhat of a hurry on the morning in question. Macdonald, J.A., says:\n*** there was some slight evidence that he (Ledbury) was in a hurry; no doubt referring to the fact that Ledbury was due at the station at eight o'clock that morning. His story is, that on arriving at the car sheds at about 8:00 o'clock he found his bus had a flat tire. He was told he would have to wait for the mechanics to repair it and the latter took considerable time to do so; so much so that his boss, Reynolds, telephoned him to enquire the cause of delay and, upon being told of the flat tire, he instructed Ledbury to be on hand for the nine o'clock load. Reynolds was not called, as he apparently might have been, to corroborate the statement of Ledbury as to the fact, the effect and purport of the telephone communication. Philp, who gave evidence of meeting Ledbury at the garage, is not asked to corroborate him as to the time he left there. On discovery, Ledbury says that he \"was supposed to be on duty anywhere around eight o'clock *** at the C.P.R. station.\" He also says he arrived at the garage on Cambie Street \" about 7:30,\" when he found he had \" a flat tire,\" and had to wait some time before he could get a tire man to attend to it. Asked when he left the garage, he said, \"*** somewhere around about 8:30 I would imagine.\" On examination-in-chief, at the trial, he varies this statement by saying he reached the garage at \" a quarter to eight,\" and he speaks of the delay in waiting for the tire man and of Reynold's telephone call while he was waiting. As to the time of departure, he says:\nQ. What time did you leave?\u2014A. About 8.30. I am not very sure. I did not look at the clock.\nOn cross-examination he said, it was his duty to be at the C.P.R. depot \"somewhere around 8 o'clock.\" He does not say at what hour he reached the garage, but proceeds to tell of finding a flat tire, of a telephone call from Reynolds which he describes as not \"a hurry up call.\" He says it was only a call \"to find out what was wrong with me, why I was not down at 8 o'clock.\" Asked when he got the flat tire changed, he answers \"I don't know what time. I was ready to pull out about half-past 8.\" He does not fix the exact time when the tire was changed. He speaks of meeting Philp coming into the garage but said he had no conversation with him. When the accident occurred, Ledbury says he was on his way to take up his 9:00 o'clock load. As to Price, he had been at work all night and was going home on Sunday morning, no doubt, to have breakfast and rest.\nFrom the foregoing, I am satisfied that there was abundant evidence to warrant a finding of negligence on the part of the bus driver in travelling at too high a rate of speed having regard to the conditions at the time of the accident, and that that was really what prevented Ledbury from stopping and avoiding the impact. If made by a jury, these findings could not be disturbed. Such findings of a trial judge differ little, if at all, in their weight from the findings of a jury. No doubt, it is the duty of the Court of Appeal to act upon its own conclusions on questions of fact as well as of law (Coghlan v. Cumberland[7] . Stated otherwise, it is the duty of the Court of Appeal to draw proper inferences where the issue does not depend on the veracity of witnesses, and the facts are clear (per Lord Dunedin in Cooper v. General Accident, &c, Corp.[8] ; Admiralty Commissioners v. SS. Volute[9] . But, what Lord Chancellor Loreburn said, in Lodge Holes Colliery Co., Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corp[10].:\nI need not repeat what has often been said as to the advantages enjoyed by a judge who has heard the witnesses. When a finding of fact rests upon the result of oral evidence it is in its weight hardly distinguishable from the verdict of a jury, except that a jury gives no reasons. The former practice of Courts of Equity arose from the fact that decisions often rested upon evidence on paper, of which an Appellate Court can judge as well as a Court of first instance.\nstill holds good. (Montgomerie & Co. Ltd. v. Wallace-James[11] ; See Dominion Trust Co. v. New York Life Ins. Co.[12] .\nThe findings of the trial judge are expressed as follows:\n*** accepting his (Ledbury's) own evidence, in my opinion he ought to have and he could have stopped his car when he saw Price turn out *** or at least he ought to have slowed his car down and he could have done so on his own evidence, to such an extent that he had it under absolute control, and if he had done either, I am satisfied that this accident would not have happened.\nOtherwise, he is on the other horn of the dilemma, that he is mistaken as to the speed at which he was going and his car was going at such a rate of speed that, under all the circumstances, he was unable to stop or to hold it under control, so that he could stop it in the event of something coming in his way. I hold, therefore, that the defendant, the B.C. Motor Transportation Company, and Ledbury, are responsible for this accident. It will be noted that I agree with the alternative view of the learned trial judge as to \" the cause \" of the accident, viz., antecedent, disabling excessive speed. I think, however, that he was in error in ascribing the fault which caused the accident entirely to Ledbury. I think Price was, probably, equally to blame and was guilty of like fault with Ledbury, and that both should be held responsible for the consequences.\nAntecedent, disabling negligence in maintaining too high a speed may well be found, under such circumstances as existed at the time, to amount to \"ultimate\" negligence. (British Columbia Electric Ry. Co. Ltd. v. Loach)[13] . Ledbury's conduct might have amounted to \" ultimate \" negligence were it not for the fact that Price had, apparently, the same opportunity to stop as had Ledbury and the same duty was cast upon him to do so. In his case, too, his inability to stop was due to the same cause as Ledbury's, viz., excessive speed. He, too, might have been guilty of \"ultimate\" negligence, had Ledbury not been in the like plight. As the case stands, it appears to me that dangerously excessive speed on the part of both drivers was alike the cause of the inability of each to stop in time to avoid the collision; and that both cars were practically out of control at a time when, if his car had been under control, it was the clear duty of each driver to stop to avoid collision. Both appear to me to be at fault in this regard; the fault consisting in excessive speed, the effect of which, in the case of each, continued right down to the impact.\nA case is thus made for the application of the Contributory Negligence Act (Statutes of B.C., 1925, c. 8, s. 2), the case being clearly one, in the language of that statute \" where by the fault of two or more persons damage or loss is caused to one or more of them.\" The statute goes on to provide that \" the liability to make good the damage or loss shall be in proportion to the degree in which each person was at fault.\" There is nothing here to suggest that the plaintiff in the action must be one of the persons so at fault. It would seem to be enough that the defendant should be a party to whom responsibility for the fault of one or other of the persons causing the damage may be attributed.\nSomething was suggested at bar by counsel for the respondent to the effect that this statute is inapplicable to cases under Lord Campbell's Act. On examination, I cannot find anything to justify this contention. As there was no argument on the point, I am at a loss to conceive on what it rests; nor does the factum aid in this respect. But, as this question is res nova, it may not be passed over without due consideration.\nThe statute, commonly known as Lord Campbell's Act ((1846) 9 & 10 Vict., c. 93), adopted in British Columbia by virtue of Ordinance No. 70 (1867), is part of the English law introduced into that province, and deals with the situation in which the maxim ex morte hominis non oritur actio (or, as sometimes put, actio personalis moritur cum persona), was applied at common law to exclude actions for damages occasioned by the death of a person by reason of a wrongful act of the defendant.\nAt present, this statute is to be found as c. 85, R.S. B.C. 1924, ss. 3, 4 (1) and (2), and 5, of which read as follows:\n3. Whenever the death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act, neglect, or default, and the act, neglect, or default is such as would (if death had not ensued) have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, then and in every such case the person who would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured, and although the death shall have been caused under such circumstances as amount in law to an indictable offence.\n4. (1) Every such action shall be for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent, and child of the person whose death shall have been so caused, and shall be brought by and in the name of the executor or administrator of the person deceased; and in every such action the Court or jury before which the action shall be tried may give such damages as they may think proportioned to the injury resulting from such death to the parties respectively for whom and for whose benefit such action shall be brought; and the amount so recovered, after deducting the costs, not recovered from the defendant, shall be divided amongst the before-mentioned parties in such shares as the Court or jury by their judgment or verdict shall find and direct, or as may be determined by the Court upon motion for judgment or further consideration.\n(2) Provided that if there be no executor or administrator of the person deceased, or, there being such executor or administrator, no such action as above mentioned shall within six calendar months after the death of such deceased person have been brought by and in the name of his or her executor or administrator, then and in every such case such action may be brought by and in the name or names of all or any of the persons (if more than one) for whose benefit such action would have been if it had been brought by and in the name of such executor or administrator; and every action so to be brought shall be for the benefit of the same person or persons as if it were brought in the name of such executor or administrator;\n5.Not more than one action shall lie for and in respect of the same subject-matter of complaint; and every such action shall be commenced within twelve calendar months after the death of such deceased person. The presence of the condition of the right of action, i.e., that it must be\nsuch as would (if death had not ensued) have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof,\nhas been held to require that the deceased would have had an enforceable cause or right of action for the injury had he survived. To this cause of action, contributory negligence on his part would, of course, have been a defence. That being so, he could not have successfully maintained an action where contributory negligence was established, had he survived, and his personal representative or widow, etc., could, accordingly, maintain no action for damages caused by his death.\nThe ground now taken by the plaintiff is that the defence of contributory negligence being done away with by the statute of 1925 leaves the right of action under Lord Campbell's Act absolute and unqualified. In other words, the other provisions of the Contributory Negligence Act would have no application to a case under Lord Campbell's Act.\nI find nothing in the Contributory Negligence Act to exclude its application as a whole to cases under Lord Campbell's Act, which are so common. On the contrary, everything in the former statute indicates that such cases must have been present to the mind of the Legislature which enacted it.\nContributory negligence is a defence which the statute does away with, but only conditionally, the condition being that,\nwhere by the fault of two or more persons damage or loss is caused to one or more of them, the liability to make good the damage or loss shall be in proportion to the degree in which each person was at fault.\nI cannot conceive that the Legislature intended that this Act should apply for the purpose of enabling the plaintiff to maintain an action under Lord Campbell's Act, notwithstanding the establishment of contributory negligence imputable to her, and yet should not also apply for the purpose of providing for the apportionment of her damages under section 2.\nThat this case comes within section 2 is perfectly clear, the term or condition of its application thereby provided being that, where contributory negligence is shown, there shall be an apportionment of damages in proportion to the degree in which each person was at fault. Any person taking ad- vantage of the Contributory Negligence Act must do so on the terms and conditions laid down by the Legislature.\nHad there been a counterclaim, or a demand for set-off or \" compensation \" by the defendant Ledbury in respect to his physical injuries, or by his co-defendants for the loss of their bus, there would have been considerably more difficulty in applying to such a claim the provisions of the Contributory Negligence Act. Particularly is this so in view of clause (b) of the proviso to section 2, since such a claim would be made against the plaintiff in the present action, who in no wise represents the estate of the deceased Price, but brings an action for statutory damages given her by Lord Campbell's Act, which is independent entirely of any possible right of action derived from Price, although it is a condition of her right of action that her husband, had he survived, would have had a good cause of action.\nThe burden is, however, now cast on this Court to determine the proportion in which the damages sustained should be borne. Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, I deem it impossible to find that the evidence has satisfactorily established degrees of fault, with the result that the liability should be apportioned equally (section 2 (a) ). In the result, therefore, of the $24,000 damages found to have been caused to the plaintiff, she should recover $12,000, i.e., $7,500 to the mother and $4,500 to the six children in equal shares. The plaintiff is entitled to her costs in this Court; but, as the defendants were obliged to go to the Court of Appeal to escape the consequences of the more onerous judgment of the trial court, I would not disturb the order as to costs in that Court. The plaintiff is entitled also to recover from the defendants the costs of the action; subject, however, (except as to costs, if any, expressly awarded to her \"in any event of the action\" by orders of the court) to the provision of section 4 of the Contributory Negligence Act, that\nthe liability for costs of the parties shall be in the same proportion as the liability to make good the loss or damage.\nCANNON J. (dissenting).\u2014I have had the advantage of perusing the carefully prepared judgments of my Lord the Chief Justice and of my brother Lamont. With great respect, I cannot agree with either of them.\nAfter reading the evidence, I have reached the conclusion that both the respondents, the employer, and the employee Ledbury, are bound by the latter's version of the circumstances which accompanied the death of appellant's husband.\nEven admitting that Ledbury was entitled to assume that Price would observe the statutory obligation imposed by R.S.B.C., 1924, ch. 103, sec. 21, and would, after finding it impracticable to turn out to the left, \" so regulate the speed of his vehicle as to allow \" the other car, which he was trying to overtake, \" to precede him to some point on the highway where such turning-out to the left and a passing (could) safely be effected,\" the whole case hinges on the answer to the following question:\nWas the accident inevitable after Price tried to overtake the third car? Have Ledbury and his employer exculpated themselves in answer to the prima facie case resulting, in favour of plaintiff, from the fact, admitted by Ledbury, that, in order to dodge Price's car, he \" tramped on everything and swung his wheel right over to the left\" invading the other car's side of the roadway which of necessity was to be used by it, if it succeeded in coming back to its place behind the third car? Ledbury erred when he abandoned the right side of the roadway to cross over to his left, instead of stopping his car, as he acknowledges he could have done in that space and time, as soon as he realized that the other vehicle, through skidding or otherwise, was in difficulties and unable to get out of his way. The version of the accident, as given by Ledbury, the only surviving eyewitness of the circumstances leading to it, whose physical and mental conditions were such when he gave evidence, as to be acceptable, perhaps of necessity, to both parties who now rely on his testimony, shows, in my opinion, that the latter was guilty of ultimate negligence and did not do everything that could reasonably be required of him to avoid and prevent the possible consequence of Price's loss of control of his own car in his effort to get ahead of the car preceding him.\nFor the reasons given by the trial judge, and by Mr. Justice M. A. Macdonald in his dissenting judgment, I would allow the appeal with costs and re-establish the judgment of the trial judge in favour of plaintiff.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Clearihue & Straith.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Maitland & Maitland.\n[1] 44 B.C.

VII, c. 42.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 51 KB. 193) aff., Cannon J. dubitante. APPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Tessier J., and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action.\nOn the 23rd December, 1907, Joseph A. Bilodeau, the respondent\u2019s husband, took out a policy of insurance upon his life with the New York Life Insurance Company in the sum of $5,000, and the policy itself indicated as beneficiaries the wife of the assured, the present respondent, together with a daughter of the assured by a previous marriage in equal shares. The policy provided that it would lapse in the event of failure to pay the premiums within thirty days of their maturity, and would then have no cash surrender value. The assured was engaged in business, and in course of time became indebted to the appellant company to a considerable extent. On the 15th December, 1925, the assured, together with the two-named beneficiaries, executed a transfer of the policy to the appellant company to which, at that date, the assured was indebted in the sum of $7,500. During the year 1926 the assured made an authorized assignment in favour of his creditors and in the month of August, 1929, he died. The premiums of insurance payable in respect to this policy, for the last three years prior to the death of the assured, were paid by the appellant company. The insurance company, on or about the 31st August, 1929, paid to the appellant company, in virtue of the transfer above referred to, the sum of $5,026.62. In the month of October of that year, the respondent instituted proceedings against the appellant company, asking that she be declared the beneficiary under this policy and entitled to the proceeds thereof; that the transfer in favour of the appellant be declared illegal, null and void; that the payment made by the insurance company to the appellant be declared null and void; and that the appellant be condemned to pay to her the sum of $5,200.\nL. E. Beaulieu K.C. for the appellant.\nE. J. Flynn for the respondent. Anglin C.J.C.\u2014Although impressed by the views of Mr. Justice Howard in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, I find it impossible to follow him to his conclusions. To give effect to them here, I think, would be to exhibit a vacillation in the opinion expressed by this court on the subject of the scope and application of Art. 1301 C.C., which could not fail to be disastrous. We might as well at once forego any idea that the doctrine of stare decisis (Stuart v. Bank of Montreal)[2] forms part of our jurisprudence.\nAs Mr. Justice Howard, the dissenting judge in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, points out, parol evidence given to shew the true purpose and character of the instrument,\u2014 which, in form, is as absolute as a transfer can be made, and was executed by Mr. and Mrs. Bilodeau and their daughter, Marie Antoinette Bilodeau, the interest of the latter being similar to that of Mrs. Bilodeau,\u2014was clearly admissible (Rodrigue v. Dostie)[3]; although that learned judge differs from the majority in his court as to the effect of such evidence. The learned dissenting judge seems to agree, however, that this latter question depends largely on the view taken as to the meaning and effect of the testimony of the appellant Daoust. As put by him, \u201cthis document is in terms an absolute alienation\u201d by the respondent Rose-Anna Ferland (Bilodeau) of all her interest in the policy to the appellant, a document which, if intended to operate according to its form, it was entirely competent for her to execute (Laframboise v. Valli\u00e8res[4]; Banque Canadienne Nationale v. Carette[5]). However, it is open, in any case where the validity of a document is challenged on a ground of public policy (as it is here under Art. 1301 C.C.), for the person so challenging to adduce oral evidence at the trial to shew what was the true and real purpose or intention of the transaction which resulted in its being given. The respondent having pledged her oath that, when she executed the document in question, she did so on the understanding that it was to be used as collateral security to her husband\u2019s debt, and in no sense for her own benefit, and that she had, in fact, derived no benefit whatever from the transaction\u2014testimony fully corroborated, quantum valeat, by her son-in-law, Charles Caron,\u2014as put by Mr. Justice Howard,\nthere remains to be considered only the testimony of Mr. Daoust,\na small portion of which he quotes, commenting thus:\u2014\nThe respondent has analyzed it, pointing out that, though Mr. Daoust under examination-in-chief took the position that the transfer of the policy to the appellant was absolute, he admitted under cross-examination that it was in reality a transfer for security. With respect, I do not think that that is the correct conclusion to be drawn from Mr. Daoust\u2019s evidence. As I read it he maintained throughout that the transfer conveyed to the appellant the absolute ownership of the policy and that it was accepted and retained by the appellant as such. He does say that, on a subsequent occasion, Mr. Bilodeau assured him, that he would pay his debt to the appellant in full and promised to keep the policy in force in the meantime, and he adds that, if Mr. Bilodeau had done so, the policy would have been transferred back to him, because he (Daoust) was unwilling to keep what was not due to him.\n\u201cQ. Et s\u2019il vous avait pay\u00e9, je comprends que vous lui auriez remis, avec plaisir, sa police que vous d\u00e9teniez?\nR. Oui, m\u00eame s\u2019il avait pay\u00e9 les cinq mille piastres, s\u2019il avait pay\u00e9 * * * disons qu\u2019il nous devait seulement que deux mille piastres, les h\u00e9ritiers de Bilodeau auraient retir\u00e9 la diff\u00e9rence. Comprenez-vous? Je ne veux pas avoir ce qui ne m\u2019est pas du.\u201d\nI cannot see in that any admission, direct or indirect, that the transfer of the policy was anything but an absolute alienation of it.\nThe way the appellant subsequently dealt with this policy is quite consistent with its submission that the policy by the transfer became its absolute property. It is true that it did not give any tangible consideration\u2014did not pay anything\u2014for the transfer of the policy even by way of credit; it did not enter the policy on either side of the ledger in its account with Mr. Bilodeau;\n\u201cR. Il n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 comme garantie collat\u00e9rale.\nQ. Mais il n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 non plus comme paiement?\nR. Comme paiement, \u00e9videmment que non, tant qu\u2019il ne 6erait pas mort.\u201d\nPersonally, although the learned appellate judge, who dissented, declined to accept this testimony, I am prepared to do so at its face value, in accord with the view of the learned trial judge and with that of the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench. For me, these questions of the meaning and effect of Daoust\u2019s testimony and of his credibility are purely matters of fact, on which I am not prepared to reverse the judgment of the Superior Court, confirmed by that of the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nThis case resembles Banque Canadienne Nationale v. Carette[6], where Rinfret J., delivering the judgment of this court, said, En plus, la banque, dans son factum, admet \u201cque les polices d\u2019assurance en question ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es \u00e0 la Banque Canadienne Nationale par J.-Ed. Poulin, le mari de l\u2019intim\u00e9, pour garantir son compte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\u201d\nIl en r\u00e9sulte que le litige doit \u00eatre envisag\u00e9 du point de vue d\u2019un transport par une femme mari\u00e9e en garantie des dettes de son mari, et non pas, ainsi que la plaidoirie \u00e9crite l\u2019avait d\u2019abord soumis, comme un transport pur et simple d\u2019une femme mari\u00e9e en paiement des dettes de son mari.\nCette distinction est tr\u00e8s importante; car, comme nous l\u2019avons fait remarquer entre autres dans la cause de Laframboise v. Valli\u00e8res[7], \u201cl\u2019on est d\u2019accord, en effet, pour interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019article 1301 du code civil comme une prohibition \u00e0 la femme mari\u00e9e de cautionner, de garantir, de s\u2019engager pour l\u2019avenir \u2018avec ou pour son mari\u2019; et il est admis que l\u2019acte juridique ainsi proscrit par le l\u00e9gislateur est le contrat de garantie ou de s\u00fbret\u00e9. Le mot \u2018s\u2019obliger\u2019, dans cet article, doit s\u2019entendre comme indiquant seulement le contrat de cautionnement. (Lebel v. Bradin[8].\u201d Par cons\u00e9quent, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait c\u00e9d\u00e9 purement et simplement ses droits dans les polices, la question de l\u2019application de l\u2019article 1301 C.C. se pr\u00e9senterait sous un jour tout diff\u00e9rent.\nSee, too, page 39 of the Carette judgment[9], from which I take the following extract:\nCependant, l\u2019admission que les transports des polices d\u2019assurance ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par l\u2019intim\u00e9e non pas en cession pure et simple \u00e0 la banque, mais seulement en garantie collat\u00e9rale des dettes du mari, entra\u00eene comme cons\u00e9quence l\u2019application de l\u2019article 1301 du code civil en vertu duquel\n\u201cLa femme ne peut s\u2019obliger avec ou pour son mari qu\u2019en qualit\u00e9 de commune; toute autre obligation qu\u2019elle contracte ainsi en autre qualit\u00e9 est nulle et sans effet, sauf les droits des cr\u00e9anciers qui contractent de bonne foi.\u201d\nLa banque a pr\u00e9tendu que la prohibition contenue dans cet article ne visait que la garantie personnelle de la femme mari\u00e9e et ne comprenait pas la garantie r\u00e9elle. L\u2019honorable juge Lafontaine, le pr\u00e9sent juge-en-chef de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, dans la cause de Joubert et Turcotte v. Kieffer[10], a fait de cette question une \u00e9tude approfondie, \u00e0 laquelle nous ne saurions rien ajouter, et o\u00f9 il a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que par le mot \u201cs\u2019obliger\u201d il faut entendre \u201ctout engagement quelconque par lequel une femme mari\u00e9e prend \u00e0 sa charge le paiement d\u2019une dette de son mari, soit qu\u2019elle contracte une obligation personnelle, comme dans le cautionnement, ou qu\u2019elle engage ses biens seulement, comme dans le contrat d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que ou de gage.\u201d\nC\u2019est ce que cette cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la cause de Klock v. Chamberlin[11], et de nouveau dans la cause de Rodrigue v. Dostie[12].\nAs I read the facts and Mr. Daoust\u2019s testimony, they admit of only one conclusion, viz., that his company never had any absolute power over the policy, or any unqualified interest in it, but that interest was always in the nature of collateral security for the indebtedness of Mr. Bilodeau to his company. For instance, when Bilodeau became insolvent, this policy was not included as part of his estate, and in making claim as creditor, the appellant \u201cput in\u201d for the whole amount thereof, not taking anything off on account of the policy, neither making any reduction for it in the amount of its claim as presented to the assignee, nor making any reference to its being hold by the company as security or otherwise. Daoust had admitted in his evidence at the trial that \u201cit had never been applied by him in any way as a payment\u201d. I agree with the learned trial judge and with the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench that Daoust\u2019s testimony, taken as a whole, is consistent only with the appellant having had no real title to the policy in question as owner, but that it held the same always merely as colateral security for Bilodeau\u2019s debt.\nI refer again, for an instant to the judgment of this court in Banque Canadienne Nationale v. Carette[13],\nIl faut dire, par cons\u00e9quent, que les transports d\u2019assuranee dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 demande la nullit\u00e9 tombent sous le coup de l\u2019article 1301 du code civil; * * * L\u2019article 1301 du code civil a pour but la protection de la femme mari\u00e9e contre le danger d\u2019engager ses biens ou sa responsabilit\u00e9 personnelle, o\u00f9 elle pourrait se laisser entra\u00eener sous l\u2019influence de son mari ou m\u00eame par simple affection pour lui.\nIn La Banque Canadienne Nationale v. Audet[14], my brother Rinfret excludes all cases in which a married woman had been held not responsible (although she had contracted with (avec) her husband), where it was demonstrated that she had herself obtained the benefit of any advance made on her obligation (such as Banque d\u2019Hochelaga v. Jodoin[15]), and he proceeds (at pp. 307-8)\nTous ces jugements peuvent s\u2019expliquer par le motif que ces cas ne tombent vraiment pas sous l\u2019article 1301 du code civil. * * * Il est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019histoire de cette l\u00e9gislation, depuis le droit romain jusqu\u2019aux statuts ant\u00e9rieurs au code, de comprendre, par l\u2019expression \u201cs\u2019obliger\u201d de l\u2019article 1301 CC, uniquement le cautionnement de la femme avec ou pour son mari.\nCette interpr\u00e9tation est maintenant fix\u00e9e dans la jurisprudence Lebel v. Bradin, Cour du Banc du Roi[16]; Laframboise v. Valli\u00e8res[17]; Banque Canadienne v. Carette[18]. (Voir 4 Ed. VII, c. 42, qui d\u00e9clare que l\u2019article 1301 C.C. ne s\u2019est jamais appliqu\u00e9 aux achats, ventes ou \u00e9changes d\u2019immeubles, ni aux baux emphyth\u00e9otiques faits par la femme mari\u00e9e.) Il en r\u00e9sulte que l\u2019obligation de la femme mari\u00e9e pour ses propres affaires ou pour son propre compte, qu\u2019elle soit ou non commune avec son mari, n\u2019\u00e9tant jamais, \u00e0 proprement parler, un cautionnement de sa part, ne constitue pas un acte o\u00f9 elle \u201cs\u2019oblige\u201d au sens de l\u2019article 1301 C.C., et ne tombe pas sous le coup de cet article.\nI accept, as applicable to the case now before us, the following passage from La Banque Canadienne Nationale v. Audet[19], where Rinfret J., delivering the judgment of this court, says,\nLe premier \u00e9l\u00e9ment dans la pr\u00e9sente cause est que l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est port\u00e9e caution avec son mari pour la dette d\u2019un tiers en une autre qualit\u00e9 que celle de commune en biens. De ce chef, la cause para\u00eet donc de prime abord \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pos\u00e9 dans l\u2019article 1301 du code civil (Lebel v. Bradin[20].\nand also this passage, from p. 310,\nD\u2019autre part, la preuve ne laisse aucun doute sur le fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019a certainement tir\u00e9 aucun profit de l\u2019obligation qu\u2019elle a contract\u00e9e.\nIn Trust and Loan v. Gauthier[21], Lord Lindley, in giving the judgment of the Judicial Committee, said,\nExcept in dealing with their common property, she is not to bind herself with him, i.e., she is not to join in any obligation which affects him.\nand, at p. 101,\nTheir Lordships gather from the decisions referred to in the argument and in the published commentaries on the Code Civil that the words \u201cfor her husband\u201d are now judicially held to mean generally in any way for his purposes as distinguished from those of his wife; and that ignorance on the part of her obligee (cr\u00e9ancier) cannot avail him, if it is proved that she in fact bound herself for her husband. These conclusions are, in their Lordship\u2019s opinion, sound and in accordance with the language of art. 1301 and with its evident object.\nAs to the history, purpose and purport of the amendment to article 1301 C.C., enacted in 1904 (4 Ed. VII, c. 42), and said to have been passed in consequence of the judgment of the Privy Council in Trust and Loan v. Gauthier[22], I cannot do better than refer again to the following passage from the decision of this court in Banque Canadienne Nationale v. Audet[23], in which my brother Rinfret deals, entirely to my satisfaction, with that amendment and its effect. He says,\nDans la cause de Leclerc v. B\u00e9dard[24], la Cour de R\u00e9vision \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec (Dorion J.) s\u2019est demand\u00e9 quelle \u00e9tait la port\u00e9e de cet amendement. Elle fait remarquer avec justesse qu\u2019il \u201cne peut pas \u00eatre question de bonne foi lorsque le contrat prend la forme d\u2019un cautionnement par la femme de l\u2019obligation du mari. C\u2019est l\u00e0 ce qui est express\u00e9ment prohib\u00e9 par la loi.\u201d\nLorsque l\u2019obligation a \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e avec le mari, l\u2019amendement vient certainement confirmer le droit du cr\u00e9ancier de prouver que la femme s\u2019est oblig\u00e9e pour sa propre affaire. Mais ce droit avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu au cr\u00e9ancier par la jurisprudence.\nIl reste le cas o\u00f9 la femme mari\u00e9e s\u2019oblige seule avec l\u2019autorisation de son mari. Les tribunaux ont toujours annul\u00e9 cette obligation lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 \u00e0 leur satisfaction que nonobstant ses termes apparents, l\u2019obligation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 assum\u00e9e par la femme, suivant l\u2019expression du Conseil Priv\u00e9 \u201cin any way for her husband\u2019s purposes\u201d. Mais le jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans lequel cette expression se rencontre (Trust & Loan v. Gauthier)[25] ajoutait:\n\u201cIgnorance on the part of the lender that the money was borrowed for the husband\u2019s purposes is of no avail, and the burden is on him to prove that it was not so borrowed.\u201d\nLeclerc v. B\u00e9dard[26] a donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019amendement de la loi 4 Ed. VU, c. 42, s. 1, fait na\u00eetre la pr\u00e9somption que le pr\u00eat fait \u00e0 la femme s\u00e9par\u00e9e seule, quoique autoris\u00e9e de son mari, lui a profit\u00e9 \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame. Par suite, si elle invoque la nullit\u00e9 de son obligation pour violation de l\u2019article 1301 C.C., c\u2019est sur elle que tombe le fardeau de la preuve que le pr\u00eat a profiit\u00e9 \u00e0 son mari \u00e0 la connaissance du pr\u00eateur.\nThe learned judge says, at p. 312,\nLe jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi dans la cause de Lebel v. Bradin[27], dont nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 parl\u00e9, contient une \u00e9tude tr\u00e8s compl\u00e8te de toutes les questions qui se soul\u00e8vent en vertu de l\u2019article 1301 C.C., et de l\u2019amendement de 1904. Sa conclusion est que, sous l\u2019effet de cet amendement, le cr\u00e9ancier qui pr\u00eate \u00e0 la femme mari\u00e9e s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens seule, pour \u00eatre r\u00e9put\u00e9 de bonne foi, doit verser le produit de l\u2019emprunt \u00e0 la femme elle-m\u00eame, et il doit ignorer et n\u2019avoir aucune raison de croire que cet argent pourra servir les int\u00e9r\u00eats du mari. Le cr\u00e9ancier, dans ce cas, n\u2019est pas responsable si subs\u00e9quemment la femme remet les fonds emprunt\u00e9s \u00e0 son mari; car depuis l\u2019amendement il n\u2019est plus tenu de surveiller l\u2019emploi des deniers provenant du pr\u00eat qu\u2019il lui a fait.\nRinfret J. then condudes as follows:\nIl n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de dire que les d\u00e9finitions que nous venons de rapporter \u00e9puisent tous les cas o\u00f9 le cr\u00e9ancier pourra, en vertu de l\u2019amendement, \u00e9tablir une bonne foi suffisante pour sauvegarder ses droits \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la nullit\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9e par l\u2019article 1301 C.C. Mais \u00e0 la suite de ces d\u00e9finitions, l\u2019on doit s\u00fbrement d\u00e9cider qu\u2019il ne peut \u00eatre question de bonne foi dans le cas d\u2019une obligation contract\u00e9e express\u00e9ment par la femme s\u00e9par\u00e9e pour son mari. Dans le cas d\u2019une obligation contract\u00e9e par la femme mari\u00e9e seule, soit express\u00e9ment soit apparemment pour elle-m\u00eame, les droits du cr\u00e9ancier seront sauvegard\u00e9s m\u00eame si l\u2019argent est subs\u00e9quemment employ\u00e9 pour les fins du mari, lorsque les circonstances \u00e9tabliront les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de bonne foi indiqu\u00e9s par la Cour du Banc du Roi dans la cause de Lebel v. Bradin[28].\nDans le cas o\u00f9 la femme s\u2019oblige avec son mari, l\u2019amendement permet d\u2019\u00e9tablir la bonne foi du cr\u00e9ancier. Mais la loi pr\u00e9sume contre lui; et c\u2019est donc \u00e0 lui qu\u2019il incombe de la prouver. Nous ne trouvons pas, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la rencontre des \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9cessaires pour arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que rappelante peut invoquer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019amendement. D\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 furent sign\u00e9s les deux actes de garantie, elle connaissait toutes les circonstances qui entra\u00eenent la nullit\u00e9 de ces actes: le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait mari\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019un des cosignataires et le fait que son mari \u00e9tait actionnaire dans la compagnie pour laquelle elle se portait caution. Par suite, il est impossible de dire que l\u2019appelante a contract\u00e9 de bonne foi. Il s\u2019agit, bien entendu, de la bonne foi au sens l\u00e9gal et suivant le texte de l\u2019article 1301 du code civil.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Hall\u2019s view in the case at bar, who, concurring in the judgment of Mr. Justice Bond, says,\nFurther, it is, in my opinion, evident that Bilodeau always intended to pay his debt during his life time. He was perhaps over-optimistic in his expectation that he would be able to do so, because, shortly afterwards, he went into bankruptcy. Nevertheless, there is nothing to suggest that either Mr. Daoust or Bilodeau himself anticipated that the company-appellant would be obliged to hold the policy and keep it in force until the latter\u2019s death, at which time only would it acquire any definite value. This view is borne out by Mr. Daoust\u2019s own admission that he was always ready and willing to return the policy at any time on the payment of the debt, and it is further borne out by the fact that he made several demands upon Bilodeau for the payment of the premiums which matured subsequent to the assignment. He even goes so far as to say that it was agreed that the premiums should be paid by Bilodeau.\nThat agreement was entirely incompatible with Mr. Daoust\u2019s contention that his company had become the absolute owner of the policy, as a payment, rather than as security for the debt.\nIn the case at bar, being perfectly satisfied that the document in question was a violation of Art. 1301 C.C., it would never do, because of the extremely high character of the appellant Daoust, or of the patent honesty of the respondent\u2019s husband, to make an exception from the clear rule laid down by this court in Carette\u2019s case[29]. Nor will it do to say that, although stare decisis may be a good enough doctrine for the rest of Canada, it forms no part of Quebec jurisprudence and it, therefore, should not be applied in this court to cases from that province. Here, the old idea, ubi jus est aut vagum aut incertum, ibi maxima servitus praevalebit, still obtains. In my opinion, the doctrine of stare decisis must equally apply in the determination of any case which comes before this court, whatever may be the province of its origin.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss this appeal with coste Duff and Rinfret JJ.\u2014We agree with the conclusion of our brother Smith, and with his reasons. It is settled by-several decisions of this court that the ambit of article 1301 is not restricted to personal obligations; a real guaranty falls within its scope. Only one question can be regarded as susceptible of debate. That question is, whether or not the instrument of 15th December, 1925, would, but for the disability imposed by that article, have effected a transfer of the respondent\u2019s rights under the policy of insurance to the appellants, as security for her husband\u2019s debt.\nIt seems to us to be a case of res ipsa loquitur. By the policy, the New York Life Insurance Company promised to pay, on proof of the death of the husband, at the expiration of a stipulated period, the sum of $5,000, less any moneys due the company, to the respondent and to Marie-Antoinette Bilodeau, the respondent\u2019s daughter, in equal shares. By the document of 15th December, 1925, the husband, the wife and the daughter executed a transfer in these terms:\nPour valeur re\u00e7ue, nous majeurs, c\u00e9dons, transf\u00e8re et abandonne par les pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 Daoust, Lalonde et Cie de Montr\u00e9al, Carr\u00e9 Victoria, Qu\u00e9., la police d\u2019assurance portant le num\u00e9ro 4050533, \u00e9mise par la New York Life Insurance Company sur la vie de Joseph Aliace Bilodeau, de Qu\u00e9bec, Qu\u00e9., 161 Grande-All\u00e9e, ainsi que tous droits, titres, b\u00e9n\u00e9fices et int\u00e9r\u00eats qui s\u2019y rattachent ou qui r\u00e9sultent, et ce, sous r\u00e9serve des conditions de ladite police et sans pr\u00e9judice des r\u00e8gles de la compagnie.\nThis transfer, with the policy, was delivered to the appellants, to whom the husband was indebted in some $7,500, and who, thereafter, paid the premiums, and, on the death of the husband, collected the proceeds.\nLet it here be observed, that it was in virtue of the respondent\u2019s transfer of her rights under the policy to them, that the appellants were entitled to demand, and did in fact demand, from the insurance company, the moneys which, by the terms of the policy, had, in the event which happened, become payable to her. It was the transfer which enabled them to obtain payment to themselves of these moneys. It is self-evident that they must have accepted the transfer either in payment or in part payment of the debt, or as security. It is, of course, not suggested that it was given or accepted as a gift. It is, moreover, admitted, and it is indisputable, in fact, that it was not accepted as payment in whole or in part. Indeed, it is plain, on the face of the facts, that the appelants accepted the transfer with the intention of making use of it just as they did\u2014 namely, to collect any moneys which might, during the currency of the debt, become payable under the policy to any of the transferors, and to apply these moneys in payment, or part payment, of the debt. This is really not disputed. They \u2018accepted, that is to say, the transfer of the respondents\u2019 rights under the policy, as security for the payment of the husband\u2019s debt.\nIt is argued that the appellants are protected by the reservation, in the article, in favour of creditors dealing in good faith. The onus is, of course, upon the creditor who takes refuge under that reservation, to shew that the circumstances bring his case within it. Knowledge must be imputed to him of the facts appearing plainly on the face of the transaction. In the present case these included, first, the fact that the debt was the debt of the husband, and second, the fact that the rights which were transferred by the respondent as security for that debt (and of which the appelants now claim the benefit), were her personal rights. In these circumstances, and in the absence of some evidence shewing that they were under some delusion touching the actual facts, they cannot escape from the operation of the articles. It is to be noted, moreover, that Daoust was called as a witness, and that he did not state that he was ignorant of a single fact necessary to bring the transfer within the article. His defence, as put by himself, was a justly unsuccessful attempt to convince the court that he had not accepted the transfer as security.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with cost.\nSmith J.\u2014On the 23rd December, 1907, Mr. Joseph A. Bilodeau took out a policy of life insurance with the New York Life Insurance Co. in the sum of $5,000\u2014the beneficiaries named being, his wife, the respondent, and a daughter of the assured by a previous marriage.\nOn the 15th December, 1925, Bilodeau was indebted to the appellant company in the sum of $7,500, and on that date he, his wife the respondent, and the daughter Marie-Antoinette Bilodeau, joined in a transfer of the policy, which was then in fonce, to the appellant, the operative words of which are as follows:\u2014\nPour valeur re\u00e7ue, nous majeurs, c\u00e9dons, transf\u00e8re et abandonne par les pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 Daoust, Lalonde et Cie de Montr\u00e9al, Carr\u00e9 Victoria, Qu\u00e9., la police d\u2019assurance portant le num\u00e9ro 4050533, \u00e9mise par la New York Life Insurance Company, sur la vie de Joseph Aliace Bilodeau, de Qu\u00e9bec, Qu\u00e9., 161 Grande-All\u00e9e, ainsi que tous droits, titres, b\u00e9n\u00e9fices et int\u00e9r\u00eats qui s\u2019y rattachent ou qui r\u00e9sultent, et ce, sous r\u00e9serve des conditions de ladite police et sans pr\u00e9judice des r\u00e8gles de la compagnie.\nEn foi de quoi ma signature; fait ce quinze d\u00e9cembre mil neuf cent vingt-cinq.\n(Sgd.) Joseph Aliace Bilodeau,\n(Sgd.) Rose-Anna Ferland-Bilodeau,\n(Sgd.) Marie-Antoinette Bilodeau.\nIn the year 1926 the assured, Joseph A. Bilodeau, made an authorized assignment in favour of his creditors and the appellant filed with the assignee a claim for the full amount of his account, upon which the liquidator awarded him a dividend of $209.85.\nThe assured Bilodeau died in August, 1929. He had failed to pay the annual premiums subsequent to the assignment of the policy and these were paid by the appellant.\nThe insurance company paid the amount of policy to the appellant in virtue of the transfer referred to, and the respondent then brought this action, claiming to be declared beneficiary under the policy and entitled to the proceeds thereof and asking that the transfer in favour of the appellant, as against her, be declared null and void under the provisions of Article 1301 C.C., which provides as follows:\nA wife cannot bind herself either with or for her husband, otherwise than as being common as to property; any such obligation contracted by her in any other quality is void and of no effect, saving the rights of creditors who contract in good faith.\nEvidence was adduced at the trial on behalf of the respondent to shew that the real object of the transaction was to guarantee an existing debt of the respondent\u2019s husband and, on objection taken to this evidence, the trial judge held that, a matter of public order being at stake, evidence was admissible to shew the true nature of the transaction notwithstanding that the assignment was in form absolute, and this ruling seems not to be seriously challenged.\nCoupling the document with the evidence of the surrounding circumstances connected with the making and delivery of the document, and the other evidence, the trial judge held that the transfer was made to secure the debt of the husband owing to the appellant, and this finding is concurred in by four of the five judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Quebec. It seems to me that the only question involved in the present appeal is whether or not this finding should be upheld or reversed.\nI am unable to discover any ground upon which it should be reversed. Daoust himself testifies that the assignment was not made in payment of the debt or in payment of any part of it. It was not made in consideration of an extension of time for payment of the debt, and it cannot be contended that it was made as a gift to the appellant.\nWhat, then, was the object of the transfer? The appellant did not release his debt against the deceased Bilodeau, or any part of it, but retained all his rights to collect the full amount of the debt against the deceased, just as if no assignment of the policy had been made. He filed his claim with the assignee for $7,494.71, without making any mention of the policy or giving any credit on the account, by reason of the transfer to him of the policy and received a dividend on that full amount.\nIf the dividend paid by the liquidator had reduced the indebtedness to less than the amount of the moneys received on the policy, it seems clear that the appellant could not have retained the surplus as his own but would have been obliged to account for it to the assignors of the policy.\nIt is argued that he would, in such a case, have been obliged to account to the deceased Bilodeau or his estate only, and that because of having joined in the absolute transfer, the respondent would have no right to call for such accounting.\nThe transfer is made by all three parties to the policy and if it was made as a security for the account by one of these parties, it was to the same effect as to all three. It seems to me impossible to say that this single document, signed by the three parties, took effect as an absolute assignment by one and an assignment as security by the others.\nI am of opinion that the trial court and the Court of King\u2019s Bench properly found that the transfer was made by all three parties as a security for the debt of the husband Bilodeau and, that being the fact, article 1301 C.C. applies as was held by this court in La Banque Canadienne Nationale v. Carette[30]. There, as here, the transfers of four policies were absolute in terms, on their face, and imposed no personal liability on the wife. The assignee, however, admitted that they were, in fact, given as security for the husband\u2019s debt. It was because of the fact established by the admission that it was held that article 1301 C.C. applied. The only difference here is that the fact is established by evidence instead of by admission.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with oosts.\nCannon J. (dubitante).\u2014L\u2019appelante se plaint d\u2019un jugement en date du 7 octobre 1930 de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure du district de Qu\u00e9bec, confirm\u00e9, sauf le dissentiment de l\u2019Honorable Juge Howard, par un arr\u00eat de la Cour du Banc du Roi du 31 mars 1931, annulant le transport-cession d\u2019une police d\u2019assurance qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti par les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires, l\u2019intim\u00e9e et une fille de l\u2019assur\u00e9, conjointement avec ce dernier, feu Aliace Bilodeau, en son vivant marchand, de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, client de l\u2019appelante, compagnie manufacturi\u00e8re de chaussures. Le jugement annula et mit \u00e0 n\u00e9ant, quant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le transport consenti par elle en faveur de l\u2019appelante et condamna cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e la somme de $2,031.96 avec int\u00e9r\u00eat et les d\u00e9pens.\nI.\nIl serait inutile d\u2019exposer de nouveau la doctrine que cette cour a adopt\u00e9e dans plusieurs arr\u00eats: Klock v. Chamberlin[31]; Laframboise v. Valli\u00e8res[32]; Rodrigue v. Dostie[33]; Banque Canadienne Nationale v. Carette[34]; Banque Canadienne Nationale v. Audet[35]. Je ne saurais rien ajouter \u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit, et je me contente, pour \u00e9viter les r\u00e9p\u00e9titions, d\u2019y r\u00e9f\u00e9rer. Il ressort de ces d\u00e9cisions que si le transport de cette police d\u2019assurance a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, non pas en cession pure et simple \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, mais seulement en garantie collat\u00e9rale des dettes du mari, cela entra\u00eenerait comme cons\u00e9quence l\u2019application de l\u2019article 1301, en vertu duquel\nla femme ne peut s\u2019obliger avec ou pour son mari qu\u2019en qualit\u00e9 de commune; toute obligation qu\u2019elle contracte ainsi en autre qualit\u00e9 est nulle et sans effet, sauf les droits des cr\u00e9anciers qui contractent de bonne foi. Cette cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 adopt\u00e9 l\u2019opinion de l\u2019honorable jugeen-chef Lafontaine, de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, dans la cause de Joubert et Turcotte v. Kieffer[36], d\u00e9montrant que par le mot \u201cs\u2019obliger\u201d il faut entendre\ntout engagement quelconque par lequel une femme mari\u00e9e prend \u00e0 sa charge le paiement d\u2019une dette de son mari, soit qu\u2019elle contracte une obligation personnelle, comme dans le cautionnement, ou qu\u2019elle engage ses biens seulement, comme dans le contrat d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que ou de gage.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve, sommes-nous en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une renonciation de la part de l\u2019\u00e9pouse, d\u2019un abandon et d\u2019une cession de ses droits, suivant le texte du document, ou, au contraire, ce texte est-il simul\u00e9 et l\u2019intim\u00e9e a-t-elie, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, engag\u00e9 ses biens avec l\u2019id\u00e9e de retour? Avait-il \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu entre les parties que les biens transport\u00e9s devaient revenir \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e si les dettes du mari \u00e9taient par ailleurs pay\u00e9es? Enfin, l\u2019appelante a-t-elle contract\u00e9 de bonne foi?\nExaminons le dossier pour d\u00e9terminer la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ces questions dont d\u00e9pend le sort de l\u2019action.\nLe 13 d\u00e9cembre 1907, Joseph Aliace Bilodeau obtint de la New York Insurance Company une assurance de $5,000 et d\u00e9signa comme b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires sa femme s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens, la pr\u00e9sente intim\u00e9e, et sa fille, Marie-Antoinette Bilodeau, \u00e0 parts \u00e9gales, sous r\u00e9serve du droit de r\u00e9vocation, ce qui permettait \u00e0 l\u2019assur\u00e9 de d\u00e9signer un nouveau b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire aux lieu et place de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, sujet aux restrictions de la loi concernant l\u2019assurance sur la vie des maris et parents, devenus le chapitre 244 des Statuts Refondus de Qu\u00e9bec, 1925.\nUne autre condition de cette police, qui ne pouvait \u00eatre remise pour \u00eatre pay\u00e9e comptant du vivant de l\u2019assur\u00e9e (no cash surrender value), exigeait le paiement \u00e0 l\u2019avance des primes, \u00e0 peine de d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance apr\u00e8s un d\u00e9lai de trente jours.\nBilodeau, l\u2019assur\u00e9, semble avoir pay\u00e9 ses primes r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement jusqu\u2019au 13 d\u00e9cembre 1925 inclusivement. A cette derni\u00e8re date, l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait certains droits \u00e9ventuels pour une p\u00e9riode d\u2019une ann\u00e9e en vertu de la police, sujet aux conditions suivantes: 1o que Bilodeau ne r\u00e9voqu\u00e2t pas, en faveur de sa fille, ce b\u00e9n\u00e9fice \u00e9ventuel de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour la moiti\u00e9 du produit de l\u2019assurance; 2\u00b0 que l\u2019intim\u00e9e surv\u00e9c\u00fbt \u00e0 son mari, s\u2019il d\u00e9c\u00e9dait pendant l\u2019ann\u00e9e. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 1898, le statut qui permettait, contrairement au principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pos\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 1265 du code civil, \u00e0 un mari d\u2019avantager sa femme durant le mariage au moyen d\u2019une police d\u2019assurance, d\u00e9cr\u00e9tait que les polices d\u2019assurances r\u00e9gies par la loi ne seraient pas saisissaibles pour dettes dues soit par la personne assur\u00e9e, soit par la personne devant b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la police, et seraient incessibles par toutes telles personnes. La loi 61 Victoria, c 40, a permis la cession et a ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 5604 des Statuts Refondus de 1888 les mots\nL\u2019assur\u00e9 et les parties avantag\u00e9s peuvent de concert transporter la police.\nCette loi est maintenant l\u2019article 30 du chapitre 244 des Statuts Refondus de 1925.\nLe 15 d\u00e9cembre 1925, l\u2019intim\u00e9e signa le document suivant:\nPour valeur re\u00e7ue, nous majeurs, c\u00e9dons, transf\u00e8re et abandonne (sic) par les pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 Daoust Lalonde et Cie de Montr\u00e9al, Carr\u00e9 Victoria, Qu\u00e9., la police d\u2019assurance portant le num\u00e9ro 4050533, \u00e9mise par la New York Life Insurance Company, sur la vie de Joseph Aliace Bilodeau, de Qu\u00e9bec, Qu\u00e9., 161 Grande-All\u00e9e, ainsi que tous droits, titres, b\u00e9n\u00e9fices et int\u00e9r\u00eats qui s\u2019y rattachent ou qui r\u00e9sultent, et ce, sous r\u00e9serve des conditions de ladite police et sans pr\u00e9judice des r\u00e8gles de la compagnie.\nEn foi de quoi ma signature: fait ce quinze d\u00e9cembre mil neuf cent vingt-cinq.\nJoseph Aliace Bilodeau\nRose-Anna Ferland Bilodeau\nMarie-Antoinette Bilodeau\nlequel fut accept\u00e9 par la mise-en-cause et transmis \u00e0 l\u2019appelante. Comme la demanderesse-intim\u00e9e l\u2019admet, ce document constitue, \u00e0 sa face m\u00eame, une renonciation par l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 ses droits comme b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire.\nMais peut-on dire, comme elle l\u2019all\u00e8gue et comme les jugements le d\u00e9cident, que la preuve verbale faite par l\u2019intim\u00e9e et M. Daoust, pr\u00e9sident de la compagnie appelante, d\u00e9montre que cet abandon ou renonciation fut simul\u00e9 et ne fut consenti par elle que pour garantir la dette de son mari? La demanderesse, apr\u00e8s avoir all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que ce document fut sign\u00e9 et consenti sur les instances du g\u00e9rant de l\u2019appelante, a seulement prouv\u00e9, par son propre t\u00e9moignage, que son mari lui aurait dit qu\u2019il voulait sa signature pour garantir ce qu\u2019il devait \u00e0 Daoust, Lalonde et Cie. Elle ajoute que son mari lui disait: \u201cJe rembourserai et je te retournerai la police.\u201d Cette preuve verbale a \u00e9t\u00e9 admise, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019objection des procureurs de rappelante, bien qu\u2019elle sembl\u00e2t contredire l\u2019\u00e9crit sign\u00e9 par la d\u00e9fenderesse; et je crois, vu qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de l\u2019application possible d\u2019une loi d\u2019exception, mais d\u2019ordre public, que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a probablement eu raison d\u2019accueillir cette preuve testimoniale. Mais ces conversations entre mari et femme, en l\u2019absence de M. Daoust et en dehors de la connaissance de l\u2019appelante, ne sauraient lier cette derni\u00e8re, qui a simplement re\u00e7u, sans l\u2019avoir sollicit\u00e9e de son d\u00e9biteur, la police d\u2019assurance avec le transport pur et simple et l\u2019acceptation de l\u2019assureur. M. Daoust, dans son t\u00e9moignage, apr\u00e8s avoir relat\u00e9 que ce document lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9 spontan\u00e9ment par son d\u00e9biteur, a bien ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne pouvait le consid\u00e9rer comme un paiement en acompte de sa cr\u00e9ance, vu qu\u2019il n\u2019a retir\u00e9 et ne pouvait recevoir aucun argent du vivant de l\u2019assur\u00e9, mais il d\u00e9clara aussi qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 dispos\u00e9, sans y \u00eatre oblig\u00e9 par aucune convention \u00e0 cet effet, \u00e0 remettre, si sa cr\u00e9ance avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e, la police en question. Cette transaction a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par Bilodeau, qui semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 un homme d\u2019affaires scrupuleusement honn\u00eate, et par M. Daoust avec la meilleure foi du monde; et \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, l\u2019appelante semblerait avoir droit \u00e0 la protection que la l\u00e9gislature a assur\u00e9e aux \u201ccr\u00e9anciers qui contractent de bonne foi\u201d, par le statut 4 Ed. VII, c 42. Cette l\u00e9gislation, sanctionn\u00e9e le 2 juin 1904, para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 provoqu\u00e9e par l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 1301 par le comit\u00e9 judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9, le 3 novembre 1903, dans l\u2019affaire Trust & Loan Company of Canada v. Gauthier[37], o\u00f9 l\u2019on semblait d\u00e9passer les limites jusqu\u2019alors fix\u00e9es par la jurisprudence canadienne pour d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter la nullit\u00e9 des obligations de la femme pour ou avec son mari.\nEn 1926, Bilodeau fit faillite et, contrairement \u00e0 ce qui s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans la cause de La Banque Canadienne Nationale v. Carette[38] o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait admis de part et d\u2019autre que la police d\u2019assurance avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e en garantie collat\u00e9rale, la maison Daoust, Lalonde & Cie produisit une r\u00e9clamation pour le plein montant de sa cr\u00e9ance, sans mentionner \u00e0 l\u2019acquit de Bilodeau, comme paiement ou garantie, la police qu\u2019elle d\u00e9tenait. Le 13 d\u00e9cembre 1926, la police devenait caduque, \u00e0 moins du paiement de la prime dans les trente jours. C\u2019est l\u2019appelant qui, cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0 et jusqu\u2019au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Bilodeau, survenu en 1929, paya les renouvellements. L\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que ces paiements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits \u00e0 son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice et avantage, et non pas pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice et avantage de l\u2019appelante, qui a pay\u00e9 pour prot\u00e9ger ses droits en vertu du transport. Avons-nous, dans le t\u00e9moignage de M. Daoust, la preuve que la femme a cautionn\u00e9 pour son mari? Elle ne l\u2019a certainement pas fait par \u00e9crit. Ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la signature du transport, Daoust ne l\u2019a pas rencontr\u00e9e; et c\u2019est de son propre mouvement, pour satisfaire sa conscience, que Bilodeau a transmis \u00e0 l\u2019appelante, qui ne l\u2019avait pas demand\u00e9, cette police d\u2019assurance: M\u00eame en admettant comme prouv\u00e9 que le cr\u00e9ancier \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9, sans s\u2019y \u00eatre oblig\u00e9 par une convention formelle, \u00e0 remettre la police aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires apr\u00e8s paiement de la dette, pouvons-nous dire que ceci constituait une d\u00e9rogation aux termes de l\u2019article 1301 du code civil, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la jurisprudence \u00e9tablie? L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas encouru une obligation personnelle vis-\u00e0-vis de l\u2019appelante. Mais a-t-elle engag\u00e9 l\u2019avenir pour qu\u2019on puisse dire que cette renonciation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite avec esprit de retour? N\u2019oublions pas qu\u2019il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019une loi qui, en 1841, a chang\u00e9 le droit commun tel qu\u2019il existait alors. L\u2019application m\u00eame mitig\u00e9e du s\u00e9natus-consulte Vell\u00e9ien auquel on nous r\u00e9f\u00e8re avait \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9e en France sous Henri IV, en 1606, et le Code Napol\u00e9on a fait dispara\u00eetre compl\u00e8tement cette incapacit\u00e9 de la femme, tout en lui donnant le droit de se faire indemniser, s\u2019il y a lieu, soit par la communaut\u00e9, soit par son mari. La l\u00e9gislation de 1841 aurait donc fait un pas en arri\u00e8re; et cet article 1301, que nous avons conserv\u00e9 dans notre code, reste unique dans la l\u00e9gislation moderne, comme l\u2019a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 M. J. J. Beauchamp, d\u00e8s 1896, dans une \u00e9tude tr\u00e8s fouill\u00e9e, au 2e volume de la Revue L\u00e9gale, N.S. p. 320, et sp\u00e9cialement aux pages 383 et suivantes. La l\u00e9gislature, en 1904, semble l\u2019avoir reconnu et avoir voulu en diminuer la rigueur en adoptant un proviso en faveur des cr\u00e9anciers de bonne foi.\nIl me fait plaisir de pouvoir citer une haute autorit\u00e9, feu sir Louis Jett\u00e9, ancien juge-en-chef de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, qui disait: Re Hogue & Cousineau & La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction de Montarville[39]: Or dans la cause de Boudrias v. McLean40, la Cour d\u2019Appel a jug\u00e9 que la femme peut valablement renoncer, en faveur de son mari, non seulement \u00e0 son douaire, mais encore \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que lui garantissant ses reprises matrimoniales.\nCe jugement, de l\u2019aveu de l\u2019Hon. Juge Meredith, qui faisait alors partie du tribunal, a surtout \u00e9t\u00e9 bas\u00e9 sur un article remarquable publi\u00e9 dans le 3e volume de la Revue de L\u00e9gislation, p. 133 et suivantes, par feu M. Louis Ren\u00e9 Lacoste, et sur les autorit\u00e9s qui y sont cit\u00e9es.\nLa doctrine consacr\u00e9e par ce jugement est que la loi du Bas-Canada, telle que modifi\u00e9e par l\u2019ordonnance d\u2019enregistrement de 1841, d\u00e9fend, il est vrai, \u00e0 la femme le cautionnement des dettes, des engagements contract\u00e9s par son mari; elle lui d\u00e9fend de s\u2019obliger pour lui, de se rendre responsable de ses obligations, autrement que comme commune en biens; mais elle ne lui d\u00e9fend rien de plus. Par suite, les actes qui n\u2019exigent, qui ne contiennent, de la part de la femme mari\u00e9e, aucune responsabilit\u00e9, aucune obligation, elle peut les faire.\nAinsi elle peut payer pour son mari, car ce n\u2019est pas l\u00e0 s\u2019obliger pour lui, puisqu\u2019elle ne contracte aucune obligation en ce cas.\nDe m\u00eame une femme mari\u00e9e peut renoncer \u00e0 son hypoth\u00e8que l\u00e9gale sur les biens de son mari en faveur d\u2019un cr\u00e9ancier de ce dernier; en faisant cette renonciation, elle ne s\u2019oblige point-, elle ali\u00e8ne.\nC\u2019est pourquoi les empereurs Philippe disent dans un rescrit adress\u00e9 \u00e0 une femme au sujet du s\u00e9natus-consulte Vell\u00e9ien qui d\u00e9fendait aux femmes de s\u2019obliger pour autrui: \u201cIl est constant en jurisprudence que, m\u00eame durant le mariage, les droits d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que et de gage peuvent \u00eatre remis au mari.\u201d\n6 Pandectes de Pothier, p. 251.\nEt nous trouvons la raison de cette distinction entre l\u2019obligation de la femme et sa renonciation \u00e0 son hypoth\u00e8que dans les Pandectes:\n\u201cC\u2019est parce qu\u2019une femme se d\u00e9termine plus ais\u00e9ment \u00e0 s\u2019obliger pour autrui qu\u2019\u00e0 donner; quia facilius se obligat mulier, quam alicui donat.\u201d\nCette doctrine a \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9e de nouveau en 1871, par la Cour d\u2019Appel, dans la cause de Lagorgendi\u00e8re v. Thibodeau, mentionn\u00e9e au 1er vol. de la Revue Critique, p. 478.\n* * *\nMais apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tabli la validit\u00e9 de cette renonciation, quant aux droits hypoth\u00e9caires, il nous reste \u00e0 en d\u00e9terminer l\u2019\u00e9tendue et la port\u00e9e.\nC\u2019est un principe admis par tous les auteurs que les renonciations, suivant l\u2019expression de Merlin, doivent \u00eatre resserr\u00e9es dans leurs termes pr\u00e9cis et qu\u2019on ne doit jamais les \u00e9tendre d\u2019un cas \u00e0 l\u2019autre.\nR\u00e9pertoire, vo. Renonciations, \u00a73.\nIl est \u00e9galement certain que la renonciation que l\u2019on appelle en droit in favorem n\u2019est pas un abandon ou plut\u00f4t un an\u00e9antissement complet des droits hypoth\u00e9caires de la femme, mais constitue simplement un acte d\u2019abstention par lequel la femme promet de ne pas se pr\u00e9valoir des avantages qu\u2019elle pourrait avoir sur le pr\u00eateur.\n4 Proudhon. Usufruit n\u00b0 2339.\nCette renonciation, \u00e0 laquelle quelques auteurs attribuent, quant \u00e0 celui qui l\u2019obtient, les effets de la subrogation, ne prive n\u00e9anmoins la femme renon\u00e7ante, de ses droits hypoth\u00e9caires qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019encontre de celui qui l\u2019a obtenue. Remarquons que ce jugement, unanimement confirm\u00e9 en appel, le 3 f\u00e9vrier 188041, par sir A. A. Dorion, C.J., Monk, Ramsay, Tessier et Cross, JJ., est de beaucoup ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la modification de 1904.\nDans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il est prouv\u00e9 que rappelante, apr\u00e8s avoir accord\u00e9 du d\u00e9lai et exp\u00e9di\u00e9 de nouvelles marchandises \u00e0 Bilodeau et apr\u00e8s avoir pay\u00e9 les primes, en aurait demand\u00e9 en vain le remboursement \u00e0 Bilodeau. Est-ce que cette inutile demande de remboursement doit l\u2019obliger \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e la moiti\u00e9 de ce qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u de la mise-en-cause, au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Bilodeau?\nNe pouvons-nous pas dire que l\u2019appelante a re\u00e7u de bonne foi, non seulement pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e ici mais prouv\u00e9e, la cession et le paiement de la police d\u2019assurance dont elle s\u2019est d\u00e9partie lors du paiement avec une \u00e9gale bonne foi? Dans cette esp\u00e8ce, qui est peut-\u00eatre la plus favorable de toutes celles qui se sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es devant les tribunaux, l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et la bonne conscience ne semblent-elles pas militer en faveur de l\u2019appelante, qui a re\u00e7u, non de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, mais de la mise-en-cause, le paiement partiel de ce qui lui \u00e9tait d\u00fb, et ce, en vertu du titre que l\u2019assur\u00e9 lui avait adress\u00e9 spontan\u00e9ment avec le consentement et la renonciation de sa femme?\nLa femme n\u2019a pas sign\u00e9 un cautionnement, que l\u2019article 1929 du code d\u00e9finit\nl\u2019acte par lequel une personne s\u2019engage \u00e0 remplir l\u2019obligation d\u2019une autre pour le cas o\u00f9 celle-ci ne la remplirait pas;\nmais la preuve d\u00e9montre-t-elle une garantie ou un engagement de payer \u00e0 m\u00eame son patrimoine la dette de son mari? Les droits \u00e9ventuels qu\u2019elle aurait pu exercer en cas de pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son mari dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant le renouvellement du 13 d\u00e9cembre 1925, seraient certainement devenus caducs par l\u2019omission de payer la prime. L\u2019assur\u00e9 en faillite, en d\u00e9cembre 1926, ne pouvait la payer et ne l\u2019a pas fait. La police a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue en vigueur gr\u00e2ce aux d\u00e9bours\u00e9s faits par rappelante. Peut-on pr\u00e9tendre un seul instant que cette derni\u00e8re aurait pay\u00e9 ces primes si l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas sign\u00e9 ce qu\u2019elle appelle sa renonciation \u00e0 ses droits? Peutelle aujourd\u2019hui avec \u00e9quit\u00e9 demander \u00e0 une cour de justice d\u2019annuler ce document, en disant qu\u2019elle l\u2019a sign\u00e9 par erreur, ou qu\u2019il ne veut pas dire ce que son texte comporte? Peut-elle dire que les parties se sont entendues pour simuler leur contrat? Et, apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu, sous ce pr\u00e9tendu faux pr\u00e9texte, le concours de rappelante pour payer les primes et maintenir la police en vigueur, peut-elle s\u2019approprier aujourd\u2019hui le produit de la police? Ni le s\u00e9natus-consulte Vell\u00e9ien, ni l\u2019article 1301 C.C. n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9s pour encourager la fraude par la femme mari\u00e9e.\nLebel v. Bradin42:\nLa femme qui agissait de mauvaise foi ne pouvait pas prendre avantage du s\u00e9natus-consulte, Il ne prot\u00e9geait pas la fraude. \u201cIl peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9\u201d, dit un rescrit de Septime S\u00e9v\u00e8re, \u201cpar celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tromp\u00e9es, et non par celles qui ont tromp\u00e9. Si la faiblesse des femmes est susceptible d\u2019indulgence, leur astuce n\u2019en m\u00e9rite pas.\u201d\nComme le disait en 1903 l\u2019Honorable Juge Archambault, plus tard juge-en-chef de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, dans son discours devant le Conseil L\u00e9gislatif, en discutant un amendement propos\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 1301 et reproduit au long dans cette cause de Lebel v. Bradin43.\nD\u2019ailleurs il n\u2019y a pas lieu \u00e0 changer la loi pour emp\u00eacher la femme d\u2019invoquer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019article 1301; car, aujourd\u2019hui, comme \u00e0 Rome, en vertu du r\u00e9scrit de Septime S\u00e9v\u00e8re, la loi est faite pour prot\u00e9ger la femme contre ceux qui veulent abuser de sa bonne foi, de son bon c\u0153ur ou de sa faiblesse, et non pour prot\u00e9ger la femme qui veut frauder les autres.\nAvec respect, j\u2019aurais \u00e9t\u00e9 enclin \u00e0 dire que l\u2019exception au droit commun et \u00e0 la loi des assurances de Qu\u00e9bec que comporte l\u2019article 1301 du Code civil ne devrait pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 aux circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Mais la majorit\u00e9 de mes coll\u00e8gues, comme le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et la majorit\u00e9 des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi, ont trouv\u00e9 que Daoust, par sa version de l\u2019affaire, a \u00e9tabli, en fait, \u00e0 leur satisfaction, que la femme ne s\u2019est pas d\u00e9pouill\u00e9e de ses droits, mais s\u2019est suffisamment oblig\u00e9e pour et avec son mari pour dire qu\u2019elle a engag\u00e9 son patrimoine \u00e0 venir de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 n\u00e9cessiter l\u2019application de la sanction de l\u2019article 1301. L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation exacte de cet article est trop importante et j\u2019ai trop de respect pour la jurisprudence de cette cour et pour ceux qui l\u2019ont \u00e9tablie dans les causes cit\u00e9es au commencement de ces notes pour enregistrer un dissentiment formel, mais je reste avec un doute s\u00e9rieux qu\u2019il y ait lieu, dans l\u2019occurrence, d\u2019appliquer cette doctrine.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Beaulieu, Gouin, Mercier & Tellier.\nSolicitors for the respondent: B\u00e9dard & Flynn.\n[1] (1931) Q.R. 51 K.B. 193.\n[2] (1909) 41 Can.

Lamarre, in Their Capacity as Trustees in Bankruptcy of the Defendant La compagnie des remedes de l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9 Limit\u00e9e (Defendants) Respondents.\n1931: November 20; 1932: February 2.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nExchequer Court\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Nature of claim\u2014Relief\u2014Trade-mark\u2014Copyright\nHeld, that, although in this action plaintiffs claimed relief (expunging registration of trade-mark, injunction restraining use of trade-mark, damages for infringement of copyright and injunction restraining further infringement, etc.) in the nature of what, ordinarily and in a proper case, it would be within the province of the Exchequer Court to grant, yet they had not made out a case in which that court had jurisdiction to interfere. In support of their claim they relied exclusively on an agreement between them and the defendant W. and its alleged effect in preventing W. from entering into similar agreements with other persons for the territory covered; and that agreement (which was interpreted by this Court in Warr\u00e9 v. Bertrand et al., [1929] Can. S.C.R. 303) was one, not in respect of a trade-mark or copyright, but in respect of the sale of goods; any reference therein to a trade-mark or copyright being only accessory and not carrying the meaning alleged by plaintiffs. There was nothing in the agreement to take away from W. the right to register any acceptable trade-mark for distinguishing his products, nor did plaintiffs allege or show anything of a nature to establish that, by force of any provision of the Trade Mark and Design Act, the registration complained of should have been refused or should now be expunged, nor did anything in the record support their alternative claim for expunging any entries relating to assignment of the trade-mark. As to copyright: plaintiffs were, at best, W\u2019s grantees of an interest in a copyright; their grant had not been registered; their action was one for infringement under the Copyright Act; and under that Act (now R.S.C., 1927,. c. 32, s. 40 (3)), their grant not having been registered, they were precluded from maintaining the action (Canadian Performing Right Soc. Ltd. v. Famous Players Canadian Corp. Ltd., [1929] AC. 456). Plaintiffs\u2019 action was rightly dismissed by the Exchequer Court; their claim being one for the provincial courts. APPEAL by the plaintiffs (by leave granted by a judge of this Court) from the judgment of Audette J., in the Exchequer Court of Canada, dismissing their action.\nThe plaintiffs alleged an agreement in writing made in 1922, whereby the defendant Warr\u00e9 constituted them his sole representatives in Canada and the United States for a period of twenty years for the sale of vegetable remedies manufactured by him, which they were to buy from him at certain specified prices, and also authorized them to effect the copyright registration of a book written by him called \u201cLa Sant\u00e9 par les Plantes,\u201d and to prepare and publish an English translation thereof, and to cause to be registered as trade-marks, if plaintiffs so desired, the name \u201cLes Warrecures-Canada\u201d and the word \u201cWarrecures\u201d (such names were, however, not registered or used). The plaintiffs further alleged that they duly entered on the performance of the agreement, sold considerable quantities of said defendant\u2019s products in Canada and the United States, and caused said book to be registered under The Copyright Act, 1921. They complained that, in breach of the agreement, the said defendant, in or about the year 1926, made an agreement with one Godbout, carrying on business in his own name or as \u201cLa Compagnie des Rem\u00e8des de l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9,\u201d by which Godbout or said company were appointed to act as agents for said defendant in Canada and the United States and were furnished by said defendant with the products of his manufacture, which Godbout or the company sold as agents and representatives of said defendant, with full knowledge of said defendant\u2019s agreement with plaintiffs; that Godbout had caused to be registered on said defendant\u2019s behalf a certain trade-mark (a photograph of said defendant, in a certain setting, with his signature) to be used in connection with the sale of vegetable remedies; and that said defendant had sold his copyright in said book to Godbout, acting for and in the name of said company, and had assigned to him or said company the said trademark; that subsequently Godbout or the company assigned the copyright and the trade-mark to La Compagnie des Rem\u00e8des de l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9 Limit\u00e9e, which is the defendant company; that the said defendant company had continued, with full knowledge of the agreement between plaintiffs and the defendant Warr\u00e9, to act as agent for the sale of defendant Warr\u00e9\u2019s products, had distributed the book and a translation, and had used the said trade-mark, all with the approval and consent of the defendant Warr\u00e9.\nThe plaintiffs claimed: an order expunging the trademark registration, or, in the alternative, expunging the entries relating to the assignment thereof to the defendant company, and directing the correction of the register by vesting the trade-mark in the plaintiffs; damages for the infringement of the plaintiffs\u2019 copyright; an injunction restraining defendant from further infringing said copyright or making use of said trade-mark or any mark indicating that the goods sold by it were the products of the defendant Warr\u00e9; and an injunction restraining the defendant Warr\u00e9 from selling or delivering any of his products to his co-defendant.\nThe agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendant Warr\u00e9 has been dealt with in a previous judgment of this Court[1].\nThe present action was dismissed in the Exchequer Court, the judgment being given orally. On this appeal, there was some dispute as to the interpretation of the judgment with regard to its grounds for disposal of the case. The appellants contended that the ground of the dismissal of the action was that the Exchequer Court was without jurisdiction, the granting of any relief being within the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial court, and that the sole question for determination on this appeal was whether the action was one in which the Exchequer Court had jurisdiction to afford to plaintiffs any of the relief prayed for; and they submitted that, in his ground of dismissal, the trial judge was wrong, and they asked that the action should be remitted to the Exchequer Court for trial.\nBy the judgment of this Court, now reported, the appeal was dismissed with costs.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. for the appellants.\nGregor Barclay K.C. for the respondents.\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014While concurring in the conclusions of my brother Rinfret and, speaking generally, in his reasons therefor, my inability at present exhaustively to consider all the questions he has raised prevents my giving an unqualified concurrence in all his reasons for judgment.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The conclusions of the statement of claim in this action are for:\n1. An order expunging the registration of a certain trademark or, in the alternative, expunging the entries relating to the assignment thereof and directing the correction of the register by vesting the trade-mark in the appellants ; an injunction restraining the respondents from making use of the said trade-mark or of any mark indicating that the goods sold by them are the products of the respondent Warr\u00e9; and an injunction restraining the respondent Warr\u00e9 from selling or delivering any of his products to the other respondent;\n2. Damages for the infringement of a copyright and an injunction restraining the respondents from further infringing the said copyright.\nThere would seem to be little doubt that, with the exception perhaps of the prayer for an injunction restraining the sale or delivery of the products, these conclusions are in the nature of those which, ordinarily and in a proper case, it would be well within the province of the Exchequer Court to grant.\nAt first sight, the judgment a quo appeared to have dismissed the action entirely upon the ground that the Court was without \u201cpower and jurisdiction\u201d in the premises. Such was the appellants\u2019 contention; and it was for that reason that leave to appeal had been granted.\nAt the hearing, counsel for the appellants again argued that the sole question for determination was whether the action was one in which the Exchequer Court had jurisdiction to afford to them any of the relief prayed for; but counsel for the respondents showed that the language of the judgment was susceptible of another construction. He pointed out that even the slightest difference in punctuation brought about a different meaning in the judgment\u2014a consideration not without its importance in view of the fact that the decision was delivered orally. Now that we have had the opportunity of examining the whole record, we have no doubt that the judgment, read in the light of the discussion between court and counsel throughout the trial, must be interpreted as having disposed of the case upon the merits, so far at least as concerned the prayer with regard to the trade-mark. Our reasons for that conclusion will be developed as we proceed.\nThere was no limitation in the order granting leave to appeal. All questions affecting the judgment can therefore be discussed by the parties and may now be considered (A. R. Williams Machinery Co. Ltd. v. Moore[2]).\nThe appellants\u2019 case was submitted as follows:\nThey alleged a certain agreement made between them and the respondent Warr\u00e9, in the months of October and November, 1922, in respect to the purchase of vegetable remedies manufactured by Warr\u00e9, to a book called \u201cLa sant\u00e9 par les plantes\u201d relating to such products and prepared by Warr\u00e9, and to the exclusive right to sell the products in a defined territory. They further alleged that the agreement was made for a period of twenty years and contained certain provisions with regard to the copyright of the book and the registration as trade-marks, if they so desired, of the words: \u201cLes Warrecures-Canada\u201d and \u201cWarrecures.\u201d\nThe complaint was that, \u201cnotwithstanding the said agreement and in breach thereof,\u201d in or about the year 1926, the respondent had made another similar agreement with one Godbout, \u201ccarrying on business in his own name or as \u2018La Compagnie des Rem\u00e8des de l\u2019abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9,\u2019\u201c who had entered on the performance of this new contract \u201cwith full knowledge of the (respondent) Warr\u00e9\u2019s agreement with the (appellants)\u201d; that Godbout had caused to be registered on behalf of the respondent Warr\u00e9 a certain trade-mark to be used in connection with the sale of the vegetable remedies, and that l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9 had sold his copyright in the book \u201cLa sant\u00e9\u201d to Godbout and had assigned to him the registered trade-mark. In turn, on the 14th of September, 1928, so it was stated, Godbout or his firm had turned over the copyright and the trade-mark to a joint stock company known as \u201cLa Compagnie des Rem\u00e8des de l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9 Limit\u00e9e,\u201d which was joined as defendant. At the trial, the appellants contented themselves with filing a copy of their agreement with l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9, a copy of the trade-mark registered by Godbout in the name of l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9 with the certificates of assignments thereof, and a certificate of the copyright for the book \u201cLa Sant\u00e9\u201d registered in the name of Albert Bertrand. Their counsel then stated that he would stay his case there and leave the rest for argument. No other evidence, either verbal or in writing, was adduced, not even the contract between l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9 and Godbout.\nIt will thus be realized that, in support of the conclusions they took in their statement of claim, the appellants relied exclusively on the strength of the agreement of 1922 between them and l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9, and its possible effect in preventing the latter from entering, with other parties, into similar agreements for the territory therein covered.\nOf the particular contracts complained of we know nothing, except what may be inferred from the admissions contained in the statements of defence; and there is no evidence to show that, at the time they were entered into, the other contracting parties had any knowledge of the existence of the agreement between l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9 and the appellants.\nNow, if we turn to the agreement so relied upon by the appellants as the sole basis of their claim, we find that it has already received judicial interpretation by this court in a case where the Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9 was the appellant and the present appellants were the respondents[3]. The unanimous judgment of the court was delivered by Mignault J., who said:\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s ce contrat, il est convenu que les intim\u00e9s ach\u00e8teront au comptant, et en quantit\u00e9s pour au moins 1,000 francs l\u2019achat simple, les produits de l\u2019appelant aux prix stipul\u00e9s dans une lettre de ce dernier. Ils ach\u00e8teront \u00e9galement au comptant et en lots \u00e0 leur convenance le livre \u201cLa Sant\u00e9\u201d publi\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant, et cela aux prix mentionn\u00e9s dans la m\u00eame lettre. Enfin, ils s\u2019engagent \u00e0 d\u00e9penser en publicit\u00e9, annonces, etc., au moins $1,000 par ann\u00e9e, \u00e0 commencer un an apr\u00e8s la signature du contrat.\nDe son c\u00f4t\u00e9, l\u2019appelant nomme les intim\u00e9s ses agents, repr\u00e9sentants et d\u00e9positaires exclusifs pour la vente de ses produits pour tout le Canada et les Etats-Unis, durant vingt ann\u00e9es \u00e0 compter de la signature du contrat. Il les autorise \u00e0 faire enregistrer au Canada et aux Etats-Unis le livre \u201cLa Sant\u00e9\u201d, \u00e0 en faire publier une traduction anglaise, et \u00e0 se servir pour toutes fins commerciales et enregistrer comme raison sociale le nom \u201cles Warr\u00e9cures-Canadade\u201d, m\u00eame que le mot \u201cWarr\u00e9cures\u201d pour toutes autres fins de publicit\u00e9.\n* * *\n* * * Le contrat en question est d\u2019un type bien connu en ce pays. Il comporte le droit exclusif, dans le Canada et les Etats-Unis, de vendre les produits de l\u2019appelant que les intim\u00e9s doivent acheter de lui en quantit\u00e9s repr\u00e9sentant au moins 1,000 francs la commande. Les marchandises que les intim\u00e9s ach\u00e8tent et qu\u2019ils paient comptant avant l\u2019exp\u00e9dition leur appartiennent. Ils les vendent comme ils le veulent et n\u2019en sont pas comptables envers l\u2019appelant. La clause qui les nomme les agents et repr\u00e9sentants de ce dernier, n\u2019est un mandat que de nom, car les intim\u00e9s ne g\u00e8rent aucune affaire pour l\u2019appelant (art. 1701 C.C., d\u00e9finition du mandat), et malgr\u00e9 que la clause dise que les intim\u00e9s sont les agents de l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9 pour la vente de ses produits, ils ne peuvent obtenir ces produits qu\u2019en les payant d\u2019avance, et alors c\u2019est leur propre marchandise qu\u2019ils vendent.\nIn that case, l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9 sought the annulment of the agreement upon the alleged failure of the appellants to carry out its terms. The court held that the contract was not revokable at the sole will of l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9; and, having found otherwise that no default was proven on the part of the present appellants, it dismissed the action.\nUpon that interpretation, the agreement of 1922 is an agreement not in respect to a trade-mark or to a copyright, but in respect to the sale of goods. The subject-matter of the agreement is the sale of goods. The reference, if any, made therein to a trade-mark or copyright is only accessory and does not carry the meaning which the appellants give to it, as will be shown more conveniently by quoting from the document the clause itself relating to that matter:\n2. La partie de seconde part (i.\u00e9. l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9) autorise les dits Albert Bertrand et Louis V. Labelle \u00e0:\n(a) faire enregistrer au Canada et aux Etats-Unis le livre \u201cLa Sant\u00e9\u201d;\n(b) faire et publier une traduction en langue anglaise du dit livre \u201cLa Sant\u00e9\u201d aux conditions de sa lettre du 13 octobre 1922;\n(c) se servir et employer pour toutes fins commerciales et enregistrer comme raison sociale, s\u2019ils le veulent, le nom \u201cLes Warrecures-Canada\u201d, de m\u00eame que le mot \u201cWarr\u00e9cures\u201d pour toutes autres fins de publicit\u00e9.\nLeaving aside for the moment sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), which deal with the copyright, and considering subparagraph (c), dealing with what the appellants call the trade-marks, the stipulation, on its face, is nothing more than a consent of l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9 to the use by the appellants of the word \u201cLes Warrecures-Canada\u201d as a firm name, and of the word \u201cWarr\u00e9cures\u201d for purposes of publicily. No express mention is made of a trade-mark. Whether consent to registration of one or both names as trade-marks may be inferred from the language of the clause is not necessary to discuss, because the appellants admitted at the trial that registration never took place and that they never made use of the names. Incidentally it may be mentioned that the trade-mark complained of and which Godbout caused to be registered in the name of l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9 does not consist in the words referred to and is of a very different character.\nBut the important point is that l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9, as manufacturer and vendor of the vegetable remedies he agreed to sell to the appellants, was undoubtedly entitled, under the Trade Mark and Design Act, to register any trade-mark accepted by the Minister for the purpose of distinguishing his products; nothing can be found in the agreement to take away that right from him; and there is no allegation in the statement of claim, nor was any evidence adduced or any point made at the trial, of a nature to establish that, by force of any of the provisions of the Act, the registration should have been refused or should now be expunged.\nThe appellants did not come before the court as persons aggrieved, complaining that the entries in the register relating to the trade-mark were made without sufficient cause within the meaning of the Act. Their cause of action, as disclosed in the statement of claim and during the proceedings at trial, is founded exclusively on an alleged breach of contract. And what the learned trial judge says in his judgment is that, having regard to the nature of the agreement, there was no breach in respect of any matter connected with a trade-mark, since \u201cthere is nothing that takes away from Warr\u00e9 the untrammeled right to get as many trade-marks * * * as he wishes.\u201d Having so found, the learned judge held that the balance of the action (always leaving aside for the moment the question as to the copyright) resolved itself into one for breach of a contract for the sale of goods, \u201ca matter entirely involving civil rights within the province,\u201d and therefore a matter in respect of which the Exchequer Court had no power to enforce the remedy prayed for.\nIn effect, what the learned judge says is that the appellants have not made out a case in which the Exchequer Court may interfere. After what we have already said, we need not add that we find ourselves in complete agreement with that conclusion. Without discussing otherwise the question of jurisdiction, as to which we would refer to the judgment of this Court in Consolidated Distilleries Limited v. Consolidated Exporters Corporation Limited[4], we are clearly of the opinion that, in this case, the appellants having failed to establish any breach of contract relating to a trade-mark, they could not get their remedy from the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nThe same reasoning applies to the prayer for an order expunging the entries relating to the assignment of the trade-mark to the respondent \u201cLa Compagnie des Rem\u00e8des de l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9 Limit\u00e9e.\u201d As previously stated, the contracts between l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9 and Godbout, as well as between Godbout and the respondent company, were not filed. The court\u2019s knowledge of the contents of these contracts is limited to what is admitted in the statement of defence. According to those admissions, l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9 assigned his registered trade-mark to Godbout, and the latter, in turn, assigned it to the respondent company, under agreements whereby the good will in Warr\u00e9\u2019s business in Canada became vested in them \u201ctogether with the secret formula in accordance with which the goods to which the said trademark relates were manufactured, and the right to exclusive manufacture of the said goods in Canada.\u201d If the trademark in question was properly registered in the name of l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9\u2014as, on the record before us, we hold that it was\u2014that trade-mark was certainly assignable in law ; and, so far as we know, the assignment made under the conditions above stated was no more a breach of duty in respect to a trade-mark than was the registration itself of the trademark by l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9; so that the argument which prevailed to refuse the order expunging the trade-mark equally applies, in the alternative, to the prayer for expunging the entries relating to the assignment. It should be understood, of course, that we refrain from saying more upon the nature and the effect of the agreements between the respondents, except so far as necessary to discuss the power of the Exchequer Court to interfere, as it is our purpose to avoid prejudicing, one way or the other, the controversy involving the nature and extent of the civil rights of the parties, which properly belongs to the jurisdiction of the provincial courts.\nComing now to the consideration of the complaint concerning the copyright and of the prayer for relief in connection with its infringement, the point raised calls for the interpretation and the application of the Copyright Act and the question is whether, in view of the dealings between the parties and by force of section 3 and subsections 2 and 4 of section 12, the appellants became entitled to be treated, for the purposes of the Act, as the partial owners of the copyright, and whether the provisions of the Copyright Act should have effect accordingly.\nIf that be so, it could be reasonably argued that the Exchequer Court had jurisdiction over the subject-matter (s. 22 of the Exchequer Court Act, as amended by 18-19 Geo. V, c. 23, s. 3).\nUnfortunately for the appellants, the appeal on that point is concluded by the judgment of the Privy Council in the case of Canadian Performing Right Society Ltd. v. Famous Players Canadian Corporation Ltd. (1). Under the Copyright Act (now c. 32 of R.S.C., 1927, s. 12), l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9, as the author of the book \u201cLa Sant\u00e9 par les plantes,\u201d was the first owner of the copyright therein. We shall not discuss whether, by virtue of the agreement of 1922, it was intended that the appellant Bertrand should register the copyright in his own name, nor whether the agreement itself may be construed as an assignment of the copyright. The right to prepare and publish a translation of the book in the English language was at least a partial assignment of or a grant of an interest in the copyright. In any view, the appellants were at best the grantees of l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9.\nIn the Canadian Performing Right Society case[5], the Privy Council decided that, upon its true construction, section 39, subsection 2, of the Copyright Act (now sec. 40, subsec. 3, of ch. 32, R.S.C., 1927) prohibits a grantee of an interest in a copyright, either by assignment or licence, from maintaining any action under the Act, unless his grant and similar grants forming part of the chain of his title have been registered.\nIn the present case, the action is between a grantee and a subsequent assignee from the same author\u2014a circumstance not present in the Canadian Performing case (1) before the Privy Council and which makes the application of the section only the more imperative in the premises.\nThe grant of the appellants has not been registered. Their action is an action for infringement under the Copyright Act, and no answer can be found to the contention that, under the circumstances, they are precluded from maintaining the action. The point was expressly raised at the trial and the appellants had full opportunity of meeting it.\nIt follows that the action of the appellants was rightly dismissed by the Exchequer Court, and that the appeal on both branches of the case should be disallowed with costs, without prejudice to any recourse the appellants may have before the provincial courts.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Smart & Biggar.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Henderson, Herridge & Gowling.\n[1] [1929] Can.

In an action to set aside a by-law on the ground that it had not received the approval of the requisite number of \u201cproprietors,\u201d the trial judge is entitled to go behind the valuation roll and inquire into the qualification of the individual voters as actual \u201cproprietors\u201d at the time of the voting within the meaning given to that word by the municipal code.

A. Pr\u00e9vost K.C. and Antoine Cimon for the appellant.\nLs. St. Laurent K.C. and Andr\u00e9 Taschereau K.C. for the respondents.\nAnglin C.J.C. (dissenting).\u2014Assuming that the Superior Court had jurisdiction to inquire (Art. 677 M.C.), in this proceeding, into the qualifications of individual voters, it appears to me that, on the merits, this whole case boils down to one question, viz., whether or not, under Quebec municipal law, \u201cthe valuation roll\u201d in force in a municipality (Articles 650-3, 663 and 667-9, M.C.) is intended to be accepted as conclusive proof in all courts, not merely of the fact that a voter entered thereon is a municipal elector, but of the further fact that he is the actual proprietor of any lands, of which he is entered as such on that roll.\nArticle 771 M.C. provides that,\nNo local corporation may contract debts for any amount exceeding, in the aggregate, ten per cent of the value of the taxable immoveable property, if the municipality is a rural one, or fifteen per cent of the value of the taxable immoveable property, if the municipality is a village or town,\u2014such amount including the share which such corporation has to contribute towards paying the debts of the county corporation,\u2014unless the by-law is voted upon by at least two-fifths in number of the proprietors of taxable immoveable property in the municipality who are municipal electors, and who reside in the municipality, and approved by a majority of at least two-thirds in number and real value of all the proprietors whether resident or not in the municipality who have voted, and who are entitled to vote, upon such by-law, and by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. (8 Geo. V, ch. 60, sec. 22 and 16 Geo. V, ch. 34).\n(See, too, art. 768 M.C.)\nWhile I agree with the views taken below that several distinct qualifications are here imposed, I see no reason for thinking that the legislature did not intend that, if the valuation roll should be regarded as conclusive on one point, it should not have a like quality and effect in regard to the others, v.g., if conclusive as to a man being an elector, it should also be conclusive as to his being proprietor of the land in question. I cannot imagine that it was ever intended that there should be as many trials in the Superior Court as to the qualifications of individual voters as there may be voters objected to by anybody contesting either a municipal election or the validity of a vote on a municipal by-law, and that such trials should be had in a collateral proceeding, such as that now before us, and without the persons principally concerned, i.e., the voters, being parties thereto. I more than gravely doubt if any such jurisdiction is conferred by Art. 50 C.C.P. on the Superior Court (and yet the only justification invoked by the respondent for this proceeding is Art. 50 C.C.P.); but, if it is, I find in Art. 771 M.C., above quoted, no reason for distinguishing between the valuation roll as evidence in that court of the several qualifications imposed by that article as conditions of the right to vote, i.e., (1) as to municipal electorship, that it is evidence that the voter appears upon the roll as an elector (Art. 654 M.C., paragraphs nos. 2, 6 and 12), and (2) as to proprietorship, that the voter must be regarded as proprietor of the land of which the roll in force shews him to be such. For both purposes alike, the evidence of the roll, I think, must be equally conclusive if for no other reason on the score of overwhelming convenience. In my opinion, unless the valuation roll should be regarded as conclusive for all election purposes, including voting on municipal by laws, the greatest inconvenience must ensue, as otherwise such land as that now in question must be wholly unrepresented on the vote taken, and there might well be an unseemly row in the polling booth.\nArticle 670, which provides that the valuation roll in force \u201cserves as a basis * * * for any \u2018immoveable property qualification\u2019\u201c seems to me almost conclusive on the point now before us in favour of the appellant. Moreover, abundant provision is made for the correction of this roll by appeal. For instance, Art. 663 M.C. provides that the local council must, after proper notice, etc., deal with the roll, inter alia,\nby correcting the names of persons entered therein, or the description of the lands mentioned therein;\nthe decision of the Circuit Court of the county, or the district, or of the District Magistrate\u2019s Court, on further appeal, being declared by Art. 677 to be final.\nFinally, by Art. 769 M.C., after a loan by-law has been approved by the electors, the secretary-treasurer is to transmit to the Minister for submission to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, inter alia, the following:\n(9) a certificate from the secretary-treasurer specifying the total number of municipal electors who are proprietors of taxable immoveable property.\nAt least twice (notably in Arts. 665 and 666 M.C.) provision is made whereby the secretary-treasurer, expressly or impliedly, is forbidden to derive information from any other source than the valuation roll. How, therefore, is he to know who are proprietors of immovable property without having recourse to the valuation roll?\nFinally, by Art. 772, provision is made for lenders or creditors, upon discovery of illegality or informality, having\na right to recover their claims from the member or members of the council personally, and jointly and severally, who participated in any manner whatever, even tacitly, in effecting such loan or contracting such debt.\nThe purchaser a r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 did not take advantage of article 673 M.C. to be entered on the valuation roll as proprietor, which may have been because of some agreement to that effect between the parties that the names of the vendor a r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 should continue to appear on the roll as proprietor. At all events, the only person who, in my view, should now be regarded as having had the qualification of proprietor of the land in question at the time of the voting, by virtue of ownership thereof, is the elector whose name had been allowed to remain on the valuation roll as owner of such land.\nFor these reasons, I agree in the conclusion reached by my brother Cannon, basing my concurrence largely on the additional authorities cited by him.\nThe definition by Larousse and Littr\u00e9 of \u201cqualit\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re\u201d With great respect, I differ from the view taken by my brother Rinfret as to the effect and meaning of the term \u201cqualit\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re\u201d The English translation is \u201cimmoveable property qualification.\u201d The phrase \u201cproperty qualification\u201d implies no idea or notion of \u201cvaluation\u201d whatsoever. Its connotation, like that of \u201cqualit\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re\u201d is that the voter has certain property rights as the basis of his \u201cqualification.\u201d I find substantially no difference in meaning and effect between the term \u201cqualit\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re\u201d used in the French version and the words \u201cimmoveable property qualification\u201d used in the English version. Therefore, in my opinion, no case is made for an application of the provision contained in Art. 15 of the code, although, had such a case been made, I agree that the English version, as the original text, is to be preferred to the French for the reasons stated by that learned judge.\nArticle 729 M.C. and the opinion of Taschereau J. (later C.J.C.) in Les Listes Electorales de Kamouraska[1], quoted by my brother Cannon. (See too Arts. 273 and 313 M.C.).\nAnother remedy would seem to have been that provided by Article 662 et seq. M.C., but which was not availed of. See also McDonald v. Quinn[2], especially the reasons given by Meredith J. at pp. 461-3, likewise quoted by my brother Cannon.\nWhile, possibly, of some little value in construing the effect of the valuation roll as evidence of the qualifications of municipal voters, the requirement of the code that councillors should continue to hold these qualifications throughout their entire term of office seems to me, with great respect, to have little or no bearing on the point at issue. I am, for the foregoing reasons, of the opinion that the valuation roll in force is conclusive as evidence both of the right of the voter whose name appears thereon to be an elector, and, also, for the purposes of any voting at which such roll is properly used, of the fact that he is proprietor of land of which he is inscribed thereon as such.\nWhile I fully recognize the force of the contention of the respondents that the jurisprudence of Quebec has been very largely to the contrary of the view above expressed, and the value and significance of the judgments of the Privy Council in such cases as Webb v. Outrim[3], (and am fully prepared to stand by what I said in Gagnon v. Lemay[4] as to the wisdom and importance of this branch of the doctrine of stare decisis), we must also be careful never to forget that we are not bound by the decisions of provincial courts and that it is our business to correct the errors of those courts when it is clear to us that such errors have, in fact, existed (Bourne v. Keane)[5].\nMoreover, enough attention, in my opinion, has not been paid to the scope and language of Art. 50 C.C.P. which reads as follows:\u2014\nExcepting the Court of King\u2019s Bench, all courts, circuit judges and magistrates, and all other persons and bodies politic and corporate, within the province, are subject to the superintending and reforming power, order and control of the Superior Court and of the judge thereof in such manner and form as by law provided.\nApart from the fact that nominal or consequential relief was asked originally against the mise-en-cause, Couturier, for the setting aside of the contract with him for the purchase of his land for the purpose of carrying out the scheme involved in the by-law, I find no ground whatever for suggesting that under Art. 50 C.C.P. there was any jurisdiction whatever conferred upon the Superior Court to entertain an action such as that now before us, especially where there are involved in it collateral trials of their right to vote, although the voters interested are not parties to the litigation. To say that the \u201csuperintending and reforming power, order and control of the Superior Court\u201d extends to entertaining an action such as this is, to my mind, absurd, especially in view of the exclusive jurisdiction conferred on the Circuit Court, or Magistrate\u2019s Court, of the district in which the municipality is situated, for the hearing and decision of contested elections (Art. 315 M.C.). I do not think it was ever intended, by tacking on to the proceeding of contesting the vote on a by-law, such as is now before us, a claim to set aside a contract incidentally involved, that the Superior Court would be given authority to oust the jurisdiction of the local courts, to whom matters of voting and election are exclusively entrusted.\nI would, for these two reasons (a) want of jurisdiction of the Superior Court to entertain the action, and (6) the extreme inconvenience likely to result from the Superior Court having the right to determine the qualification of voters in such a proceeding as this, hold that the present action cannot succeed.\nI would, accordingly, allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of King\u2019s Bench and would restore the judgment of Bouffard J., including the appellant\u2019s costs of the motion to add Joseph Couturier, formerly mise-en-cause, as a respondent, which, in my opinion, were quite unnecessarily incurred.\nThe judgments of Duff, Rinfret and Smith JJ. was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014L\u2019appelante est une corporation de village r\u00e9gie par le Code Municipal de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.

L\u2019inscription au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation est-elle concluante sur la question de savoir quels sont les propri\u00e9taires qui ont le \u201cdroit de voter\u201d en vertu de l\u2019article 771?\n2. Dans la n\u00e9gative, le r\u00e8glement a-t-il re\u00e7u la majorit\u00e9 requise des propri\u00e9taires qui ont vot\u00e9 et qui avaient droit de voter?\nLe juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure fut d\u2019avis que,\nau point de vue municipal, les propri\u00e9taires de biens-fonds sont ceux qui sont inscrits comme tels au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation en vigueur, lequel lie la corporation et ses contribuables.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s le jugement, \u201cle r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, lors du vote, \u00e9tait la seule base du vote\u201d et \u201cla cour ne serait pas justifiable d\u2019annuler les votes\u201d de ceux qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas alors propri\u00e9taires, pourvu qu\u2019ils fussent inscrits comme tels sur le r\u00f4le. Pour cette raison, il a d\u00e9bout\u00e9 les intim\u00e9s de leur action.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi a \u00e9t\u00e9 unanime \u00e0 rejeter cette interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 771.\nLe raisonnement des juges du tribunal d\u2019appel, tel qu\u2019il est exprim\u00e9 dans leurs notes, nous para\u00eet convaincant, et nous l\u2019adoptons sans restriction. Nous voulons seulement y ajouter les quelques consid\u00e9rations qui suivent:\nCe qui ressort de l\u2019article 771 du Code Municipal, et de l\u2019article 758 qui en est la base, c\u2019est que le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu que les r\u00e8glements d\u2019emprunts fussent approuv\u00e9s tout d\u2019abord par les propri\u00e9taires de biens-fonds imposables. C\u2019est la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui va \u00eatre affect\u00e9e par la taxe impos\u00e9e \u00e0 raison de l\u2019emprunt. Il est juste que ce soit celui qui d\u00e9tient la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui se prononce. Il a non seulement ce privil\u00e8ge pour lui-m\u00eame, mais il a un int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 ce que les non-propri\u00e9taires n\u2019aient pas voix au chapitre. Si la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est subs\u00e9quemment vendue pour taxes, ce sera le v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire, inscrit ou non sur le r\u00f4le, qui la perdra. C\u2019est donc le fait d\u2019\u00eatre propri\u00e9taire qui est la condition primordiale du vote. En pareil cas, la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9lecteur municipal n\u2019est que suppl\u00e9mentaire. Et c\u2019est bien ce que fait voir l\u2019article 771. Il exige d\u2019abord qu\u2019on soit propri\u00e9taire; et cette exigence est exprim\u00e9e au temps pr\u00e9sent. C\u2019est le propri\u00e9taire, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire celui qui a le titre au moment o\u00f9 la taxe va \u00eatre impos\u00e9e, qui peut voter. Comme le dit fort bien M. le juge Galipeault:\nLe propri\u00e9taire dont le nom n\u2019appara\u00eet pas sur le r\u00f4le est certainement priv\u00e9 de voter; le non-propri\u00e9taire dont le nom est inscrit au r\u00f4le ne poss\u00e8de pas plus de droits: \u00e0 chacun d\u2019eux il manque l\u2019une des conditions essentielles.\nCet argument est renforc\u00e9 par l\u2019article 243 du code, qui d\u00e9finit ce qu\u2019est un \u00e9lecteur.\nIl faut, dit l\u2019article, pour\navoir le droit de voter *** et d\u2019exercer tous les droits et privil\u00e8ges conf\u00e9r\u00e9s aux \u00e9lecteurs par les dispositions du pr\u00e9sent code, sujet \u00e0 l\u2019application de l\u2019article 768, poss\u00e9der au moment d\u2019exercer tels droits et privil\u00e8ges, les conditions suivantes etc.\nOn remarque imm\u00e9diatement la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence sp\u00e9ciale subordonnant cet article \u00e0 l\u2019application de l\u2019article 758 qui, comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 soulign\u00e9, est l\u2019article de base des votes des propri\u00e9taires sur les r\u00e8glements d\u2019emprunt. Mais on remarque surtout qu\u2019il faut poss\u00e9der les conditions requises pour \u00eatre \u00e9lecteur, \u201cau moment d\u2019exercer tels droits et privil\u00e8ges Ce qui veut dire clairement que le fait de les avoir poss\u00e9d\u00e9es lors de l\u2019homologation du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation n\u2019est pas suffisant.\nEn plus, l\u2019article 243 \u00e9num\u00e8re en quatre paragraphes les conditions essentielles pour \u00eatre \u00e9lecteur. Il faut poss\u00e9der chacune d\u2019elles, \u201cau moment d\u2019exercer tels droits et privil\u00e8ges\u201d. Le quatri\u00e8me paragraphe, qui se lit comme suit:\nEtre inscrit comme propri\u00e9taire, comme locataire ou comme occupant, sur le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation en vigueur dans la municipalit\u00e9,\nest seulement une de ces conditions. Il faut, en plus, poss\u00e9der les autres: \u00eatre sujet de Sa Majest\u00e9; \u00eatre majeur; \u00eatre du sexe masculin ou \u00eatre fille ou veuve; poss\u00e9der soit comme propri\u00e9taire, soit comme locataire, soit comme occupant, un terrain d\u2019une certaine valeur r\u00e9elle ou annuelle, tel qu\u2019il appert du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation en vigueur.\nS\u2019il suffisait d\u2019\u00eatre inscrit sur le r\u00f4le, il \u00e9tait bien inutile de mentionner les autres conditions, puisque chacune d\u2019elles figure parmi les mentions qui apparaissent au r\u00f4le en vertu de l\u2019article 654 du Code municipal.\nCela fait bien voir qu\u2019\u00eatre inscrit sur le r\u00f4le ne constitue que l\u2019un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments requis pour \u00eatre \u00e9lecteur. Il est n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9unir, en outre, chacune des autres qualit\u00e9s \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans l\u2019article 243. Et il faut poss\u00e9der ces qualit\u00e9s et, en plus, \u00eatre inscrit, dit l\u2019article 243, \u201cau moment d\u2019exercer (les) droits et privil\u00e8ges conf\u00e9r\u00e9s\u201d. Donc: au moment de voter sur un r\u00e8glement d\u2019emprunt.\nD\u2019o\u00f9 il r\u00e9sulte que le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation n\u2019est nullement une liste \u00e9lectorale, puisqu\u2019il faut tout ensemble y \u00eatre inscrit et, par surcro\u00eet, remplir au moment du vote toutes les autres conditions. Et si l\u2019article 379 du code exige que le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier assiste \u00e0 l\u2019assembl\u00e9e des \u00e9lecteurs \u201cavec l\u2019original ou une copie certifi\u00e9e du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation en vigueur\u201d, ce n\u2019est pas parce que ce r\u00f4le repr\u00e9sente la liste de ceux qui ont le droit de voter (bien qu\u2019il faille y figurer), mais c\u2019est parce que ce r\u00f4le est n\u00e9cessaire au secr\u00e9taire et est essentiel pour v\u00e9rifier et contr\u00f4ler la valeur des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par ceux qui votent. L\u2019article 771 requiert \u201cune majorit\u00e9 d\u2019au moins les deux tiers en nombre et en valeur immobili\u00e8re\u201d de ceux qui ont vot\u00e9. C\u2019est au moyen du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation que cette valeur immobili\u00e8re est \u00e9tablie. C\u2019est lui qui permet de d\u00e9terminer si la majorit\u00e9 en valeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue.\nIl reste l\u2019article 670 du Code Municipal, sur lequel le juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a surtout appuy\u00e9 son raisonnement. Il s\u2019agit du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation; et l\u2019article se lit comme suit:\n670. Il reste en vigueur jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur d\u2019un nouveau r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation fait d\u2019apr\u00e8s les dispositions du pr\u00e9sent titre; et, pendant ce temps, il sert de base aux taxes, contributions, r\u00e9partitions en deniers, mains-d\u2019\u0153uvre ou mat\u00e9riaux impos\u00e9s en vertu des r\u00e8glements, proc\u00e8sverbaux ou actes de r\u00e9partition, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 toute qualit\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re, et au paiement de toute dette municipale, sauf les cas particuliers o\u00f9 il en est autrement ordonn\u00e9 par les dispositions du pr\u00e9sent code.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance a insist\u00e9 sur les mots \u201cqualit\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re\u201d. Faisons d\u2019abord remarquer que la version anglaise de l\u2019article donne comme l\u2019\u00e9quivalent de \u201cqualit\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re\u201d, l\u2019expression \u201cimmoveable property qualification\u201d. Le code actuel a succ\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 celui de 1870. Si l\u2019on se reporte au texte de 1870, tel qu\u2019il se trouve au statut de Qu\u00e9bec, 34 Victoria, c. 68, art. 743, on constate que, dans ce statut originaire, les deux versions (anglaise et fran\u00e7aise) emploient le mot \u201cqualification\u201d. C\u2019est dans les Statuts Refondus de 1888 que le mot \u201cqualit\u00e9\u201d s\u2019est gliss\u00e9, sans explication, dans la version fran\u00e7aise, tandis que le mot \u201cqualification\u201d persistait dans la version anglaise. S\u2019il y a divergence entre les deux textes, c\u2019est la version anglaise, au besoin, qui pr\u00e9vaudrait, comme \u00e9tant conforme au texte du statut de 1870 (C.M. art. 15\u201450 Vict. c. 5, art. 12, R.S.Q. 1888, p. CXX).\nMais un premier point bien d\u00e9cisif, suivant nous, qu\u2019il est important de faire observer quand il s\u2019agit de l\u2019application de l\u2019article 670, c\u2019est qu\u2019il se termine par la phrase:\nsauf les cas particuliers o\u00f9 il en est autrement ordonn\u00e9 par les dispositions du pr\u00e9sent code\nqui doit qualifier tout le reste de l\u2019article et dont il est impossible de ne pas tenir compte. Or, pour les raisons qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, nous sommes d\u2019avis que les articles 758, 771 et 243, qui s\u2019appliquent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, sont des \u201ccas particuliers o\u00f9 il en est autrement ordonn\u00e9\u201d.\nAdmettons cependant, pour les besoins de l\u2019argument, qu\u2019il n\u2019en soit pas ainsi. L\u2019article 670 a trait au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation. Le but fondamental du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation est d\u2019\u00e9tablir \u201cla valeur r\u00e9elle des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s\u201d pour les fins municipales. Art. 650. Sa fonction essentielle est de fixer l\u2019\u00e9valuation fonci\u00e8re: et c\u2019est bien ce qui r\u00e9sulte de l\u2019article, lorsqu\u2019il dit que le r\u00f4le\nsert de base aux taxes, contributions, r\u00e9partitions en deniers, mains-d\u2019\u0153uvre ou mat\u00e9riaux impos\u00e9s en vertu des r\u00e8glements, proc\u00e8s-verbaux ou actes de r\u00e9partition, *** et au paiement de toute dette municipale.\nC\u2019est dans cette \u00e9num\u00e9ration que figurent les mots \u201cqualit\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re\u201d, et il est raisonnable de penser qu\u2019ils y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9s pour les m\u00eames fins que tous les autres objets de cette \u00e9num\u00e9ration, surtout si l\u2019on songe que l\u2019insertion des noms des propri\u00e9taires d\u2019immeubles n\u2019est pas exig\u00e9e par l\u2019article 654 parmi les particularit\u00e9s qui \u201cdoivent \u00eatre port\u00e9es au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation\u201d; mais que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le sous-paragraphe 6 de cet article, les noms des propri\u00e9taires ne sont ins\u00e9r\u00e9s que \u201cs\u2019ils sont connus\u201d. Il s\u2019ensuit que l\u2019indication des propri\u00e9taires dans le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation n\u2019est pas une partie essentielle de ce r\u00f4le. Aussi lorsque l\u2019article, parlant du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, d\u00e9clare que ce r\u00f4le sert de base \u00e0 la \u201cqualit\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re\u201d, ou \u201cqualification fonci\u00e8re\u201d ou \u201cimmoveable property qualification\u201d, il est logique d\u2019entendre ces mots comme se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e et \u00e0 la notion de valeur ou d\u2019\u00e9valuation. La valeur ou \u00e9valuation est d\u2019ailleurs la seule chose sur laquelle les estimateurs, en pr\u00e9parant le r\u00f4le, sont appel\u00e9s \u00e0 se prononcer. Or, cette conclusion est conforme \u00e0 la jurisprudence constante de la province de Qu\u00e9bec; et nous croyons que M. le juge Galipeault, dans son jugement, donne une id\u00e9e exacte de la situation, lorsqu\u2019il dit:\nNos tribunaux ont toujours interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019expression \u201cqualit\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re\u201d comme voulant dire le cens d\u2019\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 ou le cens requis pour exercer un droit ou une fonction en vertu du droit municipal.\nIl cite plusieurs jugements \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette observation et il conclut:\nIl ne para\u00eet pas contest\u00e9 aujourd\u2019hui que le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation ne fait pas preuve de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9; qu\u2019il constitue simplement et uniquement une preuve p\u00e9remptoire de la valeur des biens-fonds qui y sont port\u00e9s.\nNous avons d\u2019abord \u00e0 examiner la port\u00e9e de deux arr\u00eats assez anciens: McDonald v. Quinn[6] et In re Les listes \u00e9lectorales de Kamouraska[7], qui, \u00e0 notre humble avis, n\u2019ont pas d\u2019application \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause, parce que les questions en litige \u00e9taient sans analogie avec celle qui est d\u00e9battue dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce actuelle, et parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 de lois et de textes diff\u00e9rents.\nMcDonald v. Quinn[8] est un jugement de 1854, de beaucoup ant\u00e9rieur au premier Code Municipal. Le d\u00e9bat \u00e9tait quant \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de certains votes donn\u00e9s \u00e0 une \u00e9lection municipale de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec; et l\u2019on a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les juges \u00e9taient li\u00e9s par les listes \u00e9lectorales pr\u00e9par\u00e9es par le conseil. Le rapport fait voir (p. 463) que l\u2019ordonnance qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019appliquer (3 et 4 Vict. c. 35, sec. 19) se lisait comme suit:\nIt is provided that it shall be lawful for the said council of the said city, by a by-law or by-laws to be enacted in this behalf, to make a provision for the making of lists and the registration of all persons qualified to vote at the elections of Councillors and other city officers in the said city, whereby the right to vote at such elections may be determined.\nLa cour a jug\u00e9 que la liste des \u00e9lecteurs faite en vertu de cette ordonnance \u00e9tait d\u00e9finitive et devait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme concluante du droit de voter \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9lection. Comme on le voit, le texte de l\u2019ordonnance \u00e9tait d\u00e9cisif et ne pouvait se comparer \u00e0 celui des articles 771 et 243 ou 670 C.M.\nDans In re Les listes \u00e9lectorales du Comt\u00e9 de Kamouraska7, la question soulev\u00e9e \u00e9tait celle de savoir quel \u00e9tait le devoir du secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier de la municipalit\u00e9, lorsqu\u2019il pr\u00e9parait la liste des \u00e9lecteurs conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019Acte \u00e9lectoral de Qu\u00e9bec de 1875 (e. 7 de 38 Vict.). Le texte qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter \u00e9tait le suivant:\n12. Chaque ann\u00e9e, du premier au quinze du mois de mars, le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier de toute municipalit\u00e9 devra faire, en double, une liste par ordre alphab\u00e9tique des personnes qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation alors en force dans la municipalit\u00e9 pour les fins locales, et tel que revis\u00e9 s\u2019il l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00eame seulement pour des fins locales, paraissent \u00eatre \u00e9lecteurs, \u00e0 raison des biens-fonds poss\u00e9d\u00e9s ou occup\u00e9s par elles dans la municipalit\u00e9.\nL\u2019honorable juge Taschereau d\u00e9cida qu\u2019en vertu de ce texte seules les personnes inscrites au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation pouvaient \u00eatre port\u00e9es sur la liste des \u00e9lecteurs par le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier; et voici comment il d\u00e9finit lui-m\u00eame l\u2019effet de sa d\u00e9cision (p. 309) :\nLe l\u00e9gislateur a donc voulu, il me semble; 1\u00b0 que le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation soit conclusif quant \u00e0 la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9; 2\u00b0 que personne ne soit sur la liste des \u00e9lecteurs s\u2019il n\u2019est sur le r\u00f4le; 3\u00b0 que tous ceux qui apparaissent qualifi\u00e9s par le r\u00f4le soient sur la liste \u00e9lectorale,\u2019 \u00e0 moins de disqualification personnelle de nature \u00e0 ne pouvoir appara\u00eetre sur le r\u00f4le.\nSa conclusion sur le point qu\u2019il avait \u00e0 juger fut que\nLe secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier n\u2019a donc aucun droit de corriger le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation; la loi lui dit, au contraire, de le suivre et de ne suivre que le r\u00f4le.\nIl semblerait, en effet, que le texte de l\u2019article 12 de l\u2019Acte Electoral imposait cette conclusion. Mais, en outre que la question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider \u00e9tait toute diff\u00e9rente de celle qui nous occupe, il est facile de voir que la loi s\u2019exprimait de fa\u00e7on tout autre que ce que nous trouvons dans les articles 771 et 243 ou 670 C.M. Sans doute, au cours de ses notes, l\u2019honorable juge discute la port\u00e9e de l\u2019article 743 C.M. qui correspondait alors \u00e0 l\u2019article 670 actuel. Mais il reste que cette discussion n\u2019\u00e9tait nullement n\u00e9cessaire pour les fins de la d\u00e9cision; et il semble qu\u2019on doive interpr\u00e9ter ce qu\u2019il dit en ayant \u00e9gard \u00e0 la question qui lui \u00e9tait alors soumise. Si toutefois on voulait donner plus d\u2019ampleur \u00e0 ce jugement, il faudrait alors dire que l\u2019opinion qui y est exprim\u00e9e sur la port\u00e9e de l\u2019article 743 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par la suite et que la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec a \u00e9t\u00e9 constamment et uniform\u00e9ment dans le sens contraire.\nL\u2019arr\u00eat de Kamouraska date de 1877. D\u00e8s 1875, dans la cause de Gratton v. Ste-Scholastique[9], il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation ne faisait preuve que de la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas\ndestin\u00e9 \u00e0 prouver qu\u2019un tel est propri\u00e9taire, occupant ou locataire d\u2019un tel bien-fonds, surtout lors d\u2019un \u00e9v\u00e9nement futur. *** C\u2019est l\u2019\u00e9valuation qu\u2019on a voulu \u00e9tablir par le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le S.R.C. c. 6, s. 5, signifie: Document contenant un \u00e9tat de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nL\u2019honorable juge Mathieu, de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, \u00e0 deux reprises, en 1886, dans la cause de Filiatrault v. Corporation, de St-Zotique[10], et en 1888, dans la cause de Coupal v. Corporation de St-Jacques le Mineur[11], a jug\u00e9 que le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation ne fait foi que de l\u2019estimation des biensfonds, et qu\u2019il ne fait pas preuve des autres \u00e9nonciations.\nEn 1890, dans la cause de Vinet v. Fletcher[12], l\u2019honorable juge Cimon avait jug\u00e9 que\ncelui dont le nom est inscrit sur le r\u00f4le comme propri\u00e9taire d\u2019un terrain estim\u00e9 \u00e0 la valeur requise, mais qui r\u00e9ellement n\u2019a jamais poss\u00e9d\u00e9 ce terrain et n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire, n\u2019a pas droit de vote.\nEt des d\u00e9cisions au m\u00eame effet ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues, en 1896, dans Cadot v. Pelletier[13]; en 1901, dans Tremblay v. M\u00e9nard[14]: \u201cLe r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation ne fait pas foi de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais seulement de la valeur\".\nA son tour, l\u2019honorable juge Dorion, dans la cause de Lajramboise v. Ladouceur[15], d\u00e9cide, en 1904, que\nc\u2019est la qualit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9lecteur lors de l\u2019\u00e9lection qu\u2019il faut consid\u00e9rer, et non celle qui peut appara\u00eetre au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation; mais si un \u00e9lecteur qui pr\u00eate serment et vote comme occupant a cess\u00e9 depuis deux mois, lors de l\u2019\u00e9lection, d\u2019habiter la maison sur laquelle il se qualifie, son vote doit \u00eatre mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nPuis viennent les deux d\u00e9cisions de l\u2019honorable juge de Lorimier, en 1907 et en 1909, dans les deux causes (qui portent le m\u00eame titre) de Perrault v. Beaudry[16]. Au cours de son jugement dans la premi\u00e8re de ces causes, l\u2019honorable juge dit:\nIl est \u00e9vident qu\u2019il ne suffit pas d\u2019\u00eatre inscrit au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation pour avoir droit de vote; mais il faut de plus, au moment o\u00f9 l\u2019on veut exercer ses droits et privil\u00e8ges comme \u00e9lecteur municipal, poss\u00e9der aussi les autres capacit\u00e9s exig\u00e9es par la loi sous l\u2019article 291 (maintenant 243). * * * En cons\u00e9quence, n\u2019est pas \u00e9lecteur qualifi\u00e9 \u00e0 voter \u00e0 une \u00e9lection municipale, ni \u00e0 contester une \u00e9lection municipale, celui qui, bien que port\u00e9 au r\u00f4le comme locataire d\u2019un terrain estim\u00e9 suffisamment, en fait, lors de l\u2019\u00e9lection, ne poss\u00e9dait plus ce terrain ni comme propri\u00e9taire, ni comme locataire, ni comme occupant.\nEn 1910, re Desjardins v. Leclerc[17], sir Fran\u00e7ois Lemieux, juge-en-chef de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de la province, d\u00e9cide que les mots le cens d\u2019\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 devant \u00eatre \u00e9tabli par le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation (dans l\u2019article 108 de l\u2019Acte des Cit\u00e9s et Villes) se rapportent uniquement \u00e0 la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 (p. 372).\nAu cours de son jugement, il dit ce qui suit (p. 373):\nOr, le r\u00f4le ne fait pas preuve de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, car un tel peut y para\u00eetre propri\u00e9taire et cependant ne pas l\u2019\u00eatre. On en voit des exemples fr\u00e9quents. * * * La seule chose certaine que le r\u00f4le constate, c\u2019est la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la quotit\u00e9 ou la quantit\u00e9 de biens requise pour donner le cens de l\u2019\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9.\nEn 1911, dans la cause de Levasseur v. Pelletier[18], la question vint devant la Cour de Revision, compos\u00e9e des honorables juges Lemieux, juge-en-chef, Cannon et Letellier. Dans le jugement de la cour, qui confirmait le jugement de l\u2019honorable juge Cimon, le juge-en-chef de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure dit ce qui suit (p. 494):\nPelletier a soutenu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait port\u00e9 sur le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation de la ville de Fraserville comme propri\u00e9taire de cet immeuble. L\u2019inscription de son nom sur le r\u00f4le ne faisait qu\u2019\u00e9tablir une pr\u00e9somption de propri\u00e9taire qui pouvait \u00eatre d\u00e9truite par une preuve au contraire.\nL\u2019honorable juge Letellier, en 1917, dans la cause de Lapointe v. Cauchon[19], juge comme suit:\nAu point de vue du cens \u00e9lectoral, le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation constitue une preuve peremptoire de la valeur des biens qui y sont port\u00e9s; mais il ne fait pas preuve de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nL\u2019un des consid\u00e9rants se lit comme suit (p. 396):\nConsid\u00e9rant que le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation est fait pour \u00e9tablir la valeur immobili\u00e8re et, quant \u00e0 la qualification des personnes, fait preuve prima facie mais peut toujours \u00eatre contredit par une preuve directe; vu que c\u2019est au moment de la mise en nomination que la qualification doit avoir lieu, il est permis de contredire le r\u00f4le lors de la mise en nomination, comme il est permis de le contredire apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9lection, si le maire ou le conseiller perd sa qualification.\nEn 1919, la Cour de R\u00e9vision de Qu\u00e9bec est encore saisie de cette question, dans la cause de Parent v. Bouchard[20]. La cour est compos\u00e9e de sir Fran\u00e7ois Lemieux, juge-en-chef, et de MM. les juges Letellier et Belleau. M. le juge Belleau, pronon\u00e7ant le jugement de la majorit\u00e9 de la cour, dit entre autres choses (p. 413):\nOn sait qu\u2019en effet, si le r\u00f4le fait foi de la valeur des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qui y sont port\u00e9es, il ne fait pas foi du droit m\u00eame de propri\u00e9t\u00e9. C\u2019est ce qui a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par nos cours de justice.\nEt si l\u2019honorable juge-en-chef de la cour, dans cette cause, se d\u00e9clare dissident, c\u2019est parce qu\u2019il exprime l\u2019opinion que, non seulement le r\u00f4le ne fait pas preuve de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais que les charges et hypoth\u00e8ques qui gr\u00e8vent l\u2019immeuble doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9duites non de la valeur port\u00e9e au r\u00f4le, mais \u201cde la valeur r\u00e9elle que l\u2019immeuble peut r\u00e9ellement avoir\u201d (p. 415); et la majorit\u00e9 de la cour ne voulait pas aller aussi loin.\nEnfin, en 1926, le m\u00eame principe est de nouveau affirm\u00e9 par l\u2019honorable juge Dorion dans la cause de Beno\u00eet v. Phaneuf et la Corporation de St-Antoine-sur-Richelieu[21].\nNous avons tenu \u00e0 faire cette revue de la jurisprudence aussi compl\u00e8te que possible afin de d\u00e9montrer la persistance avec laquelle, depuis 1875, les tribunaux de la province ont toujours d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation est d\u00e9finitif seulement quant \u00e0 la valeur des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qui y figure, et que la mention au r\u00f4le de la qualit\u00e9 de propri\u00e9taire est peut\u00eatre une preuve prima facie mais n\u2019est pas concluante, et elle peut toujours \u00eatre contredite.\nCette s\u00e9rie de d\u00e9cisions \u00e9tablit non seulement une uniformit\u00e9 d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation judiciaire ininterrompue et qui remonte jusqu\u2019aux premiers temps de l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur du Code Municipal, mais l\u2019on peut en d\u00e9duire \u00e9galement que cette mani\u00e8re de voir est v\u00e9ritablement entr\u00e9e dans la pratique courante des affaires municipales de la province et que c\u2019est ainsi que la chose a \u00e9t\u00e9 comprise et appliqu\u00e9e dans l\u2019administration municipale.\nCe qui donne encore plus d\u2019importance \u00e0 cette revue, c\u2019est qu\u2019il ne s\u2019y trouve pas un seul jugement en sens contraire. Il y a seulement l\u2019opinion de l\u2019honorable juge Taschereau, dans la cause de Kamouraska[22], en 1877, exprim\u00e9e dans un litige o\u00f9 la question qui nous occupe ne se pr\u00e9sentait pas. Il est peut-\u00eatre significatif que, lors de l\u2019audition, le savant procureur de rappelante a pratiquement abandonn\u00e9 ce moyen d\u2019appel; et que, d\u2019ailleurs, les avocats des parties ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9s par la cour de lui envoyer une liste des jugements de part et d\u2019autre sur cette question, alors que les procureurs des intim\u00e9s en ont fourni une s\u00e9rie imposante soutenant le point de vue que nous pr\u00e9conisons et d\u2019o\u00f9 nous avons tir\u00e9, en grande partie, les arr\u00eats que nous avons examin\u00e9s, l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pu en soumettre aucun dans le sens oppos\u00e9.\nPendant que la jurisprudence et la pratique de la province de Qu\u00e9bec s\u2019affirmaient ainsi avec persistance, le Code Municipal a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement refondu en 1916. C\u2019est le code que nous avons actuellement. A cette \u00e9poque, les d\u00e9cisions de nos tribunaux avaient invariablement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019article 743 du code (maintenant l\u2019article 670) de la fa\u00e7on que nous avons montr\u00e9e; et cependant, en 1916, la l\u00e9gislature n\u2019a pas modifi\u00e9 le texte de l\u2019article dans le but d\u2019indiquer une intention contraire \u00e0 celle que lui avait donn\u00e9e la jurisprudence.\nA cet \u00e9gard, nous tenons \u00e0 r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 ce que dit le Conseil Priv\u00e9, dans la cause de Casgrain v. Atlantic and NorthWest Railway Co.[23]:\nTheir Lordships cannot assume that the Dominion Legislature, when they adopted the clause verbatim in the year 1888, were in ignorance of the judicial interpretation which it had received. It must, on the contrary, be assumed that they understood that sect. 12 of the Canadian Act must have been acted upon in the light of that interpretation. In these circumstances their Lordships, even if they had entertained doubts as to the meaning of sect. 12 of the Act of 1888, wold have declined to disturb the construction of its language which had been judicially affirmed.\nCe principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 de nouveau r\u00e9affirm\u00e9, de fa\u00e7on encore plus pr\u00e9cise, si possible, par le Conseil Priv\u00e9, dans la cause de Webb v. Outrim[24], o\u00f9 nous trouvons ce passage, que nous extrayons du jugement prononc\u00e9 par le Lord Chancelier, The Earl of Halsbury:\nIt is quite true, as observed by Griffith C.J., in the above-mentioned case of D\u2019Emden v. Pedder[25] that: \u201cWhen a particular form of legislative enactment which has received authoritative interpretation, whether by judicial decision or by a long course of practice, is adopted in the framing of a later statute, it is a sound rule of construction to hold that the words so adopted were intended by the Legislature to bear the meaning which has been so put upon them.\u201d\nDans la cause de Gagnon v. Lemay[26], le tr\u00e8s honorable juge-en-chef de cette cour disait, \u00e0 la page 374:\nThe wisdom of not overruling judical decisions of some years\u2019 standing, where numerous contracts must have been made and moneys paid on the footing of the law as established by them, and of not breaking away from previous decisions upon the construction of a well known document in constant use for a number of years, even in cases where, were the matters res integra, a different view might have prevailed is fully recognized in the English system of jurisprudence. Palmer v. Johnson[27]; Dunlop & Sons v. Balfour, Williamson & Co.[28]. I cannot think that anything so mischievous as unsettling the law in regard to matters affecting rights of property should be countenanced by courts administering the civil law. That would seem to have been the view of the learned judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench in the present case.\nLa r\u00e8gle ainsi pos\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 souvent suivie par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 (Ruckmaboye v. Mottichund[29]; Evanturel v. Evanturel[30]; Migneault v. Malo[31].\nEt si le principe est vrai en mati\u00e8re de contrat et de droit priv\u00e9, \u00e0 plus forte raison doit-il en \u00eatre ainsi dans les affaires municipales qui, par leur nature m\u00eame, sont davantage susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre port\u00e9es \u00e0 la connaissance du public. Voici ce que disait, dans la cause de City of Montreal v. Dupr\u00e9[32], notre coll\u00e8gue, M. le juge Duff, \u00e0 la page 255:\nThe authority of decided cases, it is needless to say, in the province of Quebec, stands upon a footing which is not the same as that upon which it is based in the law of England. Nevertheless, the central idea of stare decisis has not often been better expressed than in the sentence of Paul: \u201cMinime sunt mutanda ea qu\u00e6 interpretationem certam semper habuerunt\u201d D.I. 3, 23; and the importance of adhering to an interpretation of a statute given in an authoritative decision which has been accepted for many years without challenge is recognized by writers on the French law; for example, I.B.L., section 261. It is impossible to suppose that the legal advisers of municipalities governed by the Towns Act and of municipalities governed by the Municipal Code have not been familiar, since the appearance of the report, with the decision in Chambly v. Lamoureux[33], or that they have failed to treat it as an authoritative exposition of section 943 in the sense ascribed to the decision by Mr. Justice Mathieu in the note quoted above; I cannot doubt that it must have been acted upon in that sense.\n(et, au sujet de ce jugement, voir ce que dit le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Canadian Spool Cotton Company Ltd. v. City of Montreal)[34].\nIl est \u00e0 peine besoin d\u2019ajouter, apr\u00e8s ce que nous venons de dire, que, contrairement \u00e0 la crainte exprim\u00e9e par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, en annulant les votes des non-propri\u00e9taires, comme la Cour du Banc du Roi a unanimement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019elle en avait le droit, elle ne \u201cporte pas atteinte au r\u00f4le\u201d et elle ne s\u2019est pas trouv\u00e9e virtuellement \u00e0 corriger le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation ou \u00e0 l\u2019annuler partiellement puisqu\u2019il ne fait pas preuve de la qualit\u00e9 de propri\u00e9taire (il ne doit m\u00eame mentionner les noms des propri\u00e9taires que \u201cs\u2019ils sont connus\u201d\u2014C.M. art. 654-6); et pour cette autre raison que: prouver qu\u2019une personne n\u2019est pas propri\u00e9taire au moment du vote n\u2019est pas contredire le fait qu\u2019elle l\u2019aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 plusieurs mois auparavant, lors de l\u2019homologation du r\u00f4le.\nNous sommes donc d\u2019accord avec tous les juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi pour d\u00e9cider que le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure doit \u00eatre mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nCela \u00e9tant, nous partageons l\u2019avis du juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi \u00e0 l\u2019effet que, en retranchant les votes des non-propri\u00e9taires au moment du vote, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve faite \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate, il ne reste pas en faveur du r\u00e8glement une majorit\u00e9 d\u2019au moins les deux tiers en valeur immobili\u00e8re. Nous adoptons sur ce point le raisonnement de MM. les juges Bond et Galipeault, qui ont exprim\u00e9 le point de vue de la majorit\u00e9 de la cour, tant sur la question des ventes \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 que sur la question des promesses de vente. (Sirois v. Carrier[35]; Salvas v. Vassal[36]. Cela est suffisant pour disposer de l\u2019appel.\nLe Code Municipal divise les personnes, relativement aux biens-fonds, en trois cat\u00e9gories qu\u2019il d\u00e9finit: les propri\u00e9taires (art. 16, parag. 20), les occupants (art. 16, parag. 21) et les locataires (art. 16, parag. 22). Nous sommes d\u2019avis que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les termes et conditions stipul\u00e9s aux contrats qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits, celle des parties contractantes qui correspond au propri\u00e9taire, dans le sens de l\u2019article 771 C.M. et suivant la d\u00e9finition du paragraphe 20 de l\u2019article 16 C.M., est l\u2019acheteur, dans les ventes \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, et le promettant vendeur, dans les promesses de vente. Il est \u00e9vident que, sur un r\u00e8glement d\u2019emprunt, deux personnes ne peuvent voter comme propri\u00e9taires \u00e0 raison du m\u00eame immeuble. Entre le vendeur et l\u2019acheteur dans les ventes \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 dont il s\u2019agit, comme aussi entre le promettant acheteur et le promettant vendeur dans les promesses de vente en question, il nous para\u00eet que celui \u00e0 qui appartient le vote, comme propri\u00e9taire, accord\u00e9 par l\u2019article 771, c\u2019est, dans le premier cas, l\u2019acheteur sujet \u00e0 la clause de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 (art. 1553 C.C.; Pothier, de la Vente, n\u00b0 387, cit\u00e9 par les codificateurs sous arts. 1546 et suiv. C.C. Voir aussi Cour de Cassation, 23 ao\u00fbt 1871\u2014D. 73. 1. 321) et, dans le second cas, le prometteur vendeur. A cause des stipulations sp\u00e9ciales contenues dans les actes, l\u2019application de l\u2019article 1478 C.C. est \u00e9cart\u00e9e. Pour les fins de l\u2019article 771, il ne faut pas faire \u00e9tat de la possession actuelle ou physique de l\u2019immeuble, puisque, sur ce point, l\u2019article est clair: La majorit\u00e9 qui est requise est celle des\ndeux tiers * * * de tous les propri\u00e9taires r\u00e9sidant ou non dans la municipalit\u00e9.\nNotre conclusion rend inutile toute discussion sur la motion des intim\u00e9s pour casser l\u2019inscription en Cour Supr\u00eame, par suite du fait que le mis-en-cause Joseph Couturier n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9 devant cette cour. Les intim\u00e9s en avaient fait une question de juridiction, mais nous ne serions pas pr\u00eats \u00e0 admettre cette pr\u00e9tention Dans la cause de La Corporation de la Paroisse de St-Gervais v. Goulet[37], un point analogue a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 sur le m\u00e9rite de l\u2019appel. Ici, l\u2019appelante faisait porter son appel sur toute la cause: r\u00e8glement, r\u00e9solution et contrat. M\u00eame si l\u2019on pouvait dire que l\u2019inscription en Cour Supr\u00eame \u00e9tait insuffisante quant au contrat, \u00e0 cause de l\u2019absence de Couturier, l\u2019une des parties contractantes, il y avait quand m\u00eame juridiction au moins pour d\u00e9cider cela. Il reste que nous ne pouvions nous prononcer sur la question de ce contrat sans que Couturier f\u00fbt intim\u00e9 devant cette cour. A la suite de la motion, nous avons ordonn\u00e9 sa mise en cause, qui \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire. La motion a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 utile et les frais de cette motion devront suivre le sort de l\u2019appel.\nNous confirmerions le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi avec d\u00e9pens.\nCannon J. (dissenting).\u2014Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi, rendu \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec le 31 mars 1931, infirmant un jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure du district du Saguenay, du 19 novembre 1930, par l\u2019honorable juge Bouffard, rejetant l\u2019action en invalidation d\u2019un r\u00e8glement et autres actes municipaux. Deux des savants juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi enregistr\u00e8rent leur dissentiment.\nLe mis-en-cause Joseph Couturier \u00e9tait l\u2019un des intim\u00e9s devant la Cour du Banc du Roi, mais il n\u2019a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d\u2019appeler du jugement de cette cour qui annulait la vente de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la corporation municipale. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019audition devant cette cour, par une motion pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 23 novembre 1931, la corporation municipale a demand\u00e9 une r\u00e9audition pour demander le renvoi de l\u2019appel pour manque de juridiction, pour les raisons suivantes:\n1. The action taken by respondents, plaintiffs in the Superior Court, was to set aside as illegal and ultra vires by-law number 145 as it had not been approved by the required majority in number and value of the proprietors of immoveable properties qualified to vote thereon and also certain resolutions and proceedings passed and made by the said corporation on the strength of the said illegal by-law;\n2. The respondents had also prayed the court to set aside a certain contract or deed of sale from Joseph Couturier (mis-en-cause in the Superior Court and in the Court of King\u2019s Bench) to the appellant corporation before J. Rolland Warren, N.P., the 3rd of October, 1930, by which the said corporation had purchased a property therein described for the sum of $9,500 to build the required dams for the construction of an electric system in the Village of La Malbaie and its environments;\n3. The respondents\u2019 action in the Superior Court was dismissed by judgment of Mr. Justice Bouffard on the 19th of November, 1930;\n4. The respondents appealed from this judgment to the Court of King\u2019s Bench and Joseph Couturier, mis-en-cause in the Superior Court, was made a party to the said appeal, notice of which was duly served on him;\n5. The judgment of the Superior Court was reversed by judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench rendered the 31st of March, 1931, and the court declared the said by-law number 145 null and of no effect, as likewise the certificate of the secretary-treasurer purporting to establish that the said by-law has been duly approved by two-thirds of the electors being proprietors in the said municipality who had voted in respect to the said by-law; and further cancelled and annulled a deed of sale passed before Mtre. J. Rolland Warren, notary public, bearing date the thirtieth day of October, 1930, by Joseph Couturier to the said corporation respondent; and also declared null and void the three resolutions adopted by the council of the said corporation respondent on the second day of October, 1930, providing respectively for the authorization of the mayor and the secretary treasurer to sign the said contract, calling for tenders for the purchase of the said debentures, and for the execution of the works mentioned in the said by-law.\n6. The appellant corporation appealed from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench to this court on the 14th of April, 1931, but failed to call Joseph Couturier before this court;\n7. The judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench is therefore final (res judicata) as to the nullity of the contract of the third of October, 1930, passed between the appellant corporation and Joseph Couturier and consequently this question is not in controversy before this court;\n8. The only question in controversy before this court is that of the validity of by-law number 145 of the appellant corporation, providing for the construction of an electric system in the village and its environments and of the three resolutions passed by the appellant corporation on the second of October, 1930, and providing for tenders for the sale of the bonds to be issued in execution of the by-law and for the works to be executed in conformity with the said by-law; and for the signature of the contract;\n9. There is, therefore, in this appeal before the Supreme Court of Canada no amount, value or matter in controversy exceeding the sum of $2,000. Quand cette motion fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, cette cour ordonna de signifier \u00e0 Couturier copie des proc\u00e9dures sur le pr\u00e9sent appel; et ce dernier a produit un factum o\u00f9, renon\u00e7ant au droit de se faire entendre, il soumet que, en vertu de l\u2019article 354 et de la sous-section (a) de l\u2019article 356 du Code Municipal, la municipalit\u00e9, par simple r\u00e9solution, avait le droit d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir son terrain, que cette r\u00e9solution a (\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment adopt\u00e9e, et, n\u2019ayant jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e dans les trois mois par une action en nullit\u00e9 devant la Cour de Circuit ou la Cour de Magistrat, \u00e9tait maintenant inattaquable; et le mis-en-cause adopte pour le surplus les conclusions de rappelante, se r\u00e9servant tout recours futur en vertu de son contrat.\nDans ces conditions, les intim\u00e9s peuvent-ils demander le renvoi de l\u2019appel parce que la nullit\u00e9 du contrat serait chose jug\u00e9e entre eux et Joseph Couturier, et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence le seul point en litige devant nous serait la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019approbation du r\u00e8glement num\u00e9ro 145, ce qui ne laisserait pas un montant en litige exc\u00e9dant $2,000?\nComme j\u2019ai eu l\u2019occasion de le dire dans la cause de Prudential Trust Company v. Leduc & al., suivant une d\u00e9cision de la Cour de Cassation du 9 janvier 1905 rapport\u00e9e dans Sirey, 1907, 1, 13:\nLorsqu\u2019une d\u00e9cision de justice n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9e d\u2019appel que par quelques-unes seulement des parties qui y figuraient, la d\u00e9cision nouvelle qui intervient sur l\u2019appel de ces parties n\u2019a d\u2019effet qu\u2019\u00e0 leur \u00e9gard; en ce qui concerne les parties non appelantes, la premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision conserve toute sa force et acquiert l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de chose jug\u00e9e, quelles que soient les erreurs de fait ou de droit dont elle serait entach\u00e9e.\nMais cette r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale admet une premi\u00e8re exception lorsque le litige est indivisible, n\u2019est susceptible que d\u2019une seule et m\u00eame solution. En ce cas, l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 par une des parties profite aux autres et rel\u00e8ve celles-ci de la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance qu\u2019elles ont encourue, soit en ne faisant pas appel dans le d\u00e9lai, soit en acquies\u00e7ant au jugement.\nLa demande en nullit\u00e9 de vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme indivisible (S. 1902, I. 316). Voir Glasson et Tissier, Pr\u00e9cis de Proc\u00e9dure Civile, 1929, p. 299 et suivantes.\nL\u2019ordonnance de cette cour, la signification des proc\u00e9dures et la comparution du mis-en-cause placent ce dernier suffisamment devant nous pour r\u00e9gulariser l\u2019appel et nous permettre de d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelante avait le droit d\u2019acheter et de payer le terrain par lui vendu. Dans cette cause, contrairement \u00e0 ce qui s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire de StGervais v. Goulet (1), cette cour, ayant \u00e0 sa disposition le moyen de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 l\u2019insuffisance de l\u2019inscription en appel, l\u2019a fait. Les frais de la motion devant nous devront suivre le sort de l\u2019appel.\nQuant au m\u00e9rite des questions soulev\u00e9es devant nous, l\u2019appelante a d\u2019abord pr\u00e9tendu que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure n\u2019avait pas juridiction pour entendre la pr\u00e9sente cause. Sur cette question de proc\u00e9dure, et vu qu\u2019il s\u2019agit, entre autres choses, de l\u2019annulation d\u2019un contrat de $9,500, je crois devoir mettre ce moyen de c\u00f4t\u00e9 et me rallier aux opinions exprim\u00e9s \u00e0 ce sujet par tous les juges en cette affaire.\nIl nous faut ensuite accepter ou rejeter les raisons de l\u2019honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance qui, sans scruter la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 des votes qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9s en faveur du r\u00e8glement, a accept\u00e9 comme \u00e9lecteurs d\u00fbment qualifi\u00e9s ceux dont les noms apparaissaient comme propri\u00e9taires au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation en vigueur lors de la votation sur ce r\u00e8glement 145, par les consid\u00e9rants suivants:\nConsid\u00e9rant que le vote a eu lieu sur le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation alors en vigueur, et que ce r\u00f4le n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 attaqu\u00e9, et qu\u2019il ne l\u2019est pas par la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure;\nConsid\u00e9rant que pour une corporation et ses contribuables, le r\u00f4le en vigueur sert de base pour la valeur fonci\u00e8re, l\u2019imposition des taxes, et pour la qualit\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re des contribuables;\nConsid\u00e9rant qu\u2019au point de vue municipal, les propri\u00e9taires de biensfonds sont ceux qui sont inscrits comme tels au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation en vigueur, lequel lie la corporation et ses contribuables;\nConsid\u00e9rant que si, au moment de la confection du r\u00f4le, la corporation entre comme propri\u00e9taires les personnes qui ne le sont pas, ceci peut constituer une irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 ou m\u00eame une ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 qui peut donner lieu \u00e0 faire corriger le r\u00f4le en la mani\u00e8re voulue par la loi, mais ne peut pas constituer une nullit\u00e9 absolue des actes faits par ceux qui sont inscrits au r\u00f4le comme propri\u00e9taires, lesquels sont en possession des droits et obligations du vrai propri\u00e9taire, au point de vue municipal, et doivent en supporter les cons\u00e9quences;\nConsid\u00e9rant que cette cour, en annulant les votes, tel que demand\u00e9, se trouverait virtuellement \u00e0 corriger le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, ou m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019annuler partiellement, ce que cette cour ne peut faire ni directement ni indirectement;\nConsid\u00e9rant que le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, lors du vote, \u00e9tait la seule base du vote et qu\u2019il doit rester tel, et que cette cour ne serait pas justifiable d\u2019annuler les votes tel que demand\u00e9, la corporation n\u2019ayant commisaucune faute en laissant voter les \u00e9lecteurs qui avaient droit de le faire, n\u2019ayant encouru aucune nullit\u00e9, et qu\u2019annuler ces votes serait mettre la corporation dans une impasse inextinguible; Cette doctrine ne semble pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par aucun des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nIl est admis de part et d\u2019autre que le r\u00e8glement devait \u00eatre soumis \u00e0 l\u2019approbation des \u00e9lecteurs, en vertu de l\u2019article 771 du code municipal, qui exige que le r\u00e8glement, sur lequel doivent voter au moins les deux cinqui\u00e8mes en nombre des propri\u00e9taires de biens-fonds imposables de la municipalit\u00e9, qui sont \u00e9lecteurs municipaux et qui r\u00e9sident dans la municipalit\u00e9, soit approuv\u00e9 par une majorit\u00e9 d\u2019au moins les deux tiers, en nombre et en valeur immobili\u00e8re, de tous les propri\u00e9taires, r\u00e9sidant ou non dans la municipalit\u00e9, qui ont vot\u00e9 et qui ont droit de voter sur ce r\u00e8glement, ainsi que par le lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil.\nLe code municipal, \u00e0 l\u2019article 379, nous dit que le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier de la corporation locale est tenu d\u2019assister \u00e0 l\u2019assembl\u00e9e des \u00e9lecteurs convoqu\u00e9e pour approuver ou d\u00e9sapprouver un r\u00e8glement \u201cavec l\u2019original ou une copie certifi\u00e9e du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation en vigueur\u201d; il y agit comme greffier de l\u2019assembl\u00e9e.\nL\u2019article 275 s\u2019applique; et, en cons\u00e9quence, quiconque se pr\u00e9sente pour voter doit, s\u2019il en est requis par le pr\u00e9sident ou par un \u00e9lecteur, jurer ce qui suit:\nJe jure que je suis sujet britannique, que rien ne m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 ou promis pour m\u2019engager \u00e0 voter \u00e0 cette \u00e9lection, que je suis habile \u00e0 voter \u00e0 cette \u00e9lection, que je suis \u00e2g\u00e9 d\u2019au moins vingt et un ans, et que je n\u2019ai pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 vot\u00e9 \u00e0 cette \u00e9lection.\nCette formule compl\u00e8te le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, en permettant d\u2019avoir des renseignements quant \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire, que le r\u00f4le ne doit mentionner que pour les fils du propri\u00e9taire\u2014C.M. 654 \u00a7\u00a7 10 et 11\u2014et pour l\u2019indentifier. Si l\u2019\u00e9lecteur refuse de pr\u00eater ce serment, son vote doit \u00eatre refus\u00e9.\nEn vertu de l\u2019article 267:\nQuiconque vote \u00e0 une \u00e9lection sans avoir, au moment o\u00f9 il donne son vote, les qualit\u00e9s requises d\u2019un \u00e9lecteur, encourt une amende de vingt piastres.\nRemarquons que les articles 228 et 229 vont beaucoup plus loin quand il s\u2019agit du maire et des conseillers, qui ne peuvent exercer ces fonctions \u00e0 moins qu\u2019ils ne poss\u00e8dent en tout temps le cens d\u2019\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 et les qualit\u00e9s requises par la loi.\nQuoi qu\u2019il en soit, les demandeurs \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents et ont vot\u00e9 et pouvaient, comme \u00e9lecteurs, demander l\u2019assermentation de tout \u00e9lecteur qu\u2019ils consid\u00e9raient inhabile \u00e0 voter. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le proc\u00e8s-verbal, ils ne sont pas intervenus pour se pr\u00e9valoir de ce droit.\nIl appert, \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution certifiant le r\u00e9sultat de la votation de ce r\u00e8glement num\u00e9ro 145, que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le cahier de votation et le certificat du secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier, deux cent vingt-neuf voteurs ont vot\u00e9, que quatre voteurs ont refus\u00e9 de pr\u00eater serment sur objection et n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 admis \u00e0 voter, que plus des deux cinqui\u00e8mes des voteurs ayant vot\u00e9, la votation a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e close, approuvant le r\u00e8glement. De plus, ce r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par le lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 388, ne doit approuver un r\u00e8glement qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir eu la preuve de l\u2019accomplissement des formalit\u00e9s requises pour la passation de tel r\u00e8glement.\nQui \u00e9tait habile \u00e0 voter sur ce r\u00e8glement? quels propri\u00e9taires?\nDoit \u00eatre inscrite au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation comme propri\u00e9taire, nous dit le paragraphe 20 de l\u2019article 16 du code municipal:\ntoute personne ayant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou l\u2019usufruit de biens imposables, ou les poss\u00e9dant ou occupant, \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire ou d\u2019usufruitier. * * *\nMais le propri\u00e9taire doit aussi \u00eatre \u00e9lecteur municipal, que l\u2019article 243 du code municipal, tel qu\u2019amend\u00e9 par 19 Geo.

Art. 356 C.C.\nJe ne saurais mieux faire que de citer et adopter l\u2019opinion de sir Elz\u00e9ar Taschereau, plus tard juge-en-chef du Canada, re Les listes \u00e9lectorales de Kamouraska[38]:\nL\u2019article 743 (maintenant 670) du code municipal dit sp\u00e9cialement que le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation sert de base \u00e0 toute qualification fonci\u00e8re. On a pr\u00e9tendu que le montant de la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais non la qualit\u00e9 ou le nom du propri\u00e9taire ou possesseur, \u00e9taient couverts par cette clause. C\u2019est essayer de faire dire \u00e0 un statut ce qu\u2019il ne dit pas, Si le l\u00e9gislateur e\u00fbt voulu rendre le r\u00f4le conclusif quant \u00e0 la valeur seulement, il e\u00fbt dit: \u201cLe r\u00f4le sert de base \u00e0 toute \u00e9ventualit\u00e9 de biens-fonds,\u201d ou \u201cle r\u00f4le fait preuve de la valeur des biens-fonds pour les fins de cet acte\u201d. Au contraire, ce r\u00f4le \u00e9tablit, pour toutes les fins de taxes, de listes de jur\u00e9s, etc., etc., etc., etc., non seulement la valeur de chaque propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais encore qui la poss\u00e8de ou l\u2019occupe, et \u00e0 quel titre. Et pour toutes ces fins il est conclusif. Une fois homologu\u00e9, c\u2019est res judicata. La sect. 291 (maintenant 243), C.M., ne laisse aucun doute l\u00e0-dessus pour les \u00e9lections municipales. * * *\nCe r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation est fait avec tout autant sinon plus de formalit\u00e9s que la liste \u00e9lectorale. Il est fait d\u2019abord sous serment. (725, maintenant 659, C.M.) Ensuite, apr\u00e8s avis public donn\u00e9 aux int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, il est soumis \u00e0 l\u2019examen du Conseil (734, 736, 746a, maintenant 661, 662, 663 C.M), qui peut l\u2019amender, et devant qui quiconque s\u2019y croit l\u00e9s\u00e9 peut porter plainte. Puis l\u2019article 430 donne droit d\u2019appel \u00e0 la Cour de Circuit ou de Magistrat de toute d\u00e9cision rendue par le conseil local.\nIl me semble qu\u2019il y a l\u00e0 assez de garanties pour les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s. Si quelqu\u2019un se pense injustement omis du r\u00f4le, s\u2019il croit que sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 n\u2019y est pas \u00e9quitablement \u00e9valu\u00e9e, la loi lui donne d\u2019amples moyens d\u2019obtenir justice. S\u2019il n\u00e9glige ses propres int\u00e9r\u00eats, lors de la confection ou r\u00e9vision du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, il aurait mauvaise gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 venir plus tard se plaindre que son nom n\u2019est pas inscrit comme \u00e9lecteur, par suite d\u2019erreur ou d\u2019injustice dans ce r\u00f4le. La loi lui dira alors: \u201cVigilantibus non dormientibus subvenit lex. Il fallait veiller \u00e0 vos int\u00e9r\u00eats lors de la r\u00e9vision du r\u00f4le.\u201d\n* * *\nIl y a une proc\u00e9dure, un tribunal pour d\u00e9cider sur le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation. Et dans une proc\u00e9dure collat\u00e9rale, comme une contestation des listes \u00e9lectorales, on ne peut remettre en contestation ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 finalement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 quant \u00e0 ce r\u00f4le (McDonald v. Quinn)[39], pas plus que sur une contestation d\u2019\u00e9lection, il ne serait permis de prouver que le vote d\u2019un \u00e9lecteur est nul parce qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas la qualification fonci\u00e8re voulue pour lui donner le droit de vote. (White v. McKenzie)[40].\n* * *\nIl y a un tribunal pour d\u00e9cider du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation et de toutes plaintes port\u00e9es contre icelui; un autre tribunal pour d\u00e9cider de la liste \u00e9lectorale et des plaintes port\u00e9es contre icelle; et enfin, un troisi\u00e8me tribunal pour d\u00e9cider des contestations d\u2019\u00e9lections. Chacun de ces tribunaux doit rester dans sa sph\u00e8re, dans ses attributions. C\u2019est l\u00e0, je crois, l\u2019\u00e9conomie de notre syst\u00e8me sur la mati\u00e8re. Sur la contestation d\u2019\u00e9lection, il ne sera pas permis de prouver contre la liste \u00e9lectorale; et sur la contestation de la liste \u00e9lectorale, il ne sera pas permis de prouver contre le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation.\n* * *\nLa loi veut indubitablement baser le cens \u00e9lectoral sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re. * * * Or, en faisant la liste de ceux \u00e0 qui la loi donne les droits d\u2019\u00e9lecteurs, o\u00f9 le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier doit-il puiser ses informations? Sur quoi doit-il se baser? Enti\u00e8rement sur le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation * * * Pour para\u00eetre \u00eatre \u00e9lecteur par le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, il faut para\u00eetre par le r\u00f4le \u00eatre propri\u00e9taire ou occupant d\u2019un bien-fonds; il ne suffirait pas d\u2019avoir un immeuble dont la valeur appara\u00eet par le r\u00f4le; mais il faut appara\u00eetre par le r\u00f4le \u00eatre propri\u00e9taire. Le r\u00f4le, pour le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier, dit conclusivement non seulement quelle est la valeur d\u2019un bienfonds, mais encore qui en est le propri\u00e9taire ou l\u2019occupant. * * * Il ne peut donc omettre un seul nom de ceux que la loi lui d\u00e9signe ainsi, comme il ne peut mettre un seul nom qui, par le r\u00f4le, ne para\u00eet pas avoir la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9lecteur. Il n\u2019a aucun droit, aucun pouvoir, soit de se servir de ses informations personnelles, soit de constater le fait par enqu\u00eate ou autrement, pour dire qu\u2019une telle personne est port\u00e9e sur le r\u00f4le comme propri\u00e9taire d\u2019une telle propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais que c\u2019est une erreur, et que c\u2019est le nom d\u2019une telle personne qui doit y \u00eatre port\u00e9. Aux \u00e9valuateurs, tous les contribuables sont tenus, sous peine d\u2019amende, de donner tous les renseignements demand\u00e9s pour la confection du r\u00f4le. (745, maintenant 672 C.M.) Au secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier qui demanderait ces renseignements, les contribuables seraient en droit de m\u00e9conna\u00eetre son autorit\u00e9 et de refuser de lui r\u00e9pondre. Le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier n\u2019a donc aucun droit de corriger le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation: la loi lui dit au contraire de le suivre, et de ne suivre que ce r\u00f4le.\nSi on lui reconnaissait le droit de dire que malgr\u00e9 que le r\u00f4le fasse appara\u00eetre qu\u2019un tel est propri\u00e9taire d\u2019une telle maison, cependant lui, le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier, decide lorsqu\u2019il fait sa liste, qu\u2019un tel autre est actuellement propri\u00e9taire de cette maison, il faudrait aussi lui conc\u00e9der le droit de d\u00e9cider qu\u2019un tel ou un tel n\u2019est pas propri\u00e9taire de bonne foi et ainsi ne doit pas \u00eatre mis sur la liste. Certes, la loi n\u2019a pas voulu donner ces pouvoirs au secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier. Pour lui, ceux qui sont actuellement propri\u00e9taires ou occupants de bonne foi sont ceux que le r\u00f4le lui indique comme tels, et le r\u00f4le est son seul guide.\n* * *\nPourquoi celui qui viendrait dire que, depuis que le r\u00f4le a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait ou revis\u00e9, il est devenu propri\u00e9taire d\u2019un tel immeuble, et qu\u2019il doit \u00eatre missur la liste des \u00e9lecteurs, quoique non sur le r\u00f4le, serait-il \u00e9cout\u00e9? Il est en faute lui: que n\u2019a-t-il fait mettre son nom sur ce r\u00f4le? Que ne s\u2019est-il fait substituer \u00e0 l\u2019ancien propri\u00e9taire? L\u2019article 745 (maintenant 673) C.M. lui en donnait sp\u00e9cialement le droit. \u201cApr\u00e8s chaque mutation de propri\u00e9taire ou d\u2019occupant d\u2019un terrain mentionn\u00e9 au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation en force, le Conseil Local, sur requ\u00eate par \u00e9crit \u00e0 cet effet, et sur preuve suffisante, peut biffer le nom de l\u2019ancien propri\u00e9taire ou occupant et y inscrire celui du nouveau,\u201d dit cet article.\nS\u2019il n\u2019est pas sur la liste, c\u2019est parce qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas sur le r\u00f4le, et s\u2019il n\u2019est pas sur le r\u00f4le, c\u2019est par sa faute. Il n\u2019est pas bien venu \u00e0 se plaindre.\nSir Elz\u00e9ar Taschereau cite la cause de McDonald v. Quinn[41], o\u00f9, le 5 septembre 1854, le juge-en-chef Bowen et le juge Meredith (Duval, J. dissident) d\u00e9cidaient\nQue dans l\u2019examen de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 des votes donn\u00e9s \u00e0 une \u00e9lection municipale pour la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, les juges doivent tenir pour correctes les listes d\u2019\u00e9lecteurs faites par le conseil de ville, et qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas droit d\u2019en scruter l\u2019exactitude.\net je cite, en les acceptant, les motifs du juge Meredith, aux pages 461, 462, 463:\nIn England, if the titles of electors can be tried directly, in a proceeding against themselves, such titles cannot be impugned indirectly, in the course of a proceeding against a person elected by them; but if there be no direct mode of trying the titles of the electors, then, as a matter of necessity, they may be tried in the course of the proceeding against the officer whom they have elected.\nIn the present case, according to the English doctrine, the qualification of the electors to vote ought not to be discussed collaterally here because the law declares as I have already shewn, that that question is to be determined by the lists, and that the lists are to be made by the council; so that it is by direct proceedings before the council, and against the electors that their titles ought to be tried.\n* * *\nIt would require stronger reasons than I have yet heard urged, to induce me to attempt to exercise a power which the legislature have said may be exercised by the city council, and which the city council have in fact exercised; namely the power of determining the right of individuals to vote at municipal elections.\n* * *\nMoreover, we would be called upon to disfranchise electors, whose right to vote has been admitted in the manner provided by law, namely by the council; and this, without such electors having even an opportunity of being heard before us. It is plain that in this proceeding the electors could not be heard; * * *\nBefore the council, the persons claiming the right to vote, and the persons contesting that right, were upon an exact equality, both as to the right of being heard, and the right of adducing evidence; but if we, in this proceeding, investigate the rights of the electors, we must do so in the absence of those most interested, that is to say, in the absence of the electors.\nWhether, therefore, we are guided by the letter of the law, or by what seems to be the justice of the case, I think we must come to the conclusion, that the lists of voters, prepared by the Council must be regarded as determining the individuals who have a right to vote.\nLes articles 430 et 431 C.M. donnent \u00e0 tout \u00e9lecteur ou \u00e0 tout int\u00e9ress\u00e9 une action devant la Cour de Circuit en cassation d\u2019un r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation dans les trois mois de la passation de la proc\u00e9dure attaqu\u00e9e pour cause d\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9. En cons\u00e9quence, une action directe en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour attaquer le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, sauf le cas de fraude, ne serait pas accueillie, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de cette cour re La Ville de St-Michel v. Shannon Realties Limited[42], confirm\u00e9e par le Comit\u00e9 Judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9[43], o\u00f9 Lord Shaw of Dunfermline semble r\u00e9p\u00e9ter, sous une autre forme, l\u2019opinion de sir H. E. Taschereau, quand il dit, concernant les dispositions de la Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes qui sont, pour la r\u00e9ception des plaintes par le Conseil et l\u2019appel \u00e0 la Cour de Circuit, semblables aux articles du code municipal:\nIn this view it is of cardinal importance to consider what is the remedy provided for the situation in which a ratepayer or body of ratepayers has been put by a valuation roll which is said to be illegal and invalid by reason either of error in its particular items, or by reason of fundamental error in principle. Once such a roll appears, the statute steps in to provide a remedy to \u201cevery person who, personally or as representing another person, deems himself aggrieved by the roll as drawn up,\u201d and the appeal is to state \u201cthe ground of his complaint.\u201d\nWhat the Act provides by way of the prescription to appeal is to give by that means a remedy for a grievance which is complained of. The Act demands\u2014for otherwise municipal finance would fall into confusion\u2014a statement and handling of the aggrieved person\u2019s case, and that within a period of thirty days, to the council, and, if the grievance complained of be still not remedied, within another period of thirty days to the Circuit Court. Here is promptitude, and the saving of the finance of the year, by making secure the basis of it all\u2014namely the valuation roll. Les intim\u00e9s nous ont fourni un m\u00e9moire de d\u00e9cisions o\u00f9 l\u2019on semble avoir permis la preuve du d\u00e9faut de qualit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9lecteur dont les noms avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrits au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation. Mais il est \u00e0 remarquer que la plupart de ces arr\u00eats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus dans des causes en contestation d\u2019\u00e9lection o\u00f9 il s\u2019agissait de la qualit\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re des conseillers municipaux. Or, l\u2019\u00e9conomie de notre code municipal exige plus sur ce point des conseillers et du maire que des \u00e9lecteurs. Il suffit, en effet, de comparer les articles 228 et 243 pour constater que la qualification du maire et du conseiller doit exister non seulement lors de son \u00e9lection, mais continuer aussi longtemps qu\u2019il occupe cette charge. Le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation en vigueur, d\u2019apr\u00e8s une disposition expresse de la loi, ne lie le tribunal qui entend la cause de contestation, ou auquel on demande l\u2019\u00e9mission d\u2019un bref de Quo Warranto, que quant \u00e0 la valeur des biens-fonds. Si, lors de l\u2019\u00e9lection ou apr\u00e8s, le conseiller cesse d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9lecteur ou propri\u00e9taire en son propre nom de biens-fonds, ou, si d\u00e9duction faite de toute charge impos\u00e9e, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9lection, sur tels biens-fonds, la valeur tombe \u00e0 moins de $400, on peut en faire la preuve.\nC\u2019est cette pratique qui a probablement amen\u00e9 dans certains esprits la confusion que nous pouvons constater dans certains arr\u00eats de la Cour de Circuit, qui nous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9s, o\u00f9 l\u2019on semble avoir appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article concernant la qualification des \u00e9lecteurs la m\u00eame r\u00e8gle, quant \u00e0 la preuve admissible, que l\u2019on avait adopt\u00e9e pour la contestation de la qualification des conseillers. L\u2019article 228 ne r\u00e9f\u00e8re au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation que pour la valeur fonci\u00e8re, alors que l\u2019article 243 y r\u00e9f\u00e8re quant \u00e0 la possession, \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire ou autrement, et quant \u00e0 l\u2019inscription comme propri\u00e9taire au r\u00f4le d\u00e9valuation.\nA l\u2019appui de ces conclusions, je citerai: Brisebois v. Corporation du Village de Roxton Falls [44], (Lynch, J.) Westover v. Hibbard[45], (Lynch, J.) Hickson v. Abbott, B\u00e9langer, J.[46].\nJe tiens \u00e0 remarquer qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision apparemment contraire du juge-en-chef actuel de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, re Boivin v.

At the trial of an action (in which plaintiffs claimed $20,000 damages) the judge, at close of plaintiffs' evidence, took the case from the jury and dismissed the action. On appeal by plaintiffs, the Appellate Division, Alta., ordered a new trial. Defendant appealed to this Court. Plaintiffs contended that, there having been no finding of any amount, there was no \"amount in controversy in the appeal\" (Supreme Court Act, s. 39) and this Court was without jurisdiction.\nHeld, that the objection to the jurisdiction was not well taken.\nOn the merits, defendant's appeal was dismissed.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta.\nThe action was brought by the administrators of the estate of one Stone, deceased, for the benefit of the deceased's wife and son, for damages (the amount claimed being $20,000) resulting from the deceased's death, which plaintiffs alleged was caused by defendant's negligence. Plaintiffs alleged that deceased died as the result of an accident which occurred when he was driving a team of horses attached to his wagon, and that the accident was due to the defective condition of a culvert within the defendant municipality.\nThe action was tried before Walsh J., with a jury. At the close of the evidence for the plaintiffs, the judge, on motion by defendant's counsel, took the case from the jury and gave judgment dismissing the action, on the ground that there was nothing to establish any connection whatever between the injury to deceased and the defective condition of the highway. On appeal by the plaintiffs, the Appellate Division, Alta., allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial. The defendant appealed to this Court.\nCounsel for the respondents raised the question of the jurisdiction of this Court, under the circumstances, to hear the appeal, contending that, there having been no finding of any amount, there was no \"amount in controversy in the appeal\" (Supreme Court Act, s. 39). This question was reserved along with the determination of the appeal on the merits.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. for the appellant.\nRobert Ure for the respondents.\nTHE COURT.\u2014The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nWe have come to the conclusion that Mr. Ure's point as to jurisdiction is not well taken. The necessary result of accepting the view advanced by him would be that an. appeal from a judgment ordering a new trial (on the ground that the trial judge has improperly taken the case from the jury) is only permissible upon obtaining special leave under section 39. We think we should be misinterpreting the intention of the Legislature if we ascribed such effect to the amendments of 1920. Besides, the adoption of such a construction would involve a reversal of the practice which has obtained since those amendments came into force.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n",

Appellant contended that no part of the last of the documents in question should be held to form part of the will, as it was not shewn that deceased, at the time of the making and execution of it, was of sufficient mental capacity or of a disposing mind, or understood or appreciated the document, or that it was the expression of his desires.\nHeld, that, as there was nothing to indicate that the trial judge misdirected himself, or that either he or the Court of Appeal failed to appreciate the facts, and as, in the courts below, there was nothing that could be described as a miscarriage of justice or a violation of any principles of law or procedure, this court should refuse to examine the evidence in order to interfere with the concurrent findings of the two courts below on what was a pure question of fact. (Robins v. National Trust Co., [1927] A.C. 515, at 517-518).\nThe principle laid down in Perera v. Perera, [1901] A.C. 354, at 361, as to extent of capacity required on executing a will prepared in accordance with instructions previously given, held applicable. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the judgment of Rose, C.J.H.C., declaring that certain documents dated respectively November 16, 1926, January 20, 1930, and October 4, 1930, and purporting to be the last wills and testaments of Franklin David Davis, deceased, and a codicil to the first of such wills, except paragraphs 1 and 2 of the will dated October 4, 1930, constitute together the last will and testament of said deceased, and ordering that the proper court in that behalf do admit to probate the last will and testament of said deceased, so constituted.\nThe appellant contended that no part of the document dated October 4, 1930, should be held to form a part of deceased\u2019s last will and testament, on the ground that the evidence did not shew that deceased, at the time of the making and execution of said document, was of sufficient mental capacity or of a disposing mind or understood or appreciated the document, or that it was the expression of his own desires.\nJ.H. Rodd K.C. and Roy Rodd for the appellant.\nGideon Grant K.C. and A.H. Foster for the respondent Helen Elizabeth Davis.\nGideon Grant K.C. and E.W. Haines for the respondent Annie M. Davis.\nJ.B. Aylesworth for respondents Ada A. Guppy and others.\nJ.M. Baird for the Official Guardian, representing certain infant respondents.\nOn the conclusion of the argument of counsel for the appellant, the Court retired to consider the case, and, on returning to the Bench, without calling on counsel for respondents, delivered judgment dismissing the appeal, costs to be payable out of the Estate.\nDUFF J.\u2014We are satisfied, Mr. Grant, that it is unnecessary to call upon you.\nThe principle of procedure by which we are governed is laid down by Lord Dunedin in the case of Robins v. National Trust Company[1], and I quote a few sentences from his judgment: This raises in a quite distinct way the question of whether their Lordships will examine the evidence in order to interfere with the concurrent findings of two Courts on a pure question of fact. Whether a man at the time of making his will had testamentary capacity, whether a will was the result of his own wish and act or was procured from him by means of fraud or circumvention or undue influence, are pure questions of fact. The rule as to concurrent findings is not a rule based on any statutory provision.\nThen he says it is a rule of conduct, and a rule of conduct for the Empire, and \u201cwill be applied to all the various judicatures whose final tribunal is this Board\u201d; and proceeds (pp. 517-518):\nBeing, as has been said, a rule of conduct, and not a statutory provision, the rule is not cast iron; but it would avail little to try to give a definition which should at once be exhaustive and accurate, of the exceptions which may arise. It will be sufficient to quote what has been said on this subject in the past:\u2014\nIn Moung Tha Hnyeen v. Moung Pan Nyo[2], Lord Hobhouse, delivering the judgment of a Board which included Lord Macnaghten and Lord Lindley, said: \u201cThere has been nothing to show that there has been a miscarriage of justice, or that any principles of law or of procedure have been violated in the Courts below. This case is one which very decidedly falls within the valuable principle recognized here and commonly observed in second Courts of Appeal, that such a Court will not interfere with concurrent judgments of the Courts below on matters of fact, unless very definite and explicit grounds for that interference are assigned.\u201d\nIn Rani Srimati v. Khajendra Narayan Singh[3], Lord Lindley repeated the view: \u201cThe appellants have failed to show any miscarriage of justice, or the violation of any principle of law or procedure. Their Lordships, therefore, see no reason for departing from the usual practice of this Board of declining to interfere with two concurrent findings on pure questions of fact.\u201d\nNow, we can see nothing to indicate that the trial judge misdirected himself; that either he or the Court of Appeal failed to appreciate the facts; still less, that there has been anything that could, by the widest stretching of the scope of the words, be described as a miscarriage of justice or a violation of \u201cany principles of law or procedure.\u201d\nTo repeat Lord Hobhouse\u2019s words\u2014no \u201cdefinite and explicit grounds,\u201d within the meaning of these judgments, have been brought before us for interfering with the judgment of the Court of Appeal. I might also add that this is a case for the application of the principle laid down by the Privy Council in Perera v. Perera[4], where the Judicial Committee accepted this statement of the law by Sir James Hannen in Parker v. Felgate[5]: If a person has given instructions to a solicitor to make a will, and the solicitor prepares it in accordance with those instructions, all that is necessary to make it a good will, if executed by the testator, is that he. should be able to think thus far: \u201cI gave my solicitor instructions to prepare a will making a certain disposition of my property; I have no doubt that he has given effect to my intention, and I accept the document which is put before me as carrying it out.\u201d\nThe appeal will, therefore, be dismissed.\n(The question of costs was then discussed between the Court and counsel.)\nDUFF J.\u2014We think that, considering all the circumstances of this case, the costs should be payable out of the estate.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant and for the respondent Genevieve Rogers: Rodd, Wigle, Whiteside & Jasperson.\nSolicitors for the respondent Helen Elizabeth Davis: Fleming, Drake & Foster.\nSolicitors for respondents Ada A. Guppy and others: Bartlet, Aylesworth & McGladdery.\nOfficial Guardian (on behalf of certain infant respondents): McGregor Young.\nSolicitors for the respondent Annie M.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the decision of the Superior Court, Gibsone J., and maintaining the respondent\u2019s petition of right for $13,513.01 which had been paid under protest to the treasury of the province of Quebec for succession duties on 275 shares of the Bank of Montreal, owned by one Brown, of the city of New York, deceased.\nThe respondent, acting in his quality of sole surviving executor of the late MacEvers Bayard Brown, in his lifetime of the city of New York, by petition of right seeks to recover from the appellant in right of the province of Quebec $12,573.72, which he paid to the appellant under protest on the 10th of May, 1927, and a further sum of $939.29 paid on the 13th of June following, as succession duty on 275 shares of the capital stock of the Bank of Montreal belonging to the estate of the late Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown was a citizen of the United States and during all the time relevant to this case he had his domicile in the city of New York, where he died on the 8th of April, 1926. The Bank of Montreal has its head office in the city of Montreal, Que. Formerly its shares were transferable on its books at its head office only. A transfer of shares is made on the register of the bank by the holder of them in person or by attorney authorized by special power of attorney and is accepted by the transferee in the same way. That was the procedure followed when Mr. Brown acquired the 275 shares of the stock of the bank, and on the 1st November, 1920, Mr. Brown appeared on the register at the head office of the bank as the owner of 275 shares of its capital stock.\nThe transfer of shares of the capital stock of Canadian banks is governed by the provisions of sections 42 et seq. of the Bank Act, of which paragraphs 4 and 5 have special application on this appeal. They read:\n\u201c4. The bank may open and maintain in any province in Canada in which it has resident shareholders and in which it has one or more branches or agencies, a share-registry office, to be designated by the directors, at which the shares of the shareholders, resident within the province, shall be registered and at which, and not elsewhere, except as hereinafter provided, such shares may be validly transferred.\n\u201c5. Shares of persons who are not resident in Canada or in any province in which there is a branch or agency of the bank may be registered and shall be transferable at the chief office of the bank or elsewhere, as the directors may designate.\u201d\nThe directors of the bank, acting under what they conceived to be the power and authority conferred upon the bank by these paragraphs, by by-law passed on the 14th of April, 1927, opened share-registry offices in each of the provinces of Canada in which the bank had a branch and resident shareholders, and also at the office of the bank in the city of London, England, and at its agency in the city of New York. The part of the by-law now relevant is as follows:\u2014\nBy-law no. 23\n(a) Share-registry offices for the registration and transfer of the shares of the capital stock of the bank shall be opened and maintained at:\n(1) The place where the head office of the bank is situate, namely, at the city of Montreal in the province of Quebec;\n* * *\n(3) The agency of the bank in the city of New York in the state of New York;\n* * *\n(b) Shares of persons who are not resident in Canada may be registered either on the register in the city of Montreal or on the register in the city of London, or on the register in the city of New York, and on the request in writing of the shareholder may be removed from one of these registers and placed on another, but such shares may be transferred only on the register on which they are then registered.\n* * *\n(e) Whenever there is a change of ownership of any shares, or a change of residence of any shareholders, and it is necessary in order to conform to the foregoing provisions of this by-law that a change should be made in the place of registry of the shares concerned, such change shall be made forthwith.\n(\u0192) For the purposes of this by-law, a shareholder shall be deemed to be resident at the place in which he has according to the books of the bank his post office address.\n(g) The board of directors shall from time to time appoint persons to act as local registrars of stock at the share-registry offices of the bank other than at the city of Montreal or designate other officers or employees of the bank to perform the duties of such office. The registrar of stock, the local registrars of stock, or the officer or officers of the bank designated by the board to perform the duties of these offices, shall, subject to the direction of the board keep at each of the share-registry offices of the bank an accurate register or registers of the shareholders of the bank whose shares are registered at such share-registry office, containing the post office address and description of each such shareholder * * *\u201d\nFollowing up this by-law, the bank opened a share-registry office at its agency in New York and appointed a local registrar to take charge of it. On the 8th of October following, 1925, the 275 shares belonging to Mr. Brown were removed from the head office register at Montreal to the New York register and were still there at the time of his death.\nAim\u00e9 Geofirion K.C. and Ls. St. Laurent K.C. for the appellant.\nArnold Wainwright K.C. and D. C. Abbott for the respondent.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the Attorney-General for Canada.\nThe judgments of Duff and Smith JJ. were delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014There is, I think, only one question of substance involved in this appeal. That question is whether the words \u201cor elsewhere\u201d in section 42, ss. 5 are adequate to provide for the establishment of places for registration and transfer of shares outside of Canada. I thought at first that the difficulty was important. Full consideration has led me to the conclusion that the ordinary force of the words of the subsection (they had better be quoted in full)\u2014\nShares of persons who are not resident in Canada or in any province in which there is a branch or agency of the bank may be registered and shall be transferable at the chief office of the bank or elsewhere, as the directors may designate.\nare not affected by any context upon which the appellant relies. I can perceive nothing in subsection 4 which expressly or by implication qualifies subsection 5.\nIt cannot, on a fair construction of the statute, be held that shares must be registered at a \u201cbranch or agency of the bank\u201d because the statute enacts that where the shareholder resides in a province where there is not a \u201cbranch\u201d or \u201cagency\u201d shares\nmay be registered and shall be transferable at the chief office of the bank or elsewhere as the directors may designate.\nThis is not the natural way of saying that shareholders must register their shares at the head office or at some \u201cbranch or agency,\u201d which is also a \u201cshare registry office.\u201d\nThe proper inference from the whole section appears to be that a \u201cshare registry office\u201d need not be a \u201cbranch\u201d or \u201cagency\u201d or the \u201chead office.\u201d\nReference should perhaps be made to Mr. St. Laurent\u2019s contention that this view conflicts with the presumed policy of the Act: namely, that the registration and transfer of the shares of banks should be governed exclusively by the Canadian law. But there is nothing in the Bank Act to prevent a purchaser or creditor acquiring by contract a right legal and equitable to require the vendor or debtor to do whatever is necessary in order to effect a legal transfer of such share; and the question whether such is the effect of the contract will depend upon the law of the place where the contract is made\u2014Colonial Bank v. Cady[2], nor I apprehend\u2014is there any doubt that the conditions under which title to its shares may be acquired is exclusively matter for the law making authority of the jurisdiction where the Corporation has its proper domicile. For Canadian banks, in the absence at all events of special legislation, this domicile is a single one, Canada, by reason of the fact that the whole subject of banking, as well as the incorporation of banks, is exclusively a subject for Dominion legislation. The appeal should be dismissed with costs. No costs to or against the Attorney-General for Canada.\nRinfret J.\u2014I agree with my brothers Duff and Lamont. The word \u201celsewhere\u201d (in subsection 5 of section 42 of the Bank Act), both under its ordinary meaning and in the light of the prior legislation, shews, in my view, the intention of Parliament to authorize the Canadian banks to open and maintain share registry offices outside of the Canadian territory. (Compare Wright & Carson v. Brake Service Ltd.[3], and comments of the Privy Council on that decision in Canadian General Electric Company v. Fada Radio Limited[4], and in Rice v. Christiani[5].\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgments of Lamont and Cannon JJ. were delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014The respondent in this appeal is the surviving executor of the last will and testament of McEvers Bayard Brown who, in his lifetime, was an American citizen domiciled in the state of New York, and died there on April 8, 1926. Among the assets comprising his estate at the time of his death were 275 shares of the capital stock of the Bank of Montreal, a corporation created under Canadian law with its head office in the city of Montreal in the province of Quebec. The respondent took out letters probate in the state of New York and, as the testator had considerable assets in the province of Quebec, he applied to have the assets there registered in his name as executor. In making his application he pointed out that in so far as the 275 shares in the Bank of Montreal stock were concerned they were not subject to succession duty in the province, inasmuch as they were registered on the share-register of the bank in the city of New York and transferable only on that register. The collector of succession duties for the province refused to permit registration of the assets of the testator\u2019s estate in the name of the respondent until payment had been made of the succession duty which, he claimed, was payable in respect of the 275 shares. The basis of this claim was that the shares were property within the province of Quebec. The respondent paid the amount of the duty ($13,513.01) under protest, and then commenced these proceedings by way of petition of right for an order that the Crown in right of the province be adjudged to refund him the said sum with interest thereon and costs.\nIn answer to the petition the Attorney-General for Quebec set up:\n1. That the shares of the capital stock of the bank\u2019 constituted an interest in the net assets of the bank, which were owned and controlled at its head office and not elsewhere, and that each shareholder\u2019s right or interest therein constituted an interest in property situated in the province in which the head office was located, and was, therefore, subject to such direct taxation as the provincial legislature saw fit to impose.\n2. That the Bank Act (now R.S.C., 1927, c. 12), properly construed, did not authorize the bank to establish a share-register outside of Canada, but, if it did, to that extent it was ultra vires, and\n3. In any event the by-law of the bank purporting to establish a register in the state of New York did not comply with the Act.\nThe Superior Court granted the prayer of the petition and directed a refund of the duty paid in respect of the shares. On appeal the Court of King\u2019s Bench unanimously affirmed the judgment, and the Crown now appeals to this court.\n1. The first of these above contentions was rejected by the Privy Council in Brassard v. Smith[6], where it was held that shares of the capital stock of a bank, incorporated under the Bank Act, which had been transferred from the register at the bank\u2019s head office to the register of the bank in another province, were, for the purposes of succession duty, property in the province in which the shares were registered, and not in the province in which the head office was situated. This principle was reaffirmed in the case of Erie Beach Company v. Attorney-General for Ontario[7]. 2. The greater part of the argument before us was made in support of the contention that the Act did not authorize the establishment of share-registers outside of Canada. The material section of the Act is s. 42 (5):\u2014\nShares of persons who are not resident in Canada or in any province in which there is a branch or agency of the bank may be registered and shall be transferable at the chief office of the bank or elsewhere, as the directors may designate.\nUnder the authority of this section the directors of the bank passed by-law no. 23, which, in part, reads as follows:\n(a) Share-registry offices for the registration and transfer of the shares of the capital stock of the bank shall be opened and maintained at:\n(1) The place where the head office of the bank is situate, namely, at the city of Montreal in the province of Quebec;\n(2) The office of the bank in the city of London, England;\n(3) The agency of the bank in the city of New York in the state of New York;\n(4) The office of the bank in each of the other provinces of Canada in which the bank has resident shareholders. * * *\n(b) Shares of persons who are not resident in Canada may be registered either on the register in the city of Montreal or on the register in the city of London, or on the register in the city of New York, and on the request in writing of the shareholder may be removed from one of these registers and placed on another, but such shares may be transferred only on the register on which they are then registered.\nIt was argued that the words \u201cor elsewhere\u201d in s. 42 (5) must be construed as meaning \u201cor elsewhere in Canada,\u201d because the territorial jurisdiction of the Canadian Parliament was restricted to the Dominion, and that to construe \u201celsewhere\u201d as including places beyond the Dominion would amount to an assertion of the competence of the Canadian Parliament to legislate as to the legal effect to be given to a transfer of shares made in another country.\nThe short answer to this argument, in my opinion, is that the word \u201celsewhere\u201d in the subsection is either ambiguous or it is not. If it is not ambiguous it must be given its ordinary natural meaning, which is, \u201cin some other place\u201d or \u201cany other place.\u201d This does not restrict the places at which transfers of shares may be made to places in Canada. If it is ambiguous we are at liberty to look at the prior legislation to ascertain the sense in which it was used. That legislation shews that from 1852 the Bank of Montreal had legislative authority to maintain a register of shares in Great Britain. Other banks had similar rights by pre-Confederation legislation. In 1871 a general Bank Act was passed (34 Vict., c. 5). That Act permitted a bank to open branches at any place or places in the Dominion. It also provided that the share of the capital stock of the bank might be transferable in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1890 the Act was revised and a bank was given the right to \u201copen branches, agencies and offices\u201d without the limitation as to the Dominion contained in the Act of 1871. In 1913 the Act was again revised and provision was made by which shares could be transferred as set out in s. 42 (5), above quoted.\nWhen we consider that Canadian banks were opening branches in various parts of the world outside of Canada, and that it would be for the convenience of their shareholders in those parts to be able to transfer their shares in the country in which they were residing, it seems more reasonable to suppose that the intention of Parliament in enacting s. 42 (5) was to assist the banks by authorizing the keeping of registers where the directors thought it most convenient, than to infer an intention to take away the right, enjoyed prior to 1913, of having a register in Great Britain. In my opinion the word \u201celsewhere\u201d in s. 42 (5) is not limited to Canada, nor does the subsection imply an assertion of legislative competence on the part of Parliament to determine the legal effect to be given to acts performed in other countries. The effect of a contract to transfer shares made in another country must depend upon the laws of that country. But, subject to that law, it is within the competence of the Parliament of Canada in legislating on the subject of banks and banking\u2014a matter over which it is given exclusive jurisdiction by section 91 of the British North America Act, 1867\u2014to compel a bank, its own creature, to recognize as valid a lawful transfer made outside of Canada, when made in the manner prescribed by the Act. Secretary of State of Canada v. Alien Property Custodian (U.S.)[8].\n3. It was also contended that the by-law did not comply with the Act, inasmuch as the directors did not \u201cdesignate\u201d the place of transfer outside of Canada, as required by s. 42 (5), but left it to the shareholder to select the register upon which his shares would be placed. I am of opinion that a by-law which provides that shares may be registered at one of several specified places is a designation by the directors within the meaning of the Act.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St. Laurent, Gagn\u00e9, Devlin & Taschereau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fleet, Phelan, Fleet, Robertson & Abbott.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General of Canada: W.

Newcombe J. took no part in the judgment, having died before the delivery thereof.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nRevenue\u2014Excise and Customs Act\u2014Bond\u2014Interest\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Exchequer Court Act, section 30\u2014Ontario Judicature Act, section 34.\nThe actions are for the recovery of the amounts of bonds given by the appellants to the Crown in respect of liquors entered at a port for export, the form of bond being expressed to secure actual exportation to the place provided for in the entry and production of proof thereof, such as has been fully described and discussed in the case of The Canadian Surety Co. v. The King ([1930] S.C.R. 434). The appellants denied liability on the bonds and alleged that, in any event, the Crown could not recover interest, and that the Exchequer Court of Canada had no jurisdiction in the matter, the matter being one of contract and not one arising out of the administration of the laws of Canada and the provincial courts only having jurisdiction. Held that the Exchequer Court of Canada had jurisdiction to hear and determine the claims. It was competent for the Parliament of Canada, in virtue of the powers vested in it by section 101 of the British North America Act, to confer upon a court, created by it for \u201cthe better administration of the laws of Canada,\u201d authority to hear and determine such claims; and the Parliament has clearly intended to confer such jurisdiction on the Exchequer Court of Canada, the cases probably falling within clause (a), but clearly within clause (d), of section 30 of the Exchequer Court Act.\nHeld, also, that, under the circumstances of these cases, the full amount nominated in the bond is recoverable.\nHeld further, Anglin C.J.C. dissenting, that interest should only run from the date of the judgment of the trial court as, at no date prior to it, the penalty became payable as a \u201cjust debt\u201d within the meaning of Lord MacNaghten\u2019s judgment in Toronto Ry. Co. v. City of Toronto ([1906] A.C. 117).\nSection 34 of the Ontario Judicature Act should not be regarded as dealing merely with a matter of procedure; it deals also with important matters of substantive law.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1931] Exc. C.R. 85) aff.\nAPPEALS by the appellants from the judgments of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding that the respondent was entitled to recover from the appellants the amounts of certain bonds. One action was brought on seven bonds totalling $445,093, another action, on four bonds totalling $129,512, and a third one on one bond for $12,795. These bonds were given by the appellants to the Crown in respect of the export in bond of liquors on which the excise duties had not been paid and for interest at five per cent, per annum from the date of the bonds. The bonds were given pursuant to the provisions of section 68 of the Inland Revenue Act (1906) c. 51 (now known as The Excise Act) and the regulations of the Governor in Council made pursuant to sections 67 and 140. The goods covered by the bond had been deposited in an excise bonding warehouse under section 61 of the Act without payment of the duties imposed by the Act. The appellants denied any liability under the bonds and by an amendment made to their statement in defence pleaded that in any event the Exchequer Court of Canada had no jurisdiction to decide the matters at issue in the actions, and that the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. (1927) c. 34, in so far as it purports to give the Exchequer Court jurisdiction to decide the matter at issue between the parties to this action, is beyond the power of the Parliament of Canada to enact. The trial judge held that the Exchequer Court had jurisdiction to try these actions and that the respondent was entitled to recover on the bonds. The trial judge held also that the respondent was not entitled to interest on, the bonds.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and F. T. Collins for the appellants.\nN. W. Howell K.C. and Gordon Lindsay for the respondent.\nAnglin C.J.C. (dissenting as to cross-appeals).\u2014I never entertained any doubt whatever as to the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court in these cases to hear these appeals.\nIf authority to hear and determine such claims as these is not something which it is competent for the Dominion, under s. 101 of the British North America Act, to confer upon a court created by it for \u201cthe better administration of the law of Canada,\u201d I would find it very difficult to conceive what that clause in the B.N.A. Act was intended to convey.\nThat the Dominion Parliament intended to confer such jurisdiction on the Exchequer Court, in my opinion, is clear beyond argument, the case probably falling within clause (a); but, if not, it certainly is clearly within clause (d) of s. 30 of the Exchequer Court Act.\nOn the question of the construction of the bonds raised at bar, to my mind, a breach of the condition of each bond properly constituted has been equally clearly established. As to the amount recoverable, I agree with the contention of the Crown that the whole amount named in the bond must be paid by the defendants.\nI was quite prepared to dismiss these appeals at the conclusion of the argument but, in deference to the wishes of some of my colleagues, judgment was reserved. That being so, I think it better to put in writing, as I have done very briefly above, my reasons for concurring in their dismissal.\nI also agree in the view, which I understand to be that of the other members of the court, that the matter of interest is clearly a matter of substance and in no sense a matter of procedure. Interest should, in my opinion, be allowed the respondent from the date of default by the defendants in each case. From that date the claim of the Crown was for a liquidated amount and was a just debt, payment of which was improperly withheld (Toronto Ry. Co. v. City of Toronto)[2]. As pointed out by my brother Duff, those who take the view that section 34 of the Ontario Judicature Act should be regarded as dealing merely with a matter of procedure are clearly wrong. Section 34 of that statute, like a number of other sections thereof, deals with important matters of substantive law.\nI would dismiss the appeals and allow the cross-appeals, all with costs.\nThe judgments of Duff, Rinfret and Lamont JJ. were delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014I find no difficulty in holding that the Parliament of Canada is capable, in virtue of the powers vested in it by section 101 of the British North America Act, of endowing the Exchequer Court with authority to entertain such actions as these. I do not doubt that \u201cthe better administration of the laws of Canada,\u201d embraces, upon a fair construction of the words, such a matter as the enforcement of an obligation contracted pursuant to the provisions of a statute of that Parliament or of a regulation having the force of statute. I do not think the point is susceptible of elaborate argument, and I leave it there.\nAs to the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court, in so far as that depends upon the construction of the Exchequer Court Act, something might be said for the view that these cases are not within the class of cases contemplated by subsection A of section 30; but that is immaterial because they are plainly within subsection D.\nThe professed cancellation of the bonds was inoperative in point of law. The learned trial judge properly found that the documents, upon which the cancellation proceeded, were concocted documents, and that the conditions, under which alone cancellation is permitted by the regulations, never came into effect. Nor can I agree with Mr. Tilley\u2019s contention that the alternative condition has been performed. That condition is in these words: Or if the above bounden Consolidated Distilleries, Limited, shall account for the said goods to the satisfaction of the said Collector of Inland Revenue, then this obligation is to be void.\nThere is not the slightest ground for finding that the appellants did account for the goods to the satisfaction of the Collector.\nAs to the amount recoverable, I think the reasoning of Garrow B., in The King v. Dixon[3], is conclusive. That experienced lawyer had no doubt that where the breach of the condition occurs in such circumstances as to expose the parties concerned to a serious temptation to violate in a substantial manner the revenue laws and to provide an opportunity for doing so, the breach must be regarded as substantial, and the full amount nominated in the bond is recoverable. Here the bond is required by the regulations. It is to be in the \u201cprescribed form\u201d which, since there is apparently no form prescribed either in the statute or the regulations, I take to mean that it is to follow the form authorized by the departmental instructions. The purpose of the bond is to prevent frauds on the revenue. Where such is the purpose of the bond, generally speaking, the sum named is recoverable in full. The application of this principle is illustrated in two American cases cited by the Crown, in addition to the judgment already mentioned in The King v. Dixon3. These cases are: United States v. Ottery[4], and Clark v. Barnard[5]. Such bonds are to be distinguished from those in which the purpose of the bond is merely or mainly to secure the full payment of duties on imported goods, in other words, to secure the payment of money.\nI have, indeed, some difficulty in affirming that the penalties named in these bonds were not in each case \u201ca genuine pre-estimate of the creditor\u2019s probable or possible interest in the due performance of the principal obligation.\u201d Clydebank Engineering and Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. v. Yzquierdo Y. Castaneda[6].\nAs to interest, I think we must be guided by the decision of the Judicial Committee in Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[7]. I am unable to agree with the learned President that the subject-matter of section 34 of the Ontario Judicature Act is matter of procedure. A number of titles of substantive law are dealt with in that Act, and I have no doubt that section 34 falls within that category. On the other hand, I cannot accept the view advanced on behalf of the Crown that the latest date for performance of the alternative condition of the bonds was that suggested, namely, three months subsequent to the date of the exportation of goods from out of Canada. I do not think the provisions of the regulation in regard to cancellation control the period within which the appellants were entitled to perform this condition of the obligation, and I am unable to conclude that at any date prior to judgment the penalty became payable as a \u201cjust debt,\u201d within the meaning of Lord MacNaghten\u2019s judgment in the Toronto case[8]. Effect must, therefore, be given to the general rule.\nThe appeals and cross-appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeals and cross appeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Meredith, Holden, Reward and Holden.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

An action was brought against the appellant and the municipality in the interest of the widow and the children. The action was finally dismissed by this court on the ground that the appellant was not legally responsible for the death of the victim. ([1931] S.C.R. 145). The appellant then sued the respondent municipality for indemnity against loss sustained by him as its mandatary in defending the action brought against him.\nHeld that a constable binds the municipal corporation which has appointed him when he acts as municipal officer for the purpose of enforcing the observance of the local ordinances; but he does not bind the corporation when he acts as guardian of the peace to enforce observance of the laws concerning public order. La cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al v. Plante (Q.R. 34 K.B. 137) approved.\nHeld, also, that the mandatary of several principals binds only the one for whom he acts at the time when the act causing injury is committed. It is not the regular and customary employment of the mandatary that must be taken into consideration, but the quality in virtue of which he really acts at the time of the event giving rise to the action brought against him.\nHeld, further, that the mandatary, who claims the right to be indemnified by his mandator for the costs awarded to him and taxed against a third party, must, in order to create a lien de droit, allege that he has tried, but has been unable, to collect these from that party, or, at least that that party is insolvent and not able to pay. Such an allegation is essential in order that these costs may be regarded as \u201closses caused to him by the execution of the mandate\u201d within the meaning of Art. 1725 C.C.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 52 K.B. 1) aff.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, d\u2019Auteuil J., and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action upon inscription in law.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nR.

An action was brought against the plaintiff and the municipality in the interest of the widow and the children. The action was dismissed on the ground that neither defendant was legally responsible for the death of the victim. The plaintiff now sues the municipality for indemnity against loss sustained by him as its mandatary in defending the action against him.\nHe must fail, I think, because he was not the mandatary of the village. 1st: He was acting under the pay of the circus. 2nd: In any case, as constable, he was the minister of the law. In repelling the riot his duty was not to obey the municipality, or the officers of the municipality, but to act as the law prescribes. The principle is settled by numerous authorities to which it is not necessary to refer.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgments of Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ. were delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014Au milieu d\u2019une \u00e9meute qui se produisit, le 17 juillet 1927, sur un terrain occup\u00e9 par un cirque, dans le village d\u2019Amiante, l\u2019appelant, qui \u00e9tait constable et gardien de la paix \u00e0 cet endroit, dut se servir d\u2019un revolver pour faire cesser le d\u00e9sordre; et, au cours d\u2019une altercation avec l\u2019un des dirigeants des \u00e9meutiers, il d\u00e9chargea son revolver, et, par accident, tua son assaillant.\nLa veuve et les enfants de la victime poursuivirent alors l\u2019appelant et la corporation du village d\u2019Amiante et leur r\u00e9clam\u00e8rent les dommages r\u00e9sultant du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de l\u2019\u00e9meutier, qu\u2019ils attribu\u00e8rent \u00e0 la faute de l\u2019appelant et dont ils tent\u00e8rent de tenir responsable la corporation municipale dont ils all\u00e9guaient que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 en la circonstance.\nCette action fut renvoy\u00e9e par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure (Letellier, J.), puis maintenue par la Cour du Banc du Roi contre l\u2019appelant seul (les demandeurs n\u2019ayant pas poursuivi leurs proc\u00e9dures contre la corporation municipale); et d\u00e9finitivement rejet\u00e9e par la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada[2], qui infirma le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi et r\u00e9tablit le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.

Cette action est institu\u00e9e contre la cit\u00e9 de Thetford Mines, \u00e0 laquelle, dans l\u2019intervalle, le village d\u2019Amiante a \u00e9t\u00e9 annex\u00e9, et qui est maintenant aux droits et obligations de ce village.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e a oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019action de l\u2019appelant une inscription en droit all\u00e9guant qu\u2019il appert des circonstances invoqu\u00e9es, et qui font la base de son action, que ce dernier agissait alors en sa qualit\u00e9 de constable en vertu des pouvoirs qui lui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la loi criminelle, et en aucune fa\u00e7on sous la responsabilit\u00e9 de la corporation du village d\u2019Amiante.\nL\u2019inscription en droit a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue par le motif que\nbien que nomm\u00e9 par la d\u00e9fenderesse, le demandeur tient son autorit\u00e9 et son pouvoir de la loi, et la d\u00e9fenderesse n\u2019est pas responsable envers lui des risques de sa fonction, surtout lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019all\u00e8gue pas qu\u2019elle lui a command\u00e9 l\u2019acte qui donne lieu \u00e0 son recours.\nCe jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi (Guerin, J., dissident)[3] et nous est maintenant soumis.\nLa d\u00e9claration que l\u2019appelant a annex\u00e9e au bref de sommation all\u00e8gue les faits sur lesquels il entend appuyer ses conclusions, et r\u00e9f\u00e8re aux plaidoiries \u00e9crites et aux jugements de la premi\u00e8re cause, en disant qu\u2019il les \u201cproduit comme s\u2019ils \u00e9taient ici r\u00e9cit\u00e9s au long\u201d. Il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019il les a incorpor\u00e9s dans sa d\u00e9claration et qu\u2019il faut lire cette derni\u00e8re comme si elle contenait les plaidoiries \u00e9crites et les jugements en question.\nEn ce sens, il n\u2019est m\u00eame pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019invoquer le jugement de Chechik v. Rabinovitch[4] pour savoir si, afin de d\u00e9cider sur l\u2019inscription en droit, la cour pouvait r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux pi\u00e8ces invoqu\u00e9es par la d\u00e9claration. Dans le cas actuel, \u00e0 cause de la r\u00e9daction que lui a donn\u00e9e l\u2019appelant, les pi\u00e8ces font partie de la d\u00e9claration elle-m\u00eame. Or, si on lit\u2014comme on doit le faire\u2014la d\u00e9claration comprenant les pi\u00e8ces produites, on voit reproduit au long dans le jugement de monsieur le juge Letellier le plaidoyer \u00e9crit que l\u2019appelant a produit dans la premi\u00e8re instance. Dans ce plaidoyer, pour faire repousser la premi\u00e8re action, l\u2019appelant all\u00e8gue:\n1. Qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00e0 remploi, comme gardien de la paix sur les terrains, d\u2019une compagnie locataire desdits terrains, laquelle compagnie donnait des attractions et des amusements pour le public;\n2. Qu\u2019il avait agi comme tel depuis plusieurs jours pour ladite compagnie, et qu\u2019en plusieurs circonstances, les ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, il n\u2019avait jamais eu de trouble ni de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 maintenir le bon ordre; Le plaidoyer continue en relatant les circonstances de r\u00e9meute; puis il reprend comme suit:\n5. Que c\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment, qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir tir\u00e9 plusieurs coups de revolver \u00e0 terre et en l\u2019air pour t\u00e2cher de remettre l\u2019ordre et de d\u00e9fendre sa personne, qu\u2019une balle atteint ledit M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martin;\n6. Que le coup fatal partit au moment o\u00f9 Martin lui-m\u00eame avait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 attrapper le poignet du d\u00e9fendeur et essayait de lui enlever son arme, lui disant \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s ceci: \u201cTu as voulu d\u00e9fendre le vieux, c\u2019est toi qui va y passer.\u201d Le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e9tait justifiable de se d\u00e9fendre par les moyens qu\u2019il a pris et de prot\u00e9ger sa vie et la vie du public;\n7. Que ledit M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martin, la victime, a \u00e9t\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame avec ses amis la cause de tout le trouble, et cons\u00e9quemment la cause de sa propre mort;\n8. Que le d\u00e9fendeur ne peut \u00eatre tenu responsable en dommages envers les demandeurs, et c\u2019est pourquoi il a refus\u00e9 de payer lesdits dommages;\nEt le d\u00e9fendeur conclut au renvoi de la pr\u00e9sente action, quant \u00e0 ce qui le concerne, avec d\u00e9pens;\nDans ce plaidoyer, l\u2019appelant a donc pris la position que, lors de l\u2019\u00e9meute, il se trouvait sur le terrain, non pas comme l\u2019employ\u00e9 de la corporation municipale, mais comme l\u2019employ\u00e9 de la compagnie du cirque, et que, lorsqu\u2019il a tir\u00e9 le coup fatal, il a agi comme gardien de la paix, \u00e0 la fois pour d\u00e9fendre sa personne et pour prot\u00e9ger sa vie et la vie du public. L\u2019attitude de l\u2019appelant est d\u2019ailleurs conforme \u00e0 celle que la corporation du village d\u2019Amiante a prise ellem\u00eame dans le plaidoyer s\u00e9par\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a alors produit; et les all\u00e9gations de la corporation viennent confirmer celles de l\u2019appelant. Il faut ajouter \u00e0 cela que le jugement de monsieur le juge Letellier n\u2019a pas modifi\u00e9 la situation invoqu\u00e9e par les parties elles-m\u00eames quant \u00e0 la nature des relations qui existaient entre elles lors de l\u2019\u00e9meute.\nIl est inexact de dire que ce jugement constitue chose jug\u00e9e sur ce point entre l\u2019appelant et la cit\u00e9 de Thetford Mines. La premi\u00e8re cause, o\u00f9 le jugement de monsieur le juge Letellier a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une cause entre les parties actuelles. C\u2019\u00e9tait une cause entre la veuve et les enfants de l\u2019\u00e9meutier d\u2019une part, l\u2019appelant et le village d\u2019Amiante (que repr\u00e9sente maintenant l\u2019intim\u00e9e) d\u2019autre part. L\u2019appelant et l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9taient tous deux d\u00e9fendeurs dans la premi\u00e8re cause, et le jugement n\u2019a pas prononc\u00e9 entre eux (Art. 1241 C.C.).\nMais, comme nous l\u2019avons vu, nous devons prendre les plaidoiries \u00e9crites et le jugement dans la premi\u00e8re cause comme faisant partie de la d\u00e9claration dans la cause actuelle, et nous devons envisager les all\u00e9gations qui s\u2019y trouvent telles qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites. C\u2019est de cette fa\u00e7on qu\u2019il faut n\u00e9cessairement d\u00e9cider l\u2019inscription en droit. Si donc l\u2019on prend les faits tels qu\u2019ils ressortent de l\u2019ensemble des documents produits \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9claration par l\u2019appelant, il en r\u00e9sulte que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait sans doute, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, l\u2019employ\u00e9 de la corporation du village d\u2019Amiante, mais qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 constable et gardien de la paix et que, lors de l\u2019\u00e9meute,\nil \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019emploi, comme gardien de la paix sur les terrains, d\u2019une compagnie locataire desdits terrains;\nqu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9, pour employer l\u2019expression de monsieur le juge Letellier,\nchoisi par le conseil lui-m\u00eame comme l\u2019homme que la compagnie du cirque devait engager pour tenir l\u2019ordre,\nqu\u2019il \u00e9tait\npay\u00e9 par la compagnie qui donnait ce cirque. Il \u00e9tait en autorit\u00e9 et avait le droit et le devoir de tenir l\u2019ordre sur le terrain et de prot\u00e9ger les propri\u00e9taires et les personnes qui faisaient partie de ce cirque;\net que la violence de l\u2019\u00e9meute \u201clui donnait raison de craindre pour sa vie\u201d et qu\u2019il \u201c\u00e9tait en l\u00e9gitime d\u00e9fense lorsque l\u2019accident fatal est survenu\u201d.\nIl ne nous est pas permis, sur cette inscription en droit, de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux notes des juges de la Cour Supr\u00eame pour y constater les motifs qui les ont amen\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, car ces notes n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produites avec la d\u00e9claration de l\u2019appelant; et seule la minute du jugement de la Cour Supr\u00eame se trouve au dossier.\nA ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de il faut ajouter que l\u2019appelant n\u2019all\u00e8gue pas, dans sa d\u00e9claration, que la corporation du village d\u2019Amiante aurait autoris\u00e9, approuv\u00e9 ou adopt\u00e9 l\u2019acte \u00e0 raison duquel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivi et il a encouru les frais et pertes qu\u2019il r\u00e9clame maintenant. Il appert, au contraire, de la plaidoirie \u00e9crite de la corporation d\u2019Amiante, dans la premi\u00e8re cause, et qui fait partie de la d\u00e9claration dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, que cette corporation avait alors r\u00e9pudi\u00e9 l\u2019acte de l\u2019appelant et affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle\nn\u2019avait absolument rien \u00e0 faire avec le d\u00e9fendeur H\u00e9bert, qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 son emploi, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pay\u00e9 par elle, et n\u2019avait re\u00e7u, ni ne devait recevoir d\u2019elle aucune instruction.\nEn plus, il ne faut pas oublier que la r\u00e9clamation en dommages de l\u2019appelant comprend des frais qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 distraits et tax\u00e9s contre les demandeurs dans la premi\u00e8re cause; et il n\u2019all\u00e8gue pas qu\u2019il a tent\u00e9 de les percevoir, ou que ces demandeurs sont insolvables et incapables de les payer.\nCette all\u00e9gation \u00e9tait essentielle pour que ces frais pussent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u201cdes pertes * * * essuy\u00e9es\u201d par l\u2019appelant (Art. 1725 C.C.).\nMais cette derni\u00e8re remarque ne s\u2019adresse qu\u2019\u00e0 une partie de la r\u00e9clamation, et il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019y insister, vu que nous sommes d\u2019avis que l\u2019inseription en droit totale a \u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 juste titre, maintenue par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nR\u00e9sumons, en effet, la position de l\u2019appelant, ainsi qu\u2019elle ressort de l\u2019action telle qu\u2019il a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de la r\u00e9diger: Il \u00e9tait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement l\u2019employ\u00e9 de la corporation du village d\u2019Amiante; il \u00e9tait constable; et, sur les terrains du cirque, il \u00e9tait l\u2019employ\u00e9 de la compagnie du cirque.\nAinsi que l\u2019observe monsieur le juge Rivard dans son jugement:\nLa question de la responsabilit\u00e9 des corporations municipales pour les actes des constables qu\u2019elles ont nomm\u00e9s, selon qu\u2019ils agissent comme sergents de ville pour faire respecter les ordonnances locales, ou comme gardiens de la paix pour faire observer les lois concernant l\u2019ordre public, en d\u2019autres termes selon qu\u2019ils agissent comme agents de la corporation ou comme officiers de l\u2019Etat, s\u2019est plus d\u2019une fois pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e devant nos tribunaux. La doctrine, en cette mati\u00e8re, telle qu\u2019arr\u00eat\u00e9e par une jurisprudence constante, se trouve pleinement expos\u00e9e dans la cause de Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al vs Plante[5], avec mention des principaux arr\u00eats qui l\u2019ont consacr\u00e9e et d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e.\nNous dirons, en plus, qu\u2019il serait inutile pour nous de tenter d\u2019ajouter quoi que ce soit \u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit par les juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi dans cette affaire de Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al vs Plante (l), o\u00f9 les principes qui doivent nous guider sont expos\u00e9s d\u2019une fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9cise et compl\u00e8te.\nLa d\u00e9cision dans Doolan v. Corporation of Montreal[6], qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e par le procureur de l\u2019appelant, est bien ant\u00e9rieure (1868) \u00e0 celle de la Cour du Banc du Roi dans Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al vs Plante (1922)5. Si l\u2019on y trouvait une contradiction avec ce dernier arr\u00eat, elle ne saurait pr\u00e9valoir contre lui.\nMais il n\u2019existe aucune divergence entre les deux d\u00e9cisions. Dans la cause de Doolan[7], la Court de Revision avait jug\u00e9:\nThat a city corporation may be sued in damages for assaults committed by its servants, such as policemen, when the assaults are approved and attempted to be justified by the corporation.\nDe m\u00eame, dans la cause de Plante[8], on avait jug\u00e9 (pp. 137 et 150) :\nQu\u2019une corporation municipale est aussi responsable de l\u2019acte dommageable commis par ses officiers de police, m\u00eame si ceux-ci agissent comme gardiens de la paix, lorsqu\u2019elle a autoris\u00e9, approuv\u00e9 ou adopt\u00e9 cet acte.\nComme nous l\u2019avons vu, non seulement cette all\u00e9gation manque dans l\u2019action de l\u2019appelant, mais il r\u00e9sulte du plaidoyer de la corporation d\u2019Amiante, incorpor\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9claration, que la corporation municipale, au contraire, affirmait n\u2019avoir eu \u201cabsolument rien \u00e0 faire\u201d avec l\u2019acte de l\u2019appelant.\nQuant \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat dans la cause de Talbot v. La Compagnie d\u2019Assurance de Montmagny[9], \u00e9galement invoqu\u00e9 par le savant procureur de l\u2019appelant, sans tenir compte de la diff\u00e9rence qu\u2019il peut y avoir entre une corporation publique et une corporation priv\u00e9e, il suffit de lire le rapport du jugement pour constater que si la compagnie d\u2019assurance a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 indemniser la demanderesse des frais de d\u00e9fense encourus par son d\u00e9funt mari en faisant repousser une action en dommages dirig\u00e9e contre lui par une personne qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9nonc\u00e9e comme se donnant faussement pour sous-agent de ladite compagnie, ce fut parce que la cour d\u00e9cida, en fait, qu\u2019il avait agi en sa qualit\u00e9 de secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier g\u00e9rant avec l\u2019autorisation de la compagnie, et que le bureau de direction avait approuv\u00e9 ses actes \u201cet fait enregistrer une r\u00e9solution dans le registre de ses d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations\u201d. Il est \u00e9galement juste d\u2019ajouter que, dans cette esp\u00e8ce, la d\u00e9claration all\u00e9guait que les frais de d\u00e9fense, dans l\u2019action originaire, n\u2019avaient pas pu \u00eatre pay\u00e9s au mari de la demanderesse, parce que celui contre qui ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 adjug\u00e9s \u00e9tait insolvable.\nIl nous para\u00eet donc que les jugements de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et de la Cour du Banc du Roi sont bien fond\u00e9s. Lots de l\u2019\u00e9meute, l\u2019appelant agissait comme constable\ndans l\u2019accomplissement du devoir que la loi lui impose pour le maintien de la paix, le respect de l\u2019ordre public et la pr\u00e9vention ou la punition des crimes. C\u2019est \u00e0 cause de cela que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour Supr\u00eame ont trouv\u00e9 son acte justifiable et l\u2019ont reconnu indemne de toute responsabilit\u00e9 criminelle ou civile. C\u2019est la raison pour laquelle l\u2019action intent\u00e9e contre lui par la veuve et les enfants de l\u2019\u00e9meutier a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. Il ne peut, \u00e0 la fois, avoir re\u00e7u et accept\u00e9 le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de cette position, puis tenter d\u2019en \u00e9luder les cons\u00e9quences.\nA tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, s\u2019il ne devait pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant agi, dans les circonstances, en sa qualit\u00e9 d\u2019officier de l\u2019Etat, ce ne serait pas, quand m\u00eame, la responsabilit\u00e9 de la corporation du village d\u2019Amiante qu\u2019il aurait engag\u00e9e et avec laquelle se serait \u00e9tabli le lien de droit qu\u2019il invoque; mais ce serait avec la compagnie du cirque, si l\u2019on tient compte\u2014et cela est in\u00e9vitable\u2014de l\u2019all\u00e9gation que nous avons reproduite au commencement de ce jugement \u00e0 l\u2019effet\nqu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019emploi, comme gardien de la paix, sur les terrains, d\u2019une compagnie locataire desdits terrains, laquelle compagnie donnait des attractions et des amusements pour le public.\nCette all\u00e9gation comporte, en effet, que l\u2019appelant, lors des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu au litige, \u00e9tait l\u2019employ\u00e9 temporaire de cette compagnie et que la compagnie \u00e9tait son patron momentan\u00e9.\nCela d\u00e9coule (dit Tessier, Responsabilit\u00e9 de la puissance publique, p. 196)), du principe \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire que le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de divers commettants engage la responsabilit\u00e9 de celui dont il fait l\u2019affaire au moment de l\u2019acte dommageable;\net ce principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu et appliqu\u00e9 par la Cour Supr\u00eame et le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Bain v. Central Vermont Railway Co.[10].\nCe qu\u2019il importe de regarder dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, ce n\u2019est pas l\u2019emploi ordinaire et r\u00e9gulier de l\u2019appelant, mais c\u2019est la qualit\u00e9 en laquelle il agissait vraiment lors des \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e0 raison desquels il pr\u00e9tend maintenant recouvrer les frais et d\u00e9penses qu\u2019il a encourus. Or, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ses all\u00e9gations, au moment de l\u2019\u00e9meute, il agissait connue officier de l\u2019Etat, ou, tout au plus, il \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9, le mandataire ou l\u2019employ\u00e9 de la compagnie du cirque.\nL\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Rosaire Beaudoin.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Arthur Girouard.\n[1] (1931) Q.R. 52 K.B. 1.\n[2] [1931] S.C.R. 145.\n[3] (1931) Q.R. 52 K.B. 1.\n[4] [1919] S.C.R. 400.\n[5] (1922) Q.R. 34 K.B. 137.\n[6] (1868) 13 L.C. 71.\n5 (1922) Q.R. 34 K.B. 137.\n[7] (1868) 13 L.C. 71.\n[8] (1922) Q.R. 34 K.B. 137.\n[9] (1897) Q.R. 12 S.C. 64.\n[10] (1919) 58 Can.

Campbell and Another (Defendants)\nLe Barreau De La Province De Quebec and Another (Mis-en-cause)\n1931: October 30; 1931: November 2; 1932: March 15.\nPresent at hearing: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret and Smith JJ.; Newcombe J. took no part in the judgment, having died before the delivery thereof.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nBar of Quebec\u2014Mandamus\u2014Lawyer convicted of a criminal offence\u2014Struck from the roll\u2014Res judicata\u2014Estoppel.\nThe appellant, a lawyer practising in the province of Quebec, was, on the 7th of March, 1922, convicted of having fraudulently converted to his own use a sum of money belonging to a client; the conviction was affirmed by the appellate court on the 20th of June, 1922; and, on the 24th of July, 1922, he was sentenced to two years in penitentiary. No complaint was lodged by the syndic of the local council for the district of Montreal; but on the 23rd of June, 1922, it was decided at a meeting of that council, at which the appellant was present, to notify the secretary of the General Council of the Bar of Quebec that the offence for which the appellant had been convicted was a felony prior to the passing of the Criminal Code in 1892 and instructing him to act according to the statute incorporating the Bar. On the 26th of August, 1924, the assistant secretary of the Bar of the district of Montreal sent a copy of the conviction to the secretary of the General Council, who, the 28th of August, 1924, struck the appellant\u2019s name from the roll of advocates for Quebec. On the 13th of April, 1926, the appellant presented a petition for the issue of a mandamus against the General Bar of Quebec, calling the local Bar of the district of Montreal as third party, asking that the former be ordered to reinstate him as a member of the Bar and that the secretary of the latter be ordered to accept payment of any dues owed by him. On the 11th of October, 1926, the petition was dismissed, and there was no appeal. On the 21st of June, 1929, the appellant presented another petition for mandamus, asking that the respondent Campbell, as treasurer of the Bar for the district of Montreal, be ordered to accept payment of any fees then due and that the secretary-treasurer for the General Bar be ordered to reinstate him on the roll of the Bar of Quebec.\nHeld that under the circumstances of this case, the appellant was not entitled to the issue of the writ of mandamus prayed for by his petition. The judgment of the Superior Court rendered upon the first petition for mandamus constitutes res judicata as to the legality of the striking of the appellant\u2019s name from the roll of practising lawyers. Per Duff J.\u2014In the proceedings before the trial court on the appellant\u2019s first application for a mandamus, it was established as between the Bar of the district of Montreal and the appellant, that he was disfranchised from practising as a member of the Bar and that, for that reason, he was not entitled to call upon the treasurer of that Bar to accept his unpaid subscriptions; therefore, the conditions upon which alone the appellant could call upon the secretary-treasurer of the General Bar to act are, in point of law, non-existent, because of the estoppel as between him and the Bar of Montreal and the treasurer of that Bar.\nPer Anglin C.J.C\u2014The question of the legal nature and effect of the appellant\u2019s conviction has been conclusively determined against him by the Council of the District Bar, and its view has been equally conclusively affirmed by the appellate court. The appellant\u2019s liability to disbarment is a consequence of this conviction; and the statute incorporating the Bar of Quebec has made the Council the final judges upon the sufficiency of the conviction, unappealed and duly reported to them, to warrant their action.\nPer Rinfret J.\u2014A writ of mandamus could not be granted against the respondent Campbell, as treasurer of the District Bar, as the latter, in refusing to accept dues from the appellant, while he was no more a member of the Bar, was not refusing \u201cto perform any duty belonging to such office or any act which by law he (was) bound to perform.\u201d Art. 992 (3) C.C.P.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 49 K.B. 124) aff.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Patterson J.[2], and dismissing the appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nL. J. de la Durantaye and C. A. S\u00e9guin K.C. for the appellant.\nLs. St. Laurent K.C. and Camille Tessier for the respondents, Campbell and The Bar of the district of Montreal.\nC. A. Guertin K.C. and N. A. Millette K.C. for the respondent The General Bar of Quebec.\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014Condemned originally by the Magistrate\u2019s Court for failure to account to the complainant for a sum of approximately $1,300, the receipt of which he acknowledges, and non-repayment by him whereof to the complainant pursuant to a demand therefor, duly made on him as a member of the Bar of the Province of Quebec, he admits, the appellant now seeks to escape one of the consequences of his established guilt on the ground that he did not receive the money as bailee, or that, if he did, the character of his tenure of it was later so changed that the magistrate\u2019s judgment convicting him should not be looked upon as having amounted to a conviction for an offence which would have been a felony under the old law. The appellant on this latter ground claims his discharge from disbarment to which the Bar Council has subjected him.\nIn my opinion, the question of the legal nature and effect of the appellant\u2019s conviction has been conclusively determined against him by the Council of the District Bar, and its view has been equally conclusively affirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench. One of the consequences of this conviction is his liability to disbarment, the statute having, I think, made the district Council the final judges upon the sufficiency of the conviction, unappealed and duly reported to them, to warrant their action.\nUnder these circumstances, I cannot see my way clear to interfere with the action taken by the Council of the Bar of the District of Montreal, on a mere technical ground, such as, that conversion by a fiduciary to his own use of money belonging to his cestui que use did not amount to a felony before 1892. Of that, however, the legislature, in my opinion, has left the final and conclusive determination to the Council of the Bar of the district to which the barrister owed allegiance.\nThe early part of the judgment of Rinfret J. shews the details of the action taken by the Bar and its officers in connection with this matter and it is unnecessary, therefore, to repeat them here. A similar observation may be made as to the argument in favour of res judicata by reason of the unappealed judgment of Duclos J. on the former application for mandamus.\nThe appellant had the money of the applicant. He wrongfully kept that money. The learned trial judge found him guilty of having stolen it. He is, accordingly, a person unfit to be entrusted with the funds of others. The Council of the Bar has expressly so found. Its finding is for me conclusive on that point. I should not wittingly be party to an order of this court, which would enable such a man to resume practice before our Canadian courts\u2014a practice in which he would necessarily be entrusted with the money of others.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The controversy in this appeal, once the facts are appreciated, is seen to lie in a very narrow compass and to present little difficulty.\nI concur with my brother Smith as to the character of the offence of which the appellant was convicted; it would not, I agree, have been a felony prior to the enactment of the Criminal Code;\u2014but I also share the view of the other members of the court that the earlier proceedings in the Superior Court constitute a conclusive answer to this appeal.\nAt this point it is convenient to state my opinion\u2014it is a matter upon which I can discover no room for the slightest doubt\u2014that the secretary-treasurer of the General Council has duties to perform which are committed to him by statute; and that his responsibility in respect of those duties is one which cannot be affected by any direction given by the General Council itself. He could not, for example, justify the deletion of the name of an advocate from the roll, on the ground merely of a decision by the General Council, that the advocate had been guilty of an offence which, prior to the passing of the Criminal Code, would have been a felony, when, in truth, the offence was not of that character. The statutory disqualification under section 68 (1. b) occurs only when the conditions laid down by that enactment have come into operation. For the purpose of applying that provision, the courts, and the courts alone, have authority finally to determine the question whether or not the case comes within it. The procedure is laid down in section 69, and by that section the responsibility is put, not upon the General Council, but upon the General Secretary, to decide, in the first instance, whether the offence is one in which the enactment requires him to act. If it is, the direction of the statute is peremptory. If it is not, he is without authority.\nIt should be observed in passing, however, that courts administering the law of England have always possessed a judicial discretion in respect of the prerogative writ of mandamus; and, had it not been for the considerations I am about to mention, it might have been necessary to examine the circumstances of this case with a view to ascertaining whether they presented grounds upon which such a discretion might properly be exercised.\nBriefly, the judgment of Duclos J. seems to have established, as between the Bar of Montreal and the appellant, that the appellant was disqualified from practising as a member of the Bar of the province, and that, for that reason, he was not entitled to call upon the Treasurer of the Bar of Montreal to accept his subscriptions for the years during which they had not been paid.\nThis seems to me to be conclusive of the issue before us. Section 82 does not contemplate payment by a former advocate who, in virtue of a decision of the Superior Court in litigation between himself and the \u201cproper officer,\u201d has no right to call upon that officer to receive the subscriptions alleged to be in arrear. The appellant is precluded from requiring the Treasurer to accept his tendered subscriptions, and that is the end of the matter.\nI am not, of course, saying that the judgment of Duclos J. constitutes a case of chose jug\u00e9e, as between the appellant and the secretary-treasurer of the Bar of the province. It does not. But the conditions upon which alone the appellant could call upon the secretary-treasurer to act are, in point of law, non-existent, because of the estoppel as between him and the Bar of Montreal and the Treasurer of that Bar.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRinfret J.\u2014L\u2019appelant a demand\u00e9 r\u00e9mission d\u2019un bref p\u00e9remptoire de mandamus (en vertu de l\u2019article 996 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile), enjoignant au tr\u00e9sorier du barreau de Montr\u00e9al de recevoir le montant de certaines \u201ccotisations\u201d et de lui en d\u00e9livrer un re\u00e7u, afin que, au vu de ce re\u00e7u et sur paiement de la somme n\u00e9cessaire, le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier du conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Barreau de la province de Qu\u00e9bec soit tenu de lui d\u00e9livrer un certificat, sous le sceau du Barreau de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, lui tenant lieu d\u2019inscription au tableau de l\u2019Ordre. Le Barreau de Montr\u00e9al et le Barreau de la province de Qu\u00e9bec ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en cause, mais aucune conclusion n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise contre eux. Le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier du conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est \u00e9galement en cause, mais les conclusions contre lui ne sont que subsidiaires.\nLes faits essentiels sont les suivants:\nL\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable d\u2019un acte criminel devant le magistrat de district \u00e0 Hull, et ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi si\u00e9geant en appel.\nA une s\u00e9ance du conseil de section du barreau de Montr\u00e9al, dont l\u2019appelant relevait au moment o\u00f9 il fut trouv\u00e9 coupable, le conseil prit connaissanoe du jugement; et voici comment le proc\u00e8s-verbal relate ce qui se passa:\nApr\u00e8s discussion, le Conseil d\u00e9cide de d\u00e9noncer \u00e0 Mtre Victor Marti-neau, C.R., secr\u00e9taire du Conseil Gr\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le fait que Mtre N. J. Marion a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable d\u2019un acte qualifi\u00e9 de f\u00e9lonie avant l\u2019adoption du Code Criminel de 1892 et de prier Mtre Martineau d\u2019agir suivant la loi.\nLa proposition de Mtre H. N. Chauvin, C.R., d\u2019envoyer un avis de cette d\u00e9cision aux protonotaires et aux greffiers des diff\u00e9rentes Cours de la province, est mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9; vu que cette proc\u00e9dure rel\u00e8ve plut\u00f4t du Conseil G\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nMtre N. J. Marion se pr\u00e9sente devant le conseil et, d\u00e9clarant qu\u2019il a l\u2019intention de porter de nouveau cette cause en appel, demande au Conseil de suspendre sa d\u00e9cision jusqu\u2019au jugement final.\nMtre R. G. de Lorimier, C.R., informe alors Mtre Marion de la d\u00e9cision que vient de prendre le Conseil et lui fait savoir que cette d\u00e9cision est finale.\nMarion \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 cette s\u00e9ance, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un avis qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 par l\u2019assistant-secr\u00e9taire du conseil de section, comme suit:\nCher monsieur, Le mercredi, 25 courant, \u00e0 4 heures de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi, le conseil du Barreau prendra connaissance du jugement rendu le 29 juin dernier par la cour d\u2019appel, division de trois juges, dans la cause du Roi vs vous-m\u00eame.\nJe suis charg\u00e9 de vous dire que si vous d\u00e9sirez vous pr\u00e9senter devant le conseil \u00e0 ce sujet, vous serez entendu.\nBien \u00e0 vous,\nL\u2019Assistant-Secr\u00e9taire.\nPour se conformer \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision prise par le conseil de section, l\u2019assistant-secr\u00e9taire fit parvenir une copie du jugement au secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier du conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Ce dernier raya du tableau le nom de l\u2019appelant (art. 69 du c. 210, S.R.Q., 1925, qui \u00e9tait l\u2019article 4543 des Statuts Refondus de Qu\u00e9bec de 1909); puis il donna avis, sous le sceau du barreau de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e0 tous les secr\u00e9taires de sections, leur enjoignant de rayer le nom de rappelant. A la suite de quoi, sur transmission de cet avis par les secr\u00e9taires de sections, les protonotaires et greffiers des tribunaux de la province ray\u00e8rent \u00e9galement le nom de l\u2019appelant du tableau des avocats en leur possession.\nCette proc\u00e9dure est pr\u00e9vue par l\u2019article 85 de la loi du barreau (c. 210 S.R.Q., 1925); et, apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 accomplie,\nles protonotaires et greffiers de tous les tribunaux de (la) province doivent * * * refuser de reconna\u00eetre comme avocat celui dont le nom n\u2019appara\u00eet pas sur le tableau, ou en a \u00e9t\u00e9 ray\u00e9. (Art. 87.)\nLe 13 avril 1926, l\u2019appelant demanda r\u00e9mission d\u2019un premier bref de mandamus contre le Barreau de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, intim\u00e9, et le Barreau de Montr\u00e9al, mis-en-cause, concluant :\n\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il soit enjoint \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer le requ\u00e9rant dans l\u2019exercice de sa profession d\u2019avocat, apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il aura acquitt\u00e9 les redevances dont il est endett\u00e9 tant envers l\u2019intim\u00e9e qu\u2019envers la mise-en-cause; \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il soit enjoint au secr\u00e9taire de la mise-en-cause d\u2019accepter le paiement des redevances qui pourraient \u00eatre dues \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re par le requ\u00e9rant et de lui en donner re\u00e7u; \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il soit enjoint tant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e qu\u2019\u00e0 la mise-en-cause d\u2019avoir \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer votre requ\u00e9rant, lorsqu\u2019il se sera acquitt\u00e9 des redevances dont il peut \u00eatre endett\u00e9 envers elles, comme \u00e9tant membre en r\u00e8gle du Barreau de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, et habile \u00e0 exercer sa profession d\u2019avocat, jouissant de tous les privil\u00e8ges attach\u00e9s \u00e0 cette qualit\u00e9, le tout sous toutes peines que de droit et avec d\u00e9pens contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e, mais sans frais contre la mise-en-cause, \u00e0 moins de contestation de sa part, et, en ce cas, avec d\u00e9pens contre elle.\nCette requ\u00eate pour mandamus fut contest\u00e9e par les deux corporations du Barreau qui, toutes deux, invoqu\u00e8rent le fait que l\u2019appelant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable d\u2019un acte criminel, et all\u00e9gu\u00e8rent sp\u00e9cialement ce qui suit:\n(c) Le 25 juin 1924, apr\u00e8s avis donn\u00e9 au requ\u00e9rant, le conseil du Barreau de Montr\u00e9al a pris connaissance de ces faits et documents et a rendu jugement assimilant l\u2019acte du requ\u00e9rant au cas punissable par la radiation de son nom du tableau des avocats et a communiqu\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision au secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Barreau de la province de Qu\u00e9bec pour qu\u2019action soit prise en cons\u00e9quence, et c\u2019est en ex\u00e9cution de cette d\u00e9cision que la radiation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite;\n(d) Il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019appel de cette d\u00e9cision aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui \u00e9tait un tribunal d\u2019appel comp\u00e9tent dans les limites d\u00e9termin\u00e9es par la loi;\nLe bref de mandamus dans cette premi\u00e8re instance fut refus\u00e9 par jugement de M. le juge Duclos, rendu le 11 octobre 1926[3]. Il convient de bien noter la port\u00e9e de ce jugement. Le savant juge y d\u00e9cide deux questions principales:\n1. L\u2019offense commise, par l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9e de f\u00e9lonie avant l\u2019adoption du Code criminel de 1892;\n2. Dans une s\u00e9ance convoqu\u00e9e suivant la proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 69 (3) de la Loi du Barreau, apr\u00e8s avis donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, et o\u00f9 il \u201ca eu l\u2019occasion de se d\u00e9fendre\u201d, le conseil du barreau de Montr\u00e9al a rendu une d\u00e9cision sur le cas de l\u2019appelant. \"Il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019appel de cette d\u00e9cision au conseil du barreau de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, tel que pr\u00e9vu par la loi\u201d, et la requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelant n\u2019est \u201cqu\u2019une tentative d\u2019appel aux tribunaux de la d\u00e9cision du barreau de Montr\u00e9al, appel que la loi ne permet pas\u201d.\nComme cons\u00e9quence, sur la premi\u00e8re requ\u00eate pour mandamus, il a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 entre l\u2019appelant, d\u2019une part, et le Barreau de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et le Barreau de Montr\u00e9al, d\u2019autre part, que l\u2019acte criminel dont l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable constituait une f\u00e9lonie avant 1892; et que, en plus, le conseil du barreau de Montr\u00e9al avait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que cet acte criminel \u00e9tait une f\u00e9lonie, et avait pri\u00e9 le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier du conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019agir en cons\u00e9quence.\nL\u2019appelant avait d\u2019abord inscrit en appel du jugement de l\u2019honorable juge Duclos; mais il a subs\u00e9quemment abandonn\u00e9 son appel. Ce jugement est par l\u00e0 devenu final et a acquis le caract\u00e8re de chose jug\u00e9e entre les parties dans cette premi\u00e8re cause.\nC\u2019est dans ces circonstances, pr\u00e8s de trois ans apr\u00e8s ce premier jugement, que l\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa seconde requ\u00eate pour mandamus, qui est celle qui est maintenant devant cette cour. Il all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il est porteur d\u2019un dipl\u00f4me d\u2019admission au barreau; qu\u2019il a pr\u00eat\u00e9 serment comme avocat; qu\u2019il a pay\u00e9 ses contributions jusqu\u2019au 26 avril 1924; qu\u2019il a offert au tr\u00e9sorier du barreau de Montr\u00e9al tous les arr\u00e9rages \u00e0 date de ses cotisations et les honoraires du certificat qui peut lui tenir lieu d\u2019inscription au tableau de l\u2019Ordre, suivant la loi organique et les r\u00e8glements du barreau de la province, mais que le tr\u00e9sorier a refus\u00e9 d\u2019accepter ces sommes; qu\u2019il est ainsi priv\u00e9 du re\u00e7u du tr\u00e9sorier et qu\u2019il ne peut obtenir du secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier du conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral le certificat sous le sceau de la corporation pour lui permettre de pratiquer comme avocat; et voici maintenant ses conclusions textuelles:\nPar ces motifs, plaise \u00e0 la cour:\nEnjoindre au d\u00e9fendeur \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 de recevoir ledit montant de 135 dollars plus toutes \u00e9ch\u00e9ances \u00e0 survenir en cours d\u2019instance et d\u2019en d\u00e9livrer un re\u00e7u au demandeur; et au mis-en-cause, secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier du Conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, au vu de ce re\u00e7u, de d\u00e9livrer au demandeur, sur paiement de 7 dollars, un certificat sous le sceau du Barreau de la province de Qu\u00e9bec lui tenant lieu d\u2019inscription au Tableau de l\u2019Ordre; \u00e0 quoi faire contraints m\u00eame par corps, quoi faisant d\u00e9charg\u00e9s. Avec d\u00e9pens contre toute partie contestante.\nLes intim\u00e9s ont de nouveau all\u00e9gu\u00e9 la sentence de culpabilit\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e contre l\u2019appelant, la d\u00e9cision rendue le 25 juin 1924 par le conseil du barreau de Montr\u00e9al \u201cassimilant l\u2019acte (de l\u2019appelant) * * * au cas pr\u00e9vu par la loi et entra\u00eenant la radiation du nom du demandeur du tableau des avocats dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec\u201d * * *, Favis donn\u00e9 \u201cau Secr\u00e9taire-Tr\u00e9sorier du Barreau de la province de Qu\u00e9bec d\u2019observer la loi en cons\u00e9quence,\u201d et ils ont ajout\u00e9:\nc\u2019est en ex\u00e9cution de cette d\u00e9cision que le nom du demandeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 ray\u00e9 de la liste des avocats de la province de Qu\u00e9bec suivant la loi.\nIls ont invoqu\u00e9 la chose jug\u00e9e r\u00e9sultant du jugement de l\u2019honorable juge Duelos; et ils ont plaid\u00e9 que, en cons\u00e9quence, le tr\u00e9sorier du barreau de Montr\u00e9al n\u2019avait pas le droit ni le pouvoir d\u2019accepter les offres que l\u2019appelant all\u00e8gue lui avoir faites et que,\nen refusant ces offres, (il) n\u2019a aucunement omis, n\u00e9glig\u00e9, ou refus\u00e9 d\u2019accomplir un devoir attach\u00e9 \u00e0 sa charge ou un acte auquel la loi l\u2019oblige.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance a maintenu le mandamus; mais la Cour du Banc du Roi a unanimement infirm\u00e9 ce jugement, sur le principe que les conclusions de la premi\u00e8re requ\u00eate de mandamus comprenaient tout ce que l\u2019appelant demandait dans sa seconde requ\u00eate et que, dans ces conditions, l\u2019exception de chose jug\u00e9e oppos\u00e9e en d\u00e9fense \u00e0 la nouvelle demande de l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e.\nC\u2019est ce jugement qui est port\u00e9 devant cette cour.\nIl y a lieu au mandamus pour enjoindre l\u2019accomplissement d\u2019un devoir ou d\u2019un acte dans certains cas enumeres \u00e0 l\u2019article 992 C.P.C. Le cas invoqu\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce par l\u2019appelant est celui du paragraphe 3 de l\u2019article 992, qui se lit comme suit:\n3. Lorsqu\u2019un fonctionnaire public, ou ime personne occupant une charge dans une corporation, corps public ou tribunal de juridiction inf\u00e9rieure omet, n\u00e9glige ou refuse d\u2019accomplir un devoir attach\u00e9 \u00e0 sa charge, ou un acte auquel la loi l\u2019oblige. Pour que l\u2019appelant p\u00fbt r\u00e9ussir, il lui fallait donc \u00e9tablir que le tr\u00e9sorier du barreau de Montr\u00e9al, en refusant de recevoir $135, plus toute \u00e9ch\u00e9ance \u00e0 survenir, que l\u2019appelant lui a offerts pour ses cotisations au barreau, et d\u2019en d\u00e9livrer un re\u00e7u \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, refusait \u201cd\u2019accomplir un devoir attach\u00e9 \u00e0 sa charge, ou un acte auquel la loi l\u2019oblige.\u201d\nLe nom de l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas sur le tableau g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des avocats de la province, d\u2019o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ray\u00e9 par le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier du conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9rai, \u00e0 la suite des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui viennent d\u2019\u00eatre rapport\u00e9s. L\u2019appelant s\u2019adresse au tr\u00e9sorier du Barreau de Montr\u00e9al. Il lui offre ses arr\u00e9rages de contributions comme membre de la profession et lui demande de lui en d\u00e9livrer un re\u00e7u. Pour d\u00e9montrer que ces deux actes: accepter la contribution et en d\u00e9livrer un re\u00e7u, constituent \"un devoir attach\u00e9 \u00e0 (la) \"charge\u201d du Tr\u00e9sorier et \"un acte auquel la loi l\u2019oblige\u201d, l\u2019appelant s\u2019appuie sur l\u2019article 82 de la loi du Barreau.\nIl n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de reproduire cet article; il suffit de remarquer qu\u2019il se rapporte au cas de l\u2019avocat:\n1. dont le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 omis du tableau, faute par lui d\u2019avoir pay\u00e9 toutes les contributions; (ou)\n2. dont le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 omis par suite d\u2019une suspension de ses fonctions; (ou)\n3. dont le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 omis sans sa faute.\ni.e. par erreur.\nC\u2019est sur cet article que l\u2019appelant se base pour offrir ses arr\u00e9rages au tr\u00e9sorier du barreau de Montr\u00e9al et prendre un mandamus contre lui pour le forcer \u00e0 les accepter et \u00e0 lui donner un re\u00e7u dont il se servira aupr\u00e8s du secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pour obtenir le certificat lui donnant droit de pratiquer comme avocat.\nOr, il est bien \u00e9vident que l\u2019appelant ne tombe dans aucune des trois cat\u00e9gories bien distinctes pr\u00e9vues par l\u2019article 82.\nL\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 omis du tableau de l\u2019Ordre pour l\u2019une des raisons contenues dans cet article; il ne figure pas sur le tableau parce qu\u2019il en a \u00e9t\u00e9 ray\u00e9. En pareil cas, le tr\u00e9sorier du barreau de Montr\u00e9al, non seulement n\u2019a pas le devoir de recevoir ses contributions et de lui donner un re\u00e7u, mais il n\u2019en a pas le pouvoir. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019insister, en effet, sur la diff\u00e9rence entre un avocat qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 simplement suspendu de ses fonctions et un avocat qui est priv\u00e9 pour toujours du droit d\u2019exercer sa profession. Cette distinction est soulign\u00e9e \u00e0 chaque instant dans la loi du barreau. Seuls les \u201cavocate qui ont droit de pratiquer dans la province doivent figurer sur le tableau de l\u2019Ordre (art. 81). Seuls les avocats dont le nom est sur le tableau peuvent pratiquer devant les tribunaux de la province (art. 68); et il ne peut \u00eatre rem\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00e0 cela que dans trois cas bien d\u00e9finis: lorsque le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 omis faute par l\u2019avocat d\u2019avoir pay\u00e9 ses contributions; ou lorsque le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 omis par suite d\u2019une suspension, ou lorsque le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 omis par erreur.\nDans chacun de ces cas, l\u2019avocat peut obtenir du secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier du conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral un certificat sous le sceau de la corporation constatant qu\u2019il s\u2019est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 la loi; et ce certificat lui tient lieu d\u2019inscription au tableau pour le reste de l\u2019ann\u00e9e courante\u201d. Lorsque le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 omis par erreur, l\u2019avocat obtient le certificat gratuitement sur premi\u00e8re demande.\nLorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 omis par suite d\u2019une suspension, il peut obtenir le certificat \u201c\u00e0 l\u2019expiration du temps pour lequel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu\u201d, en payant les contributions et les honoraires.\nLorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 omis, faute par lui d\u2019avoir pay\u00e9 toutes les contributions, il n\u2019a qu\u2019\u00e0 les payer \u00e0 qui de droit; et, sur production du re\u00e7u, il obtient le certificat du secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier du conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nMais tel n\u2019est pas le cas de l\u2019appelant. Lorsque le tr\u00e9sorier du barreau de Montr\u00e9al, en refusant d\u2019accepter sa contribution et de lui en donner un re\u00e7u, r\u00e9pond \u00e0 l\u2019appelant qu\u2019il ne peut recevoir cette contribution au barreau parce qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ray\u00e9 du tableau et qu\u2019il a cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre membre de la profession, cette raison constitue une r\u00e9ponse compl\u00e8te au mandamus de l\u2019appelant, ce dernier ne peut pr\u00e9tendre que le tr\u00e9sorier du barreau de Montr\u00e9al, en agissant ainsi, refuse d\u2019accomplir un devoir \u201cattach\u00e9 \u00e0 sa charge ou un acte auquel la loi l\u2019oblige\u201d (C.P.C. 992-3), et, par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019y a pas lieu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9mission d\u2019un bref de mandamus en pareil cas.\nNaturellement, l\u2019appelant pr\u00e9tend que son nom n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre ray\u00e9. Mais c\u2019est l\u00e0 une toute autre question, qui ne concerne pas le tr\u00e9sorier du Barreau de Montr\u00e9al. Ce n\u2019est pas lui qui a ray\u00e9 le nom. Ce n\u2019est pas \u00e0 lui qu\u2019il appartient de le r\u00e9installer. C\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l\u00e0 le d\u00e9bat qui s\u2019est engag\u00e9 dans la premi\u00e8re instance entre l\u2019appelant d\u2019une part, le Barreau de Montr\u00e9al et le Barreau de la province de Qu\u00e9bec d\u2019autre part; et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9 contre rappelant par le jugement de l\u2019honorable juge Duclos. Sur ce point et sous ce rapport, il y a chose jug\u00e9e contre l\u2019appelant. Quand l\u2019appelant s\u2019est adress\u00e9 au tr\u00e9sorier pour lui demander de recevoir ses contributions, il s\u2019adressait \u00e0 lui non pas comme \u00e0 un officier de la loi qui a des devoirs statutaires, mais comme \u00e0 un mandataire et un repr\u00e9sentant du Barreau de Montr\u00e9al. Le tr\u00e9sorier per\u00e7oit les contributions pour le compte du Barreau de Montr\u00e9al. La question de savoir si le nom de l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et validement ray\u00e9 du tableau est chose jug\u00e9e pour le repr\u00e9sentant du Barreau de Montr\u00e9al tout autant qu\u2019elle l\u2019est pour le Barreau de Montr\u00e9al lui-m\u00eame.

Millar[4].\nPour ces raisons, je rejetterais l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nSmith J.\u2014The appellant (plaintiff) was an advocate of the province of Quebec duly enrolled and was in practice in the district of Hull.\nOn the 23rd January, 1922, one Mrs. Daniel laid complaint against him before the district magistrate in Hull, as follows:\n* * * that at the city of Hull, in the said district of Hull, on or about the 30th day of March, 1921, Napol\u00e9on J. Marion of Hull, aforesaid, in his capacity of attorney for dame Anna Daniel, widow of the late Antoine Asselin, in her quality of tutrix to Emma Pleau, did receive from Mr. T. P. Foran, K.C., thirteen hundred dollars ($1,300) by cheque, payable to the order of said tutrix, which cheque the said N. J. Marion induced the said tutrix to endorse in order to withdraw the said money to pay it over to said tutrix as settlement of her share in the case then pending in the Superior Court of the district of Hull, which sum of money, less two hundred and five dollars, he did fraudulently convert to his own use, and fraudulently omitted to account for, and thereby did steal the said sum of money, and this contrary to the form of the statute in such cases made and provided.\nThe indictment was proferred in the same terms on 15th February, 1922, and on 7th March following he was found guilty, but sentence was deferred, pending the hearing of a reserved case. The appeal court ordered the magistrate to return a new stated case, which he did in the following terms:\n1. Elle a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que Marion \u00e9tait agent de la demanderesse \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9, il \u00e9tait son avocat.\n2. Qu\u2019en sa qualit\u00e9 d\u2019agent, il a re\u00e7u valeur ch\u00e8que de $1,300, remis par T. P. Foran.\n3. Cette valeur, la demanderesse n\u2019en a jamais connu port\u00e9e, ni eu libre possession, elle ne l\u2019a pas eue un instant entre ses mains. Marion a collect\u00e9 le produit; il a re\u00e7u $1,300. D\u00e9position du g\u00e9rant de la Banque Provinciale.\n4. Ces produits, il les a convertis \u00e0 son usage \u00e0 la banque N.-E. Il a tir\u00e9 sur ce d\u00e9p\u00f4t, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 \u00e9puisement. D\u00e9position du g\u00e9rant de la Banque Nouvelle-Ecosse.\n5. Marion pr\u00e9tend avoir agi sur la force d\u2019un certain endossement non prouv\u00e9 et certains documents. Ces documents sont absolument nuls et ill\u00e9gaux, et \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des articles 297, 298 et 307 du code civil, comme aussi du code de proc\u00e9dure civile, aux articles 1347 et 1348, et n\u2019ont pu \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration par la cour, et ne peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s ici que comme du surplusage aggravant l\u2019offense plut\u00f4t que de l\u2019att\u00e9nuer.\n6. Il n\u2019a jamais rendu compte, tout au contraire, il s\u2019est retranch\u00e9 derri\u00e8re toutes sortes d\u2019excuses pour faire croire \u00e0 la demanderesse qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9. D\u00e9position de la tutrice et de dame Anna Asselin.\n7. Qu\u2019il n\u2019a jamais fait remise et n\u2019a jamais prouv\u00e9 sa bonne foi, vis-\u00e0-vis de la demanderesse, ni devant la cour.\nPour la cour, la quintessence du crime \u00e9tait prouv\u00e9e, elle a cru de son devoir de rendre jugement en cons\u00e9quence.\nOn the 20th June, 1924, the Court of King\u2019s Bench confirmed the judgment of the magistrate, the notes of one of the judges containing the following:\u2014\nUpon a re-statement of the case, the learned magistrate states in detail what was proved before him. He states that the conviction is based upon the fact that it was proved that appellant, in his quality of agent of Daniel, received a cheque for $l,300 which he cashed and converted to his own use.\nUpon these facts I can only say that the question should be answered in the affirmative and an offence known to the law is disclosed and proven. I should maintain the conviction.\nOn the 24th July following, the magistrate sentenced Marion to two years in the penitentiary.\nOn the 23rd June, prior to the date of the sentence, the assistant secretary of the Bar of Montreal sent Marion a letter, as follows: Le Barreau de Montr\u00e9al,\nPalais de Justice, Montr\u00e9al,\n24 juin 1924.\nM. N. J. Marion,\n71A rue St-Jacques, Montr\u00e9al.\nCher monsieur.\nLe mercredi, 25 courant, \u00e0 4 heures de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi, le conseil du Barreau prendra connaissance du jugement rendu le 29 juin dernier par la cour d\u2019appel, division de trois juges, dans la cause du Roi vs vous-m\u00eame.\nJe suis charg\u00e9 de vous dire que si vous d\u00e9sirez vous pr\u00e9senter devant le conseil \u00e0 ce sujet, vous serez entendu.\nBien \u00e0 vous,\nL\u2019assistant secr\u00e9taire,\n(Sign\u00e9) J. M. Nantel.\nThere was no complaint lodged by the syndic or other officer of the section council, but at the date fixed by the notice there was a meeting of the council, at which Marion was present, and the following appears in the minutes:\nApr\u00e8s discussion, le Conseil d\u00e9cide de d\u00e9noncer \u00e0 Mtre Victor Marti-neau, C.R., secr\u00e9taire du Conseil G\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le fait que Mtre N. J. Marion a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable d\u2019un crime qualifi\u00e9 de f\u00e9lonie avant l\u2019adoption du Code Criminel de 1892 et de prier Mtre Martineau d\u2019agir suivant la loi.\nLa proposition de Mtre H. N. Chauvin. C.R., d\u2019envoyer un avis de cette d\u00e9cision aux protonotaires et aux greffiers des diff\u00e9rentes Cours de la province, est mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9; vu que cette proc\u00e9dure rel\u00e8ve plut\u00f4t du Conseil G\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nMtre N. J. Marion se pr\u00e9sente devant le conseil et, d\u00e9clarant qu\u2019il a l\u2019intention de porter de nouveau cette cause en appel, demande au Conseil de suspendre sa d\u00e9cision jusqu\u2019au jugement final.\nMtre R. G. de Lorimier, C.R., informe alors Mtre Marion de la d\u00e9cision que vient de prendre le Conseil et lui fait savoir que cette d\u00e9cision est finale.\nOn the 26th August, 1924, the assistant secretary of the Bar of Montreal sent a copy of the conviction to the secretary-treasurer of the Council of the Bar of the province of Quebec, who, on the 28th August, 1924, struck Marion\u2019s name out of the list of advocates for the province of Quebec, and sent the legal notice of same.\nIn the present action, Marion contends that the secretary-treasurer of the Bar of the province of Quebec had no jurisdiction to strike his name off the roll as he did, because he was under no disqualification; and that, having tendered the arrears of his contributions to the treasurer of the Bar of Montreal, it was the duty of that officer to accept same and give a receipt, pursuant to sec. 82 of the Bar Act, chap. 210, R.S.Q., 1925, on presentation of which it would have become the duty of the secretary-treasurer of the Bar of the province of Quebec to give him a certificate in lieu of his inscription on the roll.\nThe validity of these contentions must be tested by the provisions of the Bar Act. The Act provides that the advocates of the province shall form a corporation called \u201cThe General Corporation of the Bar,\u201d which shall be divided into sections, each of which shall form a separate corporation, one of which is named \u201cThe Bar of Montreal.\u201d\nThe general corporation may make by-laws for maintaining the honour and dignity of the Bar and discipline among its members, and for preparation and publication of the general roll of advocates in the province, and for other purposes.\nThe general corporation and the corporation of sections may make by-laws for defining the duties and functions of their officers, and for certain other purposes.\nThe powers of the general corporation are to be exercised by a council called the \u201cGeneral Council of the Bar of the province of Quebec\u201d which shall select a secretary-treasurer who shall be a member of the council.\nThe Council of each section is to be composed of a batonnier, a syndic, a treasurer, a secretary, and, for Montreal, nine elected members.\nThe syndic is specially charged with the supervision of the discipline of the Bar. He is bound immediately to inform the council of the section of any conduct of a member derogatory to the honour of the Bar, and to submit to it any accusation handed to him, saving the right of the council to receive the same directly or to take the initiative in the exercise of its disciplinary powers.\nEvery complaint against a member shall be made under oath before the syndic, batonnier or secretary of the Bar of the district where it is laid. Each council of a section may pronounce a censure or reprimand against a member guilty of a breach of discipline or any act derogatory to the honour and dignity of the Bar, and may also suspend him forever from the right of practising his profession.\nIn the exercise of these powers, the council is to proceed deliberately and allow the accused to defend himself. The decision is subject to appeal to the General Council to be instituted by letter to the secretary-treasurer of such council, but such appeal shall lie only when it appears on the face of the complaint, decision or sentence that the council had no jurisdiction; and no appeal shall lie to the courts from decisions rendered by the council of any section.\nEvery member shall pay to the treasurer of his section certain prescribed subscriptions and dues, and the treasurer shall forward annually, before the 5th of May, to the secretary-treasurer of the General Council a list of all the advocates in his section who have paid their subscriptions and dues for the previous year, and the current year.\nSection 68 provides that no advocate shall practise in any of the courts of the province in the following cases:\n(b) If he has been found guilty of any criminal offence ranked as a felony before the passing of the Criminal Code, 1892, of perjury, or subornation of perjury, of conspiracy to defraud, or of one of the criminal offences set forth in sections 405, 406, 407, 412 and 442 of the Criminal Code.\n(c) If his name is not inscribed on the General Roll of the advocates of the Province;\n(d) If he has been suspended from his functions by a court or by a council of his section or by the General Council.\nThe secretary-treasurer of the General Council is required every year during the month of May, as far as practicable, to prepare a general roll of all the advocates having a right to practise in the province, taking as a basis the information supplied him by the treasurers of sections, the secretary-treasurers of library associations and the registers in his possession, but only those who have paid their subscriptions and are not disqualified or suspended.\nSection 82 provides that:\nAny advocate, whose name has been omitted from the roll for neglecting to pay all his subscriptions, may, at any time, pay the same to the proper officer; and on producing the receipts or certificates of the said officer, the secretary-treasurer of the General Council shall give to such advocate a certificate, under the seal of the corporation, showing that he has complied with the law, and such certificate shall take the place of the entry on the roll for the rest of the current year; and provided such advocate be not under the effect of a sentence of disqualification or suspension from his functions, he may, on producing such certificate before the prothonotary or clerk of the court, practise as if his name were on the roll.\nIt will be observed that the only action taken at the meeting of the Council of the Bar of Montreal was the resolution to notify the secretary of the General Council of the fact that Marion had been found guilty of a crime ranked as a felony before the passing of the Criminal Code, 1892.\nActing on this resolution the assistant secretary wrote to the secretary of the General Council, enclosing what he calls a copy of the judgment in the affair of The King v. Marion, in virtue of which Marion is condemned to two years in the penitentiary. The original of this letter was not produced, and the only proof of its loss was the statement of Mr. Nantel, the writer of the letter, that Mr. Martineau, to whom it was addressed, had died and Mr. Jodoin, Mr. Martineau\u2019s successor, told him he had not found the original. At all events, the only ground that this notification furnished to Mr. Martineau, the secretary of the General Council, for striking Marion\u2019s name off the list was the conviction, and he and the Council of the Bar of Montreal purported to act under sec. 68 of the Act on the view that the conviction was for an offence ranked as a felony before the passing of the Criminal Code, 1892.\nThe offence for which Marion was convicted was not a felony prior to 1892 unless it comes within sec. 4 of the Larceny Act, R.S.C., 1886, c. 164, which is as follows:\n4. Every one who, being a bailee of any chattel, money or valuable security, fraudulently takes or converts the same to his own use or to the use of any person other than the owner thereof, although he does not break bulk or otherwise determine the bailment, is guilty of larceny, and may be convicted thereof upon an indictment for larceny; but this section shall not extend to any offence punishable on summary conviction.\nIt has been held that the bailment intended by this section is a deposit of something to be specifically returned, and, therefore, one who receives money with no obligation to return the identical coins received is not a bailee within the section; R. v. Hassall[5]; R. v. Garrett[6]; R. v. Hoare[7]; R. V. de Banks[8].\nI think it is impossible to hold here that there was an obligation to return the identical coins, and that, therefore, the offence was not a felony prior to the passing of the Criminal Code in 1892. There was, therefore, no power to strike Marion off the roll under the provisions of s. 62.\nThe Council of the section of Montreal could have struck him off for life by proceedings under sect. 27 and 28 of the Act, but can it be said that any such proceedings were taken, or that any pronouncement was made by that body, depriving him forever of the right of practising his profession?\nNo complaint was laid under oath, pursuant to s. 22, and the Council did not purport to hear any complaint or to render any decision on a complaint and award of punishment under s. 27. The view was that s. 68 applied, and that Marion at once ceased to have the right to practise, and that his name must be struck off by the General Secretary upon receipt of the certified copy of the sentence as provided by sec. 69.\nIn my opinion, therefore, Marion did not in fact become disqualified automatically by virtue of section 68 and was not disqualified by any decision of the council of the Montreal section on complaint under section 27.\nWe must, however, consider the effect of the judgment in the former litigation instituted by Marion against the Bar of the province of Quebec and the Bar of Montreal.\nI have examined carefully the reasoning of my brother Rinfret on this point and agree with his conclusion with regard to it.\nIn those proceedings there was put directly in issue the question of whether or not Marion had ceased to be a member of the Bar of Quebec, and the decision of the court was that, by virtue of section 68 and also by virtue of a decision of the council of the Montreal section, he had ceased to be such member.\nWhile this decision is contrary to the view I have expressed above, it is, nevertheless, a final judgment on the issue of fact and is, therefore, binding as between the parties quite regardless of whether, as a matter of law, it was correct or not.\nThe statutory duty of the respondent treasurer of the Bar of Montreal is to receive subscriptions and dues from those who are members of the Bar and Marion having, by the judgment referred to, which binds him, been declared not to be a member of the Bar, there was no obligation on the treasurer to receive the dues tendered and to give a receipt for same. The argument that the service of his sentence and fulfilment of the terms of the ticket of leave by Marion freed him of all the consequences of his crime including disqualification from practice is, in my opinion, wholly untenable.\nI agree that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: De la Durantaye, Martineau & Reeves.\nSolicitor for the respondent Campbell and the Bar of the District of Montreal: Camille Tessier.\nSolicitor for the respondent The Bar of Quebec: C.A.

Paragraph 2 of Part One of these Rules, as it was before General Order no. 490, read as follows:\u2014\n\u201cThe applicant shall at all times wholly indemnify the Company owning, operating or using the said railway of, from and against all loss, cost, damage, and expense to which the said railway company may be put by reason of any damage or injury to persons or property caused by any of the said wires or cables or any works or appliance herein provided for not being erected in all respects in compliance with the terms and provisions of this order, as well as any damage or injury resulting from the imprudence, neglect, or want of skill of the employees or agents of the applicant.\u201d General Order 490 re-enacted this clause as follows:\u2014\n\u201c2. The applicant shall at all times wholly indemnify the Company owning, operating, or using the railway from and against all loss, damage, injury and expense to which the Railway Company may be put by reason of any damage or injury to persons or property caused by any of the said applicant\u2019s wires or cables, or any works herein provided for by the terms and provisions of this Order as well as against any damage or injury resulting from the imprudence, neglect or want of skill of the employees or agents of the applicant, unless the cause of such loss, cost, damage, injury, or expense can be traced elsewhere.\u201d\nIn effect the changes made by General Order 490 are shown by the italic portions of the above quoted paragraphs, the words underlined in the previous Order being omitted in Order 490 and the words in italic in the latter being added as new. The intended effect of the change was to impose upon the appellant Commission or any other person applying for and obtaining leave from the Board to construct and maintain power lines along or across a railway, the burden of wholly indemnifying the railway companies against all damages to persons or property resulting from the applicant\u2019s wires or cables unless the cause of the damage can be traced elsewhere. This matter originated in an application made by the respondents to the Board as a result of which the appellant Commission and others who were deemed to be interested were notified that certain amendments to General Order no. 231 were proposed by the respondents and to appear before the Board on February 27, 1928, to present any objections thereto. The appellant Commission and others accordingly appeared by counsel before the Board on that date and presented their objections to the proposed amendments, following which the Board took the matter under advisement and in February, 1931, rendered its decision and made the Order no. 490 appealed from.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C., Geo. H. Montgomery K.C. and H. Hansard for the appellant The Canadian Electrical Association.\nE. Bristol K.C. for the appellant The Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario. W. N. Tilley K.C. for the respondent The Railway Association of Canada.\nA. Fraser K.C. for the respondent The Canadian National Railways.\nE. P. Flintoft K.C. for the respondent The Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.\nVincent W. Price for the Michigan Central Railroad Co.\nThe judgments of Duff, Lamont and Smith JJ. were delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014Section 372 was not attacked as ultra vires, and reading the term \u201calong\u201d as stretching \u201clongitudinally\u201d upon the right of way, it is not seriously open to objection. Otherwise the phrase \u201cfor other purposes\u201d in the principal clause might be obnoxious to the British North America Act and the section might then have to be read as if those words were eliminated.\nThe substantive question is whether section 2 of the order in its amended form, has been validly promulgated. That section is as follows:\u2014\nThe applicant shall, at all times, wholly indemnify the company, owning, operating or using the railway, from and against all loss, damage, injury and expense to which the railway company may be put by reason of any damage or injury to persons or property, caused by any of the said applicant\u2019s wires or cables, or any works herein provided for by the terms and provisions of this order, as well as against any damage or injury resulting from the imprudence, neglect or want of skill of the employees or agents of the applicant, unless the cause of such loss, cost, damage, injury or expense can be traced elsewhere.\nThe controversy is, I think, susceptible of a brief solution. The Dominion Parliament has power to prohibit all such works as those comprised in the order under discussion. The language of subsection 3 is comprehensive enough to embrace any \u201cterm or condition\u201d; and unless there is something in the order in question which is in itself absurd, or something in the statute which is repugnant to the order, then the order is valid. Lord Macnaghten\u2019s judgment in Vacher v. London Society of Compositors[1]. The statute does not elsewhere deal with the subject matter of the order and there is nothing to which our attention has been called that is inconsistent with it. I can perceive no absurdity in the sense in which the word is used in the canon of construction laid down by Lord Macnaghten. I find it impossible to affirm that the condition required by section 2 is one which it would be unreasonable for an administrative body such as the Board of Railway Commissioners to enact as the price of such privileges as those with which the order deals.\nAs to the contention that the matter of the condition is in its nature a matter exclusively for the provincial legislatures, I can only say that I do not understand the point.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgments of Rinfret and Cannon JJ. (dissenting), were delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014In the generation and distribution of electrical energy, it is frequently necessary for the electric power companies to construct and maintain lines, wires and other conductors and structures or appliances for the conveyance of power or electricity along or across a railway; or across or near other such lines, wires, conductors, structures or appliances which are within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.\nWhen a power company is desirous of constructing or maintaining its lines or wires along or across the lines or wires, etc., of any other Dominion company, it must either obtain the consent of the other company, or obtain the permission of the Board of Railway Commissioners of Canada, under section 372 of the Railway Act (c. 170 of R.S.C., 1927) which reads as follows:\u2014\n372. Lines, wires, other conductors or other structures or appliances for telegraphic or telephonic purposes, or for conveyance of power or electricity for other purposes, shall not, without leave of the Board, except as provided in subsection five of this section, be constructed or maintained.\n(a) along or across a railway, by any company other than the railway company owning or controlling the railway; or\n(b) across or near other such lines, wires, conductors, structures or appliances, which are within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.\n2. Upon any application for such leave, the applicant shall submit to the Board a plan and profile of the part of the railway or other work proposed to be affected, showing the proposed location and the proposed works.\n3. The Board may grant the application and may order the extent to which, by whom, how, when, on what terms and conditions, and under what supervision, the proposed works may be executed. 4. Upon such order being made the proposed works may be constructed and maintained subject to and in accordance with such order.\n5. Leave of the Board under this section shall not be necessary for the exercise of the powers of a railway company under section three hundred and sixty-seven of this Act, nor for the maintenance of works now authorized, nor when works have been or are to be constructed or maintained by consent and in accordance with any general orders, regulations, plans or specifications adopted or approved by the Board for such purposes.\u201d\nPursuant to the provisions of that section, which was then section 246 of chapter 37 of the Revised Statutes of 1906, the Board issued General Order no. 231 adopting \u201crules for wires erected along or across railways,\u201d to which was annexed a schedule setting forth \u201cstandard conditions and specifications for wire crossings\u201d and providing for two methods of crossing: Part I, Over-crossing; and Part II, Underground lines. General Order no. 231 was later amended by General Order no. 291.\nIn view of certain objections made or terms insisted upon by the railway companies, the General Order was again amended on the 20th February, 1931, and paragraph 2 of the Standard Conditions relating to Over-crossings was made to read as follows:\u2014\n2. The applicant shall, at all times, wholly indemnify the company owning, operating or using the railway, from and against all loss, damage, injury and expense to which the railway company may be put by reason of any damage or injury to persons or property, caused by any of the said applicant\u2019s wires or cables, or any works herein provided for by the terms and provisions of this order, as well as against any damage or injury resulting from the imprudence, neglect or want of skill of the employees or agents of the applicant, unless the cause of such loss, cost, damage, injury or expense can be traced elsewhere.\nThe question in controversy is whether the Board had jurisdiction to issue that Order (No. 490). It comes before this court, pursuant to leave granted under subsection 3 of section 52 of the Railway Act, upon the following question submitted by the Board:\nAs a matter of law, had the Board jurisdiction to make General Order No. 490 dated 20th February, 1931?\nThe appellants are The Canadian Electrical Association and The Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario. They submit that, upon an application for leave to cross railways with power lines, the authority of the Board is \u201climited to imposing terms and conditions as to the manner and means of construction of the works;\u201d and, that, in this connection, the Board is without jurisdiction to alter the law in force in the various provinces relating to the respective liabilities in damages of the railway company and the power companies.\nThe respondents are The Canadian National Railways, The Canadian Pacific Railway Company, The Michigan Central Railroad Company, and The Railway Association of Canada. They uphold the Order, and they contend that it is well within the competence of the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nThe Hydro Electric Power Commission of Ontario is a provincial institution. The Canadian Electrical Association includes several companies provincially incorporated. This should be borne in mind when dealing with the matter now before the court.\nThe appellants were authorized, by Dominion or provincial statutes, to construct or maintain their respective transmission lines in a given territory. They were incorporated to render a public service; and the legislature which called them into existence may be assumed to have regarded the services of these electrical and power companies as being in the public interest in no lesser degree than the services of the railway. The Dominion companies\u2014railway or power\u2014derive their authority from the same legislature. In the absence of a specific provision, section 372 should not be so construed as to give the Board the right to prevent the electrical companies from crossing altogether, or to attach to the permission granted by it such conditions as would practically defeat their statutory rights, or as would give to the railway companies a preferential position in respect of liability in damages. The enactment should, we think, be interpreted to mean that the Board ought to grant leave subject to certain terms and conditions. See Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General for British Columbia[2]. When Parliament intended, in the Railway Act, to delegate to the Board the power to refuse leave, it said so in express words. An instance of this may be found in the very next section of the Act, subsection 4 of section 373:\nThe Board may refuse or may grant such application in whole or in part, etc. The real question is what \u201cterms and conditions\u201d the Board may prescribe upon granting the application; and that question turns upon the interpretation of subsections 3 and 4 of section 372. So far as material, the language is:\n3. The Board * * * may order * * * on what terms and conditions * * * the proposed works may be executed.\n4. Upon such order being made the proposed works may be constructed and maintained subject to and in accordance with such order.\nThe expressions are very wide; and, to borrow the language of Lord Macmillan, delivering the judgment of the judicial Committee in Canadian Pacific Railway Company V. Toronto Transportation Commission[3],\nWhere the matter is left so much at large, practical considerations of common sense must be applied, especially in dealing with what is obviously an administrative provision.\nLiability in damages is fundamentally a matter of property and civil rights. While the competence of the Dominion Parliament to provide for matters which, though affecting civil rights, are necessarily incidental to effective legislation in respect of Dominion railways, may not be doubted[4], Parliament should not be assumed to have legislated so as to appropriate the provincial field, except if the intention so to do is clearly indicated. And if that be true of Parliament, a fortiori must it be so of a subordinate body, like the Board of Railway Commissioners, whose duties, when acting under section 372, are essentially administrative.\nThe power to create civil liability is not easily understood to have been delegated. In order to conclude that Parliament intended to delegate it in the premises, we should require more explicit language than that found in subsections 3 and 4 of section 372.\nFull effect can be given to the language of those subsections without implying the grant of the power claimed by the Board when framing General Order no. 490. Having regard to the ordinary functions of the Board and to the general scheme of the Railway Act, the safe course is to interpret the expression \u201cterms and conditions as having reference to the engineering features and protective devices relating to the actual construction of the works and their maintenance, and to decide that they are limited to prescribing the manner and the means of construction, that is: the material safeguards, with a view to protection and safety.\nIt was suggested that the Order might be supported on the ground of compensation, and that a provision for indemnifying the railway companies in all cases of accidents might be considered as a means\u2014even if unusual\u2014of ordering payment of compensation.\nBut the answer to that suggestion would be:\n1. That, under the Railway Act (except in cases specially provided for), the Board has nothing to do with the proceedings whereby compensation is to be ascertained; and\n2. That wherever it was intended to empower the Board to make directions as to compensation, a special authorization to that effect is contained in the section of the Act under which action is to be taken.\nIn that respect, reference may be made to sections 39, subs. 1; 215 to 243, dealing with expropriations; 252, subs. 3 (e); 255, 256, subs. 3; 257, subs. 2; etc., of the Railway Act. Under each of these sections, although the Board is given the power to grant applications upon such terms and conditions as it deems expedient, yet where it was intended that compensation may be made a term of the order, it was deemed necessary to insert in the enactment a special provision to that effect. On the contrary, when the expression terms and conditions is used alone, without reference to compensation, it is to be found in sections where, on account of the nature of the enactment, it does not appear to have been the intention of Parliament that compensation should be paid.\nLet us illustrate the point by a reference to sections 272 and 273 of the Act, dealing with farm crossings. The Board may, upon the application of any landowner, order the company to provide and construct a suitable farm crossing across the railway wherever, in any case, the Board deems it necessary for the proper enjoyment of his land; and the Board may order and direct how, when, where, by whom and upon what \u201cterms and conditions\u201d such farm crossing shall be constructed and maintained. One would hardly suggest that, by these expressions, Parliament intended to empower the Board to impose conditions of civil liability upon the farmer as a result of using the farm crossing. In that respect, Parliament did impose civil responsibility upon its creature, the railway company; but it did so in specific terms, and not by way of delegation. (Railway Act, sects. 385 and following). Under section 372 the power is not given to the Board, either in express terms or by necessary implication therefrom.\nThat the Board itself up to the time the present orders were issued, understood its powers and the policy of the Railway Act to be in accordance with the views we are now expressing may be gathered from the judgments of Chief Commissioners Blair, Killam and Mabee respectively in the York Street Bridge case[5]; Duthie v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[6], and Bell Telephone Co. v. Nipissing Power Co.[7]; also from comparatively recent pronouncements of the Board: City of Windsor v. Bell Telephone Co.; and Bell Telephone Company v. City of Ottawa[8].\nWe think our conclusion is also supported by the decision of the Judicial Committee in Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company v. The Landowners on streets in Fort William[9].\nIn that case, the Board of Railway Commissioners ordered that the railway company might construct its line of railway along certain streets through the city of Fort William. The order was made subject to the express condition that the railway should\nmake full compensation to all persons interested for all damage sustained by reason of the location of the said railway.\nOn behalf of the landowners (respondents), it was contended that section 47 of the Railway Act, on its true construction, authorized the Board to impose the condition contained in its order, or that otherwise it had implied authority to frame its order as it thought right. It was urged that the Board, in considering whether a proper location of the railway should or should not be approved, must, in the proper exercise of its discretion and taking into account all the circumstances, judicially determine whether it should impose any and what condition on which its approval should be granted. The language of section 47 of the Railway Act, as it then was, related to the conditions which the Board may impose, and stated, in part, as follows:\u2014\nThe Board may direct in any order that such order or any portion or provision thereof shall come into force * * * upon the performance, to the satisfaction of the Board or persons named by it, of any terms which the Board may impose upon any party interested.\nLord Shaw, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, said:\u2014\nThis language is certainly general and comprehensive; but, in their Lordships\u2019 view, it cannot be interpreted as being designed to alter the other and specific provisions of the statute as to the compensation payable by the railway company. The particular application now being dealt with falls within the scope of s. 237, which applies to \u201cany application for leave to construct the railway upon, along, or across an existing highway.\u201d By subs. 3 of that section it is provided that when the application is of that character \u201call the provisions of law at that time applicable to the taking of land by the company, to its valuation and sale and conveyance to the company, and to the compensation therefor, shall apply to the land exclusive of the highway crossing required for the proper carrying out of any order made by the Board.\u201d It does not appear to their Lordships that it would be safe to infer from the generality and comprehensiveness of the powers of the Board, and apart from any specific reference to the compensation itself and the parties entitled thereto, that these provisions of s. 237 were liable to be altered, abrogated or enlarged by the exercise of the Board\u2019s administrative power under s. 47.\nThe reasons above referred to, which might induce administrative action so as to make the compensation properly equate with the injury to all interests, are reasons which might or might not appear sufficient for direct legislative interposition, but, as already mentioned, their Lordships, apart from that, cannot interpose by the inference argued for. On the contrary it appears to them that the administrative action taken was beyond the powers of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, under the law as it stood at the date of the order.\nAn additional argument in favour of the appellant\u2019s contention may be found in the wording of subsection 3 of section 372, which is to the effect that the Board\nmay order * * * on what terms and conditions * * * the proposed work may be executed,\nthe more natural meaning of that language being that the terms and conditions which the Board is empowered to order have reference to the actual execution of the work.

(Lamont J., dissenting, contra).\nPlaintiffs claimed damages for the deaths of the occupants of a motor car through its collision with defendant company\u2019s electric train. The jury found negligence both in defendants and in the driver of the motor car, assessed damages, and apportioned the fault, 25% to defendants, and 75% to the driver of the motor car. This Court held that, having regard to the evidence, the assessment of damages was unreasonably large and such as must have been occasioned by a misunderstanding of the basis upon which the amount ought to be determined; also that the jury should have been asked who was actually driving the motor car, and whether any of the other occupants stood in such a relation to the driver as to imply his responsibility for the driver\u2019s contributory fault or neglect; and that there should be a new trial, but limited to the following issues: (1) the entire amount of damages suffered by each plaintiff; (2) to whom and how should responsibility for the contributory negligence found by the jury be imputed. (Lamont J. dissented, holding, on his grounds next stated, that the action should be dismissed.)\nPer Lamont J., dissenting: The requirement, to give a right of action under the Fatal Accidents Act, that deceased\u2019s death was caused by a wrongful act, neglect or default of defendant, has not been affected by the Contributory Negligence Act. To hold that the present action should succeed, with such damages only as would be proportioned to defendants\u2019 fault, would mean that the Contributory Negligence Act, by inference, has amended the Fatal Accidents Act in matters which are of its very essence, viz., (1) so as to give a right of action to dependants where the death, though not caused, has been contributed to, by defendant\u2019s negligence; and (2), so as to restrict dependants\u2019 measure of damages as given by the Fatal Accidents Act, which is based on a principle entirely different from that applicable were deceased living and suing; and implication of such amendments is not justified by the provisions of the Contributory Negligence Act. That Act applies only to cases where the damages sought to be recovered in the action resulted partly from the defendant\u2019s fault and partly from the plaintiff\u2019s fault.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs, and cross-appeal by the defendants, from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] ordering a new trial.\nThe action was brought under the Ontario Fatal Accidents Act, for the benefit of the plaintiff Laura Littley and her son, Stanley Littley, to recover damages for the deaths of the husband and three children of the said Laura Littley, who were occupants of a motor car, the deaths resulting from a collision between the motor car and an electric train of the defendant company, which collision the plaintiffs alleged was caused by the negligence of the defendant company, its servants or agents, and of the defendant Brooks, who was the motorman of the train.\nOn a previous appeal to this Court in the same case this Court ordered a new trial[2].\nThe second trial came on before Raney J., with a jury. The following were the questions submitted to the jury, with their answers:\n1. Was there negligence on the part of the defendants causing or contributing to the collision?\nA. Yes.\n2. If so, in what respect did such negligence consist? Answer fully.\nA. Speed of train was in excess of ten miles per hour.\n3. Was there negligence on the part of the driver of the Littley car contributing to the collision?\nA. Yes.\n4. If so, in what did such negligence consist? Answer fully.\nA. Excessive speed and lack of caution.\n5. At what amount do you assess the damages suffered by the plaintiff, Laura Littley, arising from the death of her husband and three children?\nA. $20,000.\n6. At what amount do you assess the damages of the plaintiff, Stanley Littley, arising from the death of his father?\nA. $2,000.\n7. How do you apportion the fault as between the defendants on the one hand and the driver of the Littley car on the other?\nA. Defendants, twenty-five per cent. Driver of car, seventy-five per cent.\nOn these findings, counsel for the plaintiffs moved for judgment for the full amount of the damages found to have been suffered by them; but the learned trial judge gave judgment to the plaintiff Laura Littley for $5,000 and to the plaintiff Stanley Littley for $500, these amounts being, in each case, 25 per cent. of the amounts at which the jury assessed the full damages of the plaintiffs.\nBoth defendants and plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Division, the defendants asking that the action be dismissed or, in the alternative, that a new trial be had; and the plaintiffs asking that judgment be entered for the full amount of the damages found to have been suffered by them. The Appellate Division set aside the judgment and ordered a new trial[3]. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, asking that the judgment entered at the trial and the judgment of the Appellate Division be set aside and that judgment be entered for the plaintiff Laura Littley for $20,000 and for the plaintiff Stanley Littley for $2,000; or, in the alternative, that a new trial be ordered as to the question of damages only. The defendants cross-appealed, contending that the action should be dismissed.\nJ.R. Robinson and J.L. Kemp for the appellants.\nW.N. Tilley, K.C., and R.E. Laidlaw for the respondents.\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014I understand the majority of the court favours a new trial in this case on the two questions stated by Mr. Justice Rinfret. Personally, I very much regret the necessity for further litigation concerning the matters in question here.\nAt the first trial there was a non-suit. To get rid of that it was necessary for the plaintiffs to come to this court. The case went back and was tried before a jury, Mr. Justice Raney presiding. The Appellate Division ordered a new trial generally, although the Chief Justice of Ontario, in pronouncing the judgment of that court, dealt severally with all the findings of the jury, expressly approving all of them, excepting for the objection, taken as the fourteenth ground of appeal. He dealt with that ground of appeal as follows:\nThe fourteenth ground of appeal:\n\u201c14. The jury did not properly understand the basis upon which the amount of damages, if any, ought to be determined between the parties.\u201d\nWith respect to the damages suffered by Laura Littley, I think the learned trial judge erred in requiring the jury to find one amount instead of separate amounts in respect of the respective deaths of her husband and her three children, and therefore the finding as to the amount of damages must be set aside and a new assessment had.\nThe learned trial judge had said to the jury about the beginning of his charge,\u2014after referring to the two claims\u2014made, the one on behalf of Laura Littley, the widow and mother, and the other on behalf of her son Stanley, who was a minor, these two being the only survivors of the family,\u2014\nThe widow of the late Walter Littley comes to Court representing herself and her son Stanley who was a boy of sixteen at the time of the accident. She claims damages for the loss of her husband and her children on her own account. The basis of her claim is the reasonable expectancy of pecuniary benefits which she had a right to anticipate if her husband and children had survived,\u2014the reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit. It is on a cash basis. She also comes and asks as representative of her son Stanley, who cannot sue in his own name, because he is in law an infant, she represents him, and she asks for damages on his behalf, which, if they are recovered will be paid into Court and will not be paid to her, subject to the Court\u2019s Order, and her claim on his behalf is based on his reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefits on the survival of his father; if his father had survived, he would have had benefits which it is suggested he has not got now. He and the mother are the sole survivors of the family.\nIn my opinion, this sufficed to put before the jury the essential fact that, in assessing damages, they must take into account all the claims as preferred by Laura Littley, i.e., her claim for the loss of her boy Leslie, then aged 19, and of her other two infant children, and also her claim for the loss of her husband. The order for a new trial against Laura Littley cannot, in my opinion, be supported on the sole ground for it assigned by the learned Chief Justice, viz., that the learned trial judge erred in requiring the jury to find one amount instead of separate amounts for damages in respect of the respective deaths of the husband and the three infant children. With the utmost respect for the Chief Justice, I find no difficulty in the case on this point. Its only possible materiality would arise from the fact that contributory negligence of the driver of the motor car found by the jury, and evidently, in their opinion, imputable to the mother, could not well be attributed to the two infant children (other than Leslie) on account of whose deaths, as well as that of her husband, she brought action.\nIn ordering a new trial as against Laura Littley on this ground even, as the learned Chief Justice appears to put it, limited to a new assessment of damages, the Appellate Division seems to me to have been clearly wrong, as it must be quite immaterial how much of the $20,000 pecuniary loss, found to have been occasioned to the widow by the accident, was attributable to the loss of her husband and how much of it to the loss of each of her three children.\nThere is more to be said in favour of the order for a new trial as against Stanley Littley, if likewise limited, since, in my opinion, the learned Chief Justice is quite right when he says:\nHaving regard to all the circumstances, I think it highly improper (improbable?) that Stanley sustained a pecuniary loss of $2,000 by his father\u2019s death. Considering the walk of life of the parties, Stanley had about reached the age when he would have been required by his father, to earn his own living. I therefore think that the amount awarded to him is excessive, and that that finding should be set aside.\nHere, the amount of damages alone is affected, and the new trial should, with respect, have been limited to that point.\nI agree that the assessment of damages at $20,000 in favour of the widow is considerably larger than I would have allowed and it is quite possible that the jury made some mistake in that respect, or took into account something which they should not have considered. With regard to contributory negligence, what the jury evidently meant was this: Taking the case in the by and large, they said to themselves: \u201cWe will allow $22,000 (apportioned, $20,000 to Laura Littley and $2,000 to Stanley Littley) as total damages, of which 75 per cent. should be borne by the plaintiffs and 25 per cent. by the company.\u201d While the sums allowed as total damages may seem unreasonable, bearing in mind that the question of the amount of damages is usually exclusively for the jury, and having regard to their treatment of the case as a whole, I would, personally, be satisfied to allow the award to stand. I defer, however, to the views of my learned brothers who think it so grossly excessive that they cannot but assume that there was some error in the minds of the jury as to the proper basis of assessment.\nOn this ground alone, therefore, I would agree to a new trial\u2014not at large, however, since the Appellate Division has expressly approved of the findings of the jury, excepting those as to the amount of damages,\u2014and that is the only matter which my colleagues find unsatisfactory in the verdict already given.\nAs indicated above, one reason why I am not entirely satisfied with its findings was the failure on the part of the jury to determine how and to whom the contributory negligence of the driver of the Littley car was to be imputed. I would, therefore, since there must be a partial new trial, agree to the submission to the new jury of a question to cover this point.\nFor these reasons, I agree in the result of the judgment which I understand is to be delivered by my brother Rinfret. The judgment of Rinfret and Smith JJ. was delivered by\nRINFRET, J.\u2014This action was brought under the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act (c. 183 of R.S.O., 1927). The plaintiffs (appellants) are Laura Littley, widow of Walter Littley, and Stanley Littley, son of the said Walter Littley, an infant suing by his next friend, Laura Littley. They seek damages for the death of Walter Littley, their respective husband and father. Laura Littley personally also claims damages for the death of her two sons, Leslie and Edward, and her daughter, Ivy.\nThe present appeal brings this case before this court for the second time. In a former appeal, wherein the parties were identical, this court ordered a new trial and, in doing so, took occasion to state the facts[4].\nThe second trial came on before Raney J., with a jury, and the following were the questions submitted to the jury, with their answers:\n1. Was there negligence on the part of the defendants causing or contributing to the collision?\nA. Yes.\n2. If so, in what respect did such negligence consist? Answer fully.\nA. Speed of train was in excess of 10 miles per hour.\n3. Was there negligence on the part of the driver of the Littley car contributing to the collision?\nA. Yes.\n4. If so, in what did such negligence consist? Answer fully.\nA. Excessive speed and lack of caution.\n5. At what amount do you assess the damages suffered by the plaintiff, Laura Littley, arising from the death of her husband and three children?\nA. $20,000.\n6. At what amount do you assess the damages of the plaintiff, Stanley Littley, arising from the death of his father?\nA. $2,000.\n7. How do you apportion the fault as between the defendants on the one hand and the driver of the Littley car on the other?\nA. Defendants, 25%. Driver of car, 75%.\nOn these findings, counsel for the appellants moved for judgment for the full amount of the damages found to have been suffered by them; but the learned trial judge gave judgment to the appellant Laura Littley for $5,000, and to Stanley Littley for $500, these amounts being, in each case, 25 per cent. of the amounts at which the jury assessed the full damages of the appellants. From this judgment, both parties appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario; and, on the 15th day of June, 1931, a new trial was again directed[5]. The appellants, thereupon, appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, praying that the order for a new trial be set aside, and again asking for the full amount of damages found by the jury. The respondents cross-appealed and gave notice of their intention to contend, on the hearing of the appeal, that the judgment of the Appellate Division ought to be varied and that the action ought to be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment appealed from was unanimous. It was delivered by the Right Honourable the Chief Justice of Ontario, who went into a discussion of all the grounds of appeal and considered each of them very carefully. He held that \u201cthere was ample evidence to support the findings of the jury,\u201d and expressed the \u201copinion that the charge of the learned (trial) judge was fair and sufficient.\u201d The new trial was ordered for the reason that the jury was required \u201cto find one amount instead of separate amounts in respect of the respective deaths of (the) husband and (the) three children, and therefore the finding as to the amount of damages must be set aside and a new assessment had.\u201d\nAs regards the award made to the appellant Stanley Littley, he thought \u201cthe amount awarded to him is excessive, and that that finding should be set aside.\u201d\nThe learned Chief Justice, on behalf of the Appellate Division, further expressed the view that, at the new trial, \u201cthe jury should be directed to find who was actually driving the car or in control of it at the time of the accident.\u201d\nWe now have before us the appeal and the cross-appeal from that judgment.\nOn the cross-appeal, subject to discussing the measure of damages, we have only to say that the questions raised were properly dealt with by the Appellate Division, and we do not think it should be entertained by this court.\nOn the main appeal, there are two questions to be considered: Whether the new trial was properly ordered for the reasons given by the Appellate Division; and, if not, whether judgment should be entered in favour of the appellants for the full amount of the damages assessed by the jury.\nWalter Littley, the husband and father of the respective appellants, was forty-two years old, and apparently in excellent health. He was operator of an electric shovel in a gravel pit. He was being paid sixty cents an hour for a ten-hour day and would average 5 days\u2019 work, or $30 a week throughout the year. The wife\u2019s evidence is that he gave her his wages.\nLeslie Littley was nineteen years of age. He was a teamster, receiving $85 every two weeks for himself and his team. He was just commencing in business and was paying for his team; but, up to that time, he had been a market gardener and had given his money to his mother.\nEdward was a boy of thirteen, still going to school, and Ivy was a girl of ten.\nThe appellant Laura Littley was thirty-eight in November, 1928, five months after the accident, and the appellant Stanley Littley was sixteen the following December. The evidence was that Laura Littley was in good health, but that Stanley had a more delicate health than the other children and had been kept away from school for some time before his father\u2019s death. They were left without resources and the mother has been going out to work by the day for a living.\nIn assessing damages under the Fatal Accidents Act, it is well settled law that the jury are confined to the pecuniary loss sustained by the family and cannot take into consideration the mental suffering of the survivors (Blake v. Midland Ry. Co.[6]). It is the reasonable expectation of pecuniary advantage by the relatives remaining alive that may be taken into consideration (Mayne, On Damages, 10th ed., page 516). The action exists solely \u201cfor the benefit of the wife, husband, parent and child of the person whose death was caused\u201d (Fatal Accidents Act, section 3). Under the Act, there is no right of action for the benefit of the brother of the victim of the accident. It follows that the appellant Stanley Littley was entitled to damages only in respect of the death of his father. As for Laura Littley, the pecuniary benefit which she might expect from the continuation of the lives of Edward, aged thirteen, and Ivy, aged ten, are almost negligible, particularly in view of the fact that until they reached the age when they would be earning their own living, they would have to be supported by their father and mother. Any pecuniary advantage which Laura Littley might expect must come substantially from her husband, and to a limited extent, from her son, Leslie. At the time of the accident, Leslie was using his money \u201cto pay for his team.\u201d If we admit that he would later be able to look after himself, it would mean that the earnings of the father would go to maintain himself, his wife and the remaining three children. Assuming no contingencies whatever, such as interruption in work, illness, etc., these earnings would represent about $120 per month wherewith to provide for the whole family. It will be seen at once that the share of that sum available each month for both the mother and Stanley would fall far below $100.\nNotwithstanding these facts, the jury assessed the damages at an amount the interest of which would be sufficient to provide an income of $100 a month for the mother alone. In addition to that, on the assumption that the Contributory Negligence Act does not apply in mitigation of the damages, she would become the owner of the capital sum necessary to produce that income, and a further sum of $2,000 was assessed in favour of the son, Stanley. For, let it be observed that this is not a verdict for $20,000 only. The $2,000 going to Stanley must, of course, be taken into account. Although the possible loss, remote as it is from the monetary standpoint, arising out of the deaths of the three children, may not be disregarded, the fact remains that, in this case, the damages which stand to be assessed are, almost entirely in the case of the wife, and exclusively in the case of Stanley Littley, damages resulting from the death of their respective husband and father. So that the verdict of $22,000 must be held to represent practically the pecuniary benefits which both appellants might have reasonably expected from the continuation of the life of Walter Littley. The jury, as was explained by the foreman at the trial, \u201cbased that amount on what (they) felt the widow should get a month on the basis of six per cent., which would give her one hundred dollars a month, which would be approximately $20,000.\u201d The explanation throws light on what was in the minds of the jury. Having regard to the material circumstances of all concerned, $100 a month to the widow alone would not, in any event, be warranted by the evidence; but the jury disregarded altogether the fact that, in addition to the income, they were giving the capital as well; and, besides that, they were awarding $2,000 to Stanley Littley.\nWe cannot escape the conclusion that the assessment of damages, both in favour of the wife and of the surviving child, was excessive and out of proportion to the total pecuniary loss occasioned by the deaths of the persons in respect of whom the damages were awarded.\nHaving regard to the evidence, we are clearly of the opinion that the assessment was unreasonably large and such as must have been occasioned by a misunderstanding of the basis upon which the amount ought to be determined. On that ground alone, therefore, there would have to be a new trial.\nWe may now deal with the question whether, in view of the finding that there was \u201cnegligence on the part of the driver of the Littley car contributing to the collision\u201d, judgment should nevertheless, as the appellants contend, be entered in their favour for the full amount of the damages assessed by the jury.\nBy the Fatal Accidents Act of Ontario, it is provided that:\n2. Where the death of a person has been caused by such wrongful act, neglect or default, as, if death had not ensued, would have entitled the person injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, the person who would have been liable, if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured, and although the death was caused under circumstances amounting in law to culpable homicide.\n3. (1) Every such action shall be for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent and child of the person whose death was so caused, and except as hereinafter provided shall be brought by and in the name of the executor or administrator of the deceased, and in every such action such damages may be awarded as are proportioned to the injury resulting from such death to the persons respectively for whom and for whose benefit such action is brought; and the amount so recovered, after deducting the costs not recovered from the defendant, shall be divided amongst the before-mentioned persons in such shares as may be determined at the trial. The Contributory Negligence Act (c. 103 of R.S.O., 1927) provides as follows:\n2. In any action or counterclaim for damages, which is founded upon fault or negligence, if a plea of contributory fault or negligence shall be found to have been established, the jury, or the judge in an action tried without a jury, shall find:\u2014\nFirst: The entire amount of damages to which the plaintiff would have been entitled had there been no such contributory fault or neglect;\nSecondly: The degree in which each party was in fault and the manner in which the amount of damages found should be apportioned so that the plaintiff shall have judgment only for so much thereof as is proportionate to the degree of fault imputable to the defendant.\n3. Where the judge or jury finds that it is not, upon the evidence, practicable to determine the respective degrees of fault the defendant shall be liable for one-half the damages sustained.\nThe appellants submit that by section 2 of the Fatal Accidents Act a right of action in the deceased, had he survived, is made a condition precedent to a right of action accruing to certain of his dependents under the provisions of the Act. They further submit that, if such condition precedent be fulfilled, the survivors of the class named in section 3 of the same Act have a statutory right of action untainted and unaffected by anything which the deceased may have done or agreed to, so long as he, by such conduct or agreement, had not completely barred his own right of action, had he survived. Therefore, while, before the Contributory Negligence Act, contributory negligence was a good defence to an action under the Fatal Accidents Act, this was the case because contributory negligence would have deprived the deceased of his right of action had he survived. By the Contributory Negligence Act, his right of action is no longer barred, but his right to recover is limited proportionately to the percentage of negligence attributed to the defendant. It is therefore submitted that the condition precedent to a successful action under the Fatal Accidents Act is satisfied and the persons entitled to sue under that Act are given a new statutory right of action, which is unaffected by the conduct of the deceased.\nIn a recent case, Price v. B.C. Motor Transportation Ltd.[7], the Chief Justice of this Court had occasion to examine a similar question under the British Columbia statutes. Those statutes, although not identical in terms, are substantially the same as the Ontario Acts. The Chief Justice said[8]: The presence of the condition of the right of action, i.e., that it must be \u201csuch as would (if death had not ensued) have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof,\u201d has been held to require that the deceased would have had an enforceable cause or right of action for the injury had he survived. To this cause of action, contributory negligence on his part would, of course, have been a defence. That being so, he could not have successfully maintained an action where contributory negligence was established, had he survived, and his personal representative or widow, etc., could, accordingly, maintain no action for damages caused by his death.\nThe ground now taken by the plaintiff is that the defence of contributory negligence being done away with by the statute of 1925 leaves the right of action under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act absolute and unqualified. In other words, the other provisions of the Contributory Negligence Act would have no application to a case under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act.\nI find nothing in the Contributory Negligence Act to exclude its application as a whole to cases under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, which are so common. On the contrary, everything in the former statute indicates that such cases must have been present to the mind of the Legislature which enacted it.\nContributory negligence is a defence which the statute does away with, but only conditionally, the condition being that, \u201cwhere by the fault of two or more persons damage or loss is caused to one or more of them, the liability to make good the damage or loss shall be in proportion to the degree in which each person was at fault.\u201d I cannot conceive that the Legislature intended that this Act should apply for the purpose of enabling the plaintiff to maintain an action under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, notwithstanding the establishment of contributory negligence imputable to her, and yet should not also apply for the purpose of providing for the apportionment of her damages under section 2.\nThat this case comes within section 2 is perfectly clear, the term or condition of its application thereby provided being that, where contributory negligence is shown, there shall be an apportionment of damages in proportion to the degree in which each person was at fault. Any person taking advantage of the Contributory Negligence Act must do so on the terms and conditions laid down by the Legislature.\u201d\nIn the British Columbia case7, the view taken by the other members of the court made it unnecessary for them to pass upon that point. In the present case, the point has to be decided and the opinion thus enunciated by the Chief Justice may now be stated as being the opinion of the court on the question raised by the appellants.\nAt the outset, it should be said that the whole case proceeded on the basis that the Contributory Negligence Act applied. Should we now come to the conclusion that it does not, the consequence would be that the verdict is the result of misdirection throughout and a new trial is inevitable, in any event. But, as there is to be a new trial any- how, we think we should, under the circumstances, give a direction to the judge who shall preside at the trial.\nAt common law, contributory negligence of the plaintiff is a complete defence to an action \u201cfounded upon fault or negligence\u201d. The result was that in any such case, \u201cif a plea of contributory fault or negligence (was) found to have been established\u201d, the victim of the accident could not successfully maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof. As a consequence, under the Fatal Accidents Act, and under similar circumstances, if the death of the victim ensued, neither could an action be successfully maintained \u201cfor the benefit of the wife, husband, parent and child of the person whose death was so caused\u201d. Contributory negligence of the deceased or imputable to him continued under the Act to be a complete defence against the action of the named relatives. The action could not be maintained, not on account of the contributory fault or negligence of the relatives who brought it, but on account of the contributory fault or negligence of the victim of the accident.\nThe Contributory Negligence Act, of Ontario, has not created a new right of action and it has not taken away the defence of contributory negligence. It has only modified the effect of that defence. Where contributory negligence used to be an absolute answer to the action, the Act says that henceforth it shall not be so and it shall only mitigate the liability of the negligent party owing to the contributory fault of the victim. (Compare The Napierville Junction Railway Company v. Dubois [9]). What the jury is to find is \u201cthe degree in which each party was in fault\u201d. \u201cParty\u201d here means \u201cparty to the accident\u201d. Under the Act, the primary concern is to establish the degree of liability of each party to the accident. The apportionment of the amount of damages follows only as a matter of consequence. When, therefore, we have a verdict such as we have here, and the jury finds that the fault of each party contributing to the accident should be apportioned in the ratio of twenty-five per cent. for the defendants and seventy-five per cent. for the other party, the meaning of the Act and the intention of the legislature is that, the defendants having been found guilty of fault or negligence contributing to the accident only in the proportion of twenty-five per cent., their liability for the consequences of that accident is limited to twenty-five per cent., and they are answerable only to that extent towards the person claiming damages resulting from the accident. In such a case, says the Act, \u201cthe plaintiff shall have judgment only for so much thereof as is proportionate to the degree of fault imputable to the defendant\u201d. The injurious participation by the defendants in the wrongful acts which caused the accident having been in the proportion found by the jury, they are to contribute towards the compensation for the damages in that proportion. They are to pay only that proportion of the damages which they have caused,\u2014and they are not responsible for more. The Act applies to \u201cany action or counterclaim\u201d (section 2) and, by definition (section 1), the plaintiff in any such action or the defendant in any counter-claim \u201cshall have judgment only for so much (of the entire amount of damages) as is proportionate to the degree of fault imputable to the defendant\u201d.\nThe cases cited by the appellants are not in point. In Mills v. Armstrong, commonly known as the Bernina case[10], three claims were made by the representatives of three of the victims for whose death action was brought. The accident consisted in a collision between two ships. Two of the victims were held to have had nothing to do with the negligent navigation, while the other (Owen) was found to have been connected with the wrongful acts contributing to the collision. Before the Court of Appeal, the claim on behalf of the latter\u2019s representative was given up. The two other claims were maintained in full, on the ground that, in each case, the victims for whose deaths the actions were brought were not parties to the negligence and could in no way be connected therewith, and therefore the Admiralty rule as to half damages did not apply. In the House of Lords, the question upon that rule was mentioned, but not argued. Lord Herschell expressed thus the ground of the decision:\nThey (the defendants) do not allege that those whom the respondents represent were personally guilty of negligence which contributed to the accident; nor * * * that there was contributory negligence on the part of any third person standing in such a legal relation towards the deceased men as to cause the acts of that third person, on principles well settled in our law, to be regarded as their acts.\nIn the case of British Electric Railway Company v. Gentile[11], the question was one of prescription and turned upon the construction of the Special Act of the electric railway company. It was decided that the particular enactment (whereby certain actions against the company had to be brought within six months of the event giving rise thereto) did not cover an action under the Families Compensation Act in British Columbia.\nIn Union Steamship Company of New Zealand v. Robin[12], the particular statutes therein involved and which had to be construed were quite different. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (1908) of New Zealand, sec. 62, gave to a servant who was injured by the negligence of a fellow-servant a right of action against his employer, it being provided by subs. 3 that\nno servant shall be entitled to recover from his employer in an action brought under this Act in respect of the negligence of a fellow-servant a larger sum by way of damages for any one cause of action than five hundred pounds.\nAs will have been noticed, the limitation as to damages expressly applied to \u201can action brought under this Act\u201d by the servant himself and there was \u201cnothing to restrict the right\u201d (covered by sec. 5 of the Deaths by Accident Compensation Act (1908) of New Zealand) \u201cenabling the jury to give damages as they think proportioned to the injury resulting from the death.\u201d\nUnder the Ontario Contributory Negligence Act, the limitation as to damages is only consequential. The true purport of the Act is a limitation as to responsibility. The limitation applies \u201cin any action or counterclaim for damages which is founded upon fault or negligence\u201d and not, as in the New Zealand case, to \u201can action brought under this Act.\u201d\nMoreover, the right of the jury to award damages is expressly limited to an amount \u201cproportionate to the degree of fault imputable to the defendant.\u201d\nIn fact, the New Zealand statute appeared to be clear enough, and the discussion in the case centred not on the construction to be put upon the statute, but upon the effect of an amendment made in 1911. The Act of 1908 contained the following provision:\nNothing in this subsection shall affect the measure of damages in an action brought against an employer in respect of the death of a servant.\nIn the amending statute, that provision was not repeated. The argument was that the removal of the provision must be assumed to have had some definite purpose; and it must follow that the limitation it was designed to avoid no longer applied[13]. The decision was that\nThe mere omission in a later statute of a negative provision contained in an earlier one cannot by itself have the result of effecting a substantive affirmation. It is necessary to see how the law would have stood without the original proviso, and the terms in which the repealed sections are subsequently re-enacted.\nThe decision in that case cannot affect the present case.\nWe hold, therefore, that the provisions of the Contributory Negligence Act (c. 103 of R.S.O., 1927) are applicable to an action brought under the Fatal Accidents Act (c. 183 of R.S.O., 1927).\nIt may not be without interest to point out that such is also the solution invariably given to similar cases in the province of Quebec, where the rule has always formed part of the law of the province.\nThis, however, does not end the matter. In order to affect the amount of damages recoverable by the appellants, it must be shown, in the words of Lord Herschell,\nthat those whom (they) represent were personally guilty of negligence which contributed to the accident, (or) that there was contributory negligence on the part of any third person standing in such a legal relation towards the deceased * * * as to cause the acts of that third person * * * to be regarded as their acts.\nIt follows that, in this case, the jury ought to have been asked who was actually driving the car and, further, whether any of the other occupants of the car stood in such a relation to the driver (the actual wrongdoer) as to imply his responsibility for the contributory fault or neglect of the driver. The appellants urge that the onus was upon the respondents, in order to establish their plea of contributory negligence. But there was evidence from which the facts might at least be inferred and the point is that the jury made no finding upon those facts. We know that the car belonged to the son, Leslie Littley. If he was not the actual driver, he may be responsible as owner. We know that the trip was on the father\u2019s mission. We know also that the owner of the car, Leslie, was not of age, and even if the father was not driving, he might yet be found to have been in control or to have been in a position to give orders or to interfere with the conduct of the driver. At the new trial, further evidence may be called. Mrs. Littley saw the car start and presumably could say who was driving it at that time. Other evidence may be adduced of a similar character.\nAnother consequence of the application of the Contributory Negligence Act is that it is necessary to have a separate finding of the damages suffered through the death of each of the four victims of the accident, for it might well be that all may not be held responsible for the driver\u2019s contributory negligence.\nFor all these reasons, we agree with the Appellate Division that there must be a new trial, but we think the order ought to be varied so as to limit it to the issues wherein the present trial is found to have been defective. The case having already been tried twice, the issue of negligence on both sides and the degree of fault imputable to the defendant respondents ought now to be taken as concluded.\nLeaving those findings to stand, the new trial should be ordered only as to the following questions and matters:\n1. The entire amount of damages suffered by each plaintiff.\n2. To whom and how should responsibility for the contributory negligence found by the jury be imputed?\nThe order as to costs in the Appellate Division should not be disturbed. In this Court, in view of the divided success, there should be no costs.\nLAMONT J. (dissenting).\u2014The first question we have to determine in this appeal is: Can the plaintiff, who is the widow of the deceased, maintain an action under the Fatal Accidents Act where the deceased has been found guilty of negligence contributing to his death? For the plaintiff it is contended that she can by reason of the provisions of the Contributory Negligence Act, R.S.O., 1927, ch. 103. That Act is as follows:\u2014 1. In this Act \u201cplaintiff\u201d shall include a defendant counter-claiming, and \u201cdefendant\u201d shall include a plaintiff against whom a counter-claim is brought.\n2. In any action or counterclaim for damages, which is founded upon fault or negligence, if a plea of contributory fault or negligence shall be found to have been established, the jury, or the judge in an action tried without a jury, shall find:\u2014\nFirst: The entire amount of damages to which the plaintiff would have been entitled had there been no such contributory fault or neglect;\nSecondly: The degree in which each party was in fault and the manner in which the amount of damages found should be apportioned so that the plaintiff shall have judgment only for so much thereof as is proportionate to the degree of fault imputable to the defendant.\n3. Where the judge or jury finds that it is not, upon the evidence, practicable to determine the respective degrees of fault the defendant shall be liable for one-half the damages sustained.\nSection 2 shews that the application of this Act is limited to an action or counter-claim for damages which is founded upon fault or negligence. By that language, the Legislature, in my opinion, meant that the Act applies only where the claim is for damages for loss or injury occasioned by the fault or negligence of the other party to the action or counter-claim. It applies where the purpose of the action is to determine as between the parties thereto the amount of damage which should be attributed to their respective faults. The section directs the judge or jury to find the degree in which \u201ceach party was in fault\u201d. \u201cEach party\u201d here must mean each party to the action, for they are the only persons who could be before the court. The total damage suffered by the plaintiff is to be so apportioned that he will receive from the defendant only that portion of his loss which is proportionate to the degree of fault imputable to the defendant. If the defendant has also suffered loss and counter-claims for damages for the loss he has suffered, his claim is dealt with in exactly the same way and he is entitled to damage against the plaintiff in proportion to the degree of fault imputable to the plaintiff. The Act, therefore, applies only to cases where the damages sought to be recovered in the action resulted partly from the fault of the defendant and partly from the plaintiff\u2019s own fault.\nTurning now to the Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O., 1927, ch. 183, we find that sections 2 and 3 (1) thereof read as follows:\n2. Where the death of a person has been caused by such wrongful act, neglect or default, as, if death had not ensued, would have entitled the person injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, the person who would have been liable, if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured, and although the death was caused under circumstances amounting in law to culpable homicide.\n3. (1) Every such action shall be for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent and child of the person whose death was so caused, and except as hereinafter provided shall be brought by and in the name of the executor. or administrator of the deceased, and in every such action such damages may be awarded as are proportioned to the injury resulting from such death to the persons respectively for whom and for whose benefit such action is brought; and the amount so recovered, after deducting the costs not recovered from the defendant, shall be divided amongst the before-mentioned persons in such shares as may be determined at the trial.\nThis Act, with certain immaterial exceptions, is identical with the English Act, known as Lord Campbell\u2019s Act. Apart, therefore, from the Contributory Negligence Act, which does not exist in England, the English decisions as to the meaning and effect of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act are applicable to the case before us.\nAt common law no civil action could be maintained for an injury to a human being which resulted in death. It was not until a right of action was given by statute that a wrongful act causing death subjected the wrongdoer to liability for loss occasioned by the death, and then only to such persons and on such conditions as the statute prescribed. Section 2, above quoted, prescribes two conditions precedent which must be fulfilled before an action can be maintained:\n(1) The death must be caused by a wrongful act, negligence or default, of the defendant, and\n(2) The act, negligence or default must be of such a kind that if death had not ensued the person injured would have been entitled to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof. That both these conditions must be fulfilled before the right of action exists is established by the judgment of the Privy Council in British Electric Ry. Co. v. Gentile[14], where, at page 1041, their Lordships say:\u2014\nAlthough the action under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act or the Families Compensation Act (British Columbia) is not an action of indemnity for negligence, yet nevertheless it is an action which can only exist if certain conditions precedent are fulfilled. The first is that the death shall have been caused by wrongful act, neglect, or default of the defendants. That has in this case been affirmed by the verdict of the jury. The second is that the default is such \u201cas would if death had not ensued have entitled the party injured to maintain\u2019 an action and recover damages in respect thereof.\u201d\nUnless, therefore, these two conditions precedent were found to exist in the present case, or their requirement annulled, the plaintiff has no right of action.\nWas the death of the deceased occasioned by the wrongful act, negligence or default of the defendants? The jury have found that it was not. They have found that the death was occasioned by the joint negligence of the defendants and the deceased, of which only 25 per cent. could be imputed to the defendants. The first condition precedent, therefore, is not fulfilled.\nIt is, however, argued that the fulfilment of this condition is rendered unnecessary by the Contributory Negligence Act, and that, since the passing of that Act, it is no longer necessary to prove that the death of the deceased was occasioned by the wrongful act or negligence of the defendant, but that a cause of action is established if it is shewn that the wrongful act contributed, whether much or little, to the death of the deceased.\nLet us consider this contention: Prior to the passing of the Contributory Negligence Act, contributory negligence on the part of a deceased person was a complete defence to an action under the Fatal Accidents Act. It was an answer to the first condition because, where the death was due to the fault of the deceased and the defendant jointly, it could not be said to have been caused by the defendant. It was also an answer to the second condition because, being guilty of negligence himself, the deceased, if he had remained alive, could not, at law, have maintained an action for damages against the defendant. Since the passing of the Act the person killed, had he survived, could have maintained an action against the defendant for injuries caused by the defendant\u2019s fault even although himself guilty of contributory negligence. The Act does give the right of action required by the second condition precedent of the Fatal Accidents Act, but I fail to see that it in any way affects the first. The language setting forth the first requirement of section 2 is clear and explicit, and I can find nothing in the Contributory Negligence Act which, by express language or necessary implication, indicates in any way an intention on the part of the Legislature to modify or alter the first condition required by the section. Let us test the application of the Act in another way: Let us assume that the above conclusion is wrong and that the Contributory Negligence Act is an answer to both conditions required by section 2. What is the result? The right of action given to the statutory beneficiaries by the Fatal Accidents Act is an entirely different right from that which the deceased, if living, would have had. As early as 1852, Coleridge J., in giving the judgment of the court in Blake v. Midland Ry. Co.[15], said:\u2014\nBut it will be evident that this Act does not transfer this right of action (of the deceased) to his representative, but gives to the representative a totally new right of action, on different principles.\nAnd in Seward v. \u201cVera Cruz\u201d (Owners of)[16], Lord Blackburn said:\u2014\nI think that when that Act (Lord Campbell\u2019s Act) is looked at it is plain enough that if a person dies under the circumstances mentioned, when he might have maintained an action if it had been for an injury to himself which he had survived, a totally new action is given against the person who would have been responsible to the deceased if the deceased had lived; an action which, as is pointed out in Pym v. Great Northern Ry. Co.[17], is new in its species, new in its quality, new in its principle, in every way new.\nNot only does the Act give the deceased\u2019s dependants a new cause of action but the measure of their damages is based on a principle entirely different from that which would apply if the deceased were living and suing. The damages which may be recovered under the Act are such \u201cas are proportioned to the injury resulting from such death to the persons respectively for whom and for whose benefit such action is brought\u201d. The basis of the claim is compensation for the loss of the actual pecuniary benefit which the beneficiaries might reasonably have expected to enjoy had the deceased not been killed. This loss would be exactly the same whether the defendants\u2019 wrongful act or negligence was the sole cause of the death or whether it contributed thereto only to a very small extent. It was, however, argued that the contributory negligence of the deceased must be imputed to the plaintiff and the measure of her damages determined by the degree of fault imputable to the defendants. In my opinion, it is impossible to give effect to this argument in view of the express provision of the statute that the damages are to be such as are proportioned to the injury resulting to each dependant from such death. To do so would be to amend the statute, which is the function of the legislature and not of the court. That any limitation affecting the measure of damages which the deceased, if living, could recover does not apply to the plaintiff is, I think, established by the authorities.\nIn Union Steamship Company of New Zealand v. Robin[18], the death of the deceased was caused by the negligent act of a fellow servant and an action for damages was brought against the employer, the steamship company, under the Deaths by Accident Compensation Act, 1908, of New Zealand, which was, in all material particulars, identical with Lord Campbell\u2019s Act. The contention of the company was that prior to the enactment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 1908, a servant had no right of action for damages against his employer where his injuries were caused by the negligence of a fellow servant, as the doctrine of common employment was an absolute defence; that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act took away from an employer this defence and gave a right of action to a servant injured by the negligence of a fellow servant, but it provided that the damages recoverable, in an action under the Act, should not exceed 500 pounds, and that, as the plaintiff must depend on the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act for her right of action, the limitation imposed by that Act was binding on her. The Privy Council, however, held that the measure of damages was not limited to 500 pounds, as the cause of action and the measure of damages were different from those which the deceased person would have had if he had survived. In his judgment Lord Buckmaster, at page 660, said:\nThe argument in support of the appellants\u2019 case is best put in the assertion that as, without an express statutory relief from the doctrine of common employment, no suit could be maintained, and such relief being conferred by a section which limits the remedy, the whole of these conditions must be imported into every action to which the doctrine of common employment would have afforded a defence. Their Lordships cannot accept this view. The only operation of the doctrine of common employment in a suit by the dependants of a dead man would be that the conditions precedent were not satisfied. The dead man could not have brought an action in respect of damage or injury. This he can now do. But although in the action that he might have brought there would have been a limitation as to damage, there is nothing to restrict the right expressly conferred by s. 5 of the Deaths by Accident Compensation Act enabling the jury to give damages as they think proportioned to the injury resulting from the death.\nand at page 661, he said:\nThe damages which the dependants are entitled to recover are such damages as the jury think proportional to the injury, and on this right no statutory limitations have been imposed.\nThe same principle is enunciated in the later case of Nunan v. Southern Ry. Co.[19] There the deceased, a passenger by railway, had agreed with the railway company that its liability for personal injuries should not exceed 100 pounds. He was killed by the negligence of the company\u2019s servants. In an action under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, by his dependants, it was held that the damages recoverable were not limited to such sum. In his judgment Scrutten L.J., at page 228, said:\nThen it is argued that if that is so his dependants must equally be bound if he has made an agreement which, while leaving him a cause of action, limits the amount which he can recover. I agree that it looks odd that he should be able to bar his dependants entirely, and yet should not be able to bar them in part, but one must be guided by the words of the statute.\nand further on he says:\nUnder these circumstances we must follow the language of the statute, and that language compels us to say that as the dead man could at the time of his death have brought an action for some damages his dependants can bring an action for their own and quite different damages.\nand Atkin, L.J., at page 230, said:\nThe deceased person could, if he were alive, only bring an action to recover compensation for his personal injuries, which ex hypothesi fall short of the consequences of his death; and it may well be that the sum of 100 pounds might more than cover the damages to which he would be entitled. On the other hand, the dependants bring their action substantially for the loss of the breadwinner of the family; and that is a very different matter.\nAnother illuminative case is that of McColl v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[20], where, at page 133, my brother Duff, in giving the judgment of the Privy Council, summed up what Lord Dunedin had said in the Gentile case[21], as follows:\nIn other words, an action under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act is not an action for \u201cdamage sustained by the plaintiff by reason of the wrongful act which caused the death in respect of which the claim is made.\u201d\nIf the plaintiff\u2019s claim is not for damages for loss sustained by the defendant\u2019s wrongful act, I fail to see how the degree of fault attributable to the defendant can be made the yardstick by which to measure her damages.\nIn view of the above authorities the result, in my opinion, is that, on the assumption that the Contributory Negligence Act enables the plaintiff to maintain the action, the measure of damages which she is entitled to recover for herself and her infant son is not in any way limited by the fact that the damages which her deceased husband if living could have recovered would be only such as were proportioned to the degree of negligence imputable to the defendants. The measure of her damage is that fixed by the statute and, in my opinion, that measure has not been in any way limited or altered by the Contributory Negligence Act. If the damages recoverable by the beneficiaries under the statute are the same both when the fault of the defendant is the sole cause of the death and when it merely contributes thereto in a small degree, we have to ask ourselves this question: Can the Legislature have intended to impose upon the defendant liability for the whole loss occasioned by the death, irrespective of the degree of fault imputable to him? I cannot conceive of the Legislature doing so, as the imposition of such a liability would be unfair and unjust. The fact, however, that the imposition would be unfair does not, in my opinion, justify the inference of a legislative intention to alter the measure of damages awarded to the dependants by the statute, but rather that the Legislature had no intention of making the provisions of the Contributory Negligence Act apply to the Fatal Accidents Act, beyond this, that the right of action given by the former Act to a plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence was sufficient in an action brought by his dependants, in a case where he was killed, to satisfy the second condition precedent required by the latter Act. In order that the plaintiff should succeed in this action with only such damages as would be proportioned to the defendants\u2019 fault we must, in my opinion, hold that the Contributory Negligence Act, by inference, has amended the Fatal Accidents Act in two very important particulars, namely, (1) so as to give a right of action to the dependants where the death is caused or contributed to by the wrongful act, neglect or default of the defendant, and (2) so as to restrict the dependants\u2019 measure of damages to an amount proportioned to the degree of fault attributable to the defendant. The first would give a right of action where none existed before, and the second would deprive the dependants of full compensation for the loss they had sustained by the death. But the statutory provisions which would be thus amended are of the very essence of the Fatal Accidents Act. The amendments would alter not only the purpose of the Act but also the extent of its application, and that without the slightest reference thereto in the Contributory Negligence Act. Amendments so important and far reaching in their operation, cannot, in my opinion, be implied simply from a statutory provision giving a right of action to a person injured, where he himself has been guilty of contributory negligence. In In re Cuno; Mansfield v. Mansfield[22], Bowen L.J. said:\u2014\nIn the construction of statutes, you must not construe the words so as to take away rights which already existed before the statute was passed, unless you have plain words which indicate that such was the intention of the legislature.\nand in Craies on Statute Law (3rd ed.), the same principle is enunciated. At page 105 the author says:\u2014\nExpress and unambiguous language appears to be absolutely indispensable in statutes passed for the following purposes:\u2014 * * * (2) Conferring or taking away legal rights, whether public or private; * * *\nand at page 109 he uses this language:\u2014\nTherefore rights, whether public or private, are not to be taken away, or even hampered, by mere implication from the language used in a statute, unless, as Fry J., said in Mayor, etc., of Yarmouth v. Simmons[23] \u201cthe Legislature clearly and distinctly authorize the doing of something which is physically inconsistent with the continuance of an existing right.\nIn enacting the Contributory Negligence Act the Legislature gave a right of action to a plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence, but gave it in express and unambiguous language. It does not expressly give any other right; nor does it take away any right except the right of a defendant to set up the contributory negligence of the plaintiff as a defence which results from the right given. I can see nothing in the exercise of the right given which is inconsistent with the continuance of the right of the dependants of a deceased person, killed by the fault of another, to recover the damages awarded to them by the Fatal Accidents Act. Nor can I see how the granting of that right can, by any implication, take away the immunity from liability which the defendant theretofore enjoyed unless his wrong- ful act or negligence caused (not simply contributed to) the death of the deceased. Full effect can be given to the language of the Contributory Negligence Act without interfering with the rights or immunities enjoyed under the Fatal Accidents Act beyond what is necessary to give effect to the cause of action expressly given by the former Act. Had the Legislature intended to amend the latter Act in these respects, it would, I feel sure, have done so in express language. For this court to amend it would, in my opinion, be legislation and not interpretation.\nIf the Legislature thinks the cause of action given to the dependants by the Fatal Accidents Act should be available to them but with reduced damages where the death has been caused by the joint negligence of the defendant and the deceased, it has only to say so. It not having said so, the plaintiff in this case, in my opinion, has been unable to establish the conditions upon which her right to sue depends. Her action should, therefore, be dismissed.\nOrder of the Appellate Division varied, and the new trial to be limited to certain questions and matters.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Robinson & Haines.\nSolicitor for the respondents: R.E.

Mack\nCollection\nSupreme Court Judgments\nDate\n1932-03-01\nReport\n[1932] SCR 488\nJudges\nDuff, Lyman Poore; Rinfret, Thibaudeau; Newcombe, Edmund Leslie; Lamont, John Henderson; Smith, Robert\nOn appeal from\nBritish Columbia\nSubjects\nFinancial institutions\nDecision Content\nSupreme Court of Canada\nRoyal Bank of Canada v. Mack, [1932] S.C.R. 488\nDate: 1932-03-01\nThe Royal Bank of Canada (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nWilliam Mack (Plaintiff) Respondent\n1931: October 14, 15. 1932: March 1\nPresent at hearing of the appeal: Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ. Newcombe J. took no part in the judgment, as he died before the delivery thereof.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nBanks and banking\u2014Moneys handed by bank's customer to branch bank manager for investment at latter's discretion, and used by latter for his own purposes\u2014Liability of bank\u2014Authority of the branch manager\u2014Scope of his employment\u2014Scope of business of a bank\u2014Bank Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 12, s. 75 (1) (c) (d).\nR., a branch manager of defendant bank, suggested to plaintiff that some part of plaintiff's moneys on deposit with the bank should be invested, stating that an investment could be found which would return interest at 8%. For the purpose of such an investment, plaintiff handed to R. two cheques, one payable to cash or bearer, and the other payable to self or bearer and endorsed by plaintiff. R. used the money for his own purposes. Plaintiff sought to recover the amount from the bank. This Court found on the evidence: that plaintiff believed, and R. intended him to believe, that R., in making the proposal, was acting as agent of the bank; that plaintiff believed he was placing his money at the disposal of the bank, and R. was fully aware of this; that unrestricted discretion was committed by plaintiff to R. as to the nature of the investment.\nHeld: The bank was not liable. In this transaction R. was not doing something of a kind that, as agent of the bank, he was authorized to do, in the sense that such a transaction would fall within the general scope of his employment. It could not be said that an undertaking of the duty to invest a customer's money for him at the bank's discretion falls within the scope of the business of a bank, according to the intendment of the Bank Act. There was no evidence justifying or even pointing to the conclusion that the business of an investment agent or trustee is one which \" appertains to the business of banking\" (s. 75[1] (d) ); nor did the transaction in question fall under any class of transactions comprehended within the dealings authorized by s. 75[2] (c) of the Act.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, 44 B.C.R. 81, reversed.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[3], dismissing (Macdonald C.J.B.C., and McPhillips J.A., dissenting) its appeal from the judgment of W. A. Macdonald J.[4], holding that the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the defendant the sum of $2,500, as claimed.\nThe material facts of the case (as found by this Court) are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported, and are indicated in the above head-note. The appeal was allowed and the plaintiff's action dismissed, with costs throughout.\nA. J. Mann K.C. for the appellant.\nT. G. Norris for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014The agent of the appellant bank at Kelowna, one H. F. Rees, obtained from the respondent, who was a customer of the bank, the sum of $2,500, which he used for his own purposes; and, in the action upon which this appeal arises, the respondent seeks to recover that sum from the bank. There is no real controversy as to the facts. Rees suggested to the respondent that some part of a sum of $3,000, which the respondent had on deposit with the bank, should be invested.The respondent was told that an investment could be found which would return interest at eight per cent. There is no dispute that the respondent believed, nor do I in the least doubt that Rees intended him to believe, that in making this proposal, he (Rees) was acting as the agent of the bank. It is equally clear that in handing over the sum of $2,500, for which he gave two cheques (one payable to cash or bearer, and the other payable to self or bearer and endorsed by him), the. respondent believed he was placing his money at the disposal of the bank, and that Rees was fully aware of this. I should have had no difficulty in holding the bank liable if there were grounds upon which it could be affirmed that, in this transaction, Rees was doing something of a kind that, as agent of the bank, he was authorized to do, in the sense that such a transaction would fall within the general scope of his employment.\nI am constrained to the conclusion that the agent had no such authority, and for this reason. As I understand the evidence of the respondent, he was entrusting his money to Rees to invest it for him, at Rees' discretion, in some security of some description which would yield interest at eight per cent. It is plain, I think, that unrestricted discretion was committed to Rees as to the nature of the investment. I find myself in disagreement with the view expressed by one of the judges in the court below, that there was an implied representation by Rees that the subject matter of the undertaking was something within the bank's powers under the Bank Act. I have no doubt whatever that the respondent never thought of the Bank Act or of the powers of the bank. Fairly interpreting the language and conduct of the parties, as disclosed in the evidence, the discretion committed to Rees cannot be held to be limited in such a way as to bring the transaction within the scope of the Bank Act, unless an undertaking of the duty to invest for a customer, the customer's money, at the discretion of the bank, is something which falls within the scope of the business of a bank, according to the intendment of the provisions of the Act. There, is no evidence before us justifying, or, indeed, pointing to the conclusion that the business of an investment agent or trustee is one which \" appertains to the business of banking \"; nor, in my opinion, does the transaction with which we are concerned fall under any class of transactions that is comprehended within the dealings authorized by sec. 75 (1) (c).\nThe appeal must, in my opinion, be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Walsh, Bull, Housser, Tupper & Molson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: T.

Donald Davidson (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1932: February 25; 1932: March 24.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nFire insurance\u2014Insurance Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 222\u2014Property becoming vacant\u2014Destroyed by fire within 30 days from commencement of vacancy\u2014Liability on policy\u2014Statutory condition 5 (d)\u2014\u201cChange material to the risk\u201d (statutory condition 7)\u2014Representation as to occupancy in application for insurance.\nDuring the term of a fire insurance policy on farm buildings, the insured, with his family, moved from the farm and took up residence in a new home, intending to reside there permanently and to rent or sell the farm, which remained vacant. He gave no notice to the insurer of the vacancy. Within 30 days from the time the insured property became vacant, it was destroyed by fire.\nHeld: The insurer was liable on the policy. (Judgment of the Appellate Division, Ont., [1931] 4 D.L.R. 720, affirmed.)\nIn view of statutory condition 5 (d) (Ontario Insurance Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 222) in the policy, vacancy for a period of 30 days was a risk contemplated by the policy and assumed by the insurer, and it was not open to the insurer to shew that the mere fact of vacancy or non\u2011occupancy for less than 30 days was a \u201cchange material to the risk\u201d within statutory condition 7.\nThe insured\u2019s answer \u201cyes\u201d to the question in his application for insurance, \u201cIs the house occupied all the year round,\u201d was not a misrep- resentation, or a representation on which the insurer could deny liability; it was a representation as to an existing fact and was then true.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] which, on an equally divided court, dismissed the defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment of Wright J.[2], holding that the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the defendant the loss which he had sustained by fire on property covered by a certain fire insurance policy issued by the defendant.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nNathan Phillips K.C. and H. Weinfield K.C. for the appellant.\nN.L. Matthews and J.P. Ebbs for the respondent.\nDUFF J.\u2014I agree with my brother Cannon.\nI think the construction proposed by the insurance company would, if acted upon, operate as a fraud upon the insured. The provision of Condition 5 (d) is a very specific one. It relates to buildings, to property contained in buildings and to manufacturing establishments, and goes into effect on vacancy or lack of occupation or discontinuance of operation for the period named in the Condition. Where a particular matter such as vacancy or lack of occupation or cessation of industrial operation is dealt with in a contract and in a specific way in a particular clause, then the parties naturally look to that clause as containing the controlling provision in relation to the subject dealt with. I think Condition 5 (d) is a declaration indicating that the parties contemplate vacancy and lack of operation during the periods mentioned as normal conditions of the risk insured against, and any change which consists merely in such vacancy or lack of occupation or cessation of operation is not a change material to the risk within the contemplation of the contract and is, therefore, not within Condition 7. I think that is all I have to say upon the appeal. To my mind the point is very clear and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nCANNON J.\u2014This appeal is asserted from a judgment of the Second Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[3], which, by an equal division of opinion, dismissed an appeal of the defendant and confirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ontario (Wright J.[4]), rendered on the 15th April, 1931, in favour of respondent for a fire loss covered by insurance and ordering a reference to the Master to determine the amount payable.\nThe policy of insurance issued by the appellant to the respondent insured, to the extent of $5,000, the respondent\u2019s farm dwelling, barns and contents, for three years from the 24th August, 1928.\nOn the 20th February, 1930, the respondent, with his family, moved away from the farm and took up residence in a new home that he had built in Newmarket, with the intention of permanently residing there and of renting or selling the farm, which remained vacant after his departure.\nThe property insured was destroyed by fire on the 21st day of March, 1930, being within thirty days from the time the property became vacant. No notice was given by the respondent to the defendant company that the property had become vacant.\nThe appellant disclaims liability, first upon the ground that there was misrepresentation of fact in the application signed by the respondent where he answered \u201cYes\u201d to the question, \u201cIs the house occupied all the year round?\u201d\nThe answer referred to in the application was a representation as to an existing fact and was then true, and therefore the first ground fails.\nThe second question involved in this appeal is whether, in view of statutory clause 5 (d) of the Ontario Insurance Act (R.S.O., 1927, c. 222), introduced in 1924, it was still open to the defendant to show that a vacancy or non- occupancy for less than thirty days is a change material to the risk within the meaning of statutory condition no. 7.\nThere was, prior to 1924, no specific statutory condition in Ontario, in relation to the non\u2011liability of the insurer, in the case of a vacancy or non-occupation. This was covered by the general statutory condition no. 2, which, with some unimportant changes, is now statutory condition no. 7, and which reads as follows:\nAny change material to the risk and within the control and knowledge of the insured shall avoid the policy as to the part affected thereby, unless the change is promptly notified in writing to the insurer or its local agent; and the insurer when so notified may return the unearned portion, if any, of the premium paid and cancel the policy, or may notify the insured in writing that, if he desires the policy to continue in force, he must within fifteen days of the receipt of the notice pay to the insurer an additional premium, and in default of such payment the policy shall no longer be in force and the insurer shall return the unearned portion, if any, of the premium paid.\nIn 1924, the Ontario Legislature by the Act, 14 Geo. V, chap. 50, adopted statutory condition 5 (d), which reads as follows:\nUnless permission is given by the policy or endorsed thereon, the insurer shall not be liable for loss or damage occurring:\u2014\n* * *\n(d) When the building insured or containing the property insured is, to the knowledge of the insured, vacant or unoccupied for more than thirty consecutive days, or being a manufacturing establishment, ceases to be operated and continues out of operation for more than thirty consecutive days.\nEvidence was offered at the trial to show that the vacancy of the property was a change material to the risk, but there was no evidence of any change material to the risk in addition to the bare fact of vacancy.\nWe are of opinion that, by virtue of clause (d) of condition 5 in the policy, vacancy for a period of thirty days was one of the risks contemplated by the policy, and assumed by the appellant, and that, the vacancy in question having been for less than thirty consecutive days, statutory condition no. 7 does not apply, and the appellants are liable.\nThe appeal is therefore to be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Nathan Phillips & Company.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Norman L. Matthews.\n[1] [1931] 4 D.L.R. 720.\n[2] [1931] O.R. 281; [1931] 3 D.L.R. 407.\n[3] [1931] 4 D.L.R. 720.\n[4] [1931] O.R. 281; [1931] 3 D.L.R. 407.\n",

(Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nPigeon Timber Company, Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1931: November 25; 1932: March 15.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nWaters and watercourses\u2014Timber\u2014Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 43, ss. 32, 52\u2014Authorization for construction of works in river and charging tolls on timber passing through\u2014Application of Act to international boundary streams\u2014Application to Pigeon River\u2014Validity of legislation\u2014Construction, application and effect of provision in clause 2 of Ashburton Treaty.\nSecs. 32 and 52 of the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 43, providing for incorporation of companies for \u201cacquiring or constructing and maintaining and operating works upon any lake or river in Ontario,\u201d and for charging tolls upon timber passing through such works, apply with respect to the Ontario side or part of boundary streams between Ontario and the United States, including the Pigeon River. Appellant company, incorporated under the Ontario Companies Act, R.S.O., 1914, c. 178, for the purpose (inter alia) of constructing works on that part of said river which is within Ontario, was held entitled to charge tolls, under the provisions of the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act, upon all timber passing through such works. The Ontario legislation aforesaid, authorizing such powers, is intra vires.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Ont., 66 Ont. L.R. 577, reversed.\nPer Anglin C.J.C., Rinfret and Smith JJ.: The legislation, so construed as applicable to said river, is not in conflict with the provision in Article 2 of the Ashburton Treaty (between Great Britain and the United States, August 9, 1842), that \u201call the water-communications, and all the usual portages along the line from Lake Superior to the Lake of the Woods, and also Grand Portage from the shore of Lake Superior to the Pigeon River, as now actually used, shall be free and open to the use of the subjects and citizens of both countries.\u201d\nPer Anglin C.J.C: By that provision in the Treaty it was intended merely to ensure to the citizens of both countries equality of rights in regard to the water communications, portages, etc., and not to prevent either party from imposing tolls on its citizens for the use of improvements lawfully to be made, or from imposing like tolls (but none greater) on citizens of the other country for the use of such improvements.\nPer Rinfret and Smith JJ.: That provision in the Treaty does not apply to the non\u2011navigable part of Pigeon River in which the works in question are situated, as that part of the river was not, at the time of the Treaty, \u201cactually used\u201d for water communication, Grand Portage being used to carry traffic round the high falls and rapids in that part of the river. The words \u201cas now actually used\u201d applied, not only to Grand Portage, but also to \u201call the water\u2011communications,\u201d etc.\nPer Lamont and Cannon JJ.: The words \u201cas now actually used,\u201d in the provision in the Treaty, referred only to Grand Portage and not to all water communications and usual portages. Pigeon River from its mouth along both sides of the boundary line forms part of the \u201cwater-communications\u201d which were to be \u201cfree and open.\u201d The words \u201cfree and open\u201d are not consistent with the imposition of tolls for the use of improvements erected in the river; they mean that the citizens of both countries are to be at liberty, as a matter of right, to travel these waters on both sides of the fixed boundary line without let or hindrance from anyone or having to pay anything for so doing. Therefore, s. 52 of the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act, in so far as it authorizes the imposition of tolls for the use of improvements erected in the Pigeon River, is at variance with the provisions of the Treaty. But this does not make it invalid as a legislative enactment. The existence of the Treaty of itself does not impose a limitation upon the provincial legislative power. The provision in the Treaty, in the absence of any legislation, Imperial or Canadian, implementing or sanctioning it, has only the force of a contract between Great Britain and the United States, which is ineffectual to impose any limitation upon the legislative power exclusively bestowed by the Imperial Parliament upon the legislature of a province; and, in the absence of affirming legislation, the provision in the Treaty cannot be enforced by our courts.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] allowing the present respondent\u2019s appeal from the judgment of Wright J.[2], dismissing its application for an order prohibiting His Honour Judge McKay, Junior Judge of the District of Thunder Bay, from approving any schedule of tolls proposed to be charged by the present appellant for alleged improvements made by it on the Pigeon River, and from hearing any further evidence on the application for approval of the proposed tolls. The said application by respondent before wright J. was made on the following grounds:\n1. That the said Judge has no jurisdiction to approve of tolls proposed to be charged by said Company for the use of alleged improvements made on said River by it for river driving purposes, such river being an international stream, and under the terms of the treaty between Great Britain and the United States, commonly known as the Ashburton Treaty, being free and open to the use of the subjects and citizens of both Canada and the United States.\n2. That Part V of the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act in so far as it purports to authorize the said Company to charge and collect tolls for the use of any improvements for river driving made or to be made in the said Pigeon River is ultra vires the Ontario Legislature and null and void.\n3. That the said Company has no legislative authority to exact tolls or other charges for the use of any improvements for river driving made or to be made by it in said Pigeon River.\nThe Appellate Division[3] directed that an order go prohibiting the Junior Judge of the District of Thunder Bay from approving any schedule of tolls proposed to be charged by the present appellant for alleged improvements made by it on the Pigeon River.\nThe present appellant was granted, by the Appellate Division, special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions raised are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. The appeal to this Court was allowed, and the order of Wright J. restored.\nSir William Hearst K.C. and W.I. Hearst for the appellant.\nH.F. Parkinson K.C. for the respondent.\nE. Bayly K.C. for the Attorney-General for Ontario.\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014I agree in the allowance of this appeal largely for the reasons stated by my brothers Rinfret and Smith. I should, however, have preferred it had the majority of the court seen its way clear to base its decision upon a holding that, upon the true construction of the clause of the Ashburton Treaty\u2014\nIt being understood that all the water-communications, and all the usual portages along the line from Lake Superior to the Lake of the Woods, and also Grand Portage from the shore of Lake Superior to the Pigeon River, as now actually used, shall be free and open to the use of the subjects and citizens of both countries, it was merely meant to ensure to the citizens of both countries equality of rights in regard to the water communications, portages, etc., and that it never was intended thereby to provide that in no event should either party to the Treaty be at liberty, as regards citizens of its own nationality, to impose tolls for the use of improvements lawfully to be made thereon. In other words, where either party to the Treaty saw fit to impose tolls upon its own citizens, in regard to such improvements, it should be at liberty to impose like tolls (but none greater) on citizens of the other country for the use of the improvements so made. Otherwise, it would follow that neither country could impose any tolls whatsoever upon its own citizens, because that would interfere with the water communications, portages, etc., being \u201cfree and open\u201d to the use of the subjects and citizens of both countries.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Smith JJ. was delivered by\nSMITH J.\u2014The appellant is a company incorporated by letters patent dated 26th September, 1922, under the Ontario Companies Act, chapter 178, R.S.O., 1914, now chapter 218, R.S.O., 1927, for the purposes and objects following:\nSubject to the provisions of The Timber Slide Companies Act, to acquire or construct and maintain any dam, slide, pier, boom or other work necessary to facilitate the transmission of timber down the Arrow River and its tributaries and that part of the Pigeon River which is within the Province of Ontario and to blast rocks or dredge or remove shoals or other impediments or otherwise improve the navigation of the said Arrow River and its tributaries and the said Pigeon River within the Province of Ontario.\nA company with the same shareholders and directors and with similar objects had been incorporated in 1899, the existence of which was limited to 21 years, and at the expiration of this period the works constructed by it in the Arrow and Pigeon rivers became the property of His Majesty pursuant to the provisions of the Timber Slide Companies Act, R.S.O., 1914, ch. 181.\nUpon the incorporation of the appellant company, the Crown conveyed to it for $100 all the works that had been constructed by the former company and, thereupon, the appellant company proceeded, as authorized by the letters patent, to improve and extend these works for the purpose of improving the floatability of the Arrow River and part of the Pigeon River in Ontario. The appellant made the application in question to the District Judge for approval of tolls to be charged for the use of these works, and the respondent applied for an injunction order, restraining the District Judge from acting on appellant\u2019s application, on the ground that, the Pigeon River being an international stream, its use, under the Ashburton Treaty, is free and open to the use of the citizens of both Canada and the United States, and that Part V of the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act, in so far as it purports to authorize the appellant company to charge tolls for use of improvements on that river, is ultra vires of the Ontario Legislature.\nThis injunction was refused by Wright J., on the ground that, in British countries, treaties to which Great Britain is a party are not as such binding on the individual subject in the absence of legislation.\nThe Appellate Division agrees with this and, apparently, would have upheld the decision of Wright J., had there been, in their Lordships\u2019 view, legislation in Ontario that authorized the construction of the works in question.\nThe appellant claims that these works were authorized by section 32 of the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act, which reads as follows:\nA company may be incorporated under The Companies Act for the purpose of acquiring or constructing and maintaining and operating works upon any lake or river in Ontario, and every such company shall thereupon become subject to all the provisions of this Part.\nThe Appellate Division holds that this section applies only to lakes and rivers that are wholly within the province of Ontario, and the Pigeon River, being a boundary stream, is only partly in Ontario and the section, therefore, did not authorize the acquisition, construction, maintenance and operation of these works in that river.\nThe reason given for thus construing section 32, put shortly, is that the court ought not to impute to the legislature an intent, by this section, to authorize a violation of the terms of the treaty, if the section is capable of a construction not having that effect.\nThis reasoning is, of course, based on the assumption (unwarranted, as I think) that the construction of these works under legislative authority would be a violation of the treaty. It seems to me, however, that, looking at the statute as a whole, section 32 has not the restricted application assigned to it by the Appellate Division. So interpreted, the section would also have no application to boundary streams between provinces, such as the Ottawa River, and all works in that and other boundary rivers and streams, unless otherwise authorized, would, in consequence, be without legal sanction.\nMoreover, section 14 of the Act has special provisions in relation to works in international streams, and the works there referred to are, I think, unquestionably works authorized by the Act itself, that is by section 32.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that section 32 has application to the Pigeon River and, as already intimated, am further of opinion that it is not in conflict with the terms of the treaty.\nThe precise provision of the treaty, with which it is argued that section 32, applied to the Pigeon River, is in conflict, is as follows:\nIt being understood that all the water-communications, and all the usual portages along the line from Lake Superior to the Lake of the Woods, and also Grand Portage from the shore of Lake Superior to the Pigeon River, as now actually used, shall be free and open to the use of the subjects and citizens of both countries.\nThe part of the Pigeon River, in which the works in question are situated, is not stated in the affidavit, filed by respondent, to have been in actual use at the time of the treaty for water communication and the map filed as an exhibit to the affidavit indicates, as the terms of the treaty also indicate, that what was in actual use at that time was the Grand Portage which carried traffic round and past the obstruction of the high falls and rapids that rendered the part of the Pigeon River in question non\u2011navigable for traffic then carried on.\nIt appears that some of these falls are 120 feet in height, and that the total drop in this part of the river is 620 feet. All the waters of these streams that were navigable were in use for transportation at the time of the treaty, and at the parts of the river not navigable the portages were used. In my opinion, the right preserved by the passage of the treaty quoted was the right to continue to use the water communication and portages then in use. I am unable to agree with the view expressed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit, in Clark v. Pigeon River Improvement Slide & Boom Co.[4], namely, that the words \u201cas now actually used\u201d apply only to Grand Portage. This decision would imply that the right given to use the other portages is unlimited.\nThere could, so far as I can see, have been no reason for preserving a right to use Grand Portage that would not apply to other portages, and the language as used appears to apply to all, and to the water communications, and I think should be so construed. What was being dealt with, and what was in the contemplation of the parties, was travel and transportation over the water communications and portages as then used, and there was, in my opinion, no thought or intention of dealing with the use of these non\u2011navigable rapids and falls that were not in use and could not be used, the passing of which was provided for by the portages. Both navigable and non-navigable waters are covered by the subsequent treaty in relation to boundary waters.\nArticle 1 of that treaty provides that the navigation of all navigable boundary waters shall forever continue free and open for the purposes of commerce to the inhabitants of both countries.\nOther articles make provision for an International Joint Commission, and give to that Commission control over uses, obstructions or diversions of all boundary waters on either side of the line not theretofore or thereafter provided for by agreement between the parties.\nIn my opinion, the passage of the Ashburton Treaty quoted above does not apply to the non\u2011navigable part of Pigeon River in which the works in question are situated.\nThe International Boundary Waters Treaty, however, does apply, but section 14 of the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act already referred to makes provision that everything to be done under the Act must conform to any orders or recommendation which the International Joint Commission may make under the International Boundary Waters Treaty, so that there is no conflict with that treaty.\nIt may be noted that part of the works in question is the dam extending all the way across the river. The part in the United States apparently was authorized by the State of Minnesota, which also authorized collection of tolls.\nSo far as the rights of the Dominion in connection with navigation are concerned, the provincial jurisdiction to improve the flotability of the non-navigable part of an international stream within the province, except as modified by treaty, does not seem to be different from the jurisdiction to make such improvements in a non-navigable stream wholly within the province.\nIt is argued, on behalf of the respondent, that the works in question are of no advantage to them in the floating of their cordwood ties and pulpwood; but this is a matter to be submitted to the District Judge in connection with the fixing of tolls.\nThe appeal should be allowed, and the order of Wright J. restored, with costs here and in the Appellate Division.\nThe judgment of Lamont and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014The Arrow River and Tributaries Slide & Boom Co., Limited, was, on September 7, 1922, incorporated under the Ontario Companies Act pursuant to what is now section 32 of the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act, being R.S.O., 1927, ch. 43, for the following purposes and objects as stated in its letters patent, namely:\u2014\nSubject to the provisions of The Timber Slide Companies Act, to acquire or construct and maintain any dam, slide, pier, boom or other work necessary to facilitate the transmission of timber down the Arrow River and its tributaries and that part of the Pigeon River which is within the Province of Ontario.\nSection 1 (g) of the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act defines \u201ctimber\u201d as including saw logs, posts, ties, cordwood and pulpwood.\nSection 32 of the Act reads:\u2014\n32. A company may be incorporated under The Companies Act for the purpose of acquiring or constructing and maintaining and operating works upon any lake or river in Ontario, and every such company shall thereupon become subject to all the provisions of this Part.\n\u201cWorks\u201d includes a dam, slide, pier, boom or other work constructed in a lake or river to facilitate the floating of timber down such lake or river.\nBy section 51 the owner or occupier of the works is designated \u201coperator.\u201d Section 52 reads:\u2014\nThe operator may demand and receive the lawful tolls upon all timber passing through or over such works, and shall have free access to such timber for the purpose of measuring or counting it.\nBefore tolls can be collected the amounts thereof must be approved by a judge of the County or District Court after notice published in a newspaper once a week for four successive weeks stating the proposed tolls and the day and the hour on which an application is to be made to the judge for his approval thereof (s. 53).\nThe appellants acquired certain works already erected on the Pigeon River and constructed others, and, on March 28, 1930, made an application to His Honour Judge McKay, the junior judge of the District of Thunder Bay, to approve of the tolls of which due notice had been given. His Honour took some evidence and adjourned the application. The respondents then made an application to Mr. Justice Wright in chambers for an order prohibiting His Honour Judge McKay from approving of any schedule of tolls proposed to be charged by the appellants for the alleged improvements made by them on Pigeon River. The grounds upon which prohibition was sought were stated as follows:\n1. That the said Judge has no jurisdiction to approve of tolls proposed to be charged by said Company for the use of alleged improvements made on said river by it for river driving purposes, such river being an international stream, and under the terms of the treaty between Great Britain and the United States, commonly known as the Ashburton Treaty, being free and open to the use of the subjects and citizens of both Canada and the United States.\n2. That Part V of the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act in so far as it purports to authorize the said Company to charge and collect tolls for the use of any improvements for river driving made or to be made in the said Pigeon River is ultra vires the Ontario Legislature and null and void.\nThe learned chambers judge dismissed the application. On appeal, the Second Divisional Court set aside the order of the chambers judge and made an order granting the application for prohibition. It is from this latter order that this appeal is brought.\nThe first question requiring consideration is: Does the imposition of tolls by the appellants, under section 52 above quoted, for the use of improvements made by them on Pigeon River, conflict with the provisions of the treaty made between His Majesty and the United States of America signed at Washington, August 9, 1842, and commonly known as the Ashburton\u2011Webster Treaty.\nThe treaty had for its object, inter alia, the settling and defining of the undetermined boundary line between Canada and the United States.\nThe material part of article 2, as applicable to the case before us, is as follows:\u2014\nIt is moreover agreed, that * * * the line shall run * * * to the mouth of Pigeon River, and up the said river to and through the north and south Fowl Lakes, to the lakes of the height of land between Lake Superior and the Lake of the Woods; * * * It being understood that all the water\u2011communications, and all the usual portages along the line from Lake Superior to the Lake of the Woods, and also Grand Portage from the shore of Lake Superior to the Pigeon River, as now actually used, shall be free and open to the use of the subjects and citizens of both countries.\nThe Pigeon River thus forms part of the boundary line between Canada and the United States as well as between the Province of Ontario and the State of Minnesota. The appellants have acquired or constructed a dam across that part of the river extending from the Canadian shore to the international boundary line, and have established slides to facilitate the passage of timber down the river. The shareholders of the appellant company, according to the affidavit of A.L. Johnston, have become incorporated in the State of Minnesota under the name of \u201cThe Pigeon River Improvement Slide and Boom Company,\u201d which company claims to own the improvements made on the American side of the river and is claiming the right to charge tolls for the use of its improvements there. No person, therefore, can use the river to float down timber without using the improvements on one side or the other. The respondents own pulpwood and cutting rights both in the State of Minnesota and the Province of Ontario on the upper reaches of the Pigeon River. Their wood from both sides must of necessity be floated down the river in order to reach its market. They contend that the improvements made in the river, while possibly useful in floating down saw logs or large timbers, are of no value whatever to them, as their cordwood, pulpwood and ties could, just as satisfactorily, be floated down the river in its natural state. This, however, is disputed by the appellants in their factum, but there is nothing in the material before us by which the question can be determined, if its determination be material. Neither is there anything in the record, as the chambers judge points out, shewing whether or not the river is a navigable stream at the point where the appellants made their improvements, although the argument proceeded on the assumption that it was not navigable for boats and even canoes.\nThe contentions advanced by the appellant are:\u2014\n1. That Pigeon River from its mouth to Fort Charlotte is not a water communication within the meaning of the last clause of article 2, nor was it at the time of the making of the treaty \u201cactually used\u201d as such.\n2. That the words \u201cfree and open\u201d in the clause do not mean free from tolls or charges for the use of improvements to navigation, lawfully constructed, but mean \u201cavailable,\u201d \u201caccessible,\u201d \u201cthrown open to the use and enjoyment of the citizens of both countries on equal terms,\u201d or, in other words: \u201cwithout discrimination.\u201d\n1. For the purposes of this judgment I shall assume the facts to be as the appellants state in their factum: that, between its mouth and Fort Charlotte, Pigeon River is, for the greater part of the way, a rapid and turbulent stream interrupted by numerous falls and rapids and that, to avoid these, traders and voyageurs, at the date of the treaty, were accustomed to sail up Lake Superior five miles west of the mouth of Pigeon River, debark at Grand Portage and transport their goods and belongings a distance of nine miles to Fort Charlotte on the Pigeon River above the last of the falls. Here they reloaded their boats and canoes and proceeded westward, while those coming from the west also went overland from Fort Charlotte to Grand Portage.\nI shall also assume as true the statements in the historical works to which we were referred, that, although the communication westward to the Lake of the Woods was by water, it was necessary from time to time to make a portage to avoid the rapids existing in the river and that, notwithstanding these difficulties, a very considerable trade was carried on between the east and the west.\nIn Baker\u2019s Historical Collections there is the following entry:\u2014\nHenry records that he met 40 canoes on the Pigeon River loaded with furs from Athabasca Lake and bound for Grand Portage. In view of these facts, what is the meaning to be given to \u201cwater-communications\u201d in the last clause of article 2? These are to be kept \u201cfree and open\u201d for the use of the subjects of both countries, as are also the usual portages \u201calong the line,\u201d as well as Grand Portage, which is not along the line but is wholly in United States territory.\nIn construing the treaty we have to determine the intentions of the framers thereof as expressed in the words used. Did they intend that the whole river should come within the term \u201cwater-communications,\u201d or only those parts of it between portages over which boats could pass at the date of the treaty? In order to understand these words it is material to inquire what was the subject matter with respect to which they were used, and the object the framers of the treaty had in view? The subject matter to which they were applied was the waters of the Pigeon River, and other rivers, streams and lakes up which the boundary line from Lake Superior to the Lake, of the Woods was being run. The object of the provision was to secure to the subjects of both countries the free and untrammelled right to use these water stretches irrespective of whether they were on one side of the boundary line or the other.\nAlthough at the date of the treaty the chief purpose for which these water communications were being used was the transportation by boat or canoe of persons and goods, the clause in question places no limit on the purposes for which they might be used. They are to be \u201cfree and open\u201d to the people of both countries for whatever purpose they may desire to use them as a water communication. If, therefore, they could be used for any purpose which did not necessitate the making of a portage to get past a point of danger, I see nothing in the clause, or in any other part of the treaty, which would compel the use of the portage in order to have a free passage. To hold that water communications should be limited to those portions of the river navigable by boats at the time the treaty was signed, would, in my opinion, be to give too narrow a construction to the language used, and to impute a want of vision to the framers of the treaty.\nFurthermore, such a construction would lead to the result that certain portions of the river around which portages had to be made at the date of the treaty owing to low water, would not constitute a water communication at another season when boats could pass over them with ease and safety.\nIn Kewatin Power Company v. Town of Kenora[5], my Lord the Chief Justice (then Anglin J.) held that, where a river is navigable in its general character, natural interruptions to navigation at some parts of it which can be readily overcome do not prevent it from being deemed a navigable river at such parts.\nIn Economy Light & Power Co. v. United States[6], the Supreme Court of the United States, in referring to the question of the navigability of a river, said:\u2014\nNavigability, in the sense of the law, is not destroyed because the watercourse is interrupted by occasional natural obstructions or portages; nor need the navigation be open at all seasons of the year, or at all stages of the water.\nIf a river may properly be called navigable notwithstanding that it is necessary to make use of portages at certain points, it would seem equally appropriate to designate it as a \u201cwater\u2011communication.\u201d\nIt was contended by the appellant that the term \u201cwater-communications\u201d referred to in the last paragraph of article 2, was limited by the words \u201cas now actually used\u201d in the last line but one thereof. This same argument was presented to the Circuit Court of Appeals of Minnesota in the case of Clark v. Pigeon River Improvement Slide & Boom Co.[7], where, at page 556, the court dealt with it as follows:\u2014\nAs a matter of grammatical construction, an argument might be made that the term \u201cas now actually used\u201d applies to all the water connections and usual portages and not merely to Grand Portage, but it appears from the record that Grand Portage alone of all the portages is not \u201calong the line,\u201d and we think therefore the words, \u201cas now actually used,\u201d refer only to Grand Portage. Any other theory would give the treaty a narrow and apparently distorted construction.\nIn addition there was another and a practical reason why a route which was to be \u201cfree and open\u201d between Grand Portage and Fort Charlotte should be limited to that actually in use at the time of the treaty, which did not apply to the portages along the river. These portages were taken to get around some parts of the river over which it was impossible or dangerous to take boats. Practical traders had, long before the treaty, found the most advantageous portage around these obstacles and such would always be taken owing to its practical advantage; while between Grand Portage and Fort Charlotte there was a land trip of nine miles over which possibly several routes, one as good as another, might have been established. Unless, therefore, the United States were to have more than one route across Minnesota territory kept free and open for traffic, it was desirable that the route agreed upon should be specifically defined. This was done by limiting such route to the one then \u201cactually used.\u201d I am, therefore, of opinion that Pigeon River from its mouth along both sides of the boundary line, forms part of the \u201cwater-communications\u201d which were to be free and open.\n2. I cannot agree with the appellants\u2019 contention that the words \u201cfree and open\u201d in the last clause of article 2 are consistent with the imposition of tolls for the use of improvements erected in the river. In my opinion, the meaning of these words in the clause is that the citizens of both countries are to be at liberty, as a matter of right, to travel these waters on both sides of the fixed boundary line without let or hindrance from anyone, or having to pay anything for so doing. This seems to me to be the natural and ordinary meaning of the words and the meaning which, at the time of the treaty, the subjects of both countries would place upon them. That this is the meaning the words were intended to bear seems to me to be indicated also by article 7 of the treaty, which reads:\nVII. It is further agreed,, that the channels in the River St. Lawrence on both sides of the Long Sault Islands and of Barnhart Island, the channels in the River Detroit, on both sides of the Island Bois Blanc, and between that island and both the Canadian and American shores, and all the several channels and passages between the various islands lying near the junction of the River St. Clair with the lake of that name, shall be equally free and open to the ships, vessels, and boats of both parties.\nIf we give effect to the appellants\u2019 interpretation of the words \u201cfree and open\u201d it would entitle either of the contracting parties who improved the navigation of any of the channels on its own side of these waters to levy a toll on every vessel making use of such channel. I cannot believe such to have been the intention of the parties. As Riddell, J.A., pointed out in his judgment below, the appellants here by building upon the bed of the river have interfered with the enjoyment of the free and open use of it by the citizens of the United States. This, as I read it, is contrary to the treaty. The result, therefore is, that in my opinion, section 52 of the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act, in so far as it authorizes the imposition of tolls for the use of improvements erected in the Pigeon River, is at variance with the provisions of the treaty.\nThe next question is: Does the fact that section 52 is repugnant to the provisions of the treaty make the section invalid as a legislative enactment?\nThe Second Divisional Court thought that because a former Sovereign had been a party to the treaty and His Majesty was in honour bound to uphold it, and, as the Act in question was passed in His Majesty\u2019s name, it should not be given a construction inconsistent with the terms of the treaty if it could fairly be otherwise interpreted. The Court referred to section 32 of the Act for the purpose of shewing that the company was incorporated only for the \u201cacquiring or constructing and maintaining and operating works upon any lake or river in Ontario,\u201d and held that as Pigeon River was only partly in Ontario the Act was not intended to apply to that river.\nThat Pigeon River is only in part in the Province of Ontario does not, in my opinion, render the Act inapplicable to that part, for provincial legislative enactments, unless restricted as to the area to which they shall apply, effectively operate throughout the whole province.\nHad the Legislature intended to exclude international boundary rivers from the operation of the Act, I think it would have said so in express terms and not have left the matter to inference, particularly when the inference can only be drawn by giving an unusual construction to the language used. The view that the Act was intended to apply to international boundary waters in so far as they were in Ontario is, I think, supported by the reference to such waters in section 14. The Act being applicable to boundary waters, was it, in other respects within the competence of the Legislature to enact?\nIt has long been well settled by the Privy Council that within the provincial area and the ambit of the classes of subjects enumerated in section 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, the legislative competence of a pro- vincial legislature is as plenary and as ample as the Imperial Parliament in the plentitude of its power possessed, and could bestow. That the subject matter of the Act in question falls within the enumerated heads of section 92 is not disputed nor indeed could it well be. Caldwell v. McLaren[8]. The Act must, therefore, be held to be valid unless the existence of the treaty of itself imposes a limitation upon the provincial legislative power. In my opinion, the treaty alone cannot be considered as having that effect. The treaty in itself is not equivalent to an Imperial Act and, without the sanction of Parliament, the Crown cannot alter the existing law by entering into a contract with a foreign power. For a breach of a treaty a nation is responsible only to the other contracting nation and its own sense of right and justice. Where, as here, a treaty provides that certain rights or privileges are to be enjoyed by the subjects of both contracting parties, these rights and privileges are, under our law, enforceable by the courts only where the treaty has been implemented or sanctioned by legislation rendering it binding upon the subject. Upon this point I agree with the view expressed by both courts below:\nthat, in British countries, treaties to which Great Britain is a party are not as such binding upon the individual subjects, but are only contracts binding in honour upon the contracting States.\nIn this respect our law would seem to differ from that prevailing in the United States where, by an express provision of the constitution, treaties duly made are \u201cthe supreme law of the land\u201d equally with Acts of Congress duly passed. They are thus cognizable in both the federal and state courts. In the case before us it is not suggested that any legislation, Imperial or Canadian, was ever passed implementing or sanctioning the provision of the treaty that the water communications above referred to should be free and open to the subjects of both countries. That provision, therefore, has only the force of a contract between Great Britain and the United States which is ineffectual to impose any limitation upon the legislative power exclusively bestowed by the Imperial Parliament upon the legislature of a province. In the absence of affirming legislation this provision of the treaty cannot be enforced by any of our courts whose authority is derived from municipal law. Walker v. Baird[9]; In re The Carter Medicine Co\u2019s Trade Mark[10]; United States v. Schooner \u201cPeggy\u201d[11]; The Chinese Exclusion Case[12]; Oppenheim\u2019s International Law, 4th ed., 733-4.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that section 52, in question in this appeal, must be considered to be a valid enactment until the treaty is implemented by Imperial or Dominion legislation.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the order of Wright J. restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.F.

(the claimant\u2019s assignor, and added as party claimant in the proceedings), on July 27, 1925, sent to His Majesty the King, represented by the Minister of Railways and Canals for Canada, an offer to purchase certain land in the city of Toronto for $1,250,000 cash, depositing $25,000, and agreeing, upon acceptance of the offer, to pay the balance of the purchase price at such time as possession \u201cbe given to (F.) not later than\u201d September 25, 1925. In the offer F. agreed that upon his obtaining possession, on or before September 25, 1925, he would proceed with the erection of a 26 storey building upon said land and certain adjoining land. The offer provided that His Majesty, represented as aforesaid, should execute a lease of certain floors for 30 years upon terms set out. The offer stated: \u201cThis offer of purchase, if accepted by Order * * *in Council, shall constitute a binding contract of purchase and sale,\u201d subject to its terms. On July 29, 1925, an Order in Council was passed, which recited that the Committee had before them a report from the Minister of Railways and Canals representing F.\u2019s offer, stating that \u201cthe Minister accepted said offer of purchase subject to the approval and authority of Your Excellency in Council,\u201d setting out in the main the terms of \u201cthe said offer of purchase, accepted as aforesaid,\u201d and recommending that authority be given for its acceptance. The Order in Council stated: \u201cThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.\u201d There was evidence that F. received a certified copy of the Order in Council, but no evidence that any copy of it or the fact of its having been passed was transmitted to F. by the Minister or by anyone authorized to do so. Extensions of time were given to F., signed by the Deputy Minister, and the last one by letter of the Minister, of November 17, 1925, stating: \u201cI have your letter * * * applying for a further extension of time within which to receive possession * * * and to make payment * * * and to perform * * * other details of the contract of purchase under your offer of purchase, dated July 27, 1925, and the acceptance thereof,\u201d and granting a further extension, but without waiver of rights, etc., \u201cunder and as provided for by the said contract should you fail to perform and carry out, within the hereby extended period, all the covenants and conditions which on your part, under and as provided by the said contract, were to be performed and carried out within the original period thereunder provided.\u201d In the present proceedings damages were claimed against the Crown for not carrying out the contract alleged by the claimant to have been made.\nHeld: No acceptance on behalf of the Crown communicated to F. by anyone having authority to do so, had been shewn; and, therefore, no contract binding on the Crown had been established. The Order in Council did not in itself constitute an acceptance. The acceptance referred to in the Minister\u2019s report set out in the Order in Council, if there was any such acceptance, was not in writing signed in compliance with s. 15 of the Department of Railways and Canals Act, R.S.C., 1906, c. 35, and therefore was not binding on the Crown. The Minister\u2019s letter of November 17, 1925, could not be taken as an acceptance by him of the offer, so as to constitute a contract; he was evidently under the impression that a contract existed, but had no intention by that letter of constituting a contract.\nHeld, further: The claimants could not succeed on the ground of part performance. Even if the doctrine of part performance could otherwise be invoked in this case, the acts of part performance alleged (the contracting by F. for the purchase of adjoining land to form part of the site of the proposed building, and payments on account thereof; the preparation of plans, etc., for the building, and contracting for its construction) were merely steps taken in order to be in a position to make the offer and to carry it out if accepted, and would not amount to part performance of the alleged contract.\nHeld further that, when F. made his applications for extension and was given extension in the terms of the letters, time was made, by these extensions, of the essence of the contract, and, the purchase not having been completed within the extended period, the claim could not be sustained even if there were a contract.\nThe judgment of the Exchequer Court in favour of claimants was reversed, and the claim dismissed. There being no contract, claimants were held entitled to return of the deposit (but not as damages).\nAPPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, rendered the 4th March, 1931, holding that the claimants were entitled to recover damages from the Crown for breach of an alleged contract.\nThe claim for damages was made by the respondent Dominion Building Corporation Ltd., and was referred by the Acting Minister of Railways and Canals for Canada to the Exchequer Court. In his judgment the trial judge allowed a motion made by the claimant at the beginning of the trial for an order permitting the respondent Forgie, the claimant company\u2019s assignor, to be added as a party claimant, so that, if necessary, the claim for damages might be made in the name of the assignor as well as in the name of the claimant company.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The Crown\u2019s appeal was allowed with costs, and the claim dismissed with costs, subject to a direction for return of the deposit.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and C. P. Plaxton K.C. for the appellant.\nI. F. Hellmuth K.C. and R. V. Sinclair K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSmith J.\u2014In 1923, the Crown purchased from the Imperial Bank of Canada property at the northwest corner of King and Yonge streets in the city of Toronto, for the use of the Canadian National Railways. Early in the year 1925, the respondent Forgie suggested to the President of the Canadian National Railways a scheme for the purchase of the Home Bank property on King street adjoining on the west the property of the Crown referred to, and the erection on the combined site of an office building of twenty-six storeys, the ground floor and the three floors immediately above to be leased for a term at certain rentals to the Canadian National Railways.\nOn 13th May, 1925, he submitted an offer to purchase the Crown property referred to for $1,250,000, provided that the Canadian National Railways should agree to sign a lease for the ground floor and next three floors of the twenty-six storey building he intended to cause to be erected on these lands and the lands of the Home Bank referred to, and received a reply from the President on the same date stating that he was agreeable, subject to the approval of the Board of Directors of the company, to recommending to the Government of Canada the acceptance of the proposal.\nOn the 14th May, a copy of this offer from Forgie, addressed to His Majesty the King, represented by the Minister of Railways and Canals for Canada, was forwarded to the Minister of Railways and Canals, but no action was taken in reference to it.\nThe Board of Directors of the railway company approved of the acceptance of the offer made to the President. On the 27th day of July, 1925, Forgie sent to His Majesty the King, represented by the Minister of Railways and Canals for Canada, an offer to purchase the Crown lands referred to for $1,250,000 cash, in which he undertook, upon acceptance of the offer, to pay the balance of the purchase price at such time as possession of the premises \u201cbe given to the undersigned not later than the 16th day of September, 1925.\u201d The offer further provides that it is understood that Forgie agrees, upon obtaining possession of the lands, on or before the 15th day of September, 1925, to proceed with the erection of a twenty-six storey modern fireproof office building\u201d on these Crown lands \u201cand on the lands formerly known as the Home Bank of Canada Head Office site now owned by the undersigned,\u201d and to have the same ready for occupancy \u201cnot later than the 25th day of October, 1926, subject to the usual delays,\u201d etc. The offer further provided that His Majesty, represented by the Minister of Railways and Canals for Canada, should execute a lease of the ground floor and the next three typical floors for thirty years upon terms set out. The final clause of the offer is as follows:\nThis offer of purchase, if accepted by Order of His Excellency the Governor General in Council, shall constitute a binding contract of purchase and sale, subject to all the terms and provisions thereof and which contract shall enure to the benefit of the undersigned, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns and to the benefit of His Majesty, His successors and assigns.\nWith the offer a deposit of $25,000 was made.\nOn the 29th day of July, 1925, an Order in Council was passed, which recites that the Committee had before them a report dated the 27th day of July, 1925, from the Minister of Railways and Canals representing that His Majesty had title to the Crown lands referred to, that James Forgie had, by offer of 27th July, 1925, to His Majesty represented by the Minister of Railways and Canals, a copy of which was annexed, offered to purchase the premises, subject to the terms and conditions of the offer, and\nthe Minister accepted said offer of purchase subject to the approval and authority of Your Excellency in Council given on or before the 29th day of July, AD. 1925.\nThe Order in Council proceeds to set out in the main the terms of \u201cthe said offer of purchase, accepted as aforesaid,\u201d and then proceeds as follows:\nThe Minister submits the above and, upon the advice of the Deputy Minister of Railways and Canals, recommends that authority be given for the acceptance of the said offer of purchase hereto attached marked \u201cA,\u201d and that authority be given for the sale and transfer of the premises by His Majesty to the Purchaser, the transfer by its own terms only to vest title of the premises in the Purchaser upon the execution and delivery of the lease hereinbefore referred to, and such transfer to be in form to be approved by the Department of Justice.\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.\nThere is no evidence that this Order in Council or a copy of it, or of the fact of its having been passed, was transmitted by the Minister or by anyone authorized to do so, to Forgie. At page 27 of the Case, his evidence is as follows:\nQ. When did you receive that Order in Council?\nA. I do not know, as a matter of fact, whether it was that day or a day or so afterwards, but I did receive a certified copy of the Order in Council.\nThen, at page 50, on cross-examination there is the following:\nQ. Now, you did not receive any letter from the Government with the certified copy of the Order in Council of 29th July; will you please file it if you did. It is not in your affidavit on production? A. I do not remember having received one or otherwise.\n* * * * *\nHis Lordship: From whom did you get it? Is it important?\nMr. Geoffrion: A good deal turns on the terms of the Order in Council.\nHis Lordship: The Order in Council was undoubtedly passed and it does not matter much how it reached him.\nAt page 100, the evidence of the Minister of Railways is as follows:\nHis Lordship: When the offer was made to you by Forgie in writing, did you accept the offer subject to approval by the Governor in Council orally or in writing?.\nMr. Geoffrion: Not in writing, but as to orally I do not know.\nMr. Hellmuth: I do not want it to be taken that there was not a legal acceptance. I will have something to say on that.\nHis Lordship: The Order in Council of July 29th states that the offer had been accepted by the Minister subject to the approval of the Governor in Council?\nWitness: The method is this: I took the ground, which I think was a proper one, that this being a Canadian National affair we would want a recommendation from the Canadian National Railways and then as Minister I would approve or not approve of it; first recommended by the Canadian National Railways and then the Order in Council.\nI find it difficult to understand why His Lordship thought it of no consequence how the Order in Council reached Forgie, nor why the counsel, instead of the witness, made the answer as to whether or not the witness accepted the offer orally or in writing. The witness, as would seem from his answer, makes no explicit statement as to whether or not there was in fact the acceptance referred to in his report to Council. What does appear clear is that there was no written acceptance communicated to Forgie by anyone having authority to communicate such acceptance. He obtained a certified copy of the Order in Council, but by what means or from whom, he does not state. The claimant\u2019s contention is that the offer of the 27th July, 1925, coupled with an acceptance, constituted a contract, and the main question at issue is whether or not there was an acceptance of the offer. An acceptance would, to amount to a binding contract, require to be an acceptance on behalf of His Majesty communicated to Forgie by someone having authority so to do. The Order in Council, on its face, does not purport to be an acceptance. The Minister recommends that authority be given for the acceptance of the said offer and for the sale and transfer of the premises by His Majesty to the purchaser, and the Committee concur in that recommendation, and submit the same for approval. In terms this Order in Council authorizes the Minister, to whom the offer was made, to accept it. It is, however, contended that because of the statement in the offer that if accepted by Order of His Excellency the Governor General in Council, it shall constitute a binding contract, the terms of the offer are satisfied by this Order in Council, and that therefore the Order in Council itself amounted to an acceptance creating a completed contract.\nI am quite unable to accept this view. An offer is not transformed into a completed contract until there is an acceptance of that offer by or on behalf of the party to whom the offer is made. If the Order in Council had expressly stated that His Majesty accepted the offer, I am of opinion that there would still have been no completed contract until that acceptance was communicated by or on behalf of His Majesty to Mr. Forgie in response to his offer. The situation, to my mind, is not different from what occurred at a later date in connection with the proposed lease of five floors of the proposed building for the Customs and Excise Department. An offer was made by the Dominion Building Corporation Limited, Forgie\u2019s assignee, to the Minister of Public Works for such a lease. The Minister of Public Works recommended the acceptance of the offer to His Excellency the Governor in Council, and an Order in Council was made, advising that the necessary authority be given accordingly. Forgie says that he received a copy of this Order in Council on or about the 3rd of February. He was then, of course, acting for his assignee, the Dominion Building Corporation Limited, which made the offer. Again, he does not state how or from whom he received the certified copy of the Order in Council, but admits that there was no letter or writing. It is not contended by anyone that in this later case the Order in Council constituted an acceptance, even though Forgie in some way got a certified copy of it.\nI am therefore of opinion that the Order in Council of the 29th July, 1925, did not in itself constitute an acceptance of Forgie\u2019s offer of the 27th of that month, because, in the first place, the offer was not made to His Excellency the Governor General in Council and the Order does not purport to accept the offer, and secondly, because there is no evidence that the making of such an Order in Council was communicated to Forgie on behalf of His Majesty by the Minister of Railways and Canals, or anybody else duly authorized. Section 15 of the Department of Railways and Canals Act, ch. 35, R.S.C., 1906, reads in part as follows:\nNo deed, contract, document or writing relating to any matter under the control or direction of the Minister shall be binding upon His Majesty, unless it is signed by the Minister, or unless it is signed by the Deputy Minister, and countersigned by the Secretary of the Department, or unless it is signed by some person specially authorized by the Minister, in writing, for that purpose.\nAs shown by the evidence already quoted, the acceptance referred to in the report of the Minister set out in the Order in Council, if there was any, was not in writing, signed in compliance with this section, and therefore was not binding upon His Majesty. The statement in the Minister\u2019s report to Council, to the effect that the offer had been accepted, was not a statement communicated to Forgie.\nIt is argued, however, that because there were numerous extensions of time given to Forgie for the carrying out of his contract, signed by the Deputy Minister of Railways and Canals, and a final extension to the 30th day of December, 1925, signed by the Minister himself, there was an acceptance complying with the terms of the section just quoted. The letter extending the time, that was signed by the Minister, is exhibit 30, replying to Forgie\u2019s request for an extension, and is dated November 17, 1925, and is as follows:\nOttawa, 17th November, 1925.\nDear Sir:\nRe: Purchase of Crown Property (Imperial Bank Property, so called), Corner of Yonge and King Streets, Toronto, Ont.\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, addressed to the Deputy Minister, applying for a further extension of time within which to receive possession of the property in question and to make payment of the balance of purchase price therefor and to perform and carry out on your part, other details of the contract of purchase under your offer of purchase, dated July 27, 1925, and the acceptance thereof.\nIn reply, I am to advise you that a further extension of time, namely, from November 17, 1925, to December 30, 1925, is hereby given, but without prejudice on the part of His Majesty as to, and without waiver on the part of His Majesty of, any of His rights, reservations or remedies under and as provided for by the said contract should you fail to perform and carry out, within the hereby extended period, all the covenants and conditions which on your part, under and as provided by the said contract, were to be performed and carried out within the original period thereunder provided.\nYours faithfully,\n(Sgd.) GEO. P. GRAHAM.\nJames Forgie, Esq.,\nBarrister, etc.,\nToronto, Ont.\nThis letter, signed by the Minister, is, of course, not in terms an acceptance of Forgie\u2019s offer, but implies that there is already in existence a contract. If I am correct in my view that up to this time there was in fact no contract, then this letter was written under a misapprehension of the real state of fact, and, I think, cannot be taken as an acceptance by the Minister of the offer so as to constitute a contract. The Minister was under the impression that a contract already existed, and he had no intention by this letter of constituting a contract; and without such intention I do not see how he can be held to have done so. There seems to be no doubt that the Minister was under the impression that a binding contract was in existence from about the time that the Order in Council was passed. Whether he thought that the contract was completed by the Order in Council itself, or by some acceptance by him or by his authority before or after the making of the Order, or by the fact that the Manager and Board of Directors of the Canadian National Railways had approved of the acceptance of the offer, is not apparent. Here we are not, however, dealing with what might be inferred in connection with negotiations between private parties. Parliament has seen fit, for the protection of His Majesty, to enact sec. 15 referred to, and we are not entitled to disregard that enactment. The question, therefore, is whether or not there was in fact an acceptance that complies with the terms of this sec. 15, and it seems to me impossible to say that there was.\nIt is further argued on behalf of the respondent that if there was no contract by virtue of the offer, the Minister\u2019s report and Order in Council, and the correspondence, then there was such part performance of the proposed contract by the respondents as to constitute a contract binding upon His Majesty represented by the Minister of Railways and Canals. It seems to me very doubtful if the express terms of the statute can be disregarded, especially, where, as here, the acts of part performance alleged took place entirely without the knowledge or assent of the Minister. There was no intimation by the claimants from the time of the passing of the Order in Council until the February following, when the Minister definitely refused to proceed further, that the claimants were proceeding in any way to carry out the contract, and no knowledge on the part of the Minister that the alleged acts were being performed. The claimants\u2019 successive applications for an extension of time to commence were an intimation to the Minister that nothing was being done towards carrying out the contract. The doctrine of part performance implies that one party to an intended contract stands by and knowingly allows the other party to perform acts by way of carrying out the proposed contract that places the party so performing in a changed position with regard to the subject matter. I am of opinion that none of the acts of part performance alleged here would amount to part performance. The part performance alleged is the entering into a contract by Forgie for the purchase of the Home Bank property and the payment of money on account, the preparation of plans and specifications for the building, and the entering into a contract for its construction. All these things, except some of the payments, were done prior to the making of the offer of the 27th July, 1925, and were steps taken by Forgie to put himself in a position to make the offer, and to carry it out if accepted. The option for purchase of the Home Bank property was obtained on the 7th May, 1925, and $10,000 was then paid. The offer itself has the statement that the Home Bank property is \u201cnow owned\u201d by Forgie, and refers to plans, details and specifications prepared and to be prepared. The evidence shows that these plans were prepared before the date of the offer of 27th July, 1925. The entry into the contract for the construction of the building was all arranged with Mr. Anglin, of Anglin-Norcross Limited, as a preliminary to the making of an offer, as shown in exhibit 5, dated 2nd May, 1925. By that document, it was agreed that in consideration of the advance of the $25,000 deposited with the offer, Anglin-Norcross Limited were to have the contract to construct the building. Anglin-Norcross Limited supplied the $25,000 pursuant to this letter, and Forgie was bound to give them the contract from that time.\nAll the payments subsequent to the first $10,000 in connection with the option on the Home Bank property were made by the claimants to keep that option good and to keep themselves in a position to carry out the contract if accepted, and are in no sense part performance of anything that Forgie had agreed to do in his offer. The negotiations with the President of the Canadian National Railway Company were all preparatory to the making of the offer to the Minister, as Forgie knew perfectly well that approval of his scheme by the President and Board of Directors of the railway company was a necessary preliminary to any consideration of his scheme by the Minister of Railways and Canals. I am of opinion, therefore, that there was no part performance of the proposed contract which would have the effect of an acceptance of the offer and thus constitute a binding contract.\nIt seems clear from the evidence of Forgie that the reason for all the applications for postponement was the expectation of otbaining from the Minister of Public Works the agreement for the lease of five storeys of the proposed building for the use of the Department of Customs and Excise.\nAt page 38 there is the following:\nHis Lordship: You were waiting on the Order in Council in respect of the Customs lease?\nThe Witness: Yes, and it was impossible during an election to secure the passing of that Order in Council and these extensions were given to me in order to hold over; this was definitely stated to me. The extensions were granted in order to enable me to maintain my position until Parliament was assembled and the Order in Council put through for the Customs and Excise lease of the five floors.\nAnd at page 58:\nIt was always our hope that something might occur to give us the Order in Council for the Customs Department.\nAnd in his letter, dated 15th February, 1926:\nAs you are aware, the Government decided last summer to lease five floors in this building, for different departments of the Government, and this was one of the factors in financing the construction of the building. Through circumstances with which you are familiar, and with which we had nothing to do, the Order in Council dealing with this matter, which was promised last October, was not passed until the 1st day of February, AD. 1926. It was not our fault that the Order was not passed before the expiry of the extension of time, and if there has been any default it is not on the part of those I represent.\nThere is also the telegram of Mr. Spence, exhibit 9, on Forgie\u2019s behalf, asking for an extension and explaining that delay was caused by change in financing arrangements.\nForgie, on the 29th December, 1925, by letter, asked for an extension of time till January 31, which was not granted, yet he made no move towards going on with the contract till after the Order in Council of February 1, 1926, giving authority to the Minister of Public Works to accept the offer of the lease of the five floors for the Customs and Excise Department. On getting the copy of this Order, he writes at once, on 3rd February, that he is in a position to complete the purchase and make payment about 10th February.\nThe proposition from the first involved raising the money for payment of the site and building by a flotation of bonds, secured by mortgage of the property, to be bought by the public. The proposed leases of four floors to the Canadian National Railway Company and of the five floors to the Customs and Excise Department at the rentals stated and for the long terms proposed would have made sure a very considerable revenue which would have been an important factor in securing purchasers for the bonds. The witness Anglin thinks the bonds would have sold readily without the proposed lease to the Customs and Excise Department, but, though he and his firm were largely interested in having the scheme carried through, they made no move towards a flotation on that basis instead of waiting for the Order in Council in reference to the Customs and Excise lease, as Forgie says they did.\nI entertain no doubt on the evidence that the claimants never intended to go on with the contract unless the lease to the Customs and Excise Department should be secured, and that without that lease they never were in a position to go on with the contract.\nMr. Forgie thought the Order in Council authorizing that lease made it a certainty, and at once proceeded to write that he was in a position to go on. The Order in Council, however, was never acted on, but was repealed shortly afterwards, so that the claimants did not in fact get themselves into the position to go on as stated in Mr. Forgie\u2019s letter, of February 3. I am of opinion that there never was a completed contract binding upon His Majesty represented by the Minister of Railways and Canals, or otherwise.\nI am also of opinion that, when Forgie made his various applications for an extension of time and received them in the terms of the various letters of extension, time was made by these extensions of the essence of the contract and that the claim could not be sustained even if there were a contract.\nCounsel for respondent further contends that section 15 of the Department of Railways and Canals Act, quoted above, does not apply here because the transaction was a sale of public lands governed by the provisions of the Public Lands Grants Act, ch. 57, R.S.C., (1906), whereby the Governor in Council is authorized to sell or lease any public lands which are not required for public purposes.\nThis point seems to be disposed of by the judgment of the Privy Council in Dominion Building Corporation Ltd. V. The King[1], where it is stated that, even if the matter were originally not a departmental but a government one, their Lordships would be of opinion that it was appropriated to the Department of Railways and Canals by the Order in Council, and was thereby made part of the Minister\u2019s administration for the purposes of s. 38.\nMoreover, the acceptance of the offer involved not only a sale of public lands but a contract by His Majesty for the payment of a large sum of money annually for a period of thirty years.\nIn any event, there was no contract to purchase. There was an offer to purchase which the Order in Council did not purport to accept, but which merely authorized the Minister to accept, and which, even if construed as an acceptance, was never communicated to the party making the offer by anyone authorized to do so on behalf of His Majesty.\nThere being no contract, the respondent is entitled to the $25,000 as a return of the deposit, but not as an item of damages as claimed.\nOtherwise the appeal is allowed and the claim dismissed with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. Stuart Edwards.\nSolicitor for the respondents: R. V. Sinclair.\n[1] [1930] A.C. 90.\n",

MacKenzie, [1932] S.C.R. 524\nDate: 1932-03-01\nThe Royal Bank of Canada (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nMurdo Mackenzie (Plaintiff) Respondent\n1931: October 16; 1932: March 1.\nPresent at hearing of the appeal: Duff, Newcombe, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ. Newcombe J. took no part in the judgment, as he died before the delivery thereof.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA\nc M. mortgaged to defendant bank chattels thus described: \"60 Rams; 700 Ewe Lambs (etc., giving the number of sheep in each of different classes); All sheep of whatever age and description belonging to the mortgagor being not less than 3,880 head, branded, but not excluding those not so branded. 1 Belgian Stallion; 30 head of Horses.\" The chattels were stated to be now in the possession of the mortgagor and to be situate on certain described land.\nHeld: The description of the sheep satisfied s. 5 of the Bills of Sale Act, Alta., 1929, c. 12. The clause following the enumeration meant all the sheep belonging to the mortgagor, and its meaning was not changed by the preceding particulars. A description is sufficient when it is apparent that the mortgage covers all the chattels of the specified kind owned by the mortgagor (McCall v. Wolff, 13 Can. S.C.R. 130; Hovey v. Whiting, 14 Can. S.C.R. 515; Thomson v. Quirk, 18 Can. S.C.R. 695). The mere fact that the mortgage stated a larger number of sheep than the mortgagor owned could not make the mortgage void as to the sheep he did own. The description of the horses was insufficient.\nIn the affidavit of bona fides, the printed form on the mortgage, which was apparently one in use under a former wording of the Act, was adapted by, after the preliminary part, pasting over the unsuitable part a sheet on which were typewritten the allegations required, the typewritten sheet extending below the part of the printed form so covered over, the jurat of the printed form being used, and the commissioner initialling in the margin the typewritten sheet.\nHeld: The affidavit (though the adaptation was a slovenly method) complied with the statutory requirement. The pasting over was a mode of erasure and substitution, which was authenticated by the commissioner's initialling. The fact that by holding the document to the light the printed words covered over or part of them might be read, made no difference, the intent to erase or blot out being manifest.\nThe bank took what purported to be security under s. 88 of the Bank Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 12) on livestock of a rancher, but used form C instead of form E. Held: The document was in form to the like effect as form E, and constituted a valid security. It sufficiently stated that the advance was made on the security of the live stock mentioned therein; and the statement that the security was given under the provisions of s. 88, instead of that it was given \"under the provisions of subs. 12 of s. 88\" (as in form E), was sufficient.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Alta., 25 Alta. L.R. 281, reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1].\nThe plaintiff, who sued on behalf of himself and the other creditors of the estate of William McLennan, deceased, attacked the validity of a chattel mortgage made by the said McLennan to the defendant bank; and also attacked the validity of a security purporting to be given by said McLennan to the bank under the provisions of s. 88 of the Bank Act.\nThe trial judge, Walsh J.[2], held that the chattel mortgage was a valid security (except as to the stallion and horses mentioned therein); but held against the validity of the security taken under the provisions of s. 88 of the Bank Act.\nThe Appellate Division (1) held (Clarke J.A. dissenting, who agreed with Walsh J. in this respect) that the chattel mortgage was invalid, by reason of defective description of the chattels, and also by reason that it was not accompanied by a proper affidavit of bona fides; and held also (Clarke J.A. dissenting) against the validity of the security taken under the provisions of s. 88 of the Bank Act.\nThe defendant bank appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported, and are indicated in the above head-note. The appeal to this Court was allowed with costs.\nH. G. Nolan for the appellant.\nW. A. Begg K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nSMITH J.\u2014One William McLennan, now deceased, had a sheep ranch in the vicinity of Suffield in the province of Alberta, and made a chattel mortgage dated 20th December, 1929, to the appellant, to secure $9,500 and interest on chattels described as follows:\n60 Rams; 700 Ewe Lambs; 700 Yearling Lambs; 1,920 Two, Three and Four Year Old Ewes; 450 Five Year Old Ewes; 50 Six Year Old Ewes; All sheep of whatever age and description belonging to the mortgagor being not less than 3,880 head, branded, but not excluding those not so branded.\n1 Belgian Stallion; 30 head of Horses.\nThese chattels are stated to be now in the possession of the mortgagor and to be situate on \"all of the South Half and North-west Quarter of Township Fifteen (15), Range Eight (8), West of the Fourth Meridian, in the Province of Alberta.\" The mortgagor died on the 28th day of May, 1930, insolvent, and the (plaintiff) respondent is one of the unsecured creditors suing on behalf of himself and other creditors of the deceased mortgagor, to have it declared that the chattel mortgage referred to is void as against the creditors of the mortgagor.\nThe first ground of attack is that the description quoted above does not satisfy the provisions of the Bills of Sale Act of Alberta (1929, c. 12, s. 5), which provides as follows:\nEvery bill of sale shall contain such sufficient and full description of the chattels comprised therein that the same may be thereby readily and easily known and distinguished.\nI agree with the learned trial judge that the clause following the enumeration of the sheep means all the sheep belonging to the mortgagor, and that it is not necessary to introduce any words not there. If that clause stood alone as a description of the sheep, there would be no doubt as to its meaning, and I do not see that the meaning is changed by the preceding particulars as to the numbers of sheep in each of the different classes.\nAs the learned trial judge points out, the cases establish that the description is sufficient when it is apparent that the mortgage covers all the chattels of the specified kind owned by the mortgagor. McCall v. Wolff[3]; Hovey v. Whiting[4]; Thomson v. Quirk[5]. The mere fact that the mortgagor has stated in the mortgage a larger number of sheep than he actually owned cannot make the mortgage void as to the sheep he did own. The description of the horses is, as the learned trial judge finds, insufficient.\nThe second objection to the validity of the mortgage is that the affidavit of bona fides does not comply with the statutory requirement.\nThere is on the printed form of mortgage used a printed blank form of affidavit in use apparently before the enactment of the statute as it now stands, which provides for a different form of affidavit. The conveyancer undertook to adapt the printed form of affidavit on the document by striking out the unsuitable part and substituting, in typewriting, what was necessary. He made use of the preliminary part of the printed form down to the words \"make oath and say\", and covered over all the printed words following these down to the jurat by pasting over them a sheet containing, in typewriting, all the allegations required by the statute. As this typewriting took up more space than that occupied by the printed words covered up, the bottom part of the typewritten sheet extends beyond the part of the printed form so covered over.\nThe jurat of the printed form is used and the commissioner initials in the margin this typewritten sheet. Much as one is inclined to censure the slovenliness of this kind of conveyancing, I am of opinion that in fact the affidavit complies with the statutory requirement. We have the preliminary part of the affidavit followed in typewriting by all the allegations required, and then the jurat. Pasting the substituted sheet over the printed words not intended to form part of the affidavit was a mode of erasure of these words and substitution of the typewritten words, and, being initialed by the commissioner, this erasure and substitution is authenticated and leaves no ground for doubt as to what the affidavit sworn to by the deponent really was. The fact that by holding the document up to the light the printed words covered over or part of them may be read, seems to me to make no difference, the intent to erase or blot out being manifest. When words in a document are erased as is usually done by drawing a pen through them, they remain legible, but it does not follow that they are not erased.\nI agree with the learned trial judge that the statements in the affidavit are in compliance with the statute.\nThe chattel mortgage, therefore, is a security on all the mortgagor's sheep, valid as against the creditors of the mortgagor, but invalid as a security on the horses mentioned.\nAs to the security under section 88 of the Bank Act, I am in accord with the view of Mr. Justice Clarke of the Appellate Division.\nSection 88, subsection 12, of the Bank Act, R.S.C., 1927, Chap. 12, authorizes a bank to lend money to any person engaged in stock raising upon the security of his live stock, and by subsection 14 it is provided that:\nThe security taken under subsection twelve of this section may be taken in the form set forth in schedule E to this Act or in a form to the like effect.\nIn this case, form C was used instead of form E, and as subsection 14 is only directory the whole question is as to whether what is contained in the form C used is to the like effect of what is required by form E.\nThe learned trial judge found that, in two respects, what is stated in the form used fails to comply with what is required by form E, namely, that the advance was made on the security of the live stock mentioned in it, and that the security was given under subsection 12 of section 88, the particular subsection 12 not being mentioned. As to the first of these objections, the document states that in consideration of an advance of $2,000 made by the Bank to the undersigned, for which the Bank holds bills or notes, the live stock or dead stock or the products thereof, mentioned below, is hereby assigned to the Bank as security for the payment of said bills or notes.\nI am unable to understand how it can be said that this fails to be a statement that the advance was made on the security of the live stock mentioned. I think it is a clear statement to that effect.\nThe other objection, that the document states that the security is given under the provisions of section 88 of the Bank Act instead of \"under the provisions of subsection twelve of section eighty-eight,\" seems to me to be of little force. How could the omission to state the particular subsection mislead anyone? The only provision of the Act authorizing a loan on the security of live stock is subsection 12 of section 88. The document sets out that the loan is on the security of the live stock mentioned, and anyone looking at section 88 must know at once that, if the loan is under the provisions of section 88, it must be under subsection 12 of that section.\nFor these reasons and those stated by Mr. Justice Clarke, I am of opinion that the document as completed is in form to the like effect of form E and constitutes a valid security.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 25 Alta.

In October, 1928, near Kingston, Ontario, F.\u2019s automobile collided with that of respondent, who sued F. in the Ontario courts and, on November 26, 1929, recovered judgment against her for damages and costs. A writ of execution was returned nulla bona, and respondent, on December 31, 1929, obtained an order attaching all debts owing or accruing due from appellant to F. under the policy, which was still in force. Subsequently a trial of an issue was directed to settle what amount, if any, appellant must pay to respondent on account of the judgment against F. At the trial, respondent put in evidence the policy, his judgment against F., F.\u2019s deposition admitting the collision, the action against her, her presence at the trial, that judgment had been given against her for $8,000 and costs, that no part of the judgment had been paid, and that, at the time of the accident, she carried liability insurance on the automobile with appellant. Respondent testified that the judgment was in respect of $829 damage to his car, and the balance in respect of his personal injuries, as the result of the collision. Respondent also adduced evidence that on March 23, 1929, appellant was licensed to carry on the business of automobile and other insurance in Ontario, and shewing its head office for the province, and its assets in Ontario (moneys in bank) and its assets deposited with the Receiver General of Canada for the protection of Canadian policy holders, as shewn by its annual statement filed as required by law. A clause (F) in the policy read: \u201cNo recovery against the Company by the Assured shall be had hereunder until the amount of loss or expense shall have been finally determined either by judgment against the Assured after actual trial or by written agreement * * *.\u201d\nHeld: (1) Appellant was a \u201cperson within Ontario\u201d and was \u201cindebted to the judgment debtor,\u201d within the meaning of R. 590 of the Ontario Rules of Court. By above quoted clause (F), appellant impliedly agreed that the insured would be entitled to recover on the policy when the legal liability against which she had been insured was determined as to amount by a judgment against her after trial. The amount of her loss in this case having been determined by judgment, the right of the insured to recover that amount under the policy could no longer be disputed by appellant. Appellant was, therefore, under obligation to pay a fixed and definite sum to the insured at the time the attaching order was made.\n(2) The fact that the policy was not issued in Ontario or received by the insured in Ontario was immaterial, in view of the fact that the agreement to indemnify was expressly made to cover loss incurred by the insured when operating her automobile in Canada.\n(3) The debt was attachable in Ontario.\n(4) Appellant\u2019s contention that the evidence put in did not, as against it, amount to proof of legal liability on F.\u2019s part for the damage caused by the accident, in that the judgment recovered was not evidence that the damage was caused by her negligence (Continental Casualty Co. v. Yorke, [1930] Can. S.C.R. 180), was not open on this appeal, as it had not been raised in the courts below.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Ont., [1931] O.R. 342, holding respondent entitled to recover against appellant, affirmed, subject to a slight variation as to amount. APPEAL by the defendant garnishee from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], which (reversing the judgment of Jeffrey J.) held that the present respondent (plaintiff) was entitled to recover against the present appellant (garnishee), in an issue which had been directed in certain garnishment proceedings.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported, and are indicated in the above head-note. The appeal was dismissed with costs, with a slight variation (in reduction) of the amount.\nR.S. Robertson K.C. and T.J. Rigney K.C. for the appellant.\nA.B. Cunningham K.C. for the respondent.\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014I concur in the judgment of my brother Lamont dismissing this appeal. In fact, the only difficulty I have had in connection with this case arises from the decision of this Court in Continental Casualty Co. v. Yorke[2], where a somewhat similar appeal was dismissed on the ground that\nthe defendant, to escape liability under the condition, must shew that the boy was driving with the knowledge, consent or connivance of S., and this it had failed to do. Such consent could not be presumed as against the plaintiff by reason of the judgment obtained by plaintiff against S.; it did not necessarily follow that because judgment was given against S., the latter had any knowledge that her son was driving her automobile, or that she consented thereto.\nThis case, however, I am inclined to regard as sui generis\u2014un arr\u00eat d\u2019esp\u00e8ce, and it should not be allowed to govern in the case now before us. Indeed, in my opinion, it is too clear to admit of argument to the contrary that the appellant was bound by the judgment against Anna Fitzgerald, both as to the fact of her liability and the amount thereof.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ. (Anglin C.J.C. also concurring therein) was delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014Two questions arise in this appeal:\n1. Are the appellants \u201ca person within Ontario indebted to the judgment debtor\u201d Anna Fitzgerald, within the meaning of Rule 590 of the Ontario Rules of Court? and\n2. If so, is that indebtedness attachable by the respondent to satisfy in whole or in part his judgment?\nOn or about May 23, 1928, the appellants, in consideration of the premiums therein stated, issued in the United States a policy of automobile liability insurance to Anna Fitzgerald, an American subject, by which they agreed to indemnify her against loss by reason of her legal liability to pay damages to others,\n(a) For bodily injuries to the extent of $5,000, and\n(b) damages to property to the extent of $1,000, arising out of the ownership, operation or use of her automobile within the United States of America or the Dominion of Canada.\nOn October 5, 1928, Miss Fitzgerald, in operating her automobile near Kingston in the province of Ontario (a friend of hers at her request being at the wheel), collided with another automobile belonging to the respondent with the result that the respondent was seriously injured and his car badly damaged. He brought an action for damages against Miss Fitzgerald in the Ontario courts for the injuries received by him and the damage done to his car, and, on November 26, 1929, recovered judgment against her for $8,000 and costs. The $8,000 was made up as follows: $829 damages to his car, and the balance for personal injuries suffered by himself. The costs were, on December 2, 1929, taxed at $495.60, and were, by the judgment, made payable forthwith after taxation. The respondent immediately issued execution on his judgment, but the sheriff made a return of nulla bona to the writ. The respondent, on December 31, 1929, obtained from the local judge at Kingston, Ontario, an order attaching all debts owing or accruing due from the appellants to the judgment debtor, Anna Fitzgerald, under the above mentioned policy, which was still in force. On February 24, 1930, a further order was made:\u2014\nthat the Judgment Creditor and the Garnishee do proceed to trial of an issue to settle what amount if any the Garnishee must pay to the Judgment Creditor on account of the aforesaid judgment dated the 26th day of November, 1929.\nPleadings on both sides were delivered. The appellants rested their defence upon their refusal to admit the allega- tions contained in the statement of claim, and the following two paragraphs:\u2014\n3. This Defendant pleads that if there was a contract of insurance issued by this Defendant to the Defendant Anna Fitzgerald, which this Defendant does not admit, such contract of insurance was not issued in the Province of Ontario by this Defendant nor was it received in the Province of Ontario by the Defendant Anna Fitzgerald.\n4. This Defendant further pleads that if there is a debt owing by this Defendant to the Defendant Anna Fitzgerald, which this Defendant does not admit, such debt is not subject to attachment in the Province of Ontario.\nAt the trial of the issue the respondent put in evidence the policy of insurance of the appellant to Anna Fitzgerald; his judgment for $8,000, and costs, and the certificate of taxation. He then put in the deposition of Anna Fitzgerald in which she admitted the collision on October 5, 1928; that action had been brought against her by the respondent; that she was present at the trial and that judgment had been given against her as a result thereof for $8,000 and costs; that no part of the judgment had been paid and that, at the time of the accident, she carried liability insurance on her automobile with the appellants. She was not asked in so many words if the judgment obtained against her was on account of personal injuries received by the respondent and damage to his car caused by her automobile through the negligence of her driver or herself, but that, in our opinion, was the basis upon which her examination proceeded, and all parties so understood it, and the appellants, in their defence, did not allege otherwise. Apart from that, however, the respondent testified that the judgment recovered was in respect of $829 damage to his car, and the balance in respect of personal injuries to himself, as the result of the collision.\nThe respondent also called R.W. Warwick, Senior Actuarial Examiner of the Department of Insurance, Ottawa, who testified that, on March 23, 1929, the appellants were licensed to carry on the business of Accident, Burglary, Automobile and other insurance in the province of Ontario, and that the head office of the company for the province was at 15 Toronto street, Toronto. He also testified that, according to the annual statement filed by the appellants with the Department of Insurance at Ottawa, as required by law, the appellants, on December 31, 1929, had assets in Ontario amounting to $26,367.74, in the form of money deposited in the Dominion Bank at Toronto; they had also $388,000 of assets deposited with the Receiver General of Canada for the protection of Canadian policy holders. The appellants tendered no evidence.\nThe trial judge found the issue in favour of the appellants, holding that the insurance moneys could not be attached, as the defendant\u2019s claim against the appellants under the policy was merely a claim for unliquidated damages and not a debt due or accruing due. On appeal, the first Appellate Division[3] reversed the trial judge and entered judgment for the respondent for $6,000, the amount of the policy, with interest thereon at 5% from November 26, 1929; and for $495 for taxed costs, together with the costs of the issue and appeal. The appellants now appeal to this court.\nWith the exception of a slight variation to which reference will later be made, the judgment of the first Appellate Division, in our opinion, is well founded.\nRule of Court 590 reads in part as follows:\u2014\n(1) The Court, upon the ex parte application of the judgment creditor, upon affidavit stating that the judgment is unsatisfied and\n(a) that some person within Ontario is indebted to the judgment debtor, or\n(b) * * * *\nmay order that all debts owing or accruing from such third person (hereinafter called the garnishee) to the judgment debtor, shall be attached to answer the judgment debt.\nThat the appellants constituted \u201ca person within Ontario\u201d when the attaching order was served upon them seems to admit of no doubt. As pointed out by the court below, section 31 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.O., 1927, ch. 1, declares that a \u201cperson\u201d includes a body corporate or politic, which the appellants are. They were then doing business in Ontario with a provincial head office there and with considerable sums of money on deposit in a bank in the province. We, therefore, see no reason why they cannot properly be designated \u201ca person within Ontario\u201d within the meaning of the rule.\nThen were they indebted to the judgment debtor, Anna Fitzgerald? Under the contract of insurance the appellants agreed to indemnify Anna Fitzgerald against loss by reason of her legal liability to pay damages for injuries caused to a person or his property arising out of the use of her automobile in the Dominion of Canada, and to pay the costs taxed against her in any legal proceedings to enforce a claim therefor. They did more, they fixed the time when recovery under the policy might be had, by inserting in the policy the following clause:\u2014\nF. Right of Recovery. No recovery against the Company by the Assured shall be had hereunder until the amount of loss or expense shall have been finally determined either by judgment against the Assured after actual trial or by written agreement of the Assured, the Claimant, and the Company, nor in any event unless suit is instituted within two years thereafter.\nWhether apart from this clause the claim of the insured under the policy would have been a claim for unliquidated damages, it is unnecessary to inquire. By this clause the appellants impliedly agreed that the insured would be entitled to recover on the policy when the legal liability against which she had been insured was determined as to amount by a judgment against her after trial. This, in our opinion, is the meaning which the parties intended the clause to bear. The amount of her loss in this case having been determined by judgment, the right of the insured to recover that amount under the policy could no longer be disputed by the appellants. They were, therefore, under obligation to pay a fixed and definite sum to the insured at the time the attaching order was made.\nThis view is not, in our opinion, in conflict with what was held in Luckie v. Bushby[4]. In that case the policy did not contain an express or implied undertaking to pay whatever amount the parties might agree upon as the extent of the loss. Their agreement, therefore, as to the amount at which the loss should be adjusted was only evidence by which to fix the amount for which judgment should be given.\nA somewhat similar case came before this court in Melukhova v. The Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corporation[5], where the court held that, under garnishee proceedings taken under the Rules of Practice of the province of Quebec, the obligation of the garnishee to pay the insurance money under a policy of indemnity, constituted an indebtedness, although, under the facts of that case, it was only a conditional one. That the contract of insurance was not issued in Ontario, or received by the insured in that province, is, in our opinion, immaterial in view of the fact that the agreement to indemnify was, by express provision, made to cover loss incurred by the insured when operating her automobile in the Dominion of Canada.\nThe only other defence set up was that, if the appellants were indebted to Anna Fitzgerald, such debt was not attachable in the province of Ontario. Since the appellants are a \u201cperson within Ontario\u201d and the claim of Anna Fitzgerald to the insurance moneys constitutes a present indebtedness, the attachment, it seems to us, comes squarely within the rule.\nOn the argument before us Mr. Robertson for the appellants took the point that the evidence put in on behalf of the respondent did not, as against the appellants, amount to proof of legal liability on the part of Anna Fitzgerald for the damage caused by the accident, in that, the judgment recovered was not evidence that the damage was caused by her negligence, and he cited Continental Casualty Company v. Yorke[6]. Mr. Cunningham for the respondent, however, stated that this point was not raised either before the trial judge or the Appellate Division, but that before these courts the whole issue between the parties was whether the claim for indemnity under the policy constituted a claim for debt or one for liquidated damages, and, if for a debt, was it attachable in Ontario? That this was so would appear from the judgment of the Appellate Division, written by Mr. Justice Hodgins, in which we find the following:\u2014\nThe only question therefore to be determined is whether at the date of the attaching order there was a debt, and if there was whether that debt is attachable here in Ontario.\nThe parties having fought out the issue before both courts below on these grounds and having taken it for granted that the respondent\u2019s judgment against Anna Fitzgerald determined the measure of the appellants\u2019 liability to her under the policy, the appellants are bound by the manner in which they have conducted their case.\nThe first Appellate Division gave judgment for $6,000 and interest, and costs of $495.60, together with the costs of the issue and of the appeal. We think there was a slight oversight in these figures: the judgment recovered by the respondent for damage to his car was only $829, and the liability of the appellants under the policy for personal injuries is limited to $5,000. The appellants\u2019 total liability under these two items is, therefore, $5,829, instead of $6,000. With this slight variation we would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, with a slight variation in amount of the judgment.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Rigney & Hickey.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Cunningham & Smith.\n[1] [1931] O.R. 342; [1931] 3 D.L.R. 225.\n[2] [1930] Can.

Written reasons were delivered by Smith J., with whom the other members of the Court concurred.\nThis Court disagreed with the ground taken by Maclean J. that, on the interpretation of the said agreement, the only part of the street that the Crown\u2019s covenant to repair related to was the strip occupied by the ties and rails of the railway; but agreed with his opinion that the repair or reconstruction that the City was calling upon the Crown to make did not fall within the terms of the covenant. What the City had constructed (originally about 1857, with subsequent repairs) was not simply a roadway but a structure that was to be combined so as to form a wharf and a roadway, the latter superimposed upon the wharf; the specifications for the original construction indicated that the construction of the wharf was at least a main part of the undertaking. The wording of the agreement now in question referred, in this Court\u2019s opinion, only to repair of the road. The part of the structure that was out of repair and which the Crown was being called on to repair, was the timber of the perpendicular face of the wharf, the decay and destruction of which, it was said, would in time result in destruction and consequent non-repair of part of the street. The agreement, however, imposes liability to repair the street and says nothing about the wharf, and, in the Court\u2019s opinion, does not impose any liability to maintain the street in the sense contended for. The cases of Sandgate Urban District Council v. County Council of Kent[2] and Reigate Corporation v. Surrey County Council[3], relied on by appellant, were discussed, and it was held that what was decided in those cases did not amount to authority for appellant\u2019s contention here. The judgment of the Lord Chancellor in the Sandgate case2, at p. 427, was quoted from, and it was pointed out that, in the view there taken, it was the duty to \u201cmaintain\u201d that imposed the liability; that in the present case there was no contract to \u201cmaintain,\u201d the agreement being merely to keep the portion of the street in proper repair. In the said two cases referred to, the words \u201cmaintenance and repair\u201d of the road were given a meaning wider than their express meaning so as to make them include \u201cmaintenance and repair\u201d of a structure, found as a fact not to be part of the road. This was evidently arrived at as a proper inference to be drawn from the circumstances and conditions, and was outside of the express language. In the present case the court was asked to construe the express language used so as to impose by inference a liability not expressly imposed by the language of the agreement. There was nothing in the conditions existing at the time or in the surrounding circumstances calling for extending the language of the agreement beyond its express and literal meaning. On the contrary, those conditions and circumstances indicated that the parties never contemplated, at the time, that the Crown was to be made Hable for the repairs in question. The term in the agreement giving the City the right to cancel the licence to use the street and compel the removal of the railway tracks at any time on 60 days\u2019 notice, strengthened this view; also the specific provision, in another agreement between the same parties made two years later (by which the City granted to the Government Railway the right to lay a spur along the same street on Ballast Wharf), as to repairs of the wharf structure in addition to the provision for repairs of the street, was another circumstance indicating that the parties did not regard repairs to the street as including repairs to the wharf.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nA.

On the 29th of May, 1929, the appellant company took out a policy of insurance with the respondent company insuring a seaplane for $19,650, ten per cent deducted, against certain specified perils. On July 13, 1929, the managing director of the appellant company, a pilot and a mechanic flew the machine to Lac Ouimet, some 65 miles from Montreal, and there decided to land. In attempting to land, the machine was wrecked and totally destroyed. The appellant company made a claim for the full amount of the insurance, less ten per cent deductible and the cost of salvage. The respondent company denied any liability under its policy on the ground that the flight which resulted in the loss of the plane had been made contrary to government regulations, which fact constituted a direct violation of the warranties contained in the policy, and on the further ground that the aircraft was not airworthy.\nThe trial judge held that the appellant company had established its claim to the extent of $14,185; but that judgment was unanimously reversed by the appellate court and the action was dismissed.\nAfter hearing the arguments of counsel, the Court reserved judgment, and on a subsequent day delivered judgment, dismissing the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nH.

MOTIONS by way of appeal, in each case, from an order of the Registrar affirming the jurisdiction of this Court to hear an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, in the one case affirming the granting, at trial, of a decree nisi in an action against the appellant for divorce, and in the other case affirming the dismissal of the appellant\u2019s action for alimony. In each case the Court of Appeal for Ontario granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nR.H. Wilson for the motions.\nO.M. Biggar, K.C., contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014These are two motions made by the (defendant) appellant in the first action, and (plaintiff) appellant in the second action, by way of appeal from an order of the Registrar affirming the jurisdiction of this Court to hear appeals from the judgments, in two matrimonial causes, of the Court of Appeal for Ontario. In the first action the husband sued the wife and two co-respondents for divorce and was successful in maintaining his action. This judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal. In the second case, the wife sued for alimony and her action was dismissed by the trial judge, whose judgment was also affirmed by the Court of Appeal. In both cases the wife is the appellant here.\nWe are of the opinion that there is jurisdiction in this Court to entertain the appeal in the alimony action from the judgment of the appellate court; but, in regard to the divorce action, it is quite different. The only judgment pronounced so far in that action is that pronounced by the trial judge, affirmed on appeal, whereby it is provided that\nThis Court doth order and adjudge that the marriage had and solemnized on the 24th day of February, A.D. 1915, at the city of Toronto, in the county of York and province of Ontario, between George Wesley Harris, the above-named plaintiff, and Marian J. Harris, one of the above-named defendants, then Marian J. Cheyne, be dissolved by reason that since the celebration thereof the said Marian J. Harris, one of the defendants, has been guilty of adultery, unless sufficient cause be shown to the Court why this judgment should not be made absolute within six months from the making thereof.\nIt is obvious that this is not a final judgment and cannot become such until the order is made absolute by the court. Many things may intervene before that takes place which would prevent the court from making the decree absolute, viz., collusion may later be established, or the defendant may have further evidence to offer when the application to make the order absolute is presented to the court.\nAt all events, until the decree nisi is made \u201cabsolute\u201d there can be no appeal to this court from it. Nor can there be a right of appeal from its affirmation by the Court of Appeal to this Court, inasmuch as only final judgments of that court are appealable here; and, in our opinion, an order nisi, such as that now before us, cannot be regarded as a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within s. 2(b) of the Supreme Court Act. It does not\ndetermine(s) in whole or in part any substantive right of any of the parties in controversy in (this) judicial proceeding.\nThus, the wife cannot re-marry, nor can the husband, under the present order. They are still husband and wife, unless and until the order shall be made absolute. The dissolution of marriage under the terms of the order itself becomes effective only when the order or judgment is made absolute; and this is so for all purposes.\nThe motion by way of appeal from the Registrar will, therefore, be granted as to the divorce action, and refused as to the alimony action. Under the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs.\nMotion granted as to the divorce action, and refused as to the alimony action.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McLarty & Fraser.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Wilson & Thomson.\n",

The action was brought by a firm of solicitors against the defendant as executor of the will of Mrs. McMillan, deceased, for payment of a bill of costs for alleged services in conducting certain litigation for the said deceased. The defendant denied that the deceased retained the plaintiffs to act for her in the said litigation. The trial judge, McEvoy J., gave judgment for the plaintiffs, which was reversed by the Court of Appeal[1].\nOn the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing the arguments of counsel, the Court reserved judgment, and on a subsequent day delivered judgment allowing the appeal with costs and restoring the judgment of the trial judge. Written reasons were delivered by Duff J., with whom Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ. concurred, and by Cannon J.\nDuff J. held that it was clear that Mrs. McMillan\u2019s husband had made himself responsible at each stage of the litigation, and had fully committed himself in respect of the appellants\u2019 bills; the one point was whether or not Mrs. McMillan herself, who was the real litigant, was bound. There was no formal retainer by her nor anything personally communicated by her to the appellants which, in itself, could have amounted to a retainer of the appellants by her. But her husband was the general manager of her property in Windsor, and there was evidence also to shew that she was aware that the litigation was proceeding on her account and necessarily, therefore, aware that her husband was interesting himself in it. She gave a bond for security for costs, paid one of the accounts with her own cheque, and there was abundant evidence that accounts sent to her were received, because they were brought in later by her husband. The appellants were for a long period collecting rents and crediting the amounts to the expense of litigation; and in the defence a counterclaim was set up alleging that appellants had received as solicitors for Mrs. McMillan certain monies and did not pay them, or account for them, to her, and asking for an account. There was the series of actual occasions on which the appellants acted in the most open way, and to her specific knowledge, as her solicitors; in other words, there was a ratification of the acts of her husband in retaining the appellants, as he undoubtedly did, on her behalf. The application for leave to appeal to the Privy Council, opposed by appellants on her behalf, was in the litigation in respect of which most of the bills were rendered; the party to the litigation was Mrs. McMillan who was the owner of the property concerned; her husband very properly applied for assistance from the Essex Border Utilities Commission in the cost of carrying on the litigation; the sum proposed to be advanced by the Commission was not regarded as anything like the whole of the costs. It was very clearly proved that Mrs. McMillan permitted her husband, in the course of managing her affairs on the Canadian side of the line, to act for her in legal matters. She had, by her conduct, put it entirely beyond her power to dispute her husband\u2019s authority to act as her agent in giving instructions in reference to legal matters to the appellants.\nCANNON J. held that there was no doubt that Mr. McMillan requested appellants to oppose the petition for leave to appeal before the Privy Council. Mrs. McMillan, before and after, certainly held out her husband as her agent for everything connected with the property in question. If, in fact, no agency existed, her husband, now her executor, should have sworn to that effect, but had not done so. The trial judge was right in maintaining the action.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nG.F. Henderson K.C. for the appellants.\nJ.B.

The Registrar had allowed a separate bill of costs to each of three groups of respondents. Each group had been represented by a separate firm of solicitors. Appellant objected to such allowance on the grounds: (1) The interest of all said respondents on the appeal was the same; (2) Only one joint factum was filed by them (only one fee on factum was taxed and only one allowance made on printing of factum, which costs were divided equally among the groups); (3) All said respondents were represented by one Ottawa agent, which agent had presented the three separate bills for taxation.\nHeld (Rinfret J. in chambers), that there was no ground for interfering with the Registrar\u2019s taxation.\nAPPLICATION by way of appeal from the allowance by the Registrar of a separate bill of costs to each of three groups of respondents, in the appeal before this Court[1].\nCuthbert Scott for the appellant.\nStanley M. Clark and E.H. Charleson for the respondents.\nRINFRET J. (in chambers)\u2014This is an application by way of appeal from the decision of the Registrar of this Court, upon the taxation of the bills of costs of the respondents, in respect of the allowance by the Registrar of separate sets of costs to each of three groups of respondents.\nBefore the Registrar, the appellant objected to the allowance of a separate bill of costs to each of the three groups of respondents for the following reasons: 1. The interest of all these respondents on this appeal was identical, all that was at stake before the court being the validity of the will dated October 4, 1930, in which question the interest of each of the groups of respondents was the same;\n2. Only one joint factum was filed by the respondents (other than the Official Guardian). The appellant submits that it follows accordingly that the respondents were as one party before the court, at the hearing, and that only one bill of costs can properly be presented for taxation;\n3. All the respondents were represented by one Ottawa agent, which agent has presented three separate bills for taxation on behalf of the allegedly separate respondents.\nThere were other objections mentioned in the notice filed before the Registrar, but they were not pressed on the appeal before me.\nI know of no law or rule\u2014and none was cited to me\u2014which compels persons who have different shares in an estate to appear by the same solicitor because their interest, as regards their opposition to the claim of the plaintiff, may be identical. (See Remnant v. Hood[2].)\nIn this case there were three separate firms of solicitors representing the three separate groups of respondents, and the rights of these groups to retain the services of the respective firms of solicitors may not be disputed.\nIt is a fact that only one factum was filed by the three groups of respondents. As a result, only one fee on factum was taxed and only one allowance was made by the Registrar on the printing of factum; and the fee and the cost of printing were equally divided between the three groups of respondents. This had the effect of reducing the total costs; but I fail to agree that, just because, for the sake of convenience, several respondents elect to join in their factum, it should follow that they are to be deprived of their right to a separate bill of costs. Still less, do I think that the sole fact that the respondents were represented by one Ottawa agent may affect their right in that respect.\nThe judgment of this Court, when dismissing the appeal, was \u201cthat the costs of all parties in this Court will be paid out of the said Estate\u201d; and, in my view, the result is that each party separately and properly represented before this Court is entitled to the taxation of his bill of costs. Whether, under the circumstances, there should have been given only one set of costs was a question for the court, when pronouncing its judgment, and is not a question for the taxing officer, who has only to give effect to the order upon costs, as adjudicated by the court. The point now raised by the appellant should have been taken, if at all, by speaking to the minutes of judgment.\nI find no ground for interfering with the taxation made by the Registrar, and I therefore dismiss the application by way of appeal, with costs. However, on the present application, as all the respondents were represented by one counsel, there will be only one set of costs to them.\nApplication by way of appeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] The judgment in the main appeal to this Court is reported ante, p. 407.\n[2] (1860) 27 Beavan, 613, at 614.\n",

In July, 1926, he paid another sum of $2,700.\nThe agreement contained a provision that unless the payments were punctually made \u201cthese presents shall be null and void and of no effect and vendor shall be at liberty to re-sell the said lands and all payments heretofore made are to be forfeited to the vendor as liquidated damages.\u201d\nIn May, 1927, the plaintiff sued, alleging default by defendant in payment of interest and taxes, and claimed recovery of possession of the land and cancellation of the agreement. In August, 1927, the plaintiff entered into an agreement to sell the land to other parties.\nThe defendant delivered his defence in October, 1927, and counterclaimed for repayment to him of all amounts paid on account of the alleged contract together with interest thereon.\nThat action came on for trial before McEvoy J. McEvoy J.[2], in his judgment, said that he was satisfied that the property was one of highly speculative value, and that the peculiar wording of the forfeiture clause was made for the purpose of providing what the parties considered would be a fair amount to be forfeited if the defendant should fail to carry out the agreement; and refused to relieve the defendant from the forfeiture of the cash payment of $2,700, in the circumstances revealed in the evidence. He gave judgment for the plaintiff for possession of the land and for a declaration that under the terms of the agreement the same had become null and void and of no effect. He held that the defendant was entitled to recover all amounts paid by him in excess of the sum of $2,700 together with interest thereon at 5% per annum from the date of the sale by the plaintiff to the other parties above referred to. He refused to make any allowance to the defendant for alleged improvements to the property, but did not charge him with any occupation rent.\nThe plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Division against the judgment of McEvoy J., in so far as he held defendant entitled to recover any sum from the plaintiff. The defendant cross\u2011appealed, asking that the amount awarded him by the judgment be increased to the whole amount paid by him with interest.\nThe Appellate Division, without written reasons, allowed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, and dismissed the defendant\u2019s cross-appeal.\nThe defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which[3] allowed his appeal to the extent of restoring the judgment of the trial judge.\nOn March 22, 1930, the plaintiff brought the present action, claiming damages in the sum of $2,500 for loss on re-sale of the property, the sum of $500 spent in repairing the premises and for interest thereon, and the sum of $114 paid by plaintiff for overdue taxes and for interest thereon.\nThe action was dismissed by Garrow J.[4], whose judgment was sustained by the Appellate Division4. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nBy the judgment now reported the appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nJ.H. Rodd K.C. and Roy Rodd for the appellant.\nS.L. Springsteen for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLAMONT, J.\u2014We are of opinion that the action in the present case has resulted from a misunderstanding of what had been held by the trial judge, Mr. Justice McEvoy, in a former action between the parties. That action was for cancellation of an agreement for the sale of land and possession, by reason of the defendant\u2019s default in the payment of interest and taxes. The defendant counterclaimed for the return of the instalments of purchase money paid. The agreement contained the following clause:\nAnd it is expressly understood that time is to be considered the essence of this agreement and unless the payments are punctually made at the time and in the manner above mentioned these presents shall be null and void and of no effect and vendor shall be at liberty to re-sell the said lands and all payments heretofore made are to be forfeited to the vendor as liquidated damages.\nThere had been a previous agreement for the sale of the property for $12,500, with a cash payment of $2,500; but the purchaser, on surveying the property, found that an additional ten feet was necessary to include all the house. This ten feet was purchased for $1,000, $200 cash, and the balance in four payments. The parties agreed that the present agreement should be substituted for the former one.\nIn his judgment Mr. Justice McEvoy said:\u2014\nUnder the terms of the agreement the defendant covenanted with the plaintiff, and the plaintiff covenanted with the defendant, that if the defendant should not make his payments promptly, that he should forfeit the cash payment of $2,700. Or in the words of the agreement dated the 26th of June, 1925, it was agreed that the plaintiff should be at liberty to sell the said lands, and all payments \u201cheretofore\u201d made are to be forfeited to the vendor as liquidated damages.\nI am not overlooking the law that this might be considered as a penalty, and that the damages ought to be assessed independently of the amount named in the forfeiture clause; but I am satisfied that the property was a property of highly speculative value, and that the peculiar wording of the clause was made for the purpose of providing what the parties considered would be a fair amount to be forfeited if the defendant should fail to carry out the agreement.\nThat judgment was affirmed by this court[5].\nIn the present action the plaintiff claims:\n(a) damages in the sum of $2,500 for loss on the resale of the property;\n(b) $500 spent in repairing the premises;\n(c) interest and taxes which, in the agreement, the defendant covenanted to pay.\nIn opening the present case at the trial counsel for the plaintiff said:\u2014\nWe are assisting your Lordship to this extent that we are putting in the appeal case in the action between the same parties as containing the evidence of the respective parties and the exhibits referred to in the appeal case, subject to either one calling such further witnesses as they may be advised.\nand he closed the plaintiff\u2019s case without putting in any new evidence.\nThe claims now made by the plaintiff were all before the court in the former case. They were not all claimed directly as specific relief to which the plaintiff would be entitled upon the cancellation of the contract, but, it is admitted, they were all urged as separate reasons why the second payment of $2,700 should not be returned to the defendant. This court decided against the plaintiff\u2019s contention. These claims, therefore, cannot now be made the subject of another action.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Rodd, Wigle, Whiteside & Jasperson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McTague, Clark, Springsteen, Racine & Spencer.\n[1] [1932] O.R. 29.\n[2] (1928) 38 Ont.

The residuary legatee and testamentary executors of G., deceased, sued to set aside a transfer of bank shares made by G., by way of gift, to defendant, about 8 months before G.'s death. At the time of the gift, G. was a man of 85, and defendant a woman of about 50, years of age. For some years they had been very friendly and intimate, and G. had several times proposed marriage to her. They had undertaken together the purchase of some property. About a month after the gift in ques- tion, G. gave her a general power of attorney and signed blank cheques, but these were never used. About 9 days before his death G. made his last will, the defendant not being present, which made no mention of the shares. There was no finding of any fraudulent or wrongful act or any deliberate exercise of undue influence on defendant's part; and the questions for determination were: whether there existed between them a relation of such a nature as would raise the presumption that defendant had influence over G. of such a kind that the court, acting on such presumption, would set aside the gift unless defendant established that in fact the gift was G.'s spontaneous act, in circumstances which enabled him to exercise an independent will, and which justified the court in holding that the gift was the result of a free exercise of his will; and, if there was such a relation as would raise the presumption, whether the presumption had been rebutted. The trial judge, Ewing J. (5 Alta. L.R. 562), set aside the gift. His judgment was reversed (two judges dissenting) by the Appellate Division, Alta. (ibid). On appeal to this Court:\nHeld (Duff and Lamont JJ. dissenting), that the judgment of the Appellate Division in defendant's favour should be affirmed.\nThe nature of the relationships giving rise to the presumption against a donee; the discharging of the onus of rebutting the presumption; the governing considerations; the materiality, weight and effect of certain circumstances; acquiescence or ratification by subsequent conduct of the donor; laches, etc., discussed.\nPer Rinfret and Smith JJ.: It is not the law that any relation of confidence between a donor and a donee is sufficient to raise the presumption. The presumption does not extend to cases of relationship resulting from pure friendship, even though the friendship were of such a character that the donor reposed confidence and trust in the donee. In the present case, the only relationship established was one of deep affection and of the high regard in which G. held defendant. This affection in itself afforded a satisfactory explanation of the motive which prompted the gift. But, assuming that the relationship was such as to raise the presumption, it was rebutted by the facts and circumstances in evidence.\nPer Cannon J.: While the relationship, which was one implying special confidence, was such as to raise the presumption, it had been rebutted. Moreover, the lapse of time during which G., when free from any influence of defendant, allowed the transaction to stand, and the other circumstances in the case, proved his determination to abide by what he had done.\nPer Duff J. (dissenting): The relationship was such that, by reason thereof, it must be inferred from the facts in evidence that, in transactions with defendant, G. was not under the control of his own judgment; and the onus rested on defendant to shew that, in the matter of the gift in question, G. was entirely free from this influence; and that onus was not discharged. There was not adequate evidence to warrant a finding that G., after he became free (if he was ever wholly free) from defendant's influence, deliberately and spontaneously confirmed the gift.\nPer Lamont J. (dissenting): The facts in evidence shewed the existence of such a relationship as raised the presumption. The onus was on defendant to establish that the transfer was made to her for her own benefit and was the spontaneous act of G.'s independent will; and this onus was not discharged. Without entirely disregarding defendant's testimony, effect should not be given to it unless it was corroborated by independent evidence. The evidence was not sufficient to establish, by G.'s subsequent conduct, any deliberate and intentional affirmance of the transfer.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1].\nThe action was brought by the residuary legatee, and by the executors, named in the will of one Goddard, deceased, to set aside a transfer, made by the deceased by way of gift, to the defendant of 44 shares of bank stock, it being alleged that at the time of the transfer the defendant stood in a confidential relationship to the deceased, that the deceased did not receive any independent advice and that he was induced to make the gift by the undue influence of defendant.\nThe trial judge, Ewing J.[2], gave judgment setting aside the transfer. His judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division (1) (Clarke and Lunney, J.J.A., dissenting).\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs, Duff and Lamont JJ. dissenting.\nA. Macleod Sinclair K.C. and A. B. Clow for the appellants.\nC. S. Blanchard K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Smith JJ. was delivered by\nRINFRET, J.\u2014The action is brought by the testamentary executors of the late G. M. Goddard, of Medicine Hat, in the province of Alberta, to have declared null and void and set aside a transfer by way of gift to the respondent of certain shares of stock in the Bank of Nova Scotia. It was admitted that there was no consideration passing from the respondent to Goddard.\nThe trial judge found that the transfer \"was in fact a gift\"; and the correctness of that finding cannot be seriously disputed. There is no evidence to support the contention that the shares were given to the respondent as trustee for the estate, or that an actual trust was created under either an express or an implied contract. The attack made upon the gift was based on two grounds; mental incapacity of the donor, and undue influence of the donee.\nThe ground of mental incapacity of the donor may be excluded at once. It was not entertained by the trial judge nor by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, and it was not pressed by the appellants before this court.\nIt remains to consider the ground of undue influence.\nThe evidence does not bring this case within the group of cases mentioned by Lindley L.J., in Allcard v. Skinner[3], \"in which there has been some unfair and improper conduct, some coercion from outside.\" We have here no finding of fraudulent or deliberate exercise of undue influence. As a matter of fact, the trial judge negatived any suggestion \"that the defendant was guilty of any wrongful act.\" There was no evidence whatever of undue influence leading to the gift; or, to borrow the expression of Cotton L.J., in Allcard v. Skinner[4], \"that the gift was the result of influence expressly used by the donee for the purpose.\"\nThen, there is another class of cases \"in which the position of the donor to the donee has been such that it has been the duty of the donee to advise the donor, or even to manage his property for him.\" Instances of these would be the position of solicitor to client, trustee to cestui que trust, guardian to ward; that of husband and wife, or of parent and child. In those instances, where the donor relies on the donee for guidance and advice, the doctrine of equity, as expounded in Huguenin v. Baseley [5] and such other cases, intervenes on the principle of presumed undue influence and introduces the rule that, while fiduciary relations of that character exist between donor and donee, it is, generally speaking, impossible to rebut the presumption, unless the donor had competent and independent advice.\nBut that is not the present case. It was not found here that the deceased relied on the respondent for advice of any kind or in relation to his business.\nOther relations from the existence of which the courts have presumed the exercise of undue influence are those of spiritual adviser and devotee, medical attendant and patient, principal and agent; and also, in special cases, that of a man to a woman to whom he is engaged to be married. (See: Halsbury, Laws of England, vol. 15, p. 107, no. 215).\nIn the present case, however, the learned trial judge appears to have considered that any relation of confidence between a donor and a donee is sufficient to raise a presumption of undue influence; to put it in his own words: \"that the relations between the deceased and the defendant (respondent) * * * raised a presumption that the donee had influence over the donor\"; and, for that reason, he reached the conclusion that the action should be maintained. We do not agree with that view of the law.\nThe doctrines of equity do not require that the principle and the rule should be extended to relationship resulting from pure friendship, even were the friendship of such a character that the donor reposed confidence and trust in the donee. As said by Fletcher Moulton, L.J., in Coomber v. Coomber[6]: \"The nature of the fiduciary relation must be such that it justifies the interference.\"\nIn the case at bar, there was no proof of any fiduciary relation so called, nor, in our view, proof of any confidential relationship such as is necessary to raise the presumption of undue influence. The only relationship established was one of deep affection and of the high regard in which the deceased held the respondent. We agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that such affection, in itself, \"provides a good reason\" for the gift and affords a satisfactory explanation of the motive which prompted the donor to make it.\nBut, even if we should assume that the relationship in the premises was such as to raise any presumption, we think the facts and circumstances established in the case were sufficient completely to rebut the presumption. As found by the trial judge, the respondent \"placed before the court frankly and, as far as (he) could judge, fully all the relevant facts in her possession.\" The learned judge accepted her story, but thought apparently that he was precluded from \"taking her evidence into account\" and that \"the gift must be established by separate and inde- pendent evidence,\" and so he \"felt bound\" to set aside the transfer of the shares.\nWe do not think the proposition put thus absolutely may be stated as a rule of law (See: Koop v. Smith[7]; Fowkes v. Pascoe[8]); nor does that result flow from the provision in the statute of Alberta (s. 12 of c. 87, R.S.A., 1922), invoked by the appellants' counsel, which reads as follows:\nIn an action by or against the heirs, next of kin, executors, administrators, or assigns of a deceased person, an opposite or interested party shall not obtain a verdict, judgment or decision, on his own evidence, in respect of any matter occurring before the death of the deceased person, unless such evidence is corroborated by some other material evidence.\nIn Thompson v. Coulter[9], this court had to apply the Ontario statute, which is substantially similar, and Killam J., delivering the judgment of the court, remarked (p. 263):\nThe direct testimony of a second witness is unnecessary; the corroboration may be afforded by circumstances. McDonald v. McDonald[10].\nThroughout the record in the present case may be found abundant corroboration of the evidence of the respondent. That corroboration \"confirms the credit not only of the statements which are expressly supported but of all the statements made by her\" (Minister of Stamps v. Town-end[11]). Even were the relationship existing between her and the deceased as contemplated by the decided cases and of a character to raise the presumption of undue influence, we would consider that, at all events, the evidence overbalances the presumption and shows that the gift made to the respondent by the deceased was a spontaneous and voluntary act on his part and \"the result of the free exercise of independent will.\"\nThe judgment of the Appellate Division should be affirmed and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nUnder those circumstances, the application of the respondent for leave to reopen the case and adduce further evidence becomes unnecessary; and the costs of that application should be costs in the appeal. CANNON J.\u2014In my opinion, undue influence might be presumed in this case because the deceased and the respondent stood towards one another in a relationship implying special confidence. The respondent therefore had to prove the fairness of the transaction and she has done so to my satisfaction.\nMoreover, the gift was made in May, 1930, by a man of good business ability, not illiterate nor ignorant, who was not at a disadvantage in relation to it. The donor had already done much for his nephew Bradley; and he was entitled to do what he wished for the future welfare of the respondent, for whom he had a deep regard.\nBefore he made his will in January, 1931, he could have revoked, within a reasonable time, the intention which he had formed and declared in his letter to the bank requesting the transfer of the shares to the respondent. He confirmed his intention first by signing the necessary papers giving effect to the transfer. The appellants admit that the deceased had the testamentary capacity to make a will on the 14th of January, 1931, when he was entirely free to act as he pleased and gave his instructions to the Reverend Mr. Scragg. He then remarked that he had made \"a great and grave mistake about Mrs. Crittenden\"\u2014from whose \"influence\" he had been, and was then, removed during the last few weeks of his life. In my view, the deceased was then content to let the gift stand; he did not even mention the exact nature of the transaction to Reverend Mr. Scragg, who was advising him, nor to the Bradleys with whom he was living. An impeachable transaction may become unimpeachable by reason of ratification after the influence of the \"donee\" has been removed. The lapse of time during which the donor has allowed the transaction to stand, and the other circumstances of the case prove a fixed, deliberate and unbiased determination that the gift should not be impeached\u2014and the persistent will to take these shares out of the estate to avoid complications. Paraphrasing Lord Selborne's words in Mitchell v. Homfray[12], it must be held that whether he knew or not that he had power to retract the gift, he was determined to abide by his acts; this is not a case of mere acquiescence; he determined that he would not undo what he had done. This being the state of facts, I do not think that any authority goes the length of saying that his representatives after his death, can do that, which if he had lived he himself would not have done.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014It is most important, I think, that some aspects of the law should be emphasized. The first branch of the legal rule can be put in this way: If A obtains property by contract or gift, by exercising influence upon B which, in the opinion of the court, prevents B from exercising an independent judgment, then the transaction is bad. With that particular class of case we are not concerned here. The present case belongs rather to those in which the court acts, not upon the proof of actual exercise of undue influence in a particular case, but upon a presumption of law and a rule of public policy. The rule and the presumption may be thus stated: If it be proved that there exists a relation between two persons, A and B, of such a nature as to give rise to a presumption that A possesses over B an influence which may, in operation, deprive him of his independence of judgment, then if, in any transaction B acquires from A property by gift or contract, the court will presume that the transaction has been the result of that influence and will set it aside, unless the donee (because in this case we are concerned with the case of gift) establishes, to the satisfaction of the court\n\"that in fact the gift was the spontaneous act of the donor acting under circumstances which enabled him to exercise an independent will and which justifies the Court in holding that the gift was the result of a free exercise of the donor's will. * * * In the second class of cases the Court interferes, not on the ground that any wrongful act has in fact been committed by the donee, but on the ground of public policy, and to prevent the relations which existed between the parties and the influence arising therefrom being abused.\"\nThe words in quotation marks are taken from the judgment of Cotton, L.J., in Allcard v. Skinner[13], and were explicitly approved by the House of Lords in Inche Noriah v. Shaik Allie Bin Omar[14].\nTwo other things it is important also to note: first, that where the case falls within the second of the classes mentioned, it is immaterial that the donor makes the gift without pressure or solicitation upon the donee, or that the donor perfectly understands the nature of what he is doing, that is, that he is conferring a bounty. Wright v. Vanderplank[15]; Rhodes v. Bate[16]. Effect was given to this in Allcard v. Skinner, where it was conceded that no pressure was exerted[17], except the inevitable pressure of the vows and rules.\nThen, as to the duty of giving advice, that is very far from being the core of the matter. The substance is in the answer to the question, was the gift the result of the act of a person having power to act independently\u2014who, in fact, is independent. The court sets aside the gift unless the court sees that the gift was the result of the independent judgment of the donor.\nI have been quite unable to resist the conclusion, after an examination of all the facts, that the state of influence contemplated by the law in this branch of it did exist. We need not concern ourselves with the greater or less degree of analogy to other cases. I need only mention the case of Rhodes v. Bate[18], in which that great master of equity, Lord Justice Turner, stated that such cases as child and parent, solicitor and client, medical man and patient, were merely instances of the application of the general principle. The primary question that the court ought to ask itself is: should influence of the kind contemplated be presumed? The mere fact that the motive on one side is that of pure affection is immaterial. The principle has been applied to cases of engaged young persons, and of mother and son, brother and sister, sister and sister. As I have already said, it is immaterial that nothing in the nature of solicitation or activity on the part of the beneficiary has been disclosed or exists. It is not material that the whole transaction from beginning to end is free from moral blemish on either side. Rhodes v. Bate (4).\nAs already observed, it cannot properly be laid down that independent legal advice is the only way in which the presumption can be rebutted; \"nor are they prepared to affirm,\" said the Lords of the Judicial Committee in Inche Noriah v. Shaik Allie Bin Omar[19],\nthat independent legal advice, when given, does not rebut the presumption, unless it be shewn that the advice was taken. It is necessary for the donee to prove that the gift was the result of the free exercise of independent will. The most obvious way to prove this is by establishing that the gift was made after the nature and effect of the transaction had been fully explained to the donor by some independent and qualified person so completely as to satisfy the court that the donor was acting independently (of any influence from the donee and with the full appreciation of what he was doing; and in cases where there are no other circumstances this may be the only means by which the donee can rebut the presumption. But the fact to be established is that stated in the judgment already cited of Cotton L.J., and if evidence is given of circumstances sufficient to establish this fact, their Lordships see no reason for disregarding them merely because they do not include independent advice from a lawyer. Nor are their Lordships prepared to lay down what advice must be received in order to satisfy the rule in cases where independent legal advice is relied upon, further than to say that it must be given with a knowledge of all relevant circumstances and must be such as a competent and honest adviser would give if acting solely in the interests of the donor.\nIt should, I think, in the present case, be emphasized that, as their Lordships state, if independent advice is to be given, it must be given with a knowledge of all relevant circumstances, and must be such as a competent and honest adviser would have given if acting solely in the interests of the donor.\nMy conclusion is that, in consequence of the relation between Goddard and the respondent, it must be inferred from the facts in evidence that, in transactions with Mrs. Crittenden, Goddard was not under the control of his own judgment, and that the onus rests upon the respondent to shew that in the matter of the gift in question he was entirely free from this influence. I think she has failed to do that.\nIt seems necessary to say a word as to acquiescence and laches. I am unable to agree that the few words uttered by Goddard during his last illness, coupled with what he did concerning his testamentary dispositions, can be accepted as adequate evidence that after he became free from the influence (if he was ever wholly free from it) of the respondent, he deliberately and spontaneously confirmed the gift. The term \"acquiescence\" is one which is sometimes rather loosely employed. I shall not stop to go through the authorities which illustrate the scope and proper application of the doctrine; because the law, as it affects such cases as this, is stated with perfect accuracy in the following passage from White & Tudor's Leading Cases in Equity[20]:\nDelay in asserting rights cannot be in equity a defence unless the plaintiff knows his rights. In Allcard v. Skinner[21], more than six years had elapsed since the influence had ceased, and the action was commenced, and following the analogy of the Statute of Limitations in actions for money had and received, such delay would be a very material element for consideration. And although delay is not a bar in itself, it is a fact to be considered in determining whether there has been an election on the part of the donor to confirm the gift.\nIn cases of this kind there can be no acquiescence until the donor knows his rights and is free from the influence, but ignorance of his rights which is the result of deliberate choice is no answer to a defence of laches and acquiescence. It is enough for the donee to show that the donor knew he might have rights, and being a free agent at the time, deliberately determined not to inquire what they were or to act upon them.\nI can find no evidence in this case upon which an inference can be founded that Goddard either knew his right to recall the gift, or that he had any suspicion of the existence of such a right, and deliberately chose to remain in ignorance of it. I find nothing to indicate, on his part, a deliberate abstention from enquiry. I should be disposed to ascribe his inaction to the combined effect of lack of knowledge and growing weakness of body and mind.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nLAMONT J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellants, who are the residuary legatee and the executors of the last will of George Moulton Goddard of Medicine Hat, brought this action to set aside a transfer of 44 shares of the capital stock of the Bank of Nova Scotia made by the deceased Goddard to the respondent on or about May 30, 1930. Goddard died on January 23, 1931.\nThe grounds upon which it is sought to set aside the transfer are: that there was no consideration therefor; that the parties stood in a confidential relation one to the other, and that the transfer was induced by undue influence.\nThe principle upon which courts act in cases in this kind was laid down by the Court of Appeal in Allcard v. Skinner[22]; and by the Privy Council in Inche Noriah v. Shaik Allie Bin Omar[23], and, as set out in the head-note of the latter case, is as follows:\u2014\nWhere the relations between a donor and donee raise a presumption that the donee had influence over the donor, the court will set aside the gift unless the donee establishes that it was the spontaneous act of the donor acting in circumstances which enabled him to exercise an independent will, and which justified the court in holding that it was the result of a free exercise of the donor's will. In such a case the court interferes, not on the ground that any wrongful act has in fact been committed by the donee, but on the ground of public policy and to prevent the relation which exists between the parties and the influence arising therefrom being abused. In fact, courts have gone so far as to set aside gifts made to persons in a position to exercise undue influence over the donors, although there was no proof of the actual exercise of such influence.\nIn the present case the first and most important question is: Was the relationship existing between the deceased Goddard and the respondent sufficient to raise a presumption that the transfer of the shares was the result of undue influence on the part of the respondent? On this question the facts are all important.\nThe deceased with his wife came to Alberta from Newfoundland in the fall of 1918. He had been a successful merchant and business man there and, some forty years before he came west, he had adopted as a son his nephew who grew up with him and married, but still continued to live with him. The nephew (the plaintiff Bradley) also came to Medicine Hat in 1918, where the deceased had bought a farm for him. He also bought him a house and later the Shamrock Bottling Works. In fact, he made his nephew independent. The deceased, his wife and the Bradleys all lived together. The deceased and the respondent became acquainted as they were both active workers in the same church.\nMrs. Goddard died in 1923. In 1924 the deceased commenced to visit the respondent at her home. She was a married woman living separate from her husband and earning her living by dressmaking. Her husband had, in 1923, commenced divorce proceedings against her, in the United States, but whether or not he took out the final order the respondent did not know. The deceased visited her two or three times each week; they kissed when they met and when they parted. In 1925 he proposed marriage to her, but she said she did not know if she was free to marry. On cross-examination she said she refused him. He, however, continued his visits as before and, between 1925 and the early part of 1928, he had proposed marriage to her on six different occasions. She admits he was very much in love with her and had offered to change his will and leave her everything he had if she would marry him. She also admits that she had learned about his affairs and the property he had, and said he was in the habit of bringing to her his papers as he knew she was interested in him. In 1926 he brought to her his will in which the bank shares in question in this action were bequeathed to the plaintiff Bradley. She ascertained from a lawyer the meaning of a holograph will and what, under the Alberta law, was necessary to its validity. This information she conveyed to the deceased. In the fall of 1929 she says the deceased shewed her a holograph will in which the 44 shares in the Bank of Nova Scotia were bequeathed to her and she was made sole executrix of the will. This will was not produced nor was there any evidence, except her own, that it had ever existed. In April, 1930, she says the deceased told her he was going to take the shares in question out of the will and give them to her. On May 9, 1930, the deceased had a fall and it is common ground that he was badly shaken up as a result thereof. Mrs. Bradley says that after his accident \"his speech was much changed; that it was quite thick and he could not say his words plain.\" It was for that reason she thought he had had a stroke. After the accident he brought to the respondent another holograph will, supposed to be a copy of the 1929 will except as to the shares. This will bears date May 20, 1929, but she says she called the deceased's attention to the year and he admitted that it should be 1930, and said he would rectify that. This will was produced. In it there is no mention of the 44 Bank of Nova Scotia shares. After specifying a number of bequests the will contains this clause:\u2014\nI appoint my friend Jennie Crittenden to he my Sole Executrix of this my- last will for the purpose of settling all my affairs stated herein and leave the sum of $300 for her services in connection with same, all my personal and private effects together with the contents of my office, I leave in her charge to be used at her discretion and with power to collect any monies due to me all necessary documents are to be found in my safe My Life Insurance Policies (Mutual Life No. 313777) and Confederation Life 19732 shall be used to provide for bequests above mentioned and to these shall be added any other monies standing to my credit, after satisfying these claims, together with all my just debts and funeral expenses, the residue shall constitute a fund from which certain Church and Charitable contributions shall be made annually in my name. My wishes in this respect I have conveyed to my executrix.\nThe day before he wrote this will the deceased had sent his certificates for the 44 shares in the Bank of Nova Scotia to the bank at Calgary, with instructions to have the shares transferred to the respondent. The bank manager sent back the necessary forms for signature, and, after they had been duly executed by both, the respondent returned them to the bank on May 30, 1930, and certificates in her name were issued; but she says it was understood that he was to have the dividends while he lived and after his death the shares were to be hers. At this time the deceased was still visiting her two or three times a week and he had no independent advice as to the transfer. He was then eighty-five years old, and she was around fifty.\nAt this point it is convenient to refer to their business transactions: In July, 1928, they both went for a trip to Vancouver along with his brother. While there the deceased purchased some property, and so did the respondent. They also bought one piece of property jointly for $3,375, with a cash payment of $844. The deceased made the entire cash payment but the agreement was taken in her name alone, and she says she subsequently paid him the moneys he had paid for her. From that time she took charge of these real estate transactions, his as well as her own, paying the taxes, interest, etc.\nOn June 30, 1930, the deceased gave the respondent a general power of attorney authorizing her (inter alia) to collect all moneys due to him, to sell and dispose of all mortgages, stocks, bonds, and all other personal property, and all lands of which he was possessed, at such prices as to her might seem best. He also gave her seven cheques, signed by him, but left blank as to date, payee and amount, on various banks in which he had accounts, not only in Medicine Hat and Edmonton, Alberta, but also in St. Johns, Newfoundland. After receiving these she was in complete control of all his money and property. She, however, made no use of either the power of attorney or the cheques.\nIn the early part of January, 1931, the deceased took sick and, on January 14, made his last will in which the appellants, Lang and Scragg, were made his executors, and Bradley the residuary legatee. No mention is made of the shares, and the respondent is given a legacy of $100. The entire estate of the deceased at that time, including the shares in question, amounted to $25,400, and the shares were worth $14,080.\nDo the above facts shew the existence of a relationship which raises a presumption that the transfer of the shares to the respondent was due to the influence she had over the deceased? In my opinion they do. One of the fundamental principles of our law is that a person standing in a fiduciary relation shall not be allowed to use the influence he derives from his position for his own material advantage and to the prejudice of those whom he should protect. No general rule can be laid down as to what shall constitute undue influence. Each case must depend upon its own particular circumstances. In determining the question it must not be forgotten that a man sui juris has a right to do as he likes with his own property, and the fact that the transaction may be improvident, extravagant or foolish on the part, of the donor will not alone justify interference with it. It is for the court in each ease to say if the influence exercised has been so pressing as to be undue influence within the rules of equity.\nUndue influence has been presumed where the relationship existing between donor and donee was that of solicitor and client, doctor and patient, confessor and penitent, guardian and ward, etc. The rule, however, is not confined in its application to cases in which a fiduciary relationship exists. As was said by Lord Cottenham in Dent v. Bennett[24], and quoted with approval in Cavendish v. Strutt [25] :\u2014\nThe relief stands upon a general principle, applying to all the variety of relations in which dominion may be exercised by one person over another.\nThe rule has also, been applied where the relationship existing is that of a man and woman engaged to be married. In re Lloyds Bank, Bomze v. Bomze[26]. In that case Mr. Justice Maugham said:\u2014\nA young woman engaged to be married, however, is in a different position. In general she reposes the greatest confidence in her future husband.\nSee also: Page v. Home[27]; Cobbett v. Brock[28]; Howes v. Bishop[29]. Does the rule apply where the donor and donee are not formally engaged but the donor is greatly in love with the donee and desires to make her his wife?\nUnder the circumstances of this case I am of opinion that it does. I am unable to conceive of the deceased having any greater confidence in the respondent had there been a formal engagement between them than that which the evidence shews actually existed. She says she refused his offer of marriage when first made. If so it must have been a refusal which did not repel, for his visits continued and, for over two years, his proposal was at intervals renewed. She occupied a fiduciary relation towards him in respect of the Vancouver property, and she admits that hers was the stronger mind and the stronger personality.\nThe giving to the respondent of a general power of attorney and the cheques one month after he made the transfer of the shares, shews the special confidence he had in her, as does also his making her residuary legatee under the holograph will, with a direction to distribute the fund in accordance with his verbal instructions, and his giving to her the combination of his safe which he gave to no other person. Further, although he was living with Mrs. Bradley, his relations with the respondent were so intimate that, on his last visit to her (January 6, 1931), he took her his coat to mend, and she admits that she often pressed his clothes. All this indicates how intimate and confidential was the relationship existing between them. In addition to these confidential relations there is the admitted fact that she informed the deceased as to what constituted a holograph will and the requirements necessary for its validity. In doing so there may have been nothing whatever of calculation in her action, but a holograph will appears in which she is designated the residuary legatee. Both the will and the transfer of the shares were kept secret. It is, as I read the authorities, just in cases of this kind that the courts have insisted upon the application of the rule.\nThen has that presumption been rebutted? That the deceased knew what he was doing cannot, I think, be disputed. He gave the bank instructions to make the transfer. That, however, in a case of this kind, proves nothing more than that he was transferring the shares to her. It furnishes no evidence of the terms upon which she was to hold the legal title thereto. And, even if it did, it might only tend to shew more clearly the deep rooted influence which the respondent had over him. The statement of claim alleges the transfer was made by way of gift, but, at the trial, counsel for the appellants sought to amend the prayer for relief by claiming in the alternative that the respondent held the shares as trustee for the deceased. The amendment was refused. I think it might well have been allowed. The facts were all before the court. The only living person who knew the conditions upon which she received the shares, so far as we know, was the respondent herself. If any one else had been present when the conditions were decided upon she would be aware of it and would have had that person at the trial if he could have corroborated her story. The onus was on her to establish the gift as well as that it was the spontaneous act of the donor's independent will. In Walker v. Smith[30], Sir John Romilly, M.R., said:\u2014\nHe (the donee) must prove every point of the case, not only the transfer, but that the transfer was meant to be made to him beneficially.\nAnd at page 396 he said:\u2014\nI am of opinion that, in all these cases, you must not take into account the evidence of the recipient himself; the gift must be established by separate and independent evidence.\nWithout entirely disregarding the donee's testimony I would say that effect should not be given to it unless it is corroborated by independent evidence. Upon the vital point that it was the intention of the deceased to give to the respondent the beneficial interest in the shares conditioned upon her paying the dividends to him during his lifetime, there is absolutely no evidence but her own. It is consistent with all the evidence but that of the respondent that the deceased may have transferred the shares to her to pay the dividends to him during his lifetime, and then to apply the shares to a particular purpose expressed verbally to her by him, and not put in writing, but which no person knew but themselves.\nAs to the transfer of the shares being the spontaneous act of the deceased in the exercise of an independent will, I am of opinion that the onus resting on the respondent has not been discharged. That confidential relations existed between them during the years he was seeking to make her his wife is not denied by the respondent. Where a confidential relation is established the court will presume its continuance unless there is distinct evidence of its determination. Rhodes v. Bate[31]. That there was no termination of this relation prior to the transfer of the shares and that he was more than ever dominated by his confidence in the respondent is, I think, demonstrated by the fact that a month later he gave her the power of attorney and the cheques, thus putting himself completely in her power.\nIt was argued that as, on January 14, 1931, he made a new will, when he was surrounded by influences other than hers, and made no disposition of the shares, it might reasonably be inferred that he had determined to leave them where they were. If it had been established that he then knew he could revoke the gift (if it was a gift) and set aside the transfer, the argument would have been much stronger, but, in the absence of evidence to establish such knowledge on his part, his failure to mention the shares in his last will does not, in my opinion, justify the inference that he deliberately and intentionally affirmed the transfer. Until the commencement of his sickness eight days before he made his last will, he was under the influence of the respondent. Because he did not during these eight days seek to ascertain his rights in respect to the revocation of the shares, he cannot be charged either with laches or deliberately choosing to remain in ignorance thereof, as at the time he was ill and very old. After carefully perusing the evidence I am unable to find the slightest evidence of acquiescence or ratification of the transfer by the deceased.\nThe rule of equity which places on the donee the burden of proving both the gift and the independence of the donor's will in making it, may be a harsh one and, in individual cases, may lead to hardship. The courts, however, have found it necessary to maintain it in order to prevent those in a position to exercise undue influence from taking advantage of their position under circumstances in which proof thereof would be impossible.\nIn the Inche Noriah case [32] their Lordships of the Privy Council said:\u2014\nWe regard it as most important from the point of view of public policy to maintain the rule of law which has been laid down and to insist that a gift made under circumstances which give rise to the presumption must be set aside unless the donee is able to satisfy the court of facts sufficient to rebut it.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 25 Alta., L.R. 562; [1931] 2 W.W.R. 669; [1931] 4 D.L.R.384.\n[2] (2) 25 Alta., L.R. 562; [1931] 2 W.W.R. 699; [1931] 2 D.L.R.961.\n[3] (1887) 36 Ch.

Code, R.S.C., 1927, c. 36, ss. 761, 765, 749\u2014Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 35, s. 41. A police magistrate made an order against defendant, under s. 26 of the Domestic Relations Act, Alta., 1927, c. 5, that his wife be no longer bound to cohabit with him and that the legal custody of their children, while under 16 years of age, be committed to her. Defendant had taken objections to the magistrate's jurisdiction, and the magistrate, at defendant's request, granted a stated case (purporting to be made under s. 761, Cr. Code, and the Alberta Rules of Court) to the Appellate Division, Alta. That court declared that s. 26 of the Domestic Relations Act was ultra vires, and set aside the magistrate's order. It granted to the Attorney-General for Alberta (intervener) special leave to appeal to this Court. On the appeal coming on for hearing, this Court raised the question of its jurisdiction, and this was the only question argued.\nHeld: This Court had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\nPer Anglin C.J.C.: Assuming that (notwithstanding the provincial statutory provisions making applicable Part XV of the Cr. Code) this is a civil case (if a criminal case, there would be no appeal to this Court), to which s. 761, Cr. Code, applies, and assuming that the Appellate Division had original jurisdiction to entertain the stated case (if it had not that jurisdiction, it had no jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal to this Court under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act), any appeal from its decision is precluded by s. 765, Cr. Code, which declares an order made on a stated case to \"be final and conclusive upon all parties.\" As a special provision dealing with a particular subject matter, s. 765, Cr. Code, entirely excludes the jurisdiction which might otherwise have been vested by the general terms of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act in the Appellate Division to entertain an application for special leave to appeal to this Court (Generalia specialibus non derogant). Some doubt was expressed of the jurisdiction of the Appellate Division to entertain the stated case addressed to it; in this connection, the Magistrates and Justices Act, R.S.A., 1922, c. 78, s. 9, and the Domestic Relations Act, s. 30, and the effect of the amendments to ss. 30 and 26 of the latter Act by c. 25 of 1928, were discussed.\nPer Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.: The magistrate had no jurisdiction to state a case for the Appellate Division, nor had that court jurisdiction to pronounce upon it. Proceedings by way of stated case under s. 761, Cr. Code, constitute an appeal; and, being a form of appeal given by Part XV, Cr. Code, stand in exactly the same position as the appeal to the District Court given by s. 749, Cr. Code. S. 30 of the Domestic Relations Act (as amended in 1928, c. 25) makes applicable the provisions of Part XV, Cr. Code, \"save as is otherwise specially provided by this or any other Act\"; and s. 26 (3) (as enacted in 1928, c. 25) of the Domestic Relations Act makes special provision for an appeal. The effect is, that any right of appeal which a party might otherwise have, under the provisions of Part XV, Cr. Code, is excluded, and the only right of appeal from the magistrate's order is that to the District Court provided by s. 26 (3) of the Act. There being no jurisdiction in the magistrate or the Appellate Division as above stated, this Court is likewise without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The result is that the magistrate's order, not having been appealed against, stands.\nPer Cannon J.: S. 765, Cr. Code, applied to the proceedings adopted, and the court to which the case was transmitted was to give an order \"final and conclusive upon all parties.\" This would exclude an appeal, even by special leave, to this Court.\nAPPEAL by the Attorney-General for Alberta (intervener) from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1].\nA police magistrate had made an order against the defendant (the present respondent), under s. 26 of the Domestic Relations Act, 1927, Alta. (statutes of Alberta, 1927, c. 5), that defendant's wife (the informant) be no longer bound to cohabit with him and that the legal custody of their children, while under the age of 16 years, be committed to her. The defendant had taken objections to the magistrate's jurisdiction, and the magistrate, at defendant's request, granted a stated case, purporting to be made \"under the Provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada, Section 761, and the rules of Court of the Province of Alberta,\" to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta. The defendant's appeal, upon the stated case, having come on for hearing before the Appellate Division, that court allowed the appeal, declared that said s. 26 of the Domestic Relations Act was beyond the legislative competence of the Province, and set aside and vacated the magistrate's order. The Appellate Division granted to the Attorney-General of Alberta, who had intervened in the said appeal before it, special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the Attorney-General brought the present appeal. On this appeal coming on for hearing, this Court raised the question of its jurisdiction to hear it, and this was the only question argued.\nG. B. Henwood K.C. for the appellant.\nPercy G. Davies for the respondent.\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014After giving to this case careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the appeal must be quashed or dismissed without costs on the ground that there is no jurisdiction here to entertain it.\nIf there be not jurisdiction in the Appellate Division of Alberta to deal with the stated case submitted to it, we cannot do otherwise than treat the judgment from which it is sought to appeal as a nullity.\nSection 9 of the Magistrates and Justices Act (R.S.A., 1922, c. 78) reads as follows:\nExcept as otherwise specially provided, the Provisions of The Criminal Code of Canada respecting summary convictions, as amended from time to time and proceedings relating thereto shall apply in respect of all convictions or orders made or to be made by justices of the peace and police magistrates.\nIt has been held in Alberta that the effect of the above section was to introduce into Alberta, in a case such as this, the provisions of the Criminal Code respecting appeals from summary convictions (Part XV) (Prudius v. Johnson)[2]. By s. 749 Cr. C., an appeal is given to the District Court of Alberta; and, by another provincial statute (R.S.A., 1922, c. 73, ss. 47-48), provision is made for an appeal from the District Court to the Appellate Division. But, where a case is stated under s. 761 Cr. C. (and the present appellant has elected to resort to that procedure), no appeal lies under s. 749 Cr. C.\nS. 761 Cr. C., providing for a stated case, impliedly, if not expressly, contains a provision enabling the court to make rules or orders dealing with such \"stated case\" (s. 576 Cr. C.), and expressly confines the subject matter of the stated case thereby authorized to\nquestion(ing) a conviction, order, determination or other proceeding of a justice under this Part, on the ground that it is erroneous in point of law, or is in excess of jurisdiction.\nNotwithstanding the provision of the Alberta Rules of Court, made by Rule 816, that a stated case may be addressed to the Appellate Division or to a judge (apparently at the option of the applicant), and that, by s. 705 (e) Cr. C., \"the court\" is defined as follows:\n\"The court\" in the sections of this Part relating to justices stating or signing cases means and includes any superior court of criminal jurisdiction for the province in which the proceedings in respect of which the case is sought to be stated are carried on,\nassuming that s. 761 applies to convictions such as that before us, s. 765, as part of Part XV, is also expressly made applicable. That section reads, in part, as follows:\nThe court to which a case is transmitted shall hear and determine the question or questions of law arising thereon, and shall thereupon affirm, reverse or modify the conviction, order or determination in respect of which the case has been stated, or remit the matter to the justice with the opinion of the court thereon, and may make such other order in relation to the matter, and such orders as to costs, as to the court seems fit; and all such orders shall be final and conclusive upon all parties.\nThis section in terms precludes any further appeal from the court or judge to whom the stated case has been directed, the decision of the court or judge thereon being thereby declared to \"be final and conclusive upon all parties.\" Part XV of the Criminal Code, although it may, in one aspect thereof, be regarded as provincial, and, as such, ultra vires, (because the Legislature of Alberta adopted the same instead of itself enacting a Summary Convictions Act), is an enactment of the Dominion Parliament and retains its character as legislation duly enacted by that Parliament and, as such, is a statutory provision binding on this court, the validity of which cannot be questioned here. Provision for appeal to this court in criminal cases is made by sections 1023 and 1025 of the Criminal Code. There is no other provision for any such appeal. Both counsel agreed at bar and in memoranda subsequently filed by them dealing with the point of jurisdiction (and we are inclined to the same view), that this case is not a \"criminal cause,\" within the meaning of s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act, merely because the Alberta Legislature has seen fit to adopt, and make applicable to it, Part XV of the Criminal Code. This is merely a matter of substituting the procedure of Part XV for a provincial Summary Convictions Act, such as Ontario has.\nThe appellant and respondent, however, insist that this is a civil case and that, consequently, the appellant has the right to appeal to this court under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, by virtue of an order for special leave to appeal made by the Appellate Division of Alberta. Assuming that the Appellate Division of Alberta had original jurisdiction to entertain the \"stated case,\" any appeal from its decision is precluded by s. 765, Cr. C., which prevents an application for special leave to appeal under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act being entertained by any Canadian court, because s. 765, Cr. C., has declared the order made on a stated case to \"be final and conclusive upon all parties.\" As a special provision dealing with a particular subject matter, s. 765 of the Criminal Code (enacted in 1892 by 55-56 Vic., c. 29, s. 900 (7), and to be found in the Revised Statutes of 1906, c. 146, as s. 765), entirely excludes the jurisdiction, which might otherwise have been vested by the general terms of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act (enacted in 1920) in the Appellate Division for Alberta, to entertain an application for special leave to appeal to this court from its decision \"in any case within s. 36\" of the Supreme Court Act. Generalia specialibus non derogant. If, therefore, the case at bar should, because of its nature, be regarded as a civil case, notwithstanding the provisions of the provincial statute which makes Part XV of the Criminal Code applicable to it (a provision which was acted upon and which clearly includes s. 765), as a special provision dealing with a particular subject matter, the latter section must override the provision of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act. (Garnett v. Bradley[3]; Barker v. Edger[4]; see also Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 7th ed., 152).\nWhat I have written above proceeds on the assumption that there was power in the Appellate Division of Alberta to entertain and dispose of \"the stated case\" directed to it by the magistrate. I entertain some slight doubt, however, of the jurisdiction of that court to entertain, as it did, as a court of first instance, the stated case so addressed to it.\nIt should be noted that s. 9 of the Magistrates and Justices Act opens with the phrase, \"Except as otherwise specially provided,\"\u2014evidently contemplating that there may be \"convictions or orders made or to be made by police magistrates\" to which the Legislature may intend especially to express its intention that the provisions \"of The Criminal Code of Canada respecting summary convictions, as amended from time to time and proceedings relating thereto shall (not) apply.\"\nThe immediate question before us is whether the section of the Domestic Relations Act (Stats. of Alta., 1927, c. 5, s. 30) excluded the stated case under Part XV of the Code (s. 761 et seq.) by enacting that,\n(1) Save as is otherwise specially provided by this or any other Act, the provisions of Part XV and Part XXII of The Criminal Code, shall apply to all proceedings under this Part, save and except that no appeal shall lie from any order made under this Part,\nand, if it did, whether, by the amendment of 1928 (Stats. of Alta., c. 25, s. 5) which reads as follows:\nSection 30 of the said Act is amended as to subsection (1) thereof by striking out the words \"save and except that no appeal shall lie from any order made under this Part\" where the same occur therein,\nthat right was not restored? On the one hand, it is said that s. 30 of the Act of 1927 cuts out every right of appeal and makes the magistrate's decision final. On the other hand, it is said that it merely cuts out the provisions of s. 749 et seq. of the Criminal Code, which deal with the right of appeal strictly so-called, and leave intact the provisions of s. 761 et seq., pertaining to the stated case, and also the indirect appeal by way of certiorari, etc. If the view be correct that s. 30 included in its provision the right of appeal by way of a stated case, it would seem logical that the striking out of the final words would have left the parties precisely where they would have been had the concluding words of s. 30, so repealed, never been enacted. In any event, however, whether the right of appeal does or does not include the \"stated case,\" it would seem doubtful that the Legislature thus, intended to restore a right so taken away.\nIt should not escape notice that s. 30 of the Act of 1927 opens with the words,\nSave as is otherwise specially provided by this or any other Act,\nthus raising the question whether the amendment to s. 26, also made in 1928 (Stats. of Alta., c. 25), is a special provision dealing with the \"stated case.\" It does not in terms at all apply to a stated case, and its application thereto would seem to depend upon whether or not the stated case is included in s. 30 of the Stats. of Alta., 1927, from which the words,\nsave and except that no appeal shall lie from any order made under this Part\nare deleted by the amendment of 1928. If, as above pointed out, the stated case is included in s. 30, it is likewise included in s. 5 of the amending Act of 1928. Therefore, it seems to me to be made clear that the portion of Part XV of the Criminal Code dealing with the stated case should have application to the case before us. But, either on the ground that Part XV applies and that s. 765 as part thereof also applies, or, on the ground that the application of ss. 761 et seq. is entirely excluded, and the Appellate Division was, accordingly, without original jurisdiction, there can be no jurisdiction to entertain the present appeal here. I am, moreo er, of opinion that, if that court had no jurisdiction to entertain the stated case, it had no jurisdiction to make the subsequent order granting leave to appeal to this court under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act from its decision. This appeal, therefore, must be quashed.\nAs this objection was not taken by counsel or at bar, there will be no costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ. was delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014The only question argued before us in this case was whether or not there was jurisdiction in this court to hear the appeal. Members of the court called attention to certain grounds on which it was thought our jurisdiction might be questioned and the court requested counsel to submit arguments thereon. Two of the grounds were:\u2014\n(1) that it was a criminal cause and therefore excluded ; from our consideration by the language of section 36 of the Supreme Court Act, and\n(2) that a police magistrate who makes an order under Part IV of the Domestic Relations Act, 1927 (Alberta), as amended by chapter 25 of the Act of 1928, has no power to state a case for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Alberta, and consequently the Appellate Division of that court was without jurisdiction to give the judgment now sought to be appealed against.\nIn view of the conclusion at which I have arrived on the second of these grounds, it is unnecessary to deal with the first.\nPart IV of the Domestic Relations Act is headed \"Protection Orders,\" and section 26 of that Part authorizes a police magistrate, on the application of a married woman who has been deserted by her husband, where the magistrate is satisfied that the husband is able wholly or in part to maintain his wife or his wife and family, but who has wilfully neglected to do so and has deserted his wife, to summon the husband before him and, after hearing, to make an order, or orders, containing all or any of the following provisions:\n(a) that the wife be no longer bound to cohabit with her husband;\n(b) that the legal custody of their children under sixteen years of age be committed to the wife;\n(c) that the husband shall pay to his wife such weekly sum, not exceeding $20, as the magistrate, having regard to the moneys both of the husband and wife, shall consider reasonable.\nSubsection (3) (a) of section 26 reads as follows:\n(3) (a) Any party to proceedings under this section being dissatisfied with any order or refusal to make an order pursuant to this section may appeal from such order or refusal to the District Court of the district within which such order or refusal was made, provided such party does within twenty days of the date of the order or refusal appealed from serve upon the police magistrate, who dealt with the matter, and upon the opposite party a notice in writing which shall contain the name and address of the appellant and of the opposite party, the substance of the order or refusal appealed from and the date and place of such order or refusal.\nThis is followed by provisions regulating the procedure in relation to the appeal and the hearing thereof by the District Court judge who is given jurisdiction to \"set aside, confirm or vary any order made by the magistrate, or make any other order mentioned in the section warranted by the evidence.\" Then s. 30, as amended by s. 5 of c. 25 of the Statutes of 1928, is as follows:\u2014\n30. (1) Save as is otherwise specially provided by this or any other Act, the provisions of Part XV and Part XXII of The Criminal Code, shall apply to all proceedings under this Part.\nIn the present case the magistrate's order was limited to the provisions (a) and (b) of see. 26, above referred to. The order did not include any decree against the husband for the payment of money, not even for costs. No appeal was taken to the District Court, but an application on behalf of the husband was made to the magistrate to state a case, under s. 761 of the Criminal Code, for the opinion of the Appellate Division as to the constitutionality of Part IV of the Act, A case was stated and we have now to determine if the magistrate, in view of the provisions made in the Act for an appeal to the District Court, had any jurisdiction to state it.\nThe provisions of Part XV and Part XXII of the Criminal Code are to apply to proceedings under Part IV of the Domestic Relations Act, unless it is \"otherwise specially provided\" either in that Act or in any other provincial Act. The Domestic Relations Act makes special provision for the appeal which may be taken from the order of a police magistrate under that Act. By the very language, therefore, of section 30 any right of appeal which a party might otherwise have, under the provisions of Part XV of the Criminal Code, is excluded. That is not questioned, but it is contended that the exclusion of the right of appeal given by Part XV does not affect the right to have a case stated under section 761.\nIn my opinion, we do not require to go beyond the language of sections 761 to 765 to establish that proceedings by way of stated case constitute an appeal from the magistrate's order. The very object of having a case stated is to question the conviction or order on the ground that it is erroneous in point of law, or is in excess of jurisdiction. In subsection (3) (c) of section 761 the proceedings are referred to as an \"appeal.\" In section 762 (1) the applicant is to enter into a recognizance \"conditioned to prosecute his appeal without delay.\" In subsection (2) the order of the magistrate is referred to as \"the judgment appealed against,\" and by section 765 the court to which the stated case is transmitted has jurisdiction to affirm, reverse or modify the conviction or order of the magistrate who is not to be liable for costs \"by reason of such appeal against his determination.\"\nIn addition to the internal evidence supplied by the language of these sections, there is a considerable body of judicial opinion to the same effect: In Regina v. Robert Simpson Co.[5], Boyd C., at page 235, said:\nThe Code, therefore, treats this method of stated case to be but a form of appeal equivalent to the ordinary appeal upon the facts and law to the General Sessions.\nThis view was approved by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta in Rex v. Weinfield[6]; and by the Court en banc of Saskatchewan in Zeats v. Johnston[7]. See also Rex v. Macdonald[8], and Rex v. Driscoll[9].\nIn view of the above statutory provisions, I have no hesitation in holding that proceedings by way of stated case under s. 761 of the Code constitute an appeal although limited to a point of law or a question of jurisdiction.\nBeing a form of appeal given by Part XV, a stated case, in my opinion, stands in exactly the same position as the appeal to the District Court given by s. 749 of the Code. Both are appeals allowed by Part XV and, where applicable, the party aggrieved has an option as to which appeal he will pursue. Where, however, as in s. 30 of the Domestic Relations Act, Part XV of the Code is made applicable only in so far as it is not \"otherwise specially provided,\" and the Act itself makes special provision for an appeal to the District Court from the magistrate's order, I think the intention of the legislature must be held to have been that the only appeal open to a party dissatisfied with the magistrate's order, or his refusal to make one, is the appeal to the District Court provided by subs. 3 of s. 26. If it had been intended to allow an appeal by way of stated case there was no necessity for any provision in the Act for an appeal to the District Court. If no such provision had been made, Part XV of the Code would have applied and, under s. 749, there would have been an appeal, both on the facts and the law, from the magistrate's order to the District Court, and there would have been an appeal by way of stated case on a question of law or jurisdiction to any superior court of criminal jurisdiction of the province. (S. 705 and s. 761.)\nWhen the Act was passed in 1927, s. 30 thereof contained, in addition to the language above quoted, these words: \"save and except that no appeal shall lie from any order made under this Part.\" While these words were in the Act a party to any order had no right to a stated case (s. 769 (2) Cr. C.). By the amendment of 1928, which made provision for an appeal to the District Court, these words were struck out. Had it been the intention of the legislature to permit an appeal by way of stated case it would, I think, have inserted in the Act an express provision to that effect, as was done with respect to the appeal, and not have left such intention to be inferred from the fact that Part XV was made to apply.\nThe object of Part IV of the Domestic Relations Act was, no doubt, to provide a speedy and inexpensive proceeding before a magistrate which married women, deserted by their husbands, might take to obtain redress. That its provisions are found in an Act which otherwise deals with matters coming within the jurisdiction of a superior court is, in my opinion, of no moment. They are still the expression of the legislative will.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the only appeal that may be taken from a magistrate's order, under Part IV of the Act, is that provided by the Act itself and that the magistrate had no jurisdiction to state a case for the Appellate Division, nor had that court jurisdiction to pronounce upon it. There being no jurisdiction either in the magistrate or the Appellate Division, this court is likewise without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The Grand Council of the Can. Ord. Chosen Friends v. The Local Government Board and the Town of Humboldt (1). The result is that the magistrate's order, not having been appealed against, stands.\nI would allow no costs either here or below.\nCANNON J.\u2014I have reached the conclusion that this appeal should be quashed for lack of jurisdiction. Section 765 of the Criminal Code applies to the proceedings adopted by the litigants, and the court to which the case was transmitted was to give an order \"final and conclusive upon all parties.\" This would exclude an appeal, even by special leave, to this court. No costs.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] [1931] 3 W.W.R. 614; [1932] 1 D.L.R. 135.\n[2] [1924] 2 W.W.R. 105.\n[3] (1878) 3 App. Cas. 944, per Lord Hatherley, at 950 et seq.\n[4] [1898] A.C. 748, per Lord Hobhouse, at 754.\n[5] (1896) 28 O.R. 231.\n[6] (1919) 14 Alta.

Respondent company was liquidator of E. Co. and obtained from the appellant insurance companies policies of fire insurance on E. Co.'s grain elevator, the loss, if any, being made payable to a bank to which E. Co. was indebted. In the course of the liquidation[1] respondent sold the elevator to directors of E. Co. (who were guarantors on E. Co.'s indebtedness to the bank). It was part of the arrangement that the purchasers should pay the unexpired portions of insurance premiums from date of sale. The purchasers paid the purchase price and the unexpired portions of insurance premiums. The bank was paid off and it handed to respondent E. Co.'s certificate of title and the insurance policies (which the bank had held as security). It was arranged between respondent and the purchasers that the conveyance to the latter should remain in abeyance, and no conveyance of the property, nor any assignment of the insurance policies, was made. Subsequently the elevator was burned, and respondent, at the request and for the benefit of the purchasers, sued appellants on the policies.\nHeld: Respondent was entitled to recover.\nPer Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ.: The stipulation in the contract of sale that the purchasers were to pay the unearned portions of the insurance premiums constituted an implied undertaking on respondent's part to hold the policies for the benefit of the purchasers until such times as they were validly assigned to them. Such an undertaking was enforceable in a court of equity by respondent as trustee of the purchasers. Respondent as liquidator had an insurable interest in E. Co.'s assets when it obtained the policies. Also it had an insurable interest at the time of the fire, by virtue (1) of its legal ownership, and (2) of its implied undertaking. Statutory conditions 4 and 5, schedule B, of the Alberta Insurance Act, (1926, c. 31) did not afford a defence to the claim. Appellants insured respondent as liquidator of E. Co.; by so doing they must be held to have insured all the interest in the elevator which, in the liquidation, would pass to or be under the control of respondent; the insured's interest was, therefore, stated in the policy within the meaning of statutory condition 4 (a). The insured's interest in the subject matter of the insurance had not been assigned within the meaning of statutory condition 5 (e).\nThe law in such cases discussed and authorities reviewed.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Alta. (26 Alta. L.R. 21), affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[2], which (Mitchell and McGillivray, J.J.A., dissenting) dismissed their appeal from the judgment of Ives J. [3]holding the plaintiff entitled to recover against the defendants on certain policies of fire insurance.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nG. F. Henderson K.C. and S. Bruce Smith for the appellants.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and M. B. Gordon for the respondent. ANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014I agree in the result of the judgment in this case, but, for want of opportunity to consider and analyze it in detail, cannot commit myself on the various propositions of law which it incidentally enounces.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014In this case the respondent brought action on two policies of insurance, one issued by each of the appellants who respectively agreed to indemnify the respondent for loss sustained by fire in respect of an elevator the property of the Edmonton Terminal Grain Company, Limited, in liquidation (hereinafter called the Grain Company). The relevant facts are as follows:\u2014\nOn October 15, 1928, a winding up order was made against the Grain Company, and the respondent, the Montreal Trust Company, was appointed liquidator. On October 16 the respondent applied for and obtained a policy of insurance on the Grain Company's elevator from the appellant, the Caledonian Insurance Company, for $2,500, and, on November 5, 1928, a similar policy was obtained from the appellant, the Alliance Assurance Company. In both policies the loss, if any, was made payable to the Royal Bank of Canada.\nAt that time the Grain Company was indebted to the said bank in the sum of $26,400, and the bank held as security therefor an equitable mortgage on the elevator property, the fire insurance policies on the elevator, and the personal guarantees of the following directors of the Grain Company: Messrs. Morris, Chamberlain, Scramstad, Topper and Krause.\nIn the winding up proceedings the elevator in question was offered for sale by order of the Master in Chambers but no bids were received therefor. When no bids were obtained at the sale the above named directors got together and, through their solicitors, Messrs. Abbott & McLaughlin, submitted to the respondent an offer of $25,000 for the elevator property. This offer was accepted, as testified to by Mr. Banner, the manager of the respondent's Edmonton branch, on condition that as part of the arrangement the purchasers were to pay the unexpired portions of the insurance premiums from the date of the sale. This arrangement was approved by the Master in Chambers, as appears from a letter to Abbott & McLaughlin by the respondent's solicitors, on February 19, 1929, which reads as follows:\u2014\nAs advised we attended before the Master this afternoon and explained the situation to him asking for his further directions. He directed that the purchasers, for whom you act, be required to pay, not later than 3 p.m. on Thursday the 21st inst., the amount equal to 10 per cent. of the purchase price of $25,000 and that the balance of the purchase price be paid not later than Thursday the 28th inst., together with the amount of the unearned premiums on the existing Fire Insurance Policies from the date when the sale was made. In default a further Application is to be made when directions will be given for the enforcement of the Agreement.\nThe purchasers complied with the terms set out in the letter. On February 22 they paid the $25,000 and, on February 28, the sum of $1,125, which represented the premiums on the policies (some 13 in all) from the date of the sale until the expiration of the policies. As the purchasers had not made up their minds just what they were going to do with the property, they arranged with the respondent that the conveyance to them should, in the meantime, remain in abeyance. The respondent paid the purchase money over to the Royal Bank and the guarantors furnished the additional amounts necessary to pay the bank in full. The bank then handed over to the respondent the Grain Company's certificate of title and the insurance policies. No conveyance of the property nor any assignment of the insurance policies was made. On April 28, 1929, the elevator was burned to the ground, constituting a total loss. The appellants repudiated any liability under the policies as a result of the burning of the elevator, and the respondent brought this action at the request and on behalf of the purchasers.\nAs a defence to the respondent's claim the appellants set up:\u2014\n(1) That after the making of the policies of insurance, but prior to the fire, the respondent had sold and assigned the insured property and had received the full purchase price and consideration therefor, and that, at the time of the fire, the respondent had no interest whatever in the property so insured and, therefore, did not suffer any loss or damage.\n(2) That the statutory conditions set forth in Schedule B of the Alberta Insurance Act, 1926, were, by the Act, embodied in and made part of the policies in question, and the said conditions, in part, provided:\u2014\n4. Unless otherwise specifically stated in the policy the insurer is not liable for the losses following, that is to say:\n(a) For loss of or damage to property owned by any person other than the insured, unless the interest of the insured therein is stated in the policy;\n5. Unless permission is given by the policy or endorsed thereon, the insurer shall not be liable for loss or damage occurring:\n(c) After the interest of the insured in the subject matter of the insurance is assigned.\nIn its reply the respondent set up, as an answer to the appellants' defence, that if, prior to the fire, the insured property had been sold, it was sold under a contract which contained a provision that the respondent must keep alive the existing policies of insurance for the benefit of the purchasers and retain title to and possession of the insured property, and otherwise care for the building, until the purchasers saw fit to have the same transferred to themselves, and that a sale of the property under these circumstances did not deprive the respondent of its interest therein or disentitle it to recover on the policies.\nIt is established law that a contract of fire insurance is a contract of indemnity. To establish a right to indemnity the insured must shew that he has in fact sustained loss by reason of the destruction (wholly or partly) by fire of his interest in the subject matter of insurance. The extent of his indemnity must, subject to the terms of the contract, be measured by the loss which he has actually sustained. A contract of insurance is a mere personal contract between the insurers and the insured for the payment of money and, as such, cannot, in the case of a building insured against fire, run with the land so as to pass the benefit of it to an assignee of the original owner. The mere transfer of the property insured is not of itself sufficient to pass the benefit of the insurance to the transferee.\nOn the other hand, it is equally well established law that a vendor owning a building upon which he holds a policy of insurance may validly transfer the building and, at the same time, validly assign to the transferee the policy of insurance. Welford and Otter-Barry on Fire Insurance, 3rd ed., at pp. 215 et seq. In Powles v. Innes[4], the head-note is:\nA person who assigns away his interest in a ship or goods, after effecting a policy of insurance upon them, and before the loss, cannot sue upon the policy; except as a trustee for the assignee, in a case where the policy is handed over to him upon the assignment, or there is an agreement that it shall be kept alive for his benefit.\nIn his judgment Parke B. said:\nUnless, therefore, there was some understanding that the policy should be kept alive for her benefit, the plaintiffs, suing on behalf of Page, have lost nothing. If the policy had been handed over with the bill of sale, or there had been an order to the brokers to hand it over, the case would be different; then the parties might sue as trustees for the purchaser: but we cannot infer that, no facts being stated in the case to warrant such an inference.\nAnd in Rayner v. Preston[5], Brett, L.J., stated the law as follows:\u2014\nIt is true that under certain circumstances a policy of insurance may, in Equity, be assigned, so as to give another person a right to sue upon it; but in this case the policy of insurance, as a contract, never was assigned by the Defendants to the Plaintiffs. It would have been assigned by the Defendants to the Plaintiffs if it had been included in the contract of purchase, but it was not. Any valuation of the policy, any consideration of increase of the price of the premises in consequence of there being a policy, was wholly omitted. There was nothing given by the Plaintiffs to the Defendants for the contract. The contract, therefore, neither expressly nor impliedly, was assigned to the Plaintiffs.\nSee also North of England Pure Oil-Cake Co. v. Archangel Maritime Insurance Co.[6]; Keefer v. Phoenix Insurance Co.[7]; Castellain v. Preston[8]; Collingridge v. Royal Exchange Ass. Corporation[9], and Phoenix Assurance Co. v. Spooner[10].\nThe law as laid down by these authorities and others has been summarized in Welford and Otter-Barry's work above referred to, and, as applied to this case, may briefly be said to be:\u2014\nWhere the insured property has been sold under an agreement of sale and the sale completed by the receipt of the purchase money and an absolute conveyance of the property, before its destruction by fire, the insured, having divested himself of all his interest in the property, could not suffer loss by its destruction and, therefore, has no right of recovery on the policy. In the event of a fire taking place before the sale is completed by the conveyance of the property and the receipt of the price, the insured is entitled to recover to the full extent of his loss within the limits of the policy.\nReferring to a state of facts similar to those existing in the case before us, the learned authors, at pages 217 and 218, say:\u2014\nIf the price has been paid, but the conveyance of the subject-matter has not been completed, the assured retains an insurable interest by virtue of his legal ownership. The policy therefore remains in force, notwithstanding such payment; but in the event of a loss before completion, the assured, not being damnified by the loss, will not be entitled to enforce it against the insurers for his own benefit * * * Where, however, the assured has contracted with the purchaser to be responsible for the safety of the subject-matter, the position will be different; and, unless the language of the policy is prohibitive, the value of the subject-matter will be recoverable by the assured.\nThe contract under which the assignment of the subject-matter takes place may contain a provision that the assured is to keep alive an existing policy for the benefit of the purchaser. Where, as is usually the case, the consent of the insurers is obtained to what is to all intents and purposes an assignment of the policy no difficulty can arise. The effect of the provision, in the absence of such consent, does not appear to have been discussed, but the following considerations seem to apply, namely:\u2014\n(i) There must be no condition in the policy precluding the assured from contracting with a purchaser in the terms of the provision.\n(ii) So long as the assured retains some interest in the subject-matter, such a provision may be valid, not only as between the assured and the purchaser, but also against the insurers. Although the contract may effect a change in the nature of his interest, it does not put an end to it. Nor is its value necessarily diminished, since the contract may amount to an undertaking by the assured to be responsible in the event of any loss.\nAn attempt was made by the purchasers to establish that, as a result of certain conversations between Mr. Banner, the respondent's then manager at Edmonton, and themselves, an agreement had been arrived at by which the respondent was to be responsible for the safety of the elevator. This attempt, in my opinion, wholly failed. No agreement of that nature can be spelled out of the conversations.\nThe respondent, however, is entitled to rely on the terms of the contract of sale made with the purchasers and approved by the Master. By that contract the purchasers were to pay the unearned portion of the insurance premiums. These had been paid by the respondent to the insurance companies. What object could there have been in embodying this stipulation in the contract if it was not to give the purchasers the benefit of the insurance policies? The respondent could have surrendered the policies to the companies and have obtained from them a return of the unearned premiums if all that was desired was to reimburse the respondent for money paid out in the liquidation on behalf of the Grain Company. The $1,125 was paid in respect of the policies of insurance and, in my opinion, the stipulation constituted an implied undertaking on the part of the respondent to hold the policies for the benefit of the purchasers until such times as they were validly assigned to them. Such an undertaking is enforceable in a court of equity by the respondent as trustee of the purchasers. Burton v. Gore District Mutual Ins. Co.[11].\nThat the respondent as liquidator had an insurable interest in the assets of the Grain Company when it obtained the policy is not disputed. That it had an insurable interest at the date of the fire is, in my opinion, established. It had that interest by virtue (1) of its legal ownership, and (2) of its implied undertaking.\nThe statutory conditions do not afford any defence to the respondent's claim. The appellants insured the respondent as liquidator of the Grain Company. By so doing they must be held to have insured all the interest in the elevator building which, in the liquidation, would pass to or be under the control of the respondent. The insured's interest was, therefore, stated in the policy within the meaning of statutory condition 4 (a). And, for the reasons above given, the insured's interest in the subject-matter of the insurance had not been assigned within the meaning of statutory condition 5 (c).\nAs the respondent had an insurable interest in the elevator not only when it obtained the policies in question but also at the date of the fire, and, as it was a term of the contract of sale that the insurance policies should be held for the benefit of the purchasers, the respondent, in my opinion, is entitled to recover on the policies. I, therefore, agree with the majority of the court below and would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1924] Can. S.C.R. 654.\n[2] 26 Alta.

Act, s. 92, head 2\u2014Municipal tax, on contractors non residents of the province, computed on basis of percentage of contract price\u2014Ultra vires.\nThe appellant City was by statute empowered \"to pass by-laws imposing a tax on contractors resident outside this province doing business within\" the City. It passed a by-law enacting that all contractors non residents of the province who should engage in the business of a contractor for the performance of any work within the City, under a contract or agreement, should pay to the City \" on every such con tract or agreement a direct tax,\" the tax to be a percentage of the contract price, graduated on a sliding scale according to the amount of the contract. The City claimed from respondent payment of a tax, in accordance with the by-law, of a percentage on the amount of respondent's contract for the building of an hotel.\nHeld: The tax was \"indirect taxation,\" and the said by-law imposing it was ultra vires. (Judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island en banc, 3 M.P.R. 196, affirmed, on this ground.)\n\"Direct taxation,\" as defining the sphere of provincial legislation (B.N.A. Act, s. 92, head 2),- discussed, and authorities referred to.\nHaving regard to the form of the tax as imposed, it is nothing else but \"the exaction of a percentage duty on services\" and would ordinarily be regarded and should be classified as \"indirect taxation\" (City of Halifax v. Fairbanks' Estate, [1928] A.C. 117, at 125). Such a tax would invariably be an element in the fixing of the price of the contract and, in its normal and general tendency, must be reason ably assumed to pass to the owner, in the ordinary course of the transaction, as enhancement of the cost. APPEAL by the City of Charlottetown from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island en banc ([1]).\nThe City claimed $7,812.50 for taxes against the respondent. The respondent disputed the City's right to impose the tax upon it. A special case was stated for the opinion of the Supreme Court of the Province, and, pursuant to order made on consent of the parties, the case was heard by the Court en bane, which gave judgment in favour of the respondent.\nThe special case is set out in full in the judgment now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and R. M. Martin K.C. for the appellant.\nGregor Barclay K.C. and J. O. C. Campbell for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The City of Charlottetown claimed $7,812.50 for taxes alleged to be due by the respondent as contractors resident outside the province of Prince Edward Island in respect of the respondent's building under con tract the Canadian National hotel in Charlottetown. The tax is computed on a percentage of the amount of the con tract for the building (except the foundation and steel work), as estimated and fixed by the mayor of the city as provided for in a city by-law.\nThe respondent resisted payment of the tax on several grounds.\nThe parties concurred in stating the questions of law arising herein in the form of a special case for the opinion of the Supreme Court of the province; and, on consent of all concerned, the case was heard by the court en banc, which, having considered the points submitted, ordered that judgment be entered for the respondent, without costs.\nThe most convenient way to expose the facts and the respective contentions of the parties is to transcribe the stated case: \"This action was commenced on the ninth day of December, A.D. 1930, by a writ of summons, whereby the plaintiff claimed $7,812.50 for debt, and the parties have concurred in stating the questions of law arising herein in the following case for the opinion of the Court:\u2014\n\u201c1. The plaintiff is a body corporate under an enactment of the Legislature of Prince Edward Island known as the City of Charlottetown Incorporation Act.\n\u201c2. The defendant is a body corporate incorporated by Letters Patent issued under authority of an enactment of the Parliament of Canada and having as one of its objects and powers the construction of buildings, generally through out Canada.\n\u201c3. On or about the 28th day of April, A.D. 1930, at Montreal in the Province of Quebec the defendant entered into a contract with Canadian National Realties, a body corporate with head office without Prince Edward Island, for the construction of a hotel (except the foundation and steel frame) for said Canadian National Realties, in the City of Charlottetown; and the defendant built and constructed such hotel under the said contract. The materials used in such construction were largely imported into Prince Edward Island.\n\"4. Section 112 (19) of the City of Charlottetown In corporation Act, being 3 Edward VII, Cap. 17, is as follows:\nIt is hereby enacted that the City Council of Charlottetown shall have power to pass by-laws imposing a tax on contractors resident out side this province doing business within the City of Charlottetown.\n\"5. In pursuance of said Statute the plaintiff's City Council on May 21, 1908, duly and regularly passed the following by-law:\nA BY-LAW TO IMPOSE A TAX ON NON-RESIDENT CONTRACTORS.\nBe it Enacted by the City Council of the City of Charlottetown as follows:\n1. All persons commonly known as Contractors non residents of the Province of Prince Edward Island who shall engage in the business of a Contractor for the performance of any work of a public or private nature within the City of Charlottetown, under a contract or agreement, shall pay to the City of Charlottetown on every such contract or agreement a direct tax to be computed in the manner following, that is to say:\n(a) On all contracts where the contract price does not exceed $10,000.00 the tax shall be three per cent, of such contract price. (b) Where the contract price exceeds $10,000.00 but does not exceed\n$25,000.00 the tax shall be two and one-half per cent, of such contract\nprice.\n(c) Where the contract price exceeds $25,000.00 but does not exceed $50,000.00 the tax shall be two per cent, of such contract price.\n(d)Where the contract price exceeds $50,000.00 the tax shall be one and one-quarter per cent of such contract price.\n2. In cases where the exact amount of the contract price, cannot be ascertained and in all cases where the same is disputed, the Mayor of the said City shall have power to fix the precise amount of said tax and when so fixed by the Mayor as aforesaid such tax may be sued for and recovered in the manner hereinafter provided.\n3. The tax aforesaid shall be paid on or before the expiration of ten days after it has been applied for by the Collector of the said City or other persons duly authorized, and in default of payment may be used for and recovered in any Court of competent jurisdiction.\n(Sgd.) W. W. CLARKE, (Sgd.) B. C. PROWSE,\nCity Clerk. Mayor.\n\u201c6. Under the foregoing enactment and by-law the plaintiff City has sought to impose upon the defendant a tax of $7,812.50, being the rate of one and one-quarter per cent, on $625,000, said $625,000 being the amount of the defendant's contract for the building of said hotel (except the foundation and steel frame) as estimated and fixed by the Mayor of the Plaintiff City.\n\u201c7. The due and proper assessment and demand as based on the said by-law and statute (whose provisions are not admitted to be intra vires) is accepted subject to later determination of the actual contract price if admissible.\n\u201c8. The Head Office of the defendant company is at Halifax in the Province of Nova Scotia; it has no place of business in the Province of Prince Edward Island; there is no allegation of any other or further work done in the City by the defendant, and it is not assessed by the plain tiff City in respect to any property or in any way, except the said tax in respect to the said contract.\n\u201c9. The question for the Court is whether or not the defendant is liable to pay the tax claimed and more particularly:\n(1) Is the tax \"indirect taxation,\" and so ultra vires?\n(2) Is the tax an interference with the status and powers of Dominion Companies, and so ultra vires? If not ultra vires for this reason, is it enforceable against the defendant, a Dominion Company? (3) Is the tax an interference with \u201cTrade and Commerce,\" and so ultra vires?\n(4) Is it taxation \"within the Province\" within the meaning of the British North America Act, 1867?\n(5) Is the by-law ultra vires the statute in professing to tax an isolated transaction?\"\nThe judges in the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island were unanimous in holding that the tax in dispute was \"indirect taxation,\" and we agree with their conclusion on this point.\nThe by-law declares that the tax is to be a \"direct\" one, but it is needless to say that the point does not turn on the language used in the enactment. As was observed in Caledonian Collieries Limited v. The King ([2]), to label the tax as a direct tax does not affect the substance of the matter.\nThe question of \"direct taxation\" as defining the sphere of provincial legislation has often been the subject of pronouncements by this Court and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The effect of the decisions, when analyzed, is substantially as follows:\nIn every case, the first requisite is to ascertain the inherent character of the tax, whether it is in its nature a direct tax within the meaning of section 92, head 2, of the British North America Act, 1867 (Attorney-General for British Columbia v. McDonald Murphy Lumber Co. Ltd. ([3]); City of Halifax v. Fairbanks' Estate ([4]) ). The problem is primarily one of law; and the Act is to be construed according to the ordinary canons of construction: the court must ascertain the intention of Parliament when it made the broad distinction between direct and indirect taxation. At the time of the passing of the Act,\u2014and before,\u2014the classification of the then existing species of taxes into these two separate and distinct categories was familiar to states men. Certain taxes were then universally recognized as falling within one or the other category. The framers of the Act should not be taken to have intended to disturb \"the established classification of the old and well known species of taxation.\" (City of Halifax v. Fairbanks' Estate ([5]).)\nCustoms or excise duties were the classical type of in direct taxes. Taxes on property or income were commonly regarded as direct taxes (Fairbanks case ([6])).\nThese taxes had come to be placed respectively in the category of direct or indirect taxes according to some tangible dividing line referable to and ascertainable by their general tendencies. (Bank of Toronto v. Lambe ([7]).)\nAs applied, however, to taxes outside these well recognized classifications, the meaning of the words \" direct taxation,\" as used in the Act, is to be gathered from the common understanding of these words which prevailed among the economists who had treated such subjects before the Act was passed (Attorney-General for Quebec v. Reed ([8]) ); and it is no longer open to discussion, on account of the successive decisions of the Privy Council, that the formula of John Stuart Mill (Political Economy, ed. 1886, vol. II, p. 415) has been judicially adopted as affording a guide to the application of section 92, head 2 (Fairbanks case ([9]).) Mill's definition was held to embody \"the most obvious indicia of direct and indirect taxation\" and was accepted as providing a logical basis for the distinction to be made between the two. (Bank of Toronto v. Lambe ([10]).) The expression \"indirect taxation\" connotes the idea of a tax imposed on a person who is not supposed to bear it himself but who will seek to re cover it in the price charged to another. And Mill's canon is founded on the theory of the ultimate incidence of the tax, not the ultimate incidence depending upon the special circumstances of individual cases, but the incidence of the tax in its ordinary and normal operation. It may be possible in particular cases to shift the burden of a direct tax, or it may happen, in particular circumstances, that it might be economically undesirable or practically impossible to pass it on. (The King v. Caledonian Collieries, Limited ([11]).) It is the normal or general tendency of the tax that will determine, and the expectation or the intention that the person from whom the tax is demanded shall indemnify himself at the expense of another might be inferred from the form in which the tax is imposed or from the results which in the ordinary course of business transactions must be held to have been contemplated. (Fairbanks case ([12]).)\nLet us now examine the tax in discussion in the light of the principles so laid down.\nIt is a tax on non-resident contractors (and it seemed to be common ground, at the argument, that, by the word \"contractors,\" was meant those who undertake building contracts). It is therefore a tax upon a person working for someone else in respect of the work he does for someone else, (Grain case ([13])), and the amount will be paid by someone else than the person primarily taxed (Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. ([14]) ). The tax is not a direct lump sum imposed yearly as a result of the non-resident engaging in the business of contractor within the city of Charlottetown, it is a tax on every contract or agreement, on each single transaction, graduated on a sliding scale according to the amount of the contract.\nHaving regard to the form of the tax as imposed this case is different in almost every respect from those of Bank of Toronto v. Lambe ([15]), and of Brewsters and Malsters Association of Ontario v. Attorney-General for Ontario ([16]). In truth, the tax is nothing else but \" the exaction * * * of a percentage duty on services,\" of which Lord Cave said that it \"would ordinarily be regarded\" and should be classified \"as indirect taxation\" ([17]). Such a tax would invariably be an element in the fixing of the price of the contract and, in its normal and general tendency, must be reasonably assumed to pass to the owner, in the ordinary course of the transaction, as enhancement of the cost. That would seem to be, in the end, the natural consequence \u2014in fact, the inevitable result\u2014of the taxation now in question. In the case of Attorney-General for Quebec v. Queen Insurance Co. ([18]), the disputed tax was imposed under cover of a licence to be taken out by insurers. The price of the licence was to be a percentage on the premiums received for insurances. Speaking of that case in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe ([19]), Lord Hobhouse said: \"such a tax would fall within any definition of indirect taxation.\"\nIt was pointed out by the appellant that, in the Fairbanks case ([20]), Lord Cave excluded, as a rule, from the operation of Mill's principle the imposition of municipal and local rates. This, we have no doubt, meant municipal and local rates properly so called. It is idle to mention that a rate is not a municipal rate in the proper sense, merely because it was imposed by a municipality. It must be a municipal rate according to the common understanding of the word. We find it impossible to classify the disputed tax as a municipal tax in that sense.\nIt was further argued that the non-resident contractors would, in the ordinary course, be limited in their contract price by the competition of resident contractors and would be forced to absorb the tax. A similar argument was advanced in The King v. Caledonian Collieries, Limited ([21]) and again put forward in Attorney-General for British Columbia v. McDonald Murphy Lumber Co. Ltd. ([22]), and it was rejected on the ground that the general tendency of the tax remains and it is \"really irrelevant in determining the inherent character of the tax.\"\nThe case was stated for the purpose of determining whether, as a matter of law, the respondent was \"liable to pay the tax claimed.\" The tax was imposed in the by-law. There was no dispute about the statute. Counsel for the respondent stated at bar that he found nothing objection able in the particular section of the city charter. The object of the stated case was to test the validity of the by-law. For the reasons we have stated, our view is that the tax is \"in direct taxation\" and the by-law is ultra vires. That being so, the assessment must be set aside and the action must be dismissed. We need therefore go no further, and it is unnecessary to consider the other questions submitted. The judgment appealed from should be confirmed, with costs to the respondent in this court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: K. M. Martin.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

His appointment was extended (under statutory amendments in 1925, c. 49, and 1927, c. 65), the last extension being for a period of five years from August 17, 1928. By c. 35 of the statutes of 1930, Parliament in effect abolished the Board and provided for the establishment of new tribunals, and appellant thereby lost his said office. He claimed damages from the Crown for breach of contract.\nHeld (affirming judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, [1932] Ex. C.R. 14), that appellant could not succeed.\nAppellant\u2019s appointment to his office, even for a definite period, did not deprive the Crown of the right to terminate the appointment at any time; and a fortiori did not deprive Parliament of the power, by abolishing the office, of automatically terminating the appointment.\nIn an appointment to public office, while there is a contractual element in that the Crown, in effect, promises to pay the salary or other emolument fixed by law for services performed, yet this in no respect affects the Crown\u2019s prerogative right, unless restricted by statute, to dismiss the servant at any time without incurring liability for damages or further compensation. Even if there be a contract of service, the Crown\u2019s absolute power of dismissal is deemed to be imported into it, and nothing short of a statute can restrict that power. APPEAL from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding that the present appellant (petitioner) was not entitled to the relief sought by his Petition of Right.\nThe appellant claimed from the Crown a sum for damages for alleged breach of contract.\nSection 10 of An Act to Amend the Pension Act, chapter 62 of the Statutes of Canada, 1923, provided for the creation of a Board, to be known as \u201cThe Federal Appeal Board,\u201d the members to be appointed by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, to hear certain appeals with respect to pensions, etc. It was provided that the chairman should hold office during pleasure; that of the members first appointed, other than the chairman, one-half should be appointed for a term of two years and the others for a term of three years; that the chairman should be paid a salary of $7,000 per annum and each of the other members $6,000 per annum.\nBy amendment to the said statute, contained in chapter 49 of the Statutes of 1925, it was provided that the members first appointed (other than the chairman) should be eligible for re-appointment for a further term of two years, should the Governor in Council deem it advisable. By a further amendment to the statute, contained in chapter 65 of the Statutes of 1926-1927, it was provided that the members first appointed (other than the chairman) should be eligible for re-appointment for such further terms, not to exceed five years, as the Governor in Council might deem advisable.\nBy Order in Council of August 17, 1923 (P.C. 1620), and by letters patent under the great seal of Canada, dated August 17, 1923, the appellant was appointed as a member of the Board for a term of three years. By Order in Council of June 4, 1926 (P.C. 882) his term of appointment was extended to a term of five years from August 17, 1923. By Order in Council of August 16, 1928 (P.C. 1506) his term of appointment was extended for a period of five years from August 17, 1928, (with a proviso \u201cthat the appointment of any of the said members may be terminated at any time in the event of reduction in the Board\u2019s Work to an extent sufficient to permit of its performance by fewer Commissioners\u201d).\nBy chapter 35 of the Statutes of Canada, 1930, entitled An Act to Amend the Pension Act, the enactments relating to the constitution of the Federal Appeal Board were repealed, and provision was made for the establishment of new tribunals. Said c. 35 of the Statutes of 1930 received the royal assent on May 30, 1930, and the provisions thereof came into force, as provided by s. 17 thereof, on October 1, 1930.\nIn his Petition of Right, the appellant alleged (inter alia) that he accepted the appointment and extensions and took up residence in Ottawa in August, 1923, and continuously carried out, until some time in October, 1930, the duties prescribed for him; that he had duly declared himself to be, and was, still willing and able to carry out any duties, obligations or requirements arising out of the said employment; that on October 10, 1930, he was requested to vacate the premises which were allotted to him in August, 1923, for the performance of his duties as a member of the Board, and received a communication that the Federal Appeal Board was abolished and that all legal right of any member of the Board to any salary or emoluments would cease as of October 1, 1930.\nThe appellant\u2019s claim was against the Crown for damages for alleged breach of contract. Maclean J.[2] held that he could not succeed; and he appealed to this Court.\nR. Quain K.C. and J. T. Wilson for the appellant.\nA. E. Fripp K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret, Lamont and Orde (ad hoc) JJ. was delivered by\nOrde J. (ad hoc),\u2014The sole question here is whether or not, by virtue of the legislation creating the office and the nature of his appointment thereto, the appellant acquired a contractual or other vested right to the office and its emoluments.\nIt is argued that there was a contract between the appellant and the Crown for the performance by the appellant of the duties of the office during the period of time covered by his commission and for the payment by the Crown of the statutory salary therefor, and that the Grown cannot escape its liability in respect therefor merely because Parliament abolished the office.\nWhether the Crown might not so bind itself by contract to pay for specific services over a certain period as to incur liability for a breach thereof is not the question here. Assuming the possibility of such a contract, was there any such contract in the present case?\nI find it difficult to see in what way the appointment of the appellant to be a member of the Federal Appeal Board under the Pension Act as it then stood differed from many other appointments to offices under the Crown. It was urged during the argument that the earlier negotiations or communications between the Minister and the appellant, which culminated in the Order in Council authorizing the appointment, constituted, by way of offer and acceptance, a contract binding upon the Crown. But the circumstances leading up to the appointment did not differ materially from those which must accompany most appointments to public offices, and I cannot see how they distinguished this appointment from any other.\nThere is, of course, in every appointment to public office a contractual element in that the Crown, in effect, promises to pay the salary or other emolument fixed by law for services performed. But this in no respect affects the Crown\u2019s prerogative right, unless restricted by statute, to dismiss the servant at any time without liability for damages or further compensation.\nThe principles governing appointments to civil offices under the Crown are summarized in Robertson\u2019s Civil Proceedings By and Against the Crown, at p. 359. Even if there be a contract of service, the Crown\u2019s absolute power of dismissal is deemed to be imported into it, and nothing short of a statute can restrict that power.\nHere there was no dismissal from office by the Crown in the ordinary sense. Parliament abolished the office. The power of the Crown to abolish a civil office and thereby to deprive the holder thereof of any right to further compensation is recognized in Young v. Waller[3]. If in cases where its power is not restricted by statute the Crown may abolish an office, a fortiori Parliament which created it must surely possess the power.\nIt was argued that, notwithstanding the abolition of the offices, it must be assumed that Parliament did not intend to deprive those appointed thereto of their vested rights. In other words, that, in the absence of some express statutory provision to the contrary, the rights of the holders of the abolished offices to damages or compensation as upon a breach of contract were implicitly reserved. No authority for this as a general principle was cited, but reliance was placed upon the provisions of sec. 19 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. (1927), ch. 1, which preserves rights, privileges, obligations and liabilities acquired, accrued, accruing or incurred under a repealed Act. But this argument begs the question. If there is no right there is nothing to preserve. If the appellant\u2019s appointment to his office even for a definite period did not deprive the Crown of the right to terminate the appointment at any time, and a fortiori did not deprive Parliament of the power, by abolishing the office, of automatically terminating the appointment, what right was there to preserve?\nThe judgment of the learned President of the Exchequer Court is right, and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nCannon J.\u2014The fundamental rule of our constitution requires that the legislative, executive and judicial branches of our body politic must be kept distinct and respect the independence of one another. No tribunal can interfere with the free agency of one or, as in this case, two of the constituent parts of the sovereign powder. We cannot interfere with the dismissal by the Executive, following the abolition by Parliament of plaintiff\u2019s office, although the plaintiff\u2019s commission may be read as indicating that the right of the Crown to terminate his engagement at any time has seemingly not been imported in the order in council which extended his term of office for a definite period of five years from August 17, 1928.\nBlackstone, No. 243, says that the subjects of England are not totally destitute of remedy, in case the Crown should invade their rights by private injuries: If any person has, in point of property, a just demand upon the King, he must petition him in his court of chancery, where his councellor will administer right as a matter of grace, though not upon compulsion. And this is entirely consonant to what is laid down by the writers on natural law. \u201cA subject, says Puffendorf (Law of N. and N.B. viii, c. 10), so long as he continues a subject, has no way to oblige his prince to give him his due, when he refuses it; though no wise prince will ever refuse to stand to a lawful contract. And if the prince gives the subject leave to enter an action against him, upon such contract, in his own courts, the action itself proceeds rather upon natural equity than upon the municipal laws.\u201d For the end of such action is not to compel the prince to observe the contract, but to persuade him.\nWe cannot do more. Let Parliament remedy appellant\u2019s wrong if they see fit, but the Exchequer Court and this Court cannot enforce the demand of the Petition of Right; and the appeal must be dismissed with costs, if respondent will exact them.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Quain & Wilson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

At a point in Forest Hill it was carried over a ravine by a bridge under which a railway (under Dominion jurisdiction) crossed the street. The bridge was 500 feet beyond the nearest point of the Toronto city limits. The Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, on application of the Village of Forest Hill, authorized reconstruction of the bridge, and directed that the City of Toronto contribute to the cost. The City appealed. Held: The Board had not jurisdiction under the Railway Act to direct that the City contribute to the cost of the work. There were no circumstances to warrant a holding that the City was \u201cinterested or affected\u201d by the Board\u2019s order, within the meaning of the Act.\nThe Railway Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 170, ss. 256, 39, 259, 33 (5), considered. Toronto Ry. Co. v. Toronto, [1920] A.C. 426, at 437, and Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Toronto Transportation Commission, [1930] A.C. 686, cited ; and other cases referred to and discussed. Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co., [1908] A.C. 54, distinguished.\nQuaere whether, in any case, under the circumstances in question, the reconstruction of the bridge was not a matter merely of \u201cstreet improvement\u201d (British Columbia Electric Ry. Co. v. Vancouver, etc., Ry. & Nav. Co. et al, [1914] A.C. 1067); whether the order did not deal with matters which, in their essence, fell under the category of \u201cmunicipal\u201d rather than that of \u201crailway\u201d?\nAPPEAL by the City of Toronto from an order (No. 47439, dated 25th September, 1931) of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada[1] which authorized the Village of Forest Hill (the applicant) to construct a certain bridge, replacing an existing bridge, whereby the roadway of Eglington Avenue was carried over a railway of the Canadian National Railways, and directed (inter alia) that the City of Toronto contribute to the cost of the construction.\nLeave to appeal was granted by the Board, and was also granted by a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada. The appeal was upon the following question:\n\u201cHad the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, under the circumstances of this case, jurisdiction under the Railway Act (Canada) to provide in Order No. 47439, dated 25th day of September, A.D. 1931, that the City of Toronto should contribute to the cost of the work referred to in said order?\u201d\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Smith J. now reported. The question submitted was answered by this Court in the negative and the appeal was allowed with costs to the appellant against the village of Forest Hill.\nG. R. Geary K.C. and J. N. Herapath for the appellant.\nMelville Grant for the respondent, Village of Forest Hill.\nAlistair Fraser K.C. for the respondent, Canadian National Railways. Duff J.\u2014I concur with my brother Smith.\nI am unable to agree that the decision under appeal can be supported by the judgment of the Privy Council in Toronto Corporation v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[2].\nThe question which is the governing question in this case, whether, namely, the municipality was \u201ca person interested or affected by the order,\u201d within the meaning of the statute, was disposed of by the Lords of the Judicial Committee, by reference to the reasons of Meredith J.A., in the Court of Appeal[3], in which they agreed. Those reasons are as follows:\nThis case is governed by that of In re Canadian Pacific Railway Company and York, in this Court[4], and that of Toronto v. Grand Trunk, etc., in the Supreme Court of Canada[5]. They are all quite the same in principle. The fact that the territorial limits of the City of Toronto did not extend beyond the southerly limit of the land of the railway company, and that their power over the highway in question ends there, cannot deprive them of interest in a source of great danger to persons travelling upon the highway but a few yards beyond that part of it which is vested in them, and with the keeping of which in repair they are charged. If, instead of the railway, there were a pit or a precipice there, could it be said that they had no duty to protect those lawfully using the highway against its danger? That, because it happened to be in the next parish, they were not concerned, in any way, with that danger? The road, over which they have control, is a paved invitation to the public to use it up to almost the very point of greatest danger; and up to lesser, but still considerable, danger before passing beyond their limits. We are not concerned in the extent of their interest, but that they have a substantial interest in the safety of that level crossing seems to me indisputable, unless indeed they can, and until they do, stop up the highway at their limits. It is a case of doing that, or adopting some other means of protecting traffic upon the highway either going out of or coming into the City, the highway being an invitation to use it each way. Whether the railway company, or the railway company and the other corporation, should pay the whole of the cost of necessary protection, or the bulk of it, is not a question for consideration here. The appellants are interested, and that is all that need be determined.\nIt requires no argument to shew that these reasons have no application to this case.\nIt was admitted by Mr. Grant, in the course of his most able argument, that the principle for which he contended was that all municipalities in which traffic passing over the bridge in question would normally originate, in substantial magnitude, would be subject to the jurisdiction of the Board as being \u201cpersons interested or affected by the order.\u201d That is a principle, in my opinion, not laid down or contemplated by the statute.\nI express no opinion whatever as to whether, if the Corporations of the City of Toronto and the County of York were, respectively, \u201cpersons interested or affected by the order,\u201d within the meaning of the statute, the order of which that before us is a type is one of the kind authorized by the provisions in question. There is something at least to be said for the view that it deals with matters which, in their essence, fall under the category of \u201cmunicipal\u201d rather than that of \u201crailway.\u201d\nThe appeal should be allowed and the order set aside with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nSmith J.\u2014This is an appeal from the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners of Canada authorizing the applicant, the Village of Forest Hill, to construct an overhead bridge on Eglington Avenue and Spadina Road.\nThe order directed that the Canadian National Railway Company pay $20,000 toward the construction of this bridge, and that the remainder of the cost be paid by the applicant, the City of Toronto and the Township of York, the consideration of their respective contributions being reserved until after completion of the bridge.\nThe appellant appeals on the ground that there was no jurisdiction in the Board to direct the City to contribute to the cost of the proposed bridge.\nEglington Avenue is an original road allowance running easterly and westerly through the northern part of the city of Toronto and of the village of Forest Hill, and, to the east of Toronto, through the town of Leaside and on through the township of North York. To the west of Forest Hill it runs through the township of York to the towns of Mount Forest and Weston.\nAt a point in Forest Hill this avenue is carried over a ravine by a bridge, under which the Toronto Belt Line Railway, now owned by the Canadian National Railway Company, crosses the avenue. Spadina Road to the north joins the avenue at the bridge, but continues south from the avenue at a short distance west of the bridge. This bridge was built by the Belt Line Railway Company in 1890, the location being then in the township of York, but now in the village of Forest Hill. North of the avenue it is about 500 feet west of the westerly limit of the part of the city of Toronto that was formerly North Toronto; and south of the avenue it is about 2,000 feet west of the westerly limit of the city of Toronto; and it is about one mile north of the northerly limit of Toronto.\nThe avenue has been widened to 86 feet and paved to a width of 54 feet through Toronto and Forest Hill, except a short piece in Forest Hill which, with the part forming a boundary between Forest Hill and the Township of York, it is intended to complete during the present summer.\nThe question is:\n\u201cHad the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, under the circumstances of this case, jurisdiction under the Railway Act (Canada) to provide in Order No. 47439, dated 25th day of September, A.D. 1931, that the City of Toronto should contribute to the cost of the work referred to in said order?\u201d\nThe order of the Board is made under the powers granted by sec. 256 of the Railway Act, R.S.C., 1927, ch. 170, subsections 1 and 2 of which are as follows:\n256. Upon any application for leave to construct a railway upon, along or across any highway, or to construct a highway along or across any railway, the applicant shall submit to the Board a plan and profile showing the portion of the railway and highway affected.\n(2) The Board may, by order, grant such application in whole or in part and upon such terms and conditions as to protection, safety and convenience of the public as the Board deems expedient, or may order that the railway be carried over, under or along the highway, or that the highway be carried over, under or along the railway, or that the railway or highway be temporarily or permanently diverted, or that such other work be executed, watchmen or other persons employed, or measures taken as under the circumstances appear to the Board best adapted to remove or diminish the danger or obstruction, in the opinion of the Board, arising or likely to arise in respect of the granting of the application in whole or in part in connection with the crossing applied for, or arising or likely to arise in respect thereof in connection with any existing crossing.\nThe power to apportion the cost of the work among corporations, municipalities and persons is derived from sections 39 and 259 of the Act, which are as follows:\n39. When the Board, in the exercise of any power vested in it, in and by any order directs or permits any structure, appliances, equipment, works, renewals, or repairs to be provided, constructed, reconstructed, altered, installed, operated, used or maintained, it may, except as otherwise expressly provided, order by what company, municipality or person, interested or affected by such order, as the case may be, and when or within what time and upon what terms and conditions as to the payment of compensation or otherwise, and under what supervision, the same shall be provided, constructed, reconstructed, altered, installed, operated, used and maintained.\n(2) The Board may, except as otherwise expressly provided, order by whom, in what proportion, and when, the cost and expenses of providing, constructing, reconstructing, altering, installing and executing such structures, equipment, works, renewals, or repairs, or of the supervision, if any, or of the continued operation, use or maintenance thereof, or of otherwise complying with such order, shall be paid.\n259. Notwithstanding anything in this Act, or in any other Act, the Board may, subject to the provisions of the next following section of this Act, order what portion, if any, of cost is to be borne respectively by the company, municipal or other corporation, or person in respect of any order made by the Board, under any of the last three preceding sections, and such order shall be binding on and enforcible against any railway company, municipal or other corporation or person named in such order.\nIn delivering judgment in Toronto Railway Co. v. Toronto City[6], Viscount Finlay, discussing sections 59 (now 39) and 238 (3) (now sec. 259), says, at page 437:\nWhatever be the construction of this subsection (238 (3), now 259), there is nothing in it to put an end to the application of s. 59 (now 39) to orders under ss. 237 and 238 (now 256 and 257). The power given by s. 59 applies in the case of any order made by the Board in the exercise of any power vested in it by the Railway Act. As ss. 237 and 238 (now 256 and 257) are part of the Railway Act, it follows that s. 59 (now 39) applies to orders made under them.\nThe judgment delivered by Lord Macmillan in Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Toronto Transportation Commission[7], quotes from these remarks of Viscount Finlay, and holds (p. 696) that they apply to the present sections 39 and 259; and that an order may be made only on a company, municipality or person interested or affected by the order directing the works.\nSection 33 (5) of the Act is as follows:\n5. The decision of the Board as to whether any company, municipality or person is or is not a party interested within the meaning of this section shall be binding and conclusive upon all companies, municipalities and persons.\nDealing with the provisions of this section, his Lordship, at the same page (696) says:\nThe finality provisions quoted above from the Railway Act have not in the past been held to preclude the Courts in Canada or their Lordships\u2019 Board in other cases from determining on appeal as a question of law whether a company, municipality or person was interested or affected within the meaning of the statute so as to confer jurisdiction on the Railway Board.\nThis disposes of the contrary view expressed in The County of Carleton v. The City of Ottawa[8].\nThe sole question to be determined as a question of law in this appeal is whether or not the City of Toronto, under the circumstances, is a municipality interested or affected by the order in question.\nThe Board apparently came to the conclusion that the City was interested or affected mainly on the report of its engineer. After reciting the facts already set out as to the location, width and paving of the street, he says that it is bound to carry a heavy traffic from municipality to municipality, and the 2,600 feet within Forest Hill is much like a bridge between two larger municipalities. He goes on to say that the present bridge is an unsightly structure, but, if the street were not being widened, it would be adequate to take care of the traffic for some time to come, but the municipalities want to improve conditions and want a wider and better looking bridge, and that the improvements will bring more traffic over the crossing.\nThese are the grounds on which he recommends that the Eglington Avenue section of the bridge be paid for in part by the City of Toronto. The Village of Forest Hill is widening and paving this avenue running through the town, and it is said that the \u201cprotection, safety and convenience of the public\u201d require that this bridge, which is part of the street, should also be widened and paved.\nThe public belongs to no particular municipality, but may come from, all municipalities. Each municipality ordinarily is bound to keep in a condition of safety its own streets, but the Board under the Railway Act in some special circumstances may order one municipality to contribute to the cost of works in another, but only where the outside municipality is interested or affected. How is the City of Toronto interested or affected by the construction of this bridge in Forest Hill in any way fundamentally different from the way in which any other outside municipality is interested or affected?\nIt is said that Toronto adjoins Forest Hill and the street is continued from one municipality to the other. It is also continued across East View and the Township of North York to the east. Are these municipalities also interested or affected, and had the Board jurisdiction in its discretion to assess part of the cost on them also?\nCounsel for Forest Hill complained that because of what was said by Mr. Geary, as quoted by the Chairman of the Board, he was precluded from offering evidence as to the origin and volume of traffic likely to use the bridge. He thought he could have established that much traffic over the bridge would originate largely with people of the northern and western part of the city, making use of this avenue and Spadina Road as a main connecting link between these parts of the city. In my opinion this, if a fact, would not affect the question in the slightest degree, as the matter of where traffic over the structure originates and the volume of it from various districts is not a factor in deciding whether or not a particular municipality, is interested or affected by the works within the meaning of the Act.\nToronto Corporation v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[9] establishes that a duty which a municipality owes to people for their protection, safety and convenience may furnish a ground for holding that municipality to be one interested or affected by works ordered to be constructed.\nThere the southerly limit of the lands of the Railway Company outside the City of Toronto adjoined the northerly limit of a city street. It was held that the fact that the power of the city did not extend beyond its limits did not deprive it of interest in a source of great danger to persons travelling on the city highway, but a few yards beyond it.\nThe principle on which the decision rests is stated in the following passage[10]:\nIf, instead of the railway, there were a pit or a precipice there, could it be said that they (the city) had no duty to protect those lawfully using the highway against its danger? That, because it happened to be in the next parish, they were not concerned, in any way, with that danger? The road over which they have control is a paved invitation to the public to use it up to almost the very point of greatest danger; and up to lesser, but still considerable, danger before passing beyond their limits. Surely the Corporation of the City of Toronto is under no duty to provide for the protection, safety and convenience of people using this bridge 500 feet beyond the nearest point of the city limits, the City having no special interest in that part of the Forest Hill street different from its interest in other parts of the street there.\nMr. Geary argued that the work of reconstructing the bridge was a matter merely of street improvement, and was not necessitated by any consideration of \u201cprotection, safety and convenience of the public,\u201d citing British Columbia Electric Railway Co. v. Vancouver, Victoria & Eastern Ry. & Nav. Co. et al.[11].\nThe learned Chairman of the Board describes this as a unique decision, and one which this Court and the Judicial Committee has ever since been attempting to distinguish or explain. He analyzes a number of cases in which he considers this has been done, and relies upon them as supporting the Board\u2019s decision that in this case Toronto is a municipality interested or affected by the order.\nIn two of these cases, viz., The Toronto Railway Co. v. The Corporation of the City of Toronto et al.[12] (Avenue Road), and Toronto Railway Company v. The City of Toronto[13] (Queen Street) already referred to, the tracks of the Toronto Railway Company on city streets crossed on the level the tracks of Dominion railways. The Board, in the first of these cases, ordered that the street be carried under the C.P.R. tracks, and in the other ordered that the street be carried over three Dominion railway tracks by a bridge. The sole question was whether or not the Toronto Railway Company was a company interested or affected by the orders, and it was held that it was such a company.\nI am unable to see that these decisions have any bearing on the present issue. There seems to me to be no similarity or analogy, as the Toronto Railway tracks were on the spot, contributing to the danger intended to be removed by the orders.\nFinally, Toronto Transportation Commission v. Canadian National Railways[14], dealing with the part known as Main Street Bridge, is cited, and the learned Chairman of the Board states that it appears to him to be indistinguishable in its facts from the present case. There, in July, 1920, the Railway Board ordered the construction of a new bridge carrying Main Street in Toronto over the railway tracks. The Transportation Commission was not then in existence, and there were no tracks over the old bridge. In 1922, the Commission commenced to extend their tracks over the new bridge and, on protest to the Board by the Railway Company, the Commission applied to the Board for permission to cross, and, on October 10, 1922, obtained temporary permission under which they laid their tracks and continued to operate cars over the bridge. In 1926 the Board granted the Railway Company\u2019s application for a rehearing, and at this hearing ordered the Commission to pay ten per cent of the cost. The judgment states that if the Commission had been running cars over the bridge at the time of the original order for construction of the new bridge, it would undoubtedly have been a company interested. The difficulty was whether or not the Transportation Commission, not being interested at the time of the original order, could be brought in at the rehearing and compelled to pay a part of the cost because in the meantime it had become a user of the new bridge. It was held that part of the cost could be allocated to the Commission because it was interested at the date of the rehearing and new allocation. This again seems to me to have no bearing on the present issue.\nMr. Geary\u2019s argument that the construction of the new bridge is a matter merely of street improvement does not seem to be disposed of by the three cases just referred to, as there is no similarity of facts.\nThe report of the Board\u2019s engineer shows that there was no condition of danger at the time of making the order, as the bridge was adequate to take care of the traffic for some time to come. The ground on which the order for a new bridge was sought, as he puts it, was that the municipalities want to improve conditions and want a wider and better looking bridge, which means that a great deal more traffic will use the overhead crossing. Toronto, of course, is not one of the municipalities that is seeking this improvement. Forest Hill wished to widen its street, of which the bridge was a part, and expected more traffic over it in consequence. It is difficult to discover any difference of object in widening the bridge and widening the rest of the street.\nIn any case, I am of opinion that no circumstance has been shown that warrants a holding that the City of Toronto is a municipality interested or affected by the works mentioned in the order within the meaning of the Act.\nI would therefore answer the question submitted in the negative, and would allow the appeal with costs to the appellant against the respondent the Village of Forest Hill.\nQuestion submitted answered in the negative, and appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

Duff J. expressed no opinion.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1932] 1 W.W.R. 912) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] setting aside the conviction of the respondent.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nJ. A. Ritchie K.C. for the appellant.\nMichael Garber for the respondent.\nThe judgments of Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ. were rendered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The Crown appeals by leave of Smith J. given under section 1025 of the Criminal Code. That section reads :\n1025. Either the Attorney-General of the province or any person convicted of an indictable offence may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of any court of appeal setting aside or affirming a conviction of an indictable offence, if the judgment appealed from conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case, and if leave to appeal is granted by a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada within twenty-one days after the judgment appealed from is pronounced, or within such extended time thereafter as the judge to whom the application is made may for special reasons allow.\nAlthough at first disposed to think that the order of Smith J. might be conclusive as to the existence of conflict between the judgment a quo and that of some \" other court of appeal in a like cause,\" on consideration of the above quoted section of the Code, I find that there really are two conditions precedent to the right of appeal here, viz., (a) that there is, in fact, conflict between the judgment a quo and the judgment of a court of appeal in a like case, and, (b) that leave to appeal be granted by a judge of this court. The latter condition was, undoubtedly, complied with; but the Court must be independently satisfied of the existence of the former. The case cited by Smith J., (Rex v. Boak[2] ), is probably distinguishable from that at bar, in so far as it relates to disqualification of a petit juror, inasmuch as in that case, as was pointed out in the judgment of this Court, the fact of such disqualification was known to the prisoner and his counsel during the trial. Indeed, it would seem from the judgment delivered that the juror's deafness had been canvassed before the trial judge; yet no objection on that ground was taken to the trial proceeding. But there does seem to be a clear conflict between the decision a quo and the decision of the Court of King's Bench for Quebec in Rex v. Battista[3]. Other cases could, no doubt, be found in which there were decisions along similar lines to that given in Rex v. Battista[4] . For instance, see Brisebois v. Reginam[5] ; whereas Rex v. McCrae[6] may be cited in support of the view taken by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, although, in that case, differing from the Boak case[7] , the presence of a disqualified juror had been complained of before verdict was rendered. See too R. v. Feore[8] .\nIn the result, it would seem that the conflict between the decisions in the Battista case (2) and in that at bar justified the granting of leave to appeal, and that, consequently, there is jurisdiction here to entertain this appeal.\nThe present appeal is from an order of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia setting aside the conviction of the respondent Stewart on the ground that one of the jurors at the trial was disqualified by reason of clause (c)of section 6 of The Jury Act (R.S.B.C, c. 123), which provides that,\n6. Every person coming within any of the classes following shall be absolutely disqualified for service as a juror, that is to say:\u2014\n(c) Persons convicted of indictable offences, unless they have obtained a free pardon.\nIt is common ground that the case falls within this clause. The only question would seem to be whether or not the fact of a defect of this kind in the constitution of the petit jury, afforded ground for an appeal to the Court of Appeal in view of the provisions of section 1011 Cr. C., no objection to it having been taken at the trial. There is nothing before us to shew that both counsel for the prisoner and the prisoner himself, were ignorant of this disqualification in question during the trial (Rex v. Boak[9] ) ; but that this was the case may be assumed since the Crown does not rely on this objection to the appeal, counsel representing the Crown conceding indeed, as he did at bar, that both the prisoner and his counsel at the trial were unaware of the fact of this disqualification.\nI see no reason why the provisions of section 1011 of the Criminal Code should not apply to this case. That section reads as follows:\n1011. No omission to observe the directions contained in any Act as respects the qualification, selection, balloting or distribution of jurors, the preparation of the jurors' book, the selecting of jury lists or the striking of special juries shall be ground for impeaching any verdict, or shall be allowed for error upon any appeal to be brought upon any judgment rendered in any criminal case.\nThere can be no doubt that this section is intended to apply to the case of a petit juror since it deals with a \" ground for impeaching any verdict\" and \" error upon any appeal to be brought upon a judgment rendered in any criminal case.\" The effect of s. 1011 is, after verdict, to preclude an appeal on the ground, inter alia, of disqualification of a petit juror, no complaint thereof having been made at the trial. That section, in our opinion, is applicable and was conclusive against the right of appeal to the Court of Appeal in the case at bar.\nMoreover, section 1010 Cr. C. provides that,\n1010. Judgment, after verdict upon an indictment for any offence against this Act, shall not be stayed or reversed,\n(d) because any person has served upon the jury who was not returned as a juror by the sheriff or other officer.\nIf the fact, that a person who sat to try a case had no right to be in the jury box because not returned as a juror, cannot be taken advantage of, after verdict, as a ground of appeal, a fortiori, we think that a disqualification of a person on the list who serves as a petit juror, taken for the first time only after verdict, must likewise be insufficient to warrant an appeal. We entirely agree with the decision in Rex v. Battista[10] .\nThe case of Bureau v. Regem (the latest authority to which we are referred)[11] is entirely distinguishable from that at bar on two grounds, viz., (a) that case had to do with a grand jury and not a petit jury, and (b) the appellant there would appear to have made every effort possible during the trial to have effect given to his objection.\nApart altogether from any ground of appeal based on s. 1010 (d), as above stated, s. 1011 of the Criminal Code is conclusive against the appeal to the Court of Appeal in this case. The appeal to this Court will, accordingly, be allowed and the judgment of the trial court restored.\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal involves the construction and application of section 1011 of the Criminal Code, which reads as follows:\nNo omission to observe the directions contained in any Act as respects the disqualification, selection, balloting or distribution of jurors, the preparation of the jurors' book, the selecting of jury lists or the striking of special juries, shall be a ground for impeaching any verdict, or shall be allowed for error upon any appeal to be brought upon any judgment rendered in any criminal case.\nThe relevant B.C. enactments (R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 123, secs. 10, 15 and 6) are, in substance, these:\nSection 10 of the Act directs the selector to select, from the last revised voters' list for the county, the requisite number of persons resident in the county, to serve as grand and petit jurors for the next succeeding year.\nSection 15 directs the selectors to meet and hold meetings annually commencing on the first Monday in July for the purpose of selecting a preliminary list of persons liable to serve as jurors.\nSection 6 enumerates certain classes of persons, who, although their names appear on the last revised list of voters, are disqualified from service as a juror, inter alia, (c)\n*** persons convicted of indictable offences, unless they have obtained a free pardon ***.\nOne of the jurymen who tried the respondent was afterwards discovered to be a person who had been convicted of an indictable offence, within the meaning of section 6. On this ground, that is to say, on the ground that this juryman was disqualified to act as such, the Court of Appeal for British Columbia quashed the conviction.\nThe question before us is whether or not this decision can be sustained, in view of the terms of section 1011, above quoted. In my opinion the gist of the complaint upon which the respondent's objection is founded is of such a character as to bring the objection within the language of section 1011. The complaint is founded on the failure of the selectors to observe the directions of the Jury Act, who are authorized and required to select, for the jury lists, persons liable to be called upon to serve as jurors. The Act plainly excludes from the classes of persons which it was competent to the selectors to select, persons who have been guilty of an indictable offence, and who have not received free pardon therefor. It is to this default that must be ascribed the fact that the disqualified juryman was called to serve and did serve as one of the jury on the trial of the accused. No wrong against the respondent is alleged in respect of the trial, except the fact that the juryman, being disqualified for the reasons mentioned, was present on the jury. I should have thought, especially having regard to the observations of Channel, J. in Montreal Street Ry. Co. v. Normandin (1), delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, that in the absence of some such provision as section 1011, the presence of this disqualified juryman would have been sufficient ground for quashing the conviction. But in my opinion, that particular illegality is one of the class contemplated by that section, and, therefore, the objection is not open to the respondent.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A.

Between going into occupation under the agreement in August, 1919, and determination on the part of the Board to rescind the agreement in April, 1929, the respondent defaulted in payments and neglected proper husbandry of the property. The agreement was rescinded by resolution of the Board on the 8th of August, 1929. The respondent brought an action, by petition of right, to recover the land and chattels of which he had been dispossessed and for damages for depreciation of the same. The Exchequer Court of Canada held that the respondent was not entitled to have the land or chattels returned to him; but that the notice of intention to rescind the agreement had not been given by the Crown sufficiently early to deprive the respondent of damages to be ascertained by the Registrar of that court upon a reference.\nHeld that, under the circumstances of this case, the respondent has established no actionable claim as against the Crown and that the Soldier\u2019s Settlement Act fully authorized the proceedings taken by it.\nHeld also, per Duff, Lament, Smith and Cannon JJ. that, by the effect of section 31 of the Soldier\u2019s Settlement Act, the purchaser who is let into possession becomes tenant at will, and, in respect of possession of the land, has no greater interest than such a purchaser would have had at common law before the Judicature Acts.\nSemble, per Duff, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ., that the reciprocal rights of the parties are by no means to be ascertained (in their entirety) by reference to the equitable principles governing the rights of vendor and purchaser, but chiefly by reference to the provisions of the statute, and especially to section 22 .\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, ([1932] Ex. C. 18) rev.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada (1), dismissing an action by the respondent to recover from the Crown certain lands and chattels of which he had been dispossessed but declaring that he was entitled to damages which were to be ascertained by the Registrar on a reference.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the reasons for judgment given by the President of the Exchequer Court[1].\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and E. Miall for the appellant.\nE. F. Newcombe K.C. for the respondent.\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014I concur in the result of the judgment in this case. I am entirely satisfied that the Crown was right in its contention that, under the circumstances, the statute fully authorized the proceedings taken by it herein.\nThe judgments of Duff, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ. were delivered by Duff J.\u2014The argument on behalf of the Crown has convinced me\u2014contrary to the view I had formed on reading the case\u2014that the respondent has established no actionable claim as against the Crown.\nThe appeal turns upon several sections of the Soldier\u2019s Settlement Act, the principal of which are sections 22 and 31 . My view is that by the effect of section 31 , the purchaser who is let into possession becomes tenant at will, and, in respect of possession of the land, has no greater interest than such a purchaser would have had at common law before the Judicature Acts. As to the respective interests of the parties in the land, that does not really come into question here, but I strongly incline to the view that the reciprocal rights of the parties are by no means to be ascertained (in their entirety), by reference to the equitable principles governing the rights of vendor and purchaser, but chiefly by reference to the provisions of the statute, and especially to section 22 .\nThe Act requires that the terms of the sale shall be set forth in writing, and the agreement before us declares that the provisions of the statute are part of its terms. I regret that this sort of referential declaration should be resorted to. It seems to me that a more satisfactory method would be to state in as simple language as possible what the terms are, and to declare plainly and unequivocally that the contract is such as there set forth. In so far as it is intended to supersede equitable doctrines and to substitute therefor explicit statutory declarations, and especially when it is intended to revive common law doctrines and rules now in practice obsolete, that also should be made manifest.\nBut I cannot perceive that the form of the contract is characterized by any inconsistency with the statute of such a nature as to strike at its validity or effectiveness.\nThe terms of the statute in this view may, at first sight, appear needlessly oppressive. But when one considers the scheme of the Act, as a whole, one sees that the primary purpose of it is to assist and encourage agricultural settlement by former soldiers. The advancement of this purpose is entrusted to the Board, the appellant on this appeal. The main preoccupation of the Board, within the limits laid down in the statute, is to carry out this object and policy. The provisions of section 22 might appear in a first reading and without reference to this policy, to be somewhat arbitrary. But I have no doubt that the framing of these provisions was inspired by the view that the welfare of the deserving settler would be safer in the hands of the Board than if placed exclusively under the protection of a body of legal rules.\nThe appeal is allowed and the petition dismissed. The Crown\u2019s motion for leave is granted, and as terms, the Crown will pay all costs, including the costs of the motions.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

This principle should not be taken to have been altered in the Motor-vehicle Act, except by express words or by necessary intendment. The whole scope of the Act is to prescribe certain requirements for those using the highway with motor vehicles, and to impose certain penalties upon the offenders; it does not provide that they will not be entitled to recover damages, if the damages are suffered while they are infringing the Act.\nGoodison Thresher Co. v. Township of McNab (44 Can. S.C.R. 187) dist.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , affirming the judgment of Morrison C.J.S.C. on the verdict of a jury and maintaining the respondent's action for damages. The respondent recovered from a jury $20,000 damages against the city of Vancouver for the death of her husband, a taxi driver, who was killed consequent upon the motor car crashing through the cement railing upon the viaduct situate on Georgia street, in that city.\nAt the close of the argument, the Supreme Court of Canada announced that it would not interfere with the finding of negligence made by the jury, but reserved judgment on the question whether the deceased's failure to take out a driver's licence under the city by-law, and to obtain a permit from the Chief of Police, as prescribed by the Motor-vehicle Act, disentitled the respondent from recovering.\nG. E. McCrossan K.C. for the appellant.\nJ.W. de B. Farris K.C. for the respondent.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur with my brother Rinfret.\nMy view of the pertinent provision of the Motor-vehicle Act, (R.S.B.C, 1924, c. 177, s. 7, ss. 7, as amended by c. 47, s. 2, 1930), is that its object is to require persons operating motor vehicles for hire to obtain a municipal permit as prescribed, and to make this obligation enforceable through the penal provisions of the Act. We should, in my opinion, pass beyond the scope and intendment of the statute if we were to enlarge these sanctions, by introducing an additional one having the effect of depriving such a person (in case of non-observance of this obligation) of his prima facie right to sue the municipality for negligence in respect of the non-repair of a highway.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgments of Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ. were delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014At the close of the argument, the Court announced that it would not interfere with the finding of negligence made by the jury and that the appeal should be dismissed unless the deceased's failure to take out a driver's licence under the city by-law, and to obtain a permit from the Chief of Police, as prescribed by the Motor-vehicle Act, disentitled the respondent from recovering.\nThe Motor-vehicle Act, of the province of British Columbia (R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 177), is an act respecting the operation of motor-vehicles in that province. It provides for the registration and licensing of these vehicles and for the issuance of chauffeurs' licences. It contains traffic regulations, certain requirements with regard to the age of the driver and to such other things as the equipment of the vehicles or the sale and transfer thereof. Provisions are made for the collection of the registration and licence fees. The statute further specifies in what cases any person \" shall be guilty of an offence against (the) Act,\" the penalties he shall thereby incur and to which he shall be liable, on summary conviction.\nThe particular section of the Act relied on by the appellant reads in part as follows (Motor-vehicle Act Amendment Act, 1930, c. 47 of S.B.C., 1930, s. 2, ss. 2) :\nNo chauffeur shall within any municipality drive, operate or be in charge of a motor-vehicle carrying passengers for hire unless he is the holder of a permit therefor issued to him by the Chief of Police of the municipality; and every chauffeur to whom a permit is so issued shall comply with all such regulations as may be made by the municipality and are not repugnant to the provisions of this Act or the regulations made thereunder.\nThe by-law referred to by the appellant is known as the \" Vehicle Licence By-Law \" (no. 1510 as amended by no. 1537) of the city of Vancouver. It provides for the licensing of certain trades and businesses: auto liveries, expressmen, automobiles used for purposes of business, vehicles used for hire for the carriage of passengers, etc. It describes specifically the classes of motor-vehicles coming under it. It fixes the tariff of fares that may be charged by the owners or drivers of these vehicles and subjects them to a long list of what may be truly termed police regulations.\nUnder s. 3 of the by-law,\nNo person shall carry on, maintain, own, operate, or use any of the several trades, professions, occupations, callings, businesses, vehicles or things set forth in *** this by-law, and more particularly described therein unless and until he has procured a licence to do so (for each such place or business, vehicle or thing operated by him), and shall have paid therefor such sums as are specified in said schedule \" A,\" which sum shall in all cases be paid in advance.\n4. Every person so licensed shall be subject to the provisions of this by-law, and non-compliance with any of the provisions of this by-law shall be deemed to be an infraction of the same, and shall render any person violating any of the said provisions liable to the penalties contained in section 18 hereof. And the section of the by-law on which the appellant mostly relies reads as follows :\n(3) No person shall, after the passing of this by-law, drive or operate, or permit to be driven or operated, on any of the streets of the city any motor vehicle coming within the classes \"C,\" \"D,\" \"E,\" \"F,\" or \"G\" as hereinbefore defined in subsection (1) hereof without being licensed so to do under the provisions of this by-law.\nThe several classes of motor vehicles covered by this subsection come under the general description of vehicles operated for hire.\nIt was not disputed that, at the time of the accident, the deceased's car was being operated for hire. The further undisputed facts are these: Burchill, the deceased, owner and driver of the car, had no licence to operate for hire under the by-law and no permit had been issued to him by the Chief of Police of Vancouver. It is not that he had been denied a licence and was operating his car despite the refusal. He held a licence the previous year, \" but simply had not paid the renewal fee \" and had neglected to take out the licence and to get the permit for \" the current year.\"\nThe question is as to the effect upon this case of Burchill's failure, in the manner just mentioned, to comply with the requirements of the statute and by-law.\nThe point has already been raised and discussed in several cases in the provincial courts (amongst others: Etter v. City of Saskatoon[2] ; Sercombe v. Township of Vaughan[3] ; Godfrey v. Cooper[4] ; Boyer v. Moillet[5] ; Halpin v. Smith[6] ; Walker v. British Columbia Electric Ry.[7] ; Waldron v. Rural Municipality of Elfros[8] ; James v. City of Toronto[9] ) ; but it comes for the first time before this court, at least in its present aspect.\nIt should be said at once that the matter depends primarily upon the language of the peculiar statute. No one would doubt the competency of provincial legislatures, in properly framed legislation, to deny entirely the right of recovery in the circumstances we have described and which happen to exist in this case. Generally speaking, however, legislation of that character does not operate to modify the civil rights of the parties or to relieve them from the consequences of their negligence. It is not intended for that purpose. It is framed alio intuitu; and that is undoubtedly true of the Act and the by-law now under discussion.\nOf the by-law, it is sufficient to say that it is nothing more than the regulation of certain trades. The purpose is to compel to take licences and the sanction is there. It is essentially a municipal enactment containing revenue or police ordinances with their own provisions for enforcement.\nAs for the Motor-vehicle Act, it does not pretend to deal with the liability for actionable negligence. The obvious purpose of the statute is to regulate the user of the highway for the protection of the public. Its object is not to disturb the ordinary rights of individuals or persons as between themselves.\nAt common law and as a member of the public, any individual has the right to the user of the highway under the protection of the law; and the liability of the municipality exists towards every member of the public so using the highway. This well established principle should not be taken to have been altered in the Motor-vehicle Act, except by express words or by necessary intendment. The whole scope of the Act is to prescribe certain requirements for those using the highway with motor vehicles, and to impose certain penalties upon the offenders, but nothing more.\nIt does not provide that they will not be entitled to recover damages, if the damages are suffered while they are infringing the Act.\nAfter all, we are concerned here with an action founded on negligence and, in actions of that kind, the guiding principle\u2014we should say the inevitable principle\u2014is the principle of cause and effect. The liability in such a case is based\u2014and can only be based\u2014upon the causal connection between the tort and the resulting damage. Failure by the plaintiff to comply with a statute, in no way contributing to the accident, will not, in the absence of a specific provision to that effect, defeat the right of recovery of the plaintiff; no more than, under almost similar circumstances, the violation of a statutory prohibition by the defendant will exclude the defence of contributory negligence. (Grand Trunk Pacific Ry. v. Earl)[10] .\nWe will not pause to emphasize the distinction to be made between the present case and that of Goodison Thresher Co. v. Township of McNab[11] . But we may refer to that case as an instance of the application of the principle. There, in the words of Duff J., at p. 194 :\nThe mishap was caused by the failure of the plaintiff's servants to perform the conditions under which alone they were entitled to take the engine upon the bridge.\nThere, as observed by Mr. Justice M. A. McDonald, \" the damage was consequent upon the failure to comply with the Act.\" The damage, in the case at bar, was not caused by the absence of a permit or of a licence. Their absence, under the particular circumstances, did not even show that the deceased was incompetent as a chauffeur; and the jury did not find him incompetent.\nThe appellant draws a distinction, in the premises, between the position of an ordinary defendant and that of a municipality. It points out that the municipality is the owner of the driveway and contends that the respondent's husband, holding no permit and no licence, was unlawfully upon the street, that he was at all times material a trespasser and the appellant owed him no duty other than not to do or cause him malicious or wilful injury; in other words: that Burchill had to take the road as he found it.\nWe are unable to accede to the proposition which would, in that respect, assimilate the municipality to an ordinary land-owner or make a trespasser of the unlicensed chauffeur. Under statutes where the fee simple is vested in them, the municipalities are in a sense owners of the streets. They are not, however, owners in the full sense of the word, and certainly not to the extent that a proprietor owns his land. The land-owner enjoys the absolute right to exclude anyone and to do as he pleases upon his own property. It is idle to say that the municipality has no such rights upon its streets. It holds them as trustee for the public. The streets remain subject to the right of the public to \" pass and repass \"; and that character, of course, is of the very essence of a street. So that the municipality, in respect of its streets, does not stand in the same position as a landowner with regard to his property. Under the Motor- vehicle Act and similar statutes, the situation is really this: that the unlicensed chauffeur, being on the highway as he has a right to be as a member of the public, fails to observe the rules laid down for the direction of those who make use of the highway and passed for the protection of the public, and thereby becomes subject to certain penalties. But the Act has not the effect of making him a trespasser, more particularly in the sense of an outlaw. The fair way of reading this kind of legislation is to ask the question: Does it impose such a legal incapacity as to make the offender a wrongdoer? And the answer is in the negative. The failure to take the licence or the permit is a failure to comply with the Act and the sanction is the penalty.\nWe need only point out that in the particular section of the Act relied on by the appellant and quoted at the beginning of this judgment, the mischief aimed at is not the user of a highway without a license, but the operation for hire without a permit from the Chief of Police. The enactment is directed only against the chauffeur's right to \" drive a motor-vehicle carrying passengers for hire.\" There was no intention to prevent him from using the highway. To borrow the expression of Lord Halsbury in Lowery v. Walker (1), Burchill was certainly\nnot a trespasser in the sense in which that word is strictly and technically used in law.\nThe appeal will be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.B.

The King, [1932] S.C.R. 626\nDate: 1932-06-15\nGeorge Bampton Appellant;\nand\nHis Majesty The King Respondent.\n1932: April 26; 1932: June 15;\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nCriminal law\u2014Club\u2014Benevolent Societies Act, R.S.B.C., 1911, c. 19\u2014Place \" kept for gain\"\u2014Common gaming house\u2014Game of cards played\u2014Criminal Code, section 226\u2014The Societies Act, R.S.B.C., 1914, c. 236.\nThe appellant was steward of a bona fide club organized pursuant to the Benevolent Societies Act (now the Societies Act) of British Columbia. The club had a membership of 1,700 and provided all the regular facilities of a social club, including meals, billiard rooms, reading rooms, various card games, etc.; it also leased and operated a football field. Members contributed ten cents apiece to the funds of the club for each half hour's play at the poker table, irrespective of whether they were winning or losing. This money was not taken from the stakes or the pot, but was collected by the appellant, as steward, from the players and paid over to the club. Only members were allowed in the premises, a by-law expressly forbidding the introduction of visitors to any part of the club property. The appellant was convicted, under section 226 of the Criminal Code, of unlawfully keeping a common gaming house; and the conviction was affirmed by the appellate court.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal ([1932] 1 W.W.R. 154), that, upon the facts, the club was not \"a house *** kept *** for gain \" within the meaning of section 226 Cr. C. and that the appellant had been wrongly convicted.\nR. v. Riley ( (1917) 23 B.C.R. 192 and R. v. Cherry and Long ( (1924) 20 Alta. L.R. 400) approved; R. v. Sullivan ( (1930) 42 B.C.R. 435) overruled.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , maintaining the conviction of the appellant of having kept a common gaming house.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nJ. W. de B. Farris K.C. for the appellant.\nE. F. Newcombe K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgments of Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ. were delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014After careful consideration of this appeal, I am satisfied that the order made by Newcombe J. granting leave herein was providently made and that this court has jurisdiction to entertain this appeal, on the ground of conflict between the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in it and the decision of the same court in R. v. Riley[2] , which, although impliedly overruled in R. v. Sullivan[3] , had in the meantime been followed in R. v. Cherry and Long[4], decided by the Appellate Division of Alberta in 1924. No allusion was made by the Court of Appeal, either in the Sullivan case[5] or in the present case, to R. v. Riley[6] or R. v. Cherry and Long[7] , although both were brought to the attention of the court, as appears in the report of the Sullivan case[8] at p. 436, and here in the appeal case and factums, probably because they had to do with payments for refreshments and were thought, on that ground, to be distinguishable.\nWe might have been disposed to hold that this case fell within clause (b) (ii) of s. 226 of the Criminal Code, but for the fact that the evidence does not shew that\nthe whole or any portion of the stakes or bets or other proceeds at or from such games (i.e., games of chance, or mixed games of chance and skill) (was) either directly or indirectly paid to the person keeping such house, room or place.\nIn fact, the players would appear to have paid this money to the steward out of their own pockets rather than from any proceeds of the game. This appears from the evidence throughout the case. On this point we adopt the view of Beck J.A. in R. v. Cherry and Long[9] (at p. 407), where that learned judge says:\nIn my opinion, the only reasonable interpretation of this clause ( (b) (ii) of s. 226 Cr. C.) is that it refers, and refers only, to a payment made to the keeper out of one or all of the \"pots\" under a rule, regulation, agreement or understanding exacted by the keeper that such a payment shall be made as a rake-off, commission or other form of profit to the keeper.\nAs to clause (a) of s. 226, we find it difficult to say that the \" house, room or place (was) kept *** for gain.\" No doubt, the moneys paid by the players constituted largely the revenue of the club and belonged to its members, playing being confined to them.\nThe question really presented for our determination is whether the decision of the Appeal Court of B.C. in R. v. Sullivan[10] or that earlier delivered by the same court (then (1916) composed of Macdonald C.J.A. and Martin and McPhillips JJ.A.) in Rex v. Riley[11] appeals to us as the better. In R. v. Riley (1), Macdonald C.J.A. said:\nIn Halsbury's Laws of England, vol. 4, p. 406, (par. 860), a club is defined as\nA society of persons associated together for social intercourse, for the promotion of politics, sport, art, science or literature, or for any purposes except the acquisition of gain.\nThere is no finding that the Pender Club was not a bona fide club; there is no suggestion that the accused conducted the house under the name of the Pender Club for personal gain, and apart from the finding as to the \" rake-off\" it is not suggested that the Pender Club was conducted by the members thereof for gain. The real question involved in the submission therefore turns on whether or not the receipt by the club of moneys for refreshments, in the manner above set out, proves a keeping of the club premises for gain.\nThe rake-off was not compulsory; that was merely the method adopted by the players of paying for their refreshments. Instead of each one paying for his own refreshments, or treating in turn, they took from their common store from time to time sufficient money to pay for all the refreshments which they consumed.\n*****\nI think the section is aimed at the keeping of a house for gain to which persons come by invitation, express or implied. The members of a bona fide club come as of right. This case is analogous to the case of Downes v.Johnson[12], where it was held that members of a bona fide club were not to be considered persons who resorted to the club.\nand Martin J.A. said :\nIt cannot properly be said, on such facts (i.e., those in the case) that the house or place in question, conducted by the hundred (here seventeen hundred) members of the social club all equally interested (cf. Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol. 4, p. 406, par. 862) was \"kept *** for gain\" within the meaning of the section and as defined by e.g., Rex v. James[13].\nThat learned judge concluded his judgment as follows:\nHis Worship has found that this benevolent club is only enabled to be kept open because of the gambling that is admittedly going on there, its revenue being otherwise very insufficient, but the correction of such an evil is for the legislature, and in the circumstances the courts can do nothing to stop it.\nIn R. v. Cherry and Long[14] , Beck J.A., in delivering the judgment of the Appellate Division of Alberta said,\nThere is a company, duly incorporated under The Companies Act as \"The Cooks and Waiters Club.\" In the memorandum of association, the objects of the company are stated as follows:\n*****\n(b) To carry on a club for the use and recreation of cooks and waiters in Edmonton.\n*****\nThe company was incorporated on December 7, 1923. The company undoubtedly carried on a bona fide club *** there was provision for admitting visitors or temporary members, on the recommendation of two members, for thirty days, after which period, if they desired to become permanent members they had to be voted for. Persons who were not cooks or waiters could not become permanent members; others could become visitors for thirty days.\n*****\nThe club kept generally a small stock of soft drinks, coca-cola, etc., \" just ordinary refreshments served in a club,\" but there was no restaurant in the club.***\nThere was evidence given by the police, who watched the playing through the window on two occasions for a very few minutes, that Cherry was seen taking, sometimes twenty-five and sometimes fifty cents, from the \"pot,\" on several occasions; that Cherry put this in the outside pocket of his coat. It seems to me the natural thing that, if provision was being made for paying for refreshments, the money should be kept by one person. Cherry was evidently selected as that person. It is not probable that he kept his own money in the outside pocket of his coat, so that it is to be inferred that he was keeping this refreshment money separate, to be used as occasion arose for the purpose intended.\nIt was suggested during the argument that we should infer that Cherry, who was only a visiting member, had in some way rented or got control of the use of the particular room in which he was, for his own purposes and profit, but such an inference from the evidence would, to my mind, be quite unreasonable. Long was a permanent member of the club, and was voluntarily in charge on the occasion in question for a portion of the time during which the play was going on.\n*****\nThe first question for decision *** is whether the place was being conducted \" for gain.\"\nAs to whether a place is kept for gain, if, from the stakes, bets or other proceeds at or from the game, money is paid to a bona fide club, in whose premises the game is being played, in payment for refreshments supplied by the club, I adopt the decision of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in R. v. Riley[15] , and hold that in such a case the club is not kept for gain within the meaning of the statute.\n*****\nSuch a payment is not made to the keeper qua keeper, but as a seller of refreshments. Nor is the money paid qua part of the pot, but is in reality a contribution by the several players out of their own pockets, just as much as if they severally contributed to the fund from their own pockets. It is paid for a purpose and for a consideration in no way incident to the game as a game, and I think, therefore, for the two reasons indicated, it is not the kind of payment which is contemplated by the Act.\nThis view is strengthened by two considerations: (1) The Act under consideration is criminal, and nothing is to be found in it by intendment, but only what is clearly expressed ; and (2) To hold otherwise would be to interfere with a harmless practice which is not uncommon in what perhaps may be called high-class social clubs, those resorted to by persons of divers callings, occupying the highest positions in the public and social life of the country. The case at bar, in its facts, seems to be clearly indistinguishable from R. v. Sullivan[16] . For instance, here, as there, the bona fide existence of the club is conceded, the players, who sat at the poker table for a certain period of time, all contributed (ten cents apiece for each half hour in this case), to the funds of the Club; no profits were or could be distributed amongst the members, although all the property of the Club and its revenues belonged to them (The Societies Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 236, s. 5) ; the steward collected this money from the players and paid it over to the club; only members were allowed in,\u2014in fact, in the present case, by-law no. 18 expressly forbade the introduction of visitors to any part of the club premises; the accused was steward of the club. In all these features the case resembles R. v. Sullivan[17] , where the decision was based on s. 226, 1 (a), of the Code, and the Chief Justice, delivering the judgment of the court said,\nThe appellant swore that he received nothing but his salary as steward. I think, however, that s. 69 of the Criminal Code is applicable to the appellant, since it is apparent that the club was a common gaming house.\nFrom this passage and the rest of the report, however, it would seem that the main question considered by the court was the responsibility of the steward in the premises, rather than the question now before us.\nBut, we agree with Martin J.A., where he said, in the case at bar,\nThis case cannot, in my opinion, be distinguished in principle from our decision in R. v. Sullivan[18] . Indeed, in some respects it is a stronger case for conviction than that ***.\nNot improbably the learned judge here referred to the fact that, in the Sullivan case[19] , the club in question had, in addition to other features, a lunch counter where patrons could buy meals, soft drinks, tobacco and cigars,\u2014a feature which was entirely lacking in the present case.\nThe same points made at bar in the present case would appear to have been made in the Court of Appeal in the Sullivan case[20] , yet the court there held that,\nThe appellant, therefore, was properly convicted of being a keeper (of a common gaming house kept for gain within clause (a) of s. 226).\nThe present case, however, would seem to be a fortiori a case for conviction in that here the moneys paid by the card players constituted a chief source of revenue of the club.\nAfter having given to this case, and to the cases cited at bar, the fullest consideration, we prefer the decisions and the reasoning put forward in the Riley case[21] and in R. v. Cherry and Long[22] to the decision and the reasons in support thereof given in the Sullivan case[23] . That being so, it follows that the Sullivan case[24] must be overruled, the appeal herein allowed and the conviction against the appellant must be quashed.\nDUFF J.\u2014The question is whether, on the facts disclosed in evidence, the appellant could be lawfully convicted of keeping a common gaming house, within the meaning of section 226 of the Criminal Code. The relevant parts of the section are as follows:\nSection 226. A common gaming house is\n(a) a house, room or place kept by any person for gain, to which persons resort, for the purpose of playing at any game of chance, or at any mixed game of chance and skill; or\n(b) a house, room or place kept or used for playing at any game of chance, or any mixed game of chance and skill in which\n1. ***\n2. The whole or any portion of the stakes or bets or other proceeds at or from such game is either directly or indirectly paid to the person keeping such house, room or place.\nThe appellant was the steward of the club, which, admittedly, was a social club, incorporated under the Benevolent Societies Act (now the Societies Act), which owned a club house, as well as a football ground, and provided facilities for the social intercourse and the amusement of its members. The indoor amusements consisted of billiards, card games, including poker.\nThe point in controversy concerns the manner in which poker games were conducted, and the particular fact upon which the Crown relies is this: every half hour a member occupying a seat at a table and engaged in playing poker was charged a certain sum. It is true also that the respondent, the steward, provided chips to members for which no charge was made, a circumstance, which, so far as 'I can see, has no bearing on the question at issue. Members only were admitted to the premises; and it is well perhaps to emphasize the fact already mentioned that the club was not a proprietary club, but a club incorporated under the Societies Act. I have no hesitation in holding that there is no evidence that this club was \" a house, room or place kept by any person for gain.\" There is not the slightest evidence to indicate that the club was not precisely what it purported to be\u2014a club kept for the amusement and recreation, and solely for that purpose, of the members. Fees and other contributions made by the members were for the purpose of defraying the expenses.\nThe real question seems to be whether or not the accused can be convicted under subsection (b) 2 of section 226, i.e., whether or not the room in which poker was played was\na room or place kept or used for playing therein at any game of chance or any mixed game of chance and skill in which the whole or any portion of the stakes or bets or other proceeds at or from such games as either directly or indirectly paid to the person keeping such house, room or place.\nIt is argued by Mr. Farris that the small fee charged for the use of the chair cannot be described as a \"gain,\" within the meaning of these words. I pass by that question because my mind is perfectly clear upon this point, namely, that the payment of this fee is not a payment of\nthe whole or any portion of the stakes or bets or other proceeds at or from\nthe games. Admittedly, it is, of course, not a payment from the bets or stakes. Is it a payment of \"the whole or any portion \" or \" other proceeds at or from such games \"? The word \" proceeds\" here must be read in connection with bets and stakes, and I think we are justified in saying that the word is noscitur a sociis, and that it is limited to the proceeds of a betting or gambling game as such, and proceeds similar in character to bets and stakes. The broader construction would lead to consequences which it is impossible to suppose could have been contemplated. The section is aimed, I think, at the participation by the owner of the place where the game is carried on, in the profits or other proceeds accruing to members from the game itself.\nNo doubt where it is shewn that gain is the real object of the keeping of the place, you have a case within subsection (a). But, as I have said, no such case is made out here, and I think the argument based upon subsection (b) fails also.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: T.

Therefore, the refusal by the Bankruptcy Court to approve a proposal of compromise, on the ground that the debtor had knowingly made false statements to the respondent bank, but prior to his bankruptcy, was not justified under section 16 (2) of the Act.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 52 K.B. 162) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming by a majority of the court the judgment of the Superior Court sitting in bankruptcy, Panneton J., and refusing to approve a proposal of compromise made by the debtor.\nThe appellant made an authorized assignment under the Bankruptcy Act on the 3rd day of November, 1930, and, subsequently, through its trustee, submitted for approval to the Bankruptcy Court a proposal for a compromise. The approval was refused on the ground that the debtor had committed offences mentioned in section 191, subs, q and r, of the Bankruptcy Act, c. 11, R.S.C., 1927, by making false statements in writing, with intent that they should be relied upon respecting the debtor\u2019s affairs, financial condition, means or ability to pay, and for the purpose of procuring credit and discount of bills of exchange and notes. It was claimed by the respondent bank that the debtor furnished three false statements: (a) Statement of September, 1929, which disclosed liabilities of $1,926.07 instead of $98,509.17; (b) Statement of September 29, 1928, which disclosed liabilities of $2,856.68 instead of $90,197.68 (c) Statement of 30th of September, 1927, showing liabilities of $1,925.35, while the actual liabilities were then $83,425.35. The trial judge held that the debtor had in fact made these false statements with the intention that they should be relied upon for the purpose of procuring credit from the respondent bank, and he found that these false statements constituted offences mentioned in section 191 of the Bankruptcy Act, namely under subsections q and r. This decision was affirmed by a majority of the judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench[2].\nJ. G. Ahem K.C. for the appellant.\nR. C. Holden K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgments of Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ. were delivered by\nrinfret j.\u2014We have to construe subs, (q) and (r) of s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 11). They read as follows:\n191. Any person who has been adjudged bankrupt or in respect of whose estate a receiving order has been made, or who has made an authorized assignment under this Act, shall in each of the cases following be guilty of an indictable offence and liable to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars or to a term not exceeding two years\u2019 imprisonment or to both such fine and such imprisonment:\u2014\n* * *\n(q) If he knowingly makes or causes to be made, either directly or indirectly, or through any agency whatsoever, any false statement in writing, with intent that it shall be relied upon respecting the financial condition or means or ability to pay of himself or any other person, firm or corporation in whom or in which he is interested, or for whom or for which he is acting, for the purpose of procuring in any form whatsoever, either the delivery of personal property, the payment of cash, the making of a loan, or credit, the extension of a credit, the discount of any account receivable, or the making, acceptance, discount or endorsement of a bill of exchange, cheque, draft or promissory note, either for the benefit of himself or such person, firm or corporation.\n(r) If he, knowing that a false statement in writing has been made respecting the financial condition or means or ability to pay of himself or any other person, firm or corporation in whom or in which he is interested or for whom or for which he is acting, procures upon the faith thereof, either for the benefit of himself or such person, firm or corporation, any of the benefits mentioned in the preceding paragraph.\nThe appellant made an authorized assignment under the Bankruptcy Act on the 3rd day of November, 1930. Subsequently, through its trustee, it submitted for approval to the Bankruptcy Court a proposal for a compromise. The demand of approval was contested by the respondent, the Bank of Montreal, on several grounds. Leaving aside everything else,\u201d the Court found as a fact that in and during the years 1927, 1928 and 1929 the authorized assignor had knowingly made to the bank three false statements of the character described in subs, (q) and (r). The Court held that these were offences under the subsections mentioned and that,\nthese being established, the Court under article 16, paragraph 2 (of the Bankruptcy Act) was bound to refuse the approval of the proposal of compromise.\nIn the Court of King\u2019s Bench, that judgment was upheld by the majority of the court (L\u00e9tourneau and St. Germain JJ., dissenting). The matter is now before this Court by special leave.\nIt will be convenient to set out here the material part of section 16 of the Act:\n16. The court shall, before approving the proposal, hear a report of the trustee as to the terms thereof, and as to the conduct of the debtor, and any objections which may be made by or on behalf of any creditor.\n2. If the court is of the opinion that the terms of the proposal are not reasonable or are not calculated to benefit the general body of creditors, the court shall refuse to approve the proposal whenever it is established that the debtor has committed any one of the offences mentioned in section one hundred and ninety-one of this Act.\nAs will be observed, the whole question is whether the making of the false statements by the appellant may be held to constitute the offences described in subs, (q) and (r) of sec. 191, notwithstanding that they were made before the date of the authorized assignment\u2014in fact, the last statement was made more than nine months before, and the other statements almost two and three years respectively before the assignment.\nThe acts dealt with in sec. 191 are, in terms, the acts of a person\nwho has been adjudged bankrupt or in respect of whose estate a receiving order has been made or who has made an authorized assignment.\nThen, subs, (q) and (r) proceed to describe the particular offences and the present tense is used.\nUpon the plain meaning of the words, what is there described as an offence is the act of a person who has already been adjudged bankrupt, etc. And there is no reason, in the premises, why the court should depart from the ordinary and natural sense of the words of the enactment: Vacher v. London Society of Compositors[3]. It was pointed out by the respondent that, in other subsections of s. 191, the present tense is equally used although, in terms, these subsections are made to apply to offences committed\nwithin six months next before the presentation of a bankruptcy petition, etc.\nThe obvious answer is that, in those other subsections, the times are fixed and there is an absolutely controlling context. The point is rather that: were it not for the fact that these other subsections, by their context, are expressly given a retrospective operation, the same rule would apply to them and they would have to be construed as prospective only. A retrospective effect should not be given, unless that cannot be avoided without violence to the language. (Maxwell, 7th ed., p. 186.)\nThe respondent urged that, on the construction put forward by the appellant, the statute would be nugatory or inoperative, in the sense that the acts contemplated could never happen after bankruptcy. But we find nothing absurd or repugnant in the notion of an adjudged bankrupt or an authorized assignor\nmaking a false statement in writing with intent that it shall be relied upon respecting the financial condition or means or ability to pay of himself or any other person, firm or corporation in whom or in which he is interested\nor for the other purposes mentioned in subs, (q) and (r). Like the minority judges in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, we think that any of these acts may yet be attempted after bankruptcy and in connection with the bankruptcy. Both in his factum and at the hearing, counsel for the appellant was able to suggest many instances of how an offence of the nature contemplated may be committed after bankruptcy. Section 192 of the Act, immediately following the section now in discussion, affords an illustration of the fact that Parliament had in mind the possibility of just such acts being indulged in by an undischarged bankrupt or an undischarged authorized assignor. Section 196 is another illustration.\nFor these reasons, we are of opinion that the Bankruptcy Court was in error when it decided that, on account of subs. (q) and (r) of sec. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act, it was \u201cbound to refuse the approval of the proposal for compromise and the appeal ought to be allowed with costs.\nWe do not think, however, we should go any further, and that we should either approve or disapprove the proposal which has been made on behalf of the appellant. On proceedings such as these there are considerations which make it highly desirable that the Bankruptcy Court should be allowed to exercise proper discretion. The conclusion of the minority judges in the Court of King\u2019s Bench was that the record should be sent back to the Bankruptcy Court, with the object that that Court may now adjudicate upon the other objections of the contesting respondent, as also upon the advisability of approving the proposal for compromise. That, in our view, is the wise course to follow and the record will therefore be remitted to the Bankruptcy Court for the above mentioned purposes. The appellant should have its costs both here and in the Court of Appeal. The costs of the abortive hearing should follow the event.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur with my brother Rinfret.\nThe points necessarily involved in this appeal were fully discussed on the argument and the opinion of the Court in respect of them given, except that arising under the second limb of subsection 2 of section 16. That question concerns the effect of subsections (q) and (r) of section 191; and the precise point in controversy is whether or not those subsections can be brought into play where the act complained of is an act which takes place before the bankrupt has been adjudicated as such. I am unable to accept the view that the language of those subsections, in its ordinary meaning, is ambiguous in the sense that it applies as well to such acts as to acts committed after bankruptcy. Reading it in the ordinary sense, the scope of the subsections is, in my opinion, limited to the last mentioned character of acts. It is, therefore, incumbent upon the respondent to shew, in order to make good his position (and there is no dispute about this), either, that there is some qualifying context requiring a different reading, or that the subsections read according to their ordinary sense are incapable of practical application under the law of bankruptcy.\nAs to the first, it is, in my opinion, too plain for argument that there is no such qualifying context.\nAs to the second, the respondent has quite failed to satisfy me that these subsections, upon the construction contended for by the appellant are nugatory.\nThe statute contemplates\n16. Arrangements under the approval of the Court by which the debtor may carry on his business.\nSection 196 shews very plainly that the conviction of the debtor, under section 191 of the Act, may have the effect of nullifying any such arrangements, and there is nothing whatever in that section to indicate that this is restricted to offences constituted by some act preceding bankruptcy.\nThe appeal should be allowed and there should be a declaration that the acts complained of, committed prior to the bankruptcy, are not criminal acts, within the contemplation of section 191; and the case should be referred back to the Court in Bankruptcy to be dealt with accordingly.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hyde, Ahem, Perron, Puddicombe & Smith.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Meredith, Holden, Heward & Holden.\n[1] Q.R. 52 K.B. 162.\n[2] Q.R. 52 K.B. 162.\n[3] [1913] A.C. 107, at 118.\n",

On January 28, 1931, under an order issued by the Deputy Minister of Immigration he was detained for examination upon a complaint of violation of the Immigration Act. Neither the complaint, nor a copy thereof was forwarded to the Board of Inquiry, or served on the appellant who was brought before the Board on April 29, 1931. Finding the appellant had entered Canada by misrepresentation, the Board served on the appellant a deportation order stating that he was rejected because \"in Canada contrary to the provisions of the Immigration Act and effected entry contrary to the provisions of s. 33 (7) of said Act.\" An appeal to the Minister having been dismissed, the appellant obtained a writ of habeas corpus and succesfully applied for discharge thereunder to Fisher J. on July 8, 1931, on the ground that the order was not in accordance with the provisions of the Act, in that it did not specify with sufficient particularity the reason for his deportation. On September 23, 1931, the appellant was re-arrested on the original order of April 29, 1931, which, however, had been amended by adding to it the reasons for his deportation so as to make it conform to the requirements of the statute. He again sued out a writ of habeas corpus and applied to quash the amended order. Murphy J. refused the application holding that, though deficient, the first order could be remedied by issuing the amended order, and he held the new order valid. His judgment was affirmed on appeal.\nId, Anglin C.J.C. and Smith J. dissenting, that the amended deportation order issued by the Board of Inquiry should have been quashed and the appellant discharged from custody. The Board of Inquiry when a deportation order is found defective on its face, has the right to recall it and substitute therefor an order in proper form, so long as the defective order had not been acted upon. Even after it has been served on the person in custody and constitutes the return made to a writ of habeas corpus, it may still by leave of the court or judge, be amended, or another order substituted for it, so as to make it conform to the finding of the Board. But after a deportation order which is not in accordance with the Act has been quashed by a court having jurisdiction, it cannot be amended for there is nothing to amend, the order of the Board no longer existing.\nAnglin C.J.C. and Smith J. dissenting.\u2014The order made by Fisher J. contravened the prohibition of s. 23 of the Immigration Act and was, therefore, invalid and ultra vires, since it amounted to a \"reviewing, quashing, reversing, restraining, or otherwise interfering with,\" an order of the Minister, or of the Board of Inquiry, the appellant being, admittedly, neither a Canadian citizen, nor a person having Canadian domicile. That being so, the order of the Board remained effective, as it clearly dealt with matter declared by s. 23 to be outside the authority of any \"court or judge or officer thereof\" to interfere with. Moreover, this defect in the jurisdiction of Fisher J. who made the order was obvious on the face of it and, therefore, could be taken advantage of by the respondent; the order of Fisher J. being a nullity the order of the Board, which it purported to set aside, was still valid and was legally amended so as to make it conform to the intention of the Board in making it.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, affirming a judgment of Murphy J. and dismissing the application of the appellant for a writ of habeas corpus.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nC. H. O'Halloran for the appellant.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and E. Miall for the respondent.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur with my brother Lamont.\nThe chief question I desire to discuss is the effect of section 23 of the Immigration Act. The words,\nhad, made or given under the authority and in accordance with the provisions of this Act relating to the detention or deportation of any rejected immigrant, passenger or other person, upon any ground whatsoever, unless such person is a Canadian citizen or has Canadian domicile.\nare an essential part of this section; and its disqualifying provisions obviously can only take effect where the conditions expressed in these words are fulfilled. In particular, the phrase \"in accordance with the provisions of this Act\" cannot be neglected; their meaning is plain. The \"order\" returned as justifying the detention must be \"in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\" It must not, that is to say, be essentially an order made in disregard of some substantive condition laid down by the Act. This applies to the order of the Minister, as well as to the order of the Board of Inquiry. The order of the Minister must be an order directing the investigation of facts alleged in a complaint made to him; and such facts, unless the enactment is to be reduced to the merest parade of words, must be alleged, of course, in such a manner as to make the allegation reasonably intelligible to the person against whom the investigation is directed. The jurisdiction of the Board, as an investigating body, is limited to the investigation of the facts alleged, a condition, again, implying intelligibility of allegation. Indeed, unless the person concerned is to have a reasonable opportunity of knowing the nature of the allegations, what is the purpose of requiring his presence? The deportation order must fully state the reasons for the decision, in respect of the allegations. The spirit, as well as the frame, of the whole statute, evinces the intention that these provisions are mandatory.\nI gravely fear that too often the fact that these enactments are, in practice, most frequently brought to bear upon Orientals of a certain class, has led to the generation of an atmosphere which has obscured their true effect. They are, it is needless to say, equally applicable to Scotsmen. I admit I am horrified at the thought that the personal liberty of a British subject should be exposed to the hugger-nugger which, under the name of legal proceedings, is exemplified by some of the records that have incidentally been brought to our attention.\nCourts, of course, must often draw the distinction between what is merely irregular and what is of such a character that the law does not permit it in substance. I have no difficulty in giving a construction to section 23, which does not deprive British subjects, who are not Canadians, of all redress, in respect of arbitrary and unauthorized acts committed under the pretence of exercising the powers of the Act.\nI do not find it necessary to decide whether or not the deportation order was one which fell under the protection of section 23. It is sufficient for me that Mr. Justice Fisher had jurisdiction to decide that it did not; and that the learned judge having done so and set it aside, the chairman of the Board had no authority to issue another.\nThe appeal should be allowed. The judgments of Lamont and Cannon JJ. were delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia dismissing by an equal division of the court an appeal by the appellant from a judgment of Mr. Justice Murphy in which he refused the appellant's application under a writ of habeas corpus, for his discharge from custody.\nThe appellant (a Japanese subject) entered Canada at the port of Vancouver on September 29, 1928. His passport and the ship's manifest shewed that he was entering Canada for the purpose of being employed as a domestic servant by one J. Uneo of Nanaimo, B.C. He was permitted to land and, according to his story, he went directly to Nanaimo where he found that Uneo had failed in business, closed his store and, therefore, did not require a domestic servant. He says that although he tried he could not get work as a domestic servant, and had to take what he could get.\nOn January 28, 1931, the Deputy Minister of Immigration and Colonization directed an order \"to any constable, peace officer or immigration officer in Canada\" in which he recited that a complaint had been received to the effect that Munetaka Samejima (the appellant)\nwas in Canada contrary to the provisions of the Immigration Act, and had effected entrance contrary to the provisions of s. 33, ss. 7 of the said Act,\nand he ordered that the appellant be taken into custody and detained for examination and an investigation into the facts alleged in the said complaint.\nThe examination was to be made by the Board of Inquiry or an officer acting as such. Neither the complaint itself nor a copy thereof was forwarded to the Board or served upon the appellant who was taken into custody and brought before the Board on April 29, 1931. On being questioned he admitted that he had not worked as a domestic servant since he landed in Canada, giving as a reason his inability to obtain that kind of work. The Board found that he had entered Canada by misrepresentation, and a resolution for his deportation was passed. On the same day a deportation order was drawn up and served upon the appellant. The order read as follows:\u2014 This is to certify that the rejected person above named, a person who entered Canada at B.C. ex. Empress of Asia from Yokohama, Japan, which arrived at the said port on September 29, 1928, at o'clock M., has this day been examined by the Board of Inquiry at this port, and has been rejected for the following reasons: In that he is in Canada contrary to the provisions of the Immigration Act and effected entry contrary to the provisions of section 33, subsection (7) of said Act.\nAnd the said rejected person is hereby ordered to be deported to the place from whence he came to Canada ***.\nDated at Victoria, B.C., this 29th day of April, 1931.\nJ. A. ANDERSON,\nChairman of the Board of Inquiry.\nThe appellant appealed to the Minister but his appeal was dismissed. He then obtained a writ of habeas corpus, and an application for his discharge thereunder was made to Mr. Justice Fisher who, on July 8, 1931, discharged him from custody and quashed the deportation order, on the ground that the order was not in accordance with the provisions of the Act, in that it did not specify with sufficient particularity the reason for his deportation. On September 23, 1931, the appellant was re-arrested on what purported to be an order for his deportation signed by the Chairman of the Board of Inquiry, and bearing date April 29, 1931, the date of the original order. This new order will hereafter be referred to as the \"amended order.\" This amended order was in form sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the statute. After his re-arrest the appellant was not again brought before the Board, or examined by it, or given an opportunity to offer a defence to this arrest. He, however, again sued out a writ of habeas corpus and applied to Mr. Justice Murphy to quash the amended order under which alone, according to the return made to the writ, the appellant was held in custody. Mr. Justice Murphy refused to set aside the order holding that although the first order was deficient the deficiency could be remedied by issuing a new order, and he held the new order valid. Whether or not he was right in so holding we have now to determine.\nSections 40 and 41 of the Immigration Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 93) provides that where a person belonging to the prohibited or undesirable class, as specified therein, other than a Canadian citizen or person having a Canadian domicile, is found in Canada\nit shall be the duty of any officer cognizant thereof and the duty of the clerk, secretary or other official of any municipality in Canada wherein such person may be to forthwith send a written complaint thereof to the Minister giving full particulars. Included in the prohibited class is a person who enters or remains in Canada contrary to any provision of the Act.\nThen s. 42 reads:\u2014\nUpon receiving a complaint from any officer, or from any clerk or secretary or other official of a municipality against any person alleged to belong to any prohibited or undesirable class, the Minister or the Deputy Minister may order such person to be taken into custody and detained at an immigrant station for examination and an investigation of the facts alleged in the said complaint to be made by a Board of Inquiry or by an officer acting as such.\n****\n3. If upon investigation of the facts such Board of Inquiry or examing officer is satisfied that such person belongs to any of the prohibited or undesirable classes mentioned in the two last preceding sections of this Act, such person shall be deported forthwith, subject, however, to such right of appeal as he may have to the Minister.\nCounsel for the appellant contended that jurisdiction to order the arrest of the appellant under this section depended upon the existence of the conditions precedent required by the statute, that is to say upon the receipt of a complaint from an officer under the Act or from a municipal official, and that in either case the complainant must give particulars of the act or omission which placed the immigrant in the prohibited or undesirable class; that there was no evidence that the complaint in this case had been received from any person specified in the section; that the order of the Deputy Minister would indicate that no particulars other than those contained in his order had been given, and, therefore, no jurisdiction on the part of the Deputy Minister to order the appellant's arrest had been shewn, and jurisdiction would not be presumed. He further contended that as there was no jurisdiction to issue the order which set these proceedings in motion, every step taken subsequent to the order was invalid.\nThe objection here taken is, to my mind, a very serious one, for the jurisdiction of a Minister or his Deputy, under s. 42, to take an immigrant into custody is conditioned upon a complaint being received from one of the persons specified therein. Parliament has not authorized the exercise of this jurisdiction on the complaint of an unknown person who might be an enemy or competitor or business rival of the immigrant, desirous of harrassing him. It is given only on the complaint of an officer or official, whose official position it may have been thought would warrant the inference that the complaint would not be made without knowledge, nor inspired by any but proper motives. It is established law that jurisdiction on the part of an official will not be presumed. Where jurisdiction is conditioned upon the existence of certain things, their existence must be clearly established before jurisdiction can be exercised. Failure to establish the right to arrest would ordinarily vitiate all subsequent proceedings following directly as a result of the arrest. Whether this principle would apply to a second arrest I do not find it necessary to determine, for, assuming that it would not, the order in question must, in my opinion, be set aside on another ground, namely, that the amended order itself was wholly invalid.\nSection 33 (5) provides that the order of deportation may be made in Form C in the schedule to the Act, which form requires the reasons for the rejection to be \"stated in full,\" and a copy of the order to be forthwith delivered to the rejected person. The statute, therefore, contemplates that the order will shew the reason for the deportation. The only reason for the deportation of the appellant, as found by the Board of Inquiry, was that he had entered Canada by misrepresentation. That reason was not stated in the deportation order which formed the return made to the writ of habeas corpus before Mr. Justice Fisher. Because of the Board's failure to state in the order the particular offence found against the appellant Mr. Justice Fisher quashed the order and set the appellant at liberty. Had he jurisdiction to do so?\nIt was contended that s. 23 deprived him of any jurisdiction to interfere. That section reads:\u2014\n23. No court, and no judge or officer thereof, shall have jurisdiction to review, quash, reverse, restrain or otherwise interfere with any proceeding, decision or order of the Minister or of any Board of Inquiry, or officer in charge, had, made or given under the authority and in accordance with the provisions of this Act relating to the detention or deportation of any rejected immigrant, passenger or other person, upon any ground whatsoever, unless such person is a Canadian citizen or has Canadian domicile.\nIt will be observed that the prohibition against interference by a court or judge applies only to\nany proceeding, decision or order had, made or given under the authority and in accordance with the provisions of this Act. It follows, therefore, that if the proceeding, decision or order has not been had, made or given in accordance with the provisions of the Act, no restriction is placed upon interference therewith by the court, and the immigrant is at liberty to appeal to a court or judge for any remedy to which he may be found entitled.\nIn this case the original deportation order was not in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Mr. Justice Fisher had, therefore, jurisdiction to quash it, which he did, on July 8, 1931. His order, having been made with jurisdiction, was a valid order and could only be reversed on appeal, if an appeal lay therefrom.\nThe Crown does not contend that the original order of the Board of Inquiry was valid, but it does contend that where a slip has been made in the drawing up of an order, a new order in proper form may be substituted. Up to a certain point I entirely agree with this contention. If the Board of Inquiry made a deportation order defective on its face, it could, in my opinion, recall it and substitute therefor an order in proper form, so long as the defective order had not been acted upon. Even after it has been served on the person in custody and constitutes the return made to a writ of habeas corpus, it may still, in my opinion, by leave of the court or judge, be amended, or another order substituted for it, so as to make it conform to the finding of the Board. Leonard Watson's Case[1] ; In re Clarke[2] . But after a deportation order which is not in accordance with the Act has been quashed by a court having jurisdiction, it cannot be amended for there is nothing to amend. The order of the Board no longer exists\u2014it is a thing of naught.\nWhat was attempted to be done in this case was to amend the order of April 29, after it had been quashed, by adding to it the reasons for the appellant's deportation so as to make it conform to the requirements of the statute. There is no evidence that the amended order ever was before the Board. The only order made by the Board of Inquiry of which we have any record is the one that was quashed by Mr. Justice Fisher. In the statute ample provision is made for rectifying the situation which arose through the quashing of the original order, and all the Board of Inquiry had to do was to follow the statute. In s. 33 (7) which sets out the various offences constituting a cause for deportation, it is provided that\nany person suspected of an offence under this section may be arrested and detained, without a warrant, by any officer, for examination as provided under this section, and if found not to be a Canadian citizen or not to have a Canadian domicile,\nmay be ordered to be deported. Every member of the Board of Inquiry is an officer under the Act.\nAfter the Board's deportation order had been quashed, any member thereof could have caused the appellant to be re-arrested and held for examination, for, having found, on April 29, 1931, that he entered Canada by misrepresentation, his presence at large thereafter would justify the suspicion that he was in Canada in violation of the Act. If, on re-examination the Board still found that his entry into Canada had been secured by misrepresentation, a new deportation order could have been made based upon the re-examination and, if it was in proper form, no court or judge would have jurisdiction to quash or reverse it. This re-examination, however, would have entitled the appellant to meet the charge with such evidence as he might be able to put before the Board. How important that right would have been for the appellant is disclosed in his evidence. He says that when the Immigration Officer came to Chemainus where he was working on April 28, 1931, and took him to Victoria, that the officer told him that he might return to Chemainus next day, so, when he was taken before the Board of Inquiry for examination and was asked if he wanted a lawyer he answered \"No,\" because he says he did not anticipate getting into any trouble. The record of his examination before the Board shews that the proceedings were opened by the Chairman stating to him that he was to be examined as to his right to remain in Canada, and did he wish to have counsel. The Chairman then referred to the complaint set out in the warrant of the Deputy Minister, in the language of the complaint. Up to that time the appellant had not been informed that he was to be charged with entering Canada by misrepresentation. Then he was questioned as to his age, place of birth, re- ligion, relatives in Japan and in Canada, statements appearing in his passport, his object in coming to Canada, his movements after he landed and where and for whom he expected to work when he came here. To all of these questions the appellant answered apparently in a straightforward manner, informing the Board that his destination was Nanaimo and that he expected to work for Mr. J. Uneo as a domestic servant but, that when he got to Nanaimo he found that Mr. Uneo had failed in business, his store was closed and he himself was working in the mill; that after trying in vain for two weeks to get work as a domestic servant in Nanaimo, he went to Vancouver and tried there, but was equally unsuccessful, and he had to take whatever kind of work he could get. Then he was asked:\u2014\nQ. When you got back to Vancouver, did you report to the Canadian Immigration Office and report to them that your employer was closed up and could not employ you as a domestic?\u2014A. No. I didn't.\nQ. You know that you were permitted to land in Canada for the purpose of being employed as a domestic servant and that you were going to work for Mr. Unyeo; why did you not report that this man was not in a position to employ you when you found he was closed up?\u2014A. I didn't know that I should report to the Immigration what to do.\nHe was then questioned as to his subsequent employment; the names and addresses of his employers; the rate of wages he received, etc.\nThen, practically at the close of his examination, we have the following:\u2014\nQ. And when you were questioned by the Immigration Officer, did you not state that you were going to be a domestic servant?\u2014A. I told the officer at Vancouver I was going to be a domestic servant.\nQ. After you arrived you made no attempt to be a domestic servant?\u2014A. I tried several times to have domestic work in Vancouver but could not find any.\nQ. You have never been in domestic servant work in Canada?\u2014A. No, I have not.\nQ. Then you realize that you have entered Canada by misrepresentation, do you?\u2014A. No. I don't know that. Because I try to get work but I could not help it.\nQ. But the fact that you have not taken domestic work shows you entered Canada by misrepresentation?\u2014A. I don't know.\nThis was the first time so far as the material before us discloses that he was made aware that the charge against him was entering Canada by misrepresentation. Had he known that he had to face that charge he could have had the evidence before the Board of Inquiry which he subsequently placed before Mr. Justice Murphy on the habeas corpus proceedings, namely, that of Mr. J. Uneo, who had carried on business in Nanaimo for twenty-five years and who, in his affidavit, stated not only that the appellant was to be employed by him as a domestic servant, but that more than a year before the landing of the appellant, he (Uneo) had applied to the Japanese Consul at Vancouver for a permit for the appellant's entry into Canada as his domestic servant. This was corroborated by the affidavit of K. Ishii, the appellant's uncle, who for forty years had been a merchant in Victoria, B.C., and, for many years, held office as head of the Victoria Japanese Association, and who swore that he knew of his own personal knowledge that Mr. J. Uneo had, in the latter part of 1926, applied to the Japanese Consul for a permit for the entry of the appellant as Uneo's domestic servant. This evidence although tendered before Mr. Justice Murphy, could not be considered by that learned judge because he had no jurisdiction to review the finding of fact made by the Board of Inquiry. If the evidence of these witnesses had been placed before the Board when the appellant was examined by it, it is possible that the Board might not have found as a fact that the appellant entered Canada by misrepresentation. Had the appellant known that he had to meet the charge of misrepresentation before he announced that he did not want a lawyer, I think it highly probable that he would have had counsel and that the evidence of Uneo and Ishii would have been placed before the Board. I, therefore, find myself entirely in accord with the language used by Martin J.A., in the court below, where his lordship said:\u2014\neven if the proceedings upon the Board's amended Order could be invoked at all they contain the incurable defect that after the re-arrest there was no re-investigation of the accused on the definite charge that was for the first time then laid against him.\nThe amended order, being simply an amendment of an order which had been quashed instead of a new order based upon a re-examination, had no validity whatever, and should also have been quashed.\nFor the Crown it was contended that, even if the order was invalid, Mr. Justice Murphy was right in refusing to set the appellant at liberty, and cited, among others, the case of Rex v. Governor of Brixton Prison[3] . That was an entirely different case and, in my opinion, goes no further than to hold that it does not necessarily follow in every case where some irregularity is shewn to have taken place in the procedure under which a person has been placed in custody that he should be set at liberty. But it is only in cases where the court is satisfied that a prima facie case has been made against such person, and that it is in the interests of justice that he should be tried for the offence charged, that he will be detained under an irregular commitment. In the present case the commitment under which the appellant was held was not simply tainted with an irregularity in procedure, but was wholly bad.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs; the order of the Board of Inquiry quashed, and the appellant discharged.\nThe judgments of Anglin C.J.C. and Smith J. (dissenting) were delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the carefully prepared opinion of my brother Lamont in this case and regret to find myself unable to agree with his conclusion. Unless, to employ a familiar saying, the crossing of every \"t\" and dotting of every \"i\" in all the proceedings taken in this matter is essential to the Crown's success, I do not see how this appeal can be maintained.\nTwo main questions are open for consideration, (a) whether the order of Fisher J. for the discharge of the appellant will sustain a claim of res judicata herein; and (b) whether, if that order does not stand in the way, or can be gone behind, the action of Murphy J. in refusing to discharge the appellant on habeas corpus was justified. As I read the judgment of Lamont J., that learned judge holds (a) that the order of Fisher J. amounts to res judicata in this matter; (b) that that order cannot be gone behind or be ignored; and (c) that the order of Murphy J., refusing to discharge the appellant on habeas corpus after his re-arrest under the amended order of the Board, was nugatory, on the ground that Fisher J. had definitely set aside the original order of the Board and there was, therefore, nothing left to amend. It is true that the Court of Appeal for British Columbia has a jurisdiction conferred on it by statute (R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 52, s. 6), so far as I am aware, peculiar to that province, whereby that court is obliged to entertain an appeal from, inter alia, \"every judgment, order or decree made by the Supreme Court or a judge thereof,\" no exception being made to the generality of the jurisdiction thus conferred which would exclude a right of appeal by the Crown against the order of a judge who has under habeas corpus discharged a person brought before him. The respondent maintains the right to ignore the order of Fisher J., treating it as made without jurisdiction, because of the presence in The Immigration Act of s. 23, and, instead of appealing therefrom, to proceed under the order of the Board, either as originally made or amended.\nThat it is competent for any court to amend its own order as issued so as to make it conform to the intention of the Court making it (especially where, as here, the Board in announcing its decision, had declared in terms, in the presence of the appellant, the order it proposed to make, those terms corresponding with the amendment so made), is a proposition which scarcely requires authority to support it.\nBut, it is said that the power of the Board to amend ceased with the existence of its order, and that that order ceased to exist when Fisher J. made his order quashing it. We are thus driven back again to the question of the validity of the order made by Fisher J., i.e., not whether that order was proper on the merits, but whether the learned judge had jurisdiction to make it. Ordinarily no doubt, this question of the validity of the order would have been raised on appeal from it, but it does not at all follow that that is the only manner in which the question of jurisdiction can be raised. On the contrary, if a party affected by an order of the Board, or the Board itself, chooses to treat a subsequent order, purporting to set it aside, as a nullity, he or it may do so at his or its peril. Here, the Board adopted the latter course, by ignoring the order of Fisher J. and proceeding to amend its previous order so as to make it conform to the terms in which it had intended to pronounce such order,\u2014terms which were announced at the conclusion of the hearing in the presence of the appellant. Without at all questioning the propriety on the merits of the order of Fisher J., and confining my observations solely to the jurisdiction of that learned judge, I am of the opinion that the order made by him contravened the prohibition of s. 23 of the Immigration Act and was, therefore, invalid and ultra vires, since it amounted to a \"reviewing, quashing, reversing, restraining, or otherwise interfering with,\" an order of the Minister, or of the Board of Inquiry, the appellant being, admittedly, neither a Canadian citizen, nor a person having Canadian domicile. That being so, and the order of Fisher J. being, accordingly, invalid and ultra vires, the order of the Board remained effective. It clearly dealt with matter declared by s. 23 to be outside the authority of any \"court or judge or officer thereof\" to interfere with.\nMoreover, this defect in the jurisdiction of the learned judge who made the order is obvious on the face of it. It, therefore, could, in my opinion, be taken advantage of by the respondent; and I agree with Murphy J. in his view that the order of Fisher J. was a nullity and that the order of the Board, which it purported to set aside, still stands and was validly amended by the Court so as to make it conform to the intention of the Board in making it.\nI also agree with Murphy J. that, having before him such amended order of the Board, he had abundant ground for refusing to interfere with the provision therein contained for detention of the appellant for deportation,\u2014it not being open to that learned judge, or on appeal from him to the Court of Appeal, or to us, to consider the credibility, or weight, or value of the testimony upon which the Board had proceeded, which was reviewable only by the Minister on appeal to him under ss. 18 and 19,\u2014an appeal which was duly taken by the appellant and which proved unsuccessful.\nIt is satisfactory to have reached a conclusion which seems to me to be in conformity with the requirements of justice, since the appellant was fully aware of the purpose of the inquiry of the Board and of the substance of the charge against him, i.e., that he had procured entrance into Canada by misrepresentation contrary to the provisions of s. 33 (7) of The Immigration Act, which, I have no doubt at all, was stated as a basis of the inquiry into the complaint made to the Minister under s. 42 (1). To the absence of any formality in the complaint the presumption omnia rite esse acta, affords an answer, 13 Hals. par. no. 538.\nIt must be perfectly apparent to everyone reading the proceedings that this was so. For instance we find the following in the course of the examination of the appellant by the Board:\nQ. Then you realize that you have entered Canada by misrepresentation, do you?\u2014A. No, I don't know that. Because I try to get work but I could not help it.\nQ. But the fact that you have not taken domestic work shows you entered Canada by misrepresentation?\u2014A. I don't know.\nAnd, at the conclusion of the inquiry, we find the following:\nCHAIRMAN: Who told you to say, or to state, that you were coming here as a domestic servant when apparently you have never followed that occupation?\u2014A. My uncle in Nanaimo told me to come as a domestic servant for Mr. Uyeno.\nQ. Is he the same man that came across with you on the boat?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And he it was who told you to say you were coming to work as a domestic servant for Mr. Uyeno at Nanaimo?\u2014A. Yes; I understand I am coming to work as a domestic servant for Mr. Uyeno.\nDecision of the Board.\nMr. JONES: Whereas the said Munetaka Samejima, having been found not to be a Canadian citizen or a person having Canadian domicile, and a complaint having been received under Section 40 of The Immigration Act to the effect that the said Munetaka Samejima is in Canada contrary to the provisions of The Immigration Act, namely Section 33, subsection 7, in that he entered Canada by misrepresentation: therefore, pursuant to the provisions of section 33, subsection 7 of The Immigration Act, I move that the said Munetaka Samejima be deported.\nMr. SPEED: I second the motion.\nCHAIRMAN: Mr. Samejima, a motion has been duly moved and seconded and I declare it carried unanimously that you be deported under the provisions of Section 33, subsection 7 of the Immigration Act. You have the right to appeal to the Minister of Immigration and colonization. Do you wish to appeal?\u2014A. I am going to appeal.\nHow a man can, after being so notified, contend before this Court that he had not been informed of the substance of the charge against him, as the appellant does in his affidavit I do not understand. To say that he had no notice that the substance of the accusation against him was obtaining entry into Canada by misrepresentation, to put it mildly, strikes me as dishonest. No injustice whatever on this score has been done to the appellant and to require that the circumstances of his entry should be again the subject of investigation after his re-arrest would seem to be to impose procedure that is entirely superfluous in view of the fact that the original order of the Board providing for his deportation still stands. In conclusion, therefore, I am of the opinion that Murphy J was right in declining to interfere, under s. 23 of The Immigration Act, with the detention of the appellant for deportation, that his order must be sustained and that this appeal, accordingly, should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: O'Halloran & Harvey.\nSolicitor for the respondent: John L. Clay.\n[1] (1839) 112 E.R. 1389, at 1419.\n[2] (1842) 2 Q.B. 619 ; 114 E.R. 243.\n[3] (1913) 23 Cox 713.\n",

His widow remarried in 1925. The eldest child attained the age of 25 years in November, 1928. The children, at all material times, resided in the United States, except that one resided in Canada in and from 1926. The respondent (a resident of Canada), the sole surviving executor and trustee of the will, was assessed for the years 1917 to 1928, inclusive, under the Income War Tax Act, 1917 (Dom.), as amended, for income tax upon the undistributed income, not used in the maintenance, etc., of the children under the above quoted clause (e) in the will, from the residuary estate. Respondent claimed that he or M.\u2019s estate was not assessable or taxable in respect thereof. Held: The income assessed was \u201cincome accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons, or of persons with contingent interests,\u201d within s. 3 (6) of said Act, as enacted by 10-11 Geo. V, c. 49, s. 4 (now R.S.C., 1927, c. 97, s. 11), and was taxable in the hands of respondent.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court (Audette J.), [1931] Ex. C.R. 215, reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Audette J., in the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], allowing the appeal of the present respondent (save as to the interest of Allen A. McMartin for certain years) from the decision of the Minister of National Revenue affirming the income tax assessments herein, notices of which assessments were issued on March 1, 1930, for each of the years 1917 to 1928, inclusive.\nThe following statement of facts was agreed upon by the parties for the purposes of the trial of the action in the Exchequer Court:\n\u201c1. The appellant [appellant in the Exchequer Court\u2014the present respondent] is the sole surviving Executor and Trustee of the Last Will and Testament of Duncan McMartin bearing date the 24th day of April, 1914.\n\u201c2. That the said Duncan McMartin died on the 2nd day of May, 1914, at the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, but was domiciled in the City of Montreal, Province of Quebec.\n\u201c3. After sundry bequests which are not involved in this appeal, the said deceased gave directions by his said Last Will and Testament for the sale and conversion of his residuary estate, the investment of the balance of the proceeds of such sale and conversion and as to the disposition to be made of the income derived from such investments, or the income or profits from the unrealized portions of the said Estate, which directions are to be found in Paragraph 9 of the said last Will and Testament which is as follows:\u2014\n9. I give, devise and bequeath all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate both real and personal to my executors and trustees hereinafter named upon the following trusts, namely: (a) to sell and convert the same into money (except my shares in Canadian Mining & Finance Company Limited) as soon after my death as they in their absolute discretion deem it advisable. (b) To pay out of the proceeds of such sale and conversion the legacies given by this my Will including the said legacy to my wife of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) should same become payable.\n(c) To invest and keep invested the balance of the proceeds of such sale and conversion in such investments as trustees are by the Laws of the Province of Ontario permitted to invest trust funds.\n(d) To pay out of the income derived from such investments or the income or profits from the unrealized portions of my estate, the said annuity of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) a year to my wife.\n(e) To divide the balance of the income from such investments or the income or profits derived from the unrealized portions of my estate, into three equal parts and to pay or apply one of such parts, or so much thereof as my executors and trustees in their discretion deem advisable, in or towards the support, maintenance and education of each of my children until they respectively attain the age of twenty-five years, or until the period fixed for the distribution of the capital of my estate which ever event shall last happen, provided that any portion of any child\u2019s share not required for his or her support, maintenance and education shall be re-invested by my said Executors and Trustees and form part of the residue of my estate given and bequeathed to such child.\n(\u0192) After the death or remarriage of my wife, whichever event shall first happen, to divide the residue of my estate equally between such of my three children as shall attain the age of twenty-five years, as and when they respectively attain that age, provided that if any of the said children shall have died before the period of distribution arrives, leaving a child or children, such children shall take the share in my estate which his or her parent would have taken had he or she survived the period of distribution, if more than one in equal shares.\n\u201c4. On the 1st day of January, 1917, there were then living, Iva McMartin, Widow of the said Duncan McMartin, deceased, and Allen A. McMartin, Melba McMartin and Duncan McMartin, children of the said deceased, all of whom resided in the City of New York and had so resided for some time prior to the 1st day of January, 1917. The said deceased left no other child, or any child or children of any deceased child, him surviving.\n\u201c5. That Iva McMartin, Widow of the said Duncan McMartin, deceased, remarried on or about the 4th day of March, 1925, and received on or about that date the sum to which she became entitled on such re-marriage and thereafter ceased to have any further interest in the residuary estate or in the income or profits therefrom.\n\u201c6. The said Allen McMartin continued to reside in the City of New York or elsewhere in the United States of America until January, 1926, at which date he took up his residence in the City of Montreal, Province of Quebec, and has since resided there. The said Melba McMartin and Duncan McMartin have continued to reside in the City of New York or elsewhere in the United States of America and are still residing there.\n\u201c7. That the said Allen A. McMartin attained the age of twenty-five years on the 4th day of November, 1928, and that the said Melba McMartin (now Melba McMartin Orr) attained the age of twenty-five years on the 3rd day of March, 1930, and the said Duncan McMartin attained the age of twenty-one years on the 17th day of February, 1930.\n\u201c8. That the said Allen A. McMartin was married on or about the 29th day of August, 1923, and there is no issue of such marriage; the said Melba McMartin was married to Leander Lee on the 20th day of September, 1922, and Melba Lee born May 23, 1923, is the only issue of such marriage; the said Melba McMartin and Leander Lee were divorced and the said Melba McMartin was again married to T. W. Orr on the 28th day of October, 1929, and there is no issue of such marriage; the said Duncan McMartin was married on or about the 1st day of July, 1931, and there is no issue of such marriage.\n\u201c9. By Notice of Assessment dated the 1st day of March, 1930, the appellant [appellant in the Exchequer Court\u2014the present respondent] was assessed for Income Tax upon the undistributed income, not used in the maintenance of the children under clause (e) in paragraph 9 of the will, from said residuary estate as follows:\u2014\nYear\nTaxable Income\nTax\n1917 . . . . . . . . . . .\n$ 6,508 94\n$ 40 18\n1918 . . . . . . . . . . .\n45,378 57\n3,469 16\n1919 . . . . . . . . . . .\n57,766 57\n8,152 87\n1920 . . . . . . . . . . .\n90,167 28\n20,394 78\n1921 . . . . . . . . . . .\n166,896 28\n62,508 50\n1922 . . . . . . . . . . .\n205,433 09\n85,438 34\n1923 . . . . . . . . . . .\n173,036 85\n66,119 16\n1924 . . . . . . . . . . .\n222,788 25\n96,372 10\n1925 . . . . . . . . . . .\n271,469 55\n97,321 29\n1926 . . . . . . . . . . .\n352,884 04\n121,063 95\n1927 . . . . . . . . . . .\n436,480 86\n139,366 65\n1928 . . . . . . . . . . .\n392,875 10\n122,649 04\n* * *\n* * *.\u201d\nThe respondent resides in Canada. Sec. 3, subsec. 6, of the Income War Tax Act, 1917, as enacted by 10-11 Geo. V, c. 49, s. 4, (and which was, by 10-11 Geo. V, c. 49, s. 16 (1), to be deemed to have come into force at the commencement of the 1917 taxation periods), was practically identical with R.S.C., 1927, c. 97 (the Income War Tax Act), s. 11, and read as follows:\nThe income, for any taxation period, of a beneficiary of any estate or trust of whatsoever nature shall be deemed to include all income accruing to the credit of the taxpayer whether received by him or not during such taxation period. Income accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons, or of persons with contingent interests shall be taxable in the hands of the trustees or other like persons acting in a fiduciary capacity, as if such income were the income of an unmarried person.\nThe following extract from the decision of the Minister of National Revenue gives the ground of his decision:\nAnd whereas under the provisions of the Will of the said Duncan McMartin the income not actually distributed to the named beneficiaries therein is being accumulated by the executors and trustees in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons or persons with contingent interests and it is provided by subsection 2 of Section 11 of the Income War Tax Act that income accumulating in such manner shall be taxable in the hands of the trustee or other like person acting in a fiduciary capacity as if such income were the income of an unmarried person, which provision of the Act was originally enacted by Section 4 of Chapter 49 of the Statutes of 10-11 George V and made applicable to the 1917 and subsequent periods by subsection 1 of Section 16 of the said Chapter 49.\nThe Honourable the Minister of National Revenue, having duly considered the facts as set forth in the Notices of appeal and matters thereto relating, hereby affirms the said assessments appealed against on the ground that the Executor of the estate has been properly assessed upon the income accumulating in his hands in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons or persons with contingent interests, irrespective of whether such unascertained persons or persons with contingent interests are or may be in the future resident in Canada or outside of Canada.\nAudette J.[2] held that, under the Act (See s. 4 of the original Act, as amended; its present form is found in R.S.C., 1927, c. 97, s. 9), the present respondent was not liable to be taxed in respect of the income of beneficiaries who were non-residents of Canada, and that the corpus of the trust, as well as the income, were the property of nonresidents; further, that the funds in question were not income accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons or of persons with contingent interests; and that, under the Act, the funds in question were not taxable in the hands of the present respondent. He allowed the present respondent\u2019s appeal, declaring that the fund sought to be taxed herein is absolutely vested in well known beneficiaries without any contingent interest and that such beneficiaries being admitted not to be residents in Canada are not liable to be taxed; with however this qualification that as Allen McMartin resided in New York until January, 1926, when from that date he took up his residence in the City of Montreal, Canada, he will from such date be liable to the present taxation, * * *\nThe Minister appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Executor cross-appealed from that part of the judgment which directed that the interest of Allen A. McMartin was to be assessed from the date on which he became a resident of Canada.\nBy the judgment of this Court, now reported, the Minister\u2019s appeal was allowed and the assessments confirmed, with costs throughout.\nJ. McG. Stewart K.C., C. F. Elliott K.C. and W.S. Fisher for the appellant.\nN. W. Rowell K.C. and P. C. Finlay for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff, Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ. was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014It is quite plain, I think, that a child does not take, under paragraph 9, subparagraph (\u0192), unless it attains the age of twenty-five years. It is true that the gift over is limited to the case where the child dies before the \u201cperiod of distribution.\u201d But that cannot affect the plain language which makes the gift of the share contingent upon attaining the age of twenty-five years.\nThis, it seems to me, in itself leads to one necessary conclusion with regard to all points in controversy. Until a child has attained twenty-five years, the destination of the share is uncertain, and the beneficiary is unascertained and unascertainable. That is sufficient to dispose of the main point. It is also sufficient to dispose of the subsidiary point, because up to that time the accumulated income accumulates as an integer; and the result is that the appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the Court below reversed and the assessments confirmed, with costs throughout.\nCannon J.\u2014The following facts were agreed upon by the appellant and the respondent for the purposes of this action:\n[Here is set out the above quoted statement of facts agreed upon by the parties.]\nThe question of residence or non-residence in Canada does not and cannot arise when the ultimate beneficiary in the accumulating trust fund is not definitely known and determined during the taxation period. The probable beneficiaries could not be definitely ascertained before the contingency, i.e., their survival until they reached twenty-five years of age, actually took place.\nWe therefore have to deal exclusively with the 1920 amendment (ch. 49, sec. 4) which covers the present case, and, in my view, is a complete taxing provision devised to tax in the hands of a trustee resident in Canada income accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons, or of persons with contingent interests, without, for obvious reasons, distinguishing between residents and nonresidents. I feel bound by our decision in the Royal Trust case[3] and would allow the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. S. Fisher.\nSolicitor for the respondent: James Y. Murdoch.\n[1] [1931] Ex. C.R. 215.\n[2] [1931] Ex. C.R. 215.\n[3] Minister of National Revenue v. Royal Trust Co., [1931] Can. S.C.R. 485.\n",

Registrations were made under the Conditional Sales Act. R.S.N.B., 1927, c. 152, but not under the Bills of Sale Act, R.S.N.B., 1927, c. 151. The dealers would order the cars from the manufacturers, who would send the invoice to the dealers, and would send the bill of lading, with sight draft on the dealers attached, to a bank. The dealers would then go to one of the appellants with the invoice, a conditional sale agreement covering the cars would be made, and appellant would give the dealers a cheque payable to the dealers for 85% or 90% (and in one case payable to the bank for the whole) of the amount of the draft. The dealers took the cheque to the bank and it was applied towards payment of the draft, the dealers supplying the balance. The dealers then obtained the bills of lading and took possession of the cars. The Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division (4 M.P.R. 39), affirming judgment of Barry, C.J. K.B., (ibid), held that the conditional sales agreements were ineffective as against the dealers\u2019 trustee in bankruptcy, as appellants, not having been owners of the cars, could not retain ownership or property therein under the agreements.\nHeld (reversing said judgments below, Lamont and Cannon JJ. dissenting): The conditional sales agreements were valid and effective. These agreements, coupled with the cheques and the evidence of what was done, showed that, on each occasion, an agreement was arrived at between the dealers and appellant by which the dealers, in consideration of the cheque, transferred to appellant their right to acquire from the manufacturer ownership and possession of the cars mentioned in the conditional sale agreement, in consideration of this agreement for sale of the cars to them. When the dealers used appellant\u2019s cheque towards payment of the sight draft, they were paying the draft to procure title and possession for appellant, in pursuance of their agreement. When the dealers got the bill of lading on payment of the draft and took possession, they were not taking possession to themselves by virtue of their original right, but by virtue of and in pursuance of the terms of the conditional sale agreement. Sec. 6 of the Bills of Sale Act did not apply to avoid title to the cars passing to appellant. That section has reference to a sale of goods and chattels which the seller owns, but the dealers were not selling or transferring to appellant goods and chattels which they owned, but only their right to acquire ownership and possession of the chattels on performance of a condition, namely, payment of the draft. It was a contract carried into effect and completed at the moment by payment of the price. Such a completed contract, not coming within the Bills of Sale Act, does not require to be in writing. Ownership of the cars passed to appellant and never became vested in the dealers. (Commercial Finance Corp. Ltd. v. Capital Discount Corp. Ltd., [1931] O.R. 22, and Re Grand River Motors Ltd., [1932] O.R. 101, distinguished). Appellant was in position, as such owner, to make the conditional sale agreement by virtue of which it retained the ownership until paid.\nPer Lamont J. (dissenting): Upon the evidence, there was not, nor did the transactions justify an inference of, any agreement or arrangement by which the dealers sold or agreed to sell to appellant the cars which appellant purported to sell back to them under the conditional sale agreement. The intention of the parties was a question of fact on which there are the concurrent findings of the courts below. Even assuming there was an implied sale by the dealers to appellant prior to execution of the conditional sale agreement, it was invalid, as against the trustee in bankruptcy, for want of compliance with s. 6 of the Bills of Sale Act. Nor, upon the evidence, could it be said that the dealers assigned to appellant their right to acquire from the manufacturers the ownership and possession of the cars. Upon the facts of the case, on payment of the draft the property must be deemed to have passed to the dealers. The transactions were simply a method of loans to the dealers upon the security of the conditional sales agreements, and these agreements, being simply conveyances intended by the parties to operate as mortgages of goods and chattels, and not being in the form or evidenced in the manner required by s. 2 of the Bills of Sale Act, were void as against the trustee in bankruptcy.\nPer Cannon J. (dissenting): The evidence did not justify an inference of any agreement or arrangement by which appellant acquired any title to the cars prior to the conditional sale agreement. The transactions were really loans on the security of the conditional sales agreements, and such security was invalid, as against the trustee in bankruptcy, for non-compliance with the Bills of Sale Act.\nAPPEAL (by special leave granted by a judge of this Court) from the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick (1), dismissing the present appellants\u2019 appeal from the judgment of Barry, C.J.K.B. (sitting in Bankruptcy) (2), dismissing their appeal from the decision of the Trustee of the Estate in Bankruptcy of Smith & Hogan, Ltd., disallowing the claims of the appellants as secured creditors under certain conditional sales agreements.\nThe material facts of the case and questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. The appeal to this Court was allowed with costs, Lamont and Cannon JJ. dissenting.\nL. A. Forsyth, K.C., and G. F. Osier for the appellants.\nC. F. Inches, K.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court (Rinfret, Smith and Maclean (ad hoc) JJ.) was delivered by\nSmith, J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, sitting in Bankruptcy[1], upholding the decision of the trial judge[2].\nThe bankrupt, Smith & Hogan, Limited, were dealers in automobiles in the city of Saint John, N.B., and made an authorized assignment on the 30th of July, 1930; and the respondent company was duly elected trustee of the estate in bankruptcy.\nThe appellant, with head office in Toronto, Ont., and a branch office in the city of Saint John, N.B., filed a proof of claim in the estate for sums of money owing under a number of conditional sales agreements of certain automobiles that were in possession of the bankrupt and passed into the possession of the trustee. In each case the appellants valued the security, which was the car, at the full amount of the claim under the agreement against the car.\nIt is admitted that these conditional sales agreements of the various cars in question were duly filed in compliance with the Conditional Sales Act, R.S.N.B., 1927, ch. 152, but they have been held to be ineffective as against the trustee, on the ground that the appellants were never owners of the goods, and therefore could not retain an ownership or property in the goods that they never possessed.\nIn my view the decision must turn upon this question of whether or not the appellants acquired ownership and property in the goods by virtue of what took place between the bankrupt and the appellant at the time of making the various conditional sales agreements. The statement of facts admitted and the evidence and documents show that Smith & Hogan, Limited, ordered the cars from the factory where they are made or assembled, and that the invoice for the said cars came to Smith & Hogan, Limited. The factory sent the bills of lading to the Bank of Nova Scotia at Saint John with sight draft on Smith & Hogan, Limited, attached for the invoice price. Smith & Hogan, Limited, would then go to the appellants with the invoice, when a conditional sale agreement covering the cars mentioned in the invoice would be made out, and a cheque for the whole or eighty-five or ninety per cent, of the draft would be given to Smith & Hogan, Limited, with which to take up the sight draft. In one case the appellants made their cheque for the whole amount of the sight draft, and payable to the order of the Bank of Nova Scotia, which held the draft and bills of lading; but in other cases the cheques were for eighty-five or ninety per cent, only of the sight draft, and in some cases the cheques were made payable to the order of Smith & Hogan, Limited. In all cases the appellants\u2019 cheques were taken by the firm of Smith & Hogan, Limited, to the bank, and applied in payment or part payment, as the case might be, of the sight draft, Smith & Hogan, Limited, supplying the balance over and above the appellants\u2019 cheque, required to pay the draft in full. Smith & Hogan, Limited, then obtained from the bank the bill of lading, upon which they took possession of the cars.\nThe contention is that, when Smith & Hogan, Limited, thus procured possession of the cars by payment of the sight draft, the title in the automobiles passed to that company; and, if that be the correct view of the results, the decision appealed from would appear to be right.\nIn support of this contention the respondent refers to a number of English cases decided under the provisions of the English statutes of 1854 and 1878. The former is 17-18 Vic, ch. 36, An Act for preventing Frauds upon Creditors by secret Bills of Sale of personal Chattels. The statute of 1878 is 41-42 Vic, ch. 31, which consolidates and amends the law relating to bills of sale of personal chattels. Section 3 reads as follows:\n3. This Act shall apply to every bill of sale executed on or after the first day of January one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine (whether the same be absolute, or subject or not subject to any trust) whereby the holder or grantee has power, either with or without notice, and either immediately or at any future time, to seize or take possession of any personal chattels comprised in or made subject to such bill of sale.\nSection 4 has the following:\nThe expression \u201cBill of Sale\u201d shall include bills of sale, assignments, transfers, declarations of trust without transfer, inventories of goods with receipt thereto attached, or receipts for purchase moneys of goods, and other assurances of personal chattels, and also powers of attorney, authorities, or licences to take possession of personal chattels as security for any debt, and also any agreement, whether intended or not to be followed by the execution of any other instrument, by which a right in equity to any personal chattels, or to any charge or security thereon, shall be conferred, * * *\nBy an amending Act of 1882, ch. 43, sec. 9, it was provided that\nA bill of sale made or given by way of security for the payment of money by the grantor thereof shall be void unless made in accordance with the form in the schedule to this Act annexed.\nThe cases numbered 1 to 24 cited and digested in the respondent\u2019s factum all turn upon the question whether or not the documents under which the goods were sought to be held were bills of sale within the provisions of these Acts. The object of both Acts is declared to be for preventing frauds upon creditors by secret bills of sale of personal chattels, and there is no provision for the registration of conditional sales or hire and purchase agreements unless they come within the definition of bills of sale set out in the Acts.\nThe definition quoted above of the Act of 1878 is much more comprehensive than the original definition in sec. 7 of the Act of 1854.\nThe gist of the various English decisions cited by the respondent is that the real nature of the transactions between the parties must be enquired into, regardless of the form; and if it is found that the document is in fact one made for a loan on the security of the chattels, it is a bill of sale within the meaning of these Acts, and requires to be registered. In most of the cases the transaction commenced with the ownership of the property vested in the party who became the purchaser under the hire and purchase agreement, followed by a sale or pretended sale of the chattels to the vendor in the hire and purchase agreement, and then by the execution of that agreement. The decisions in such cases hinged upon the questions of fact as to whether or not the sale to the ultimate vendor was a real sale or whether the whole transaction was a loan of money on security of the chattels.\nIn Redhead v. Westwood[3], R. applied to W. for a loan of \u00a3100, which was refused. Then R. sold the furniture in his house to W. for \u00a3100, who handed him a cheque for the money, but no receipt was given. Shortly afterwards, by an agreement in writing, W. agreed to let the furniture to R. on the hire and purchase plan. Held, that the agreement was a valid agreement for hire and not a bill of sale, and the transaction was unaffected by the Bills of Sale Act.\nIn In re Watson, Ex Parte Official Receiver in Bankruptcy[4], an execution was put into the bankrupt\u2019s house. L. agreed to lend her \u00a3150. L. made an inventory and an agreement whereby he agreed to sell the bankrupt the goods on the hire and purchase plan, and she was told she was selling the property to L., but it would be hers again on the repayments of the hire being properly kept up; and she handed L. a chair, informing him that she had sold him the furniture. She then signed the hiring agreement. Held, that the true nature, not the form of the transaction, must be regarded, and that the supposed hiring and purchase agreement was a bill of sale.\nIn Beckett v. Tower Assets Co.[5], plaintiff applied to defendants for a loan of \u00a330 on a bill of sale. Defendants made an inventory, but recommended a friendly distress. Defendants bought at the distress sale, obtainging a receipt, and then sold back to plaintiff\u2019s wife on the hire and purchase plan. Cave J. held that it was not necessary to register either the receipt or the hiring and purchase agreement. The case went to appeal[6]. At p. 648, Bowen, L.J., says:\nWe ought to find on the facts that there was an understanding between the plaintiff and the defendants that, although the property passed, the defendants should hold it in trust for the plaintiff, except so far as the rights of the parties should afterwards be defined by some document of hiring and repurchase, or other document of that sort, to be afterwards executed.\nHe goes on to say:\nIf the beneficial property in the goods was only to become theirs when some further assurance was executed, then the hiring and repurchase agreement which was executed is such a document as is avoided by the Act if not registered. Again, if it operated only as a licence to seize goods which remained in equity the property of the plaintiff, so far as the beneficial interest was concerned, then also it is avoided by the Act. So that in either view it is a document which is a bill of sale; it is a necessary part of the transaction in order to give the defendants a title to the goods, for without it they were only trustees for the plaintiff. I am glad to think we are only differing upon a question of fact from the learned judge in the Court below.\nThese cases are sufficient to show that the English cases cited by respondent turn on the special provisions of the English Acts.\nThe present appeal must be decided, not upon the provisions of these English statutes, but according to the common law and statutes of New Brunswick relating to the matters in question. In New Brunswick there are two Acts which have relation to the transfer of chattels where possession does not accompany the transfer or go with the ownership. These are the Bills of Sale Act, R.S.N.B., 1927, ch. 151; and the Conditional Sales Act, R.S.N.B., 1927, ch. 152; and it is by virtue of the provisions of the former Act that the respondent claims title; and the question, as I have already stated, is whether, upon payment of the drafts alluded to, the title and ownership of the chattels passed to Smith & Hogan, Limited, or to the appellant.\nWhen Smith & Hogan, Limited, obtained the cheques and gave the various conditional sales agreements, they were not the owners of the cars, as ownership remained with the manufacturers who shipped them until payment of the sight drafts. All that Smith & Hogan, Limited, had was a right to acquire ownership and possession by payment of the draft.\nWhat, then, were the terms of the entire agreement entered into between Smith & Hogan, Limited, and the appellant on each occasion?\nIt is not necessary, in order to constitute an agreement between parties, that it shall be stated in precise language. The terms may be arrived at from various documents, the acts of the parties and the circumstances. Here we have Smith & Hogan, Limited, going to appellant at various times with an invoice of cars shipped to them of which they can only acquire ownership and possession by payment of a sight draft for the amount of the invoice. They ask appellant to supply the whole or ninety per cent, or eighty-five per cent, of the amount required, and the conditional sales agreement is executed by both parties, and a cheque for the required amount is given Smith & Hogan, Limited, to apply on the draft. This conditional sales agreement by its terms shows that both parties intended that the cheque was given on the condition that title was to pass to appellants, and it could only be so passed by use, on appellant\u2019s behalf, of Smith & Hogan\u2019s right to acquire ownership and possession. Smith & Hogan, Limited, in the agreement contract to buy from appellants, and expressly agree that title is not to pass to them till payment by them to appellant of the purchase price, that is, the amount advanced. Therefore, when Smith & Hogan, Limited, used appellant\u2019s cheque towards payment of the sight draft, they were paying the draft to procure title and possession for appellant, in pursuance of their agreement, and not to acquire title and possession in themselves in breach of their agreement. When they got the bill of lading on payment of the draft and took possession, they were not taking possession to themselves by virtue of their original right, but by virtue of and m pursuance of the terms of the conditional sales agreement.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the conditional sales agreements, coupled with the cheques and the evidence of what was done, show that an agreement was arrived at between Smith & Hogan, Limited, and the appellant by which Smith & Hogan, Limited, in consideration of the cheques, transferred to the appellant their right to acquire ownership and possession of the cars mentioned in the various conditional sales agreements, in consideration of these agreements for sale of the cars to them.\nIt is argued that title to the cars could not pass to the appellant by such an agreement because it would have to be in writing and filed, as provided by the Bills of Sale Act, R.S.N.B., 1927, ch. 151.\nSection 6 of that Act provides that\nEvery sale of goods and chattels not accompanied by an immediate delivery and followed by an actual and continued change of possession of the goods and chattels sold, shall be in writing, etc.\nThis section has reference to a sale of goods and chattels that the seller owns, but here Smith & Hogan Limited were not selling or transferring to the appellant goods and chattels that they owned, but only their right to acquire ownership and possession of certain chattels on performance of a condition, namely, payment of the draft. It was not an executory contract to sell this right, but a contract carried into effect and completed at the moment by payment of the price. Such a completed contract, not coming within the Bills of Sale Act, does not require to be in writing. Only the part of the agreement relating to the conditional sale was required to be in writing and filed, by virtue of the Conditional Sales Act, and that part is in writing and duly filed.\nThe argument that the real nature of the transaction was a loan of money on the security of the goods, and that therefore the security must be taken by way of chattel mortgage executed and filed in compliance with the provisions of the Act, has, in my opinion, no force. This argument is based on the decisions already referred to under the particular provisions of the English Acts. Here the Act only purports to deal with mortgages not accompanied by an immediate change of possession of the chattels mortgaged, and there is no provision that loans on chattels must be by mortgage filed pursuant to the Act.\nSo far as the Bills of Sale Act is concerned, loans may be secured on chattels otherwise than by chattel mortgage in any way permitted by the common law and statute law. An ordinary way of holding chattels as security at common law is to acquire ownership of the chattels and then to sell them to a purchaser, retaining ownership until the price is paid, but, by virtue of the Conditional Sales Act, such a sale must be in writing and filed pursuant to the terms of the Act.\nThe respondent cited Commercial Finance Corporation Ltd. v. Capital Discount Corporation Ltd.[7], and Re Grand River Motors Ltd.[8]; and argued that these were directly in point. An examination shows that they are not at all in point.\nThe first of these is a decision by the Ontario Appellate Division.\nOne Lind purchased a car from Leggett Motors Ltd., for $1,349, of which he paid $232, the balance being paid by moneys from the plaintiff. The reasons state that this was apparently an outright sale and transfer of property. The distinction, therefore, between that case and this is that there the transactions by which Lind became purchaser under a conditional sales agreement started with Lind as owner and in possession, and the gist of the decision is that he could not as against creditors and subsequent purchasers transfer that ownership to plaintiff while retaining possession except by a document registered in compliance with the Bills of Sale Act.\nRe Grand River Motors Ltd.8 is a decision following the other under the same circumstances.\nIn my opinion, ownership of the automobiles here in question passed to the appellant, and never became vested in Smith & Hogan Limited. The appellant therefore was in a position as such owner to make the conditional sales agreements in question by virtue of which they retain the ownership till paid. The respondent has therefore a right to acquire ownership and retain possession only on payment to appellant of the balances owing as claimed. The appeal should be allowed, the judgments below set aside, and judgment should be entered for the appellant as indicated, with costs throughout.\nLamont J. (dissenting).\u2014I agree with the conclusions reached by my brother Cannon. The question submitted for our determination is: Are the appellants entitled to exercise against the trustee in bankruptcy, or the creditors of Smith and Hogan, Ltd., any rights with respect to certain automobiles by virtue of conditional sales agreements in which the appellants respectively appear as conditional vendors and Smith and Hogan, Ltd., as purchasers?\nEach of the appellants filed with the trustee in bankruptcy claims in which they set out that, by reason of being the holders of the conditional sales agreements, they were secured creditors and entitled to maintain their securities as against the general creditors of Smith and Hogan, Ltd. (hereinafter called the \u201cDealers\u201d). The trustee refused to recognize the appellants\u2019 claim to rank as secured creditors. The appellants appealed to a judge in bankruptcy and submitted an agreed statement of facts in each case. As the same point of law was involved in both appeals, and as the facts were similar, the appeals were consolidated and were determined on the statements of facts submitted, supplemented by viva voce evidence.\nAs pointed out by my brother Cannon J., apart from whatever understanding may be implied from the execution of the conditional sales agreements, the evidence shews that there was no agreement or arrangement whatever, either verbal or written, between the Dealers and either of the appellants, to the effect that the Dealers had, at any time, sold or agreed to sell to the appellants the automobiles which the appellants respectively purported to sell back to them under the conditional sales agreements. The material before us does, however, shew the true nature of the transactions which took place between these parties. Mr. Hogan says: \u201cWhen we first started in the car business we applied to them for credit.\u201d The Dealers had to furnish a statement of assets and liabilities. Then the Acceptance Corporations made their investigations with the result that the Dealers obtained from the appellant. The Industrial Acceptance Corporation, a line of credit of $12,000, and from the appellant, The Canadian Acceptance Corporation, a line of credit of $20,000. Mr. Casey, the manager of the appellant. The I.A.C., Ltd., gave the following testimony:\u2014\nQ. Are you authorized by your head office to give these firms like Smith and Hogan, Limited, a certain amount of credit?\u2014A. After the recommendation has been approved by the bead office.\nQ. How do you mean?\u2014A. A financial statement is received from the dealer and investigations are made and recommendations are made to head office and if they are approved it is O.K. to give them credit.\nQ. And you are allowed to advance them up to a certain sum, is that right?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. I mean a general advance. What is the largest sum that you are entitled to finance Smith and Hogan?\u2014A. I am not sure what the established line of credit is right now, but they had twelve thousand dollars outstanding credit at the time of the assignment.\nAnd Mrz. Ogilvie, manager of the appellant, The C.A.C., Ltd., testified as follows:\nQ. And what is your limit as to the amount of credit that you could give Smith and Hogan, Limited?\u2014A. They were authorized by our Credit Department at Toronto at the first of 1930\u2014fifteen thousand dollars on Hupmobiles and five thousand dollars on De Sotos. This line of credit was reduced to eight thousand dollars on June first.\nQ. How much would you advance each time, the whole amount of the invoice value or only part?\u2014A. Eighty-five or ninety per cent. Usually eighty-five per cent.\nHaving arranged for credit with which to finance their purchases, the Dealers would from time to time order from the manufacturer a car load of automobiles, and ask him to ship them with sight draft attached to the bill of lading. The manufacturer shipped the automobiles to the Dealers and sent them an invoice thereof and, at the same time, sent the bill of lading with draft for the invoice price attached, to the Bank of Nova Scotia. On receipt of the invoice the Dealers took it to one of the appellants and received, from that corporation, a cheque for 85% or 90% of the invoice price; either then or at a later date they signed a conditional sales agreement which stated that they had agreed to purchase from the Acceptance Corporation the automobiles specified therein, and had also agreed that the property therein should not pass to the Dealers until they had paid an acceptance which was given for the amount advanced. The Dealers took the appellant\u2019s cheque and deposited it to their own account in the bank with such additional funds of their own as were necessary to meet the sight draft. They then accepted the draft from the manufacturer, received the bill of lading, took delivery of the cars and placed them on the floor of their warehouse for sale by retail. Within the time specified in the statute the appellants registered the conditional sales agreement. Only on one occasion was a cheque given to the Dealers for the full amount of the invoice price and, on that occasion alone (April 22, 1930), was the cheque made payable to the Bank of Nova Scotia; in all other cases it was made payable to the Dealers.\nOn the above state of facts, as to which there is no dispute, can it be said that the conditional sales agreements represented genuine bargains and sales between the appellants and the Dealers, or were the transactions simply a method adopted by the appellants of financing the Dealers and taking security for the moneys advanced?\nThe argument of the appellants in the Bankruptcy Court, as appears from a report of it in the appeal book, was stated by their counsel in these words:\u2014\nIt is to be implied from the conduct and dealing of the parties and from the circumstances of the entire transaction, that there was a sale by Smith and Hogan, Ltd., of their beneficial interest in the cars to the acceptance corporations, before the bill of lading was taken up at the bank and before the conditional sales agreements were executed.\nThere are two answers to this argument, the first is: that the managers of the appellant corporations admit that in not one of the transactions was anything said by the Dealers from which an intention could be inferred to sell the automobiles to the appellant applied to for financial assistance. It is only from the fact that the conditional sales agreements were executed that it can be argued that such an intention must have existed. The execution of the conditional sales, agreements, however, is, in my opinion, just as consistent with an intention to take security on the automobiles for advances made, but with a misconception of the legal effect which would follow the taking of security in that form, as it is with an intention on the part of the appellants to purchase the automobiles. It is wholly a question of the intention of the parties, and that is a question of fact on which we have the concurrent finding of two courts.\nThe second answer is: that, assuming there was an implied sale of the automobiles by the Dealers to the appellants prior to the execution of the conditional sales agreements, it cannot assist the appellants, for section 6 of the Bills of Sale Act (R.S.N.B., 1927, ch. 151), reads as follows:\u2014\n6. (1) Every sale of goods and chattels not accompanied by an immediate delivery and followed by an actual and continued change of possession of the goods and chattels sold, shall be in writing, and such writing shall be a conveyance under the provisions of this Chapter, and shall be accompanied by an affidavit * * * that the sale is bona fide and for good consideration * * *.\n(2) The conveyance and affidavit shall be filed as hereinafter provided within thirty days from the execution thereof, otherwise the sale shall be absolutely void as against * * * the assignee of the grantor under any law relating to insolvency * * * or an assignee for the general benefit of the creditors of the maker * * *.\nIn this case there was no immediate delivery of the automobiles by the Dealers to the appellants, followed by actual and continued change of possession. The sale, therefore, to be valid required to be evidenced by a conveyance duly filed. As this was not done, the implied sale cannot, in my opinion, be considered a valid one as against the trustee in bankruptcy.\nOn the argument before us, counsel for the appellants altered his ground and submitted that, antecedent to the conditional sales agreements, the title to the said automobiles was not in the Dealers, but was either in the appellants respectively or in some third person, and that, by their transactions with the appellants, the Dealers were not selling or transferring automobiles which they owned, but only assigning their right to acquire the ownership and possession of the automobiles they were entitled to receive from the manufacturer upon payment of the sight draft.\nThat the title could not have been in the appellants is obvious. Up to the moment the sight draft was paid the title was in the manufacturer. The shipping of the automobiles with the draft attached to the bills of lading indicates an intention on the part of the manufacturer of retaining the property in the automobiles and their possession until payment of the draft. Until the draft was paid no property passed. Upon payment, the property passed, and the question is, to whom? In my opinion, on the facts of this case, it could pass only to the Dealers. The manufacturer\u2019s contractual obligation was to pass it to them. In the transaction he knew no one else. No agreement between the Dealers and the appellants could have the effect of making the appellants direct purchasers from the manufacturer or of altering his obligation without his consent. That consent was not obtained. The manufacturer, by shipping the automobiles and sending to the bank the bill of lading with draft attached, was not offering to sell to anyone who might come forward and pay the draft. None of the bills of lading were put in and there is no evidence of their contents, but, in his evidence, Hogan swears: \u201cThe cars would be shipped direct to us.\u201d It was suggested on the argument that the bills of lading might have been made out to the manufacturer\u2019s order and endorsed by him in blank and this would entitle anyone paying the draft, with the Dealer\u2019s consent, to obtain the property in the cars. There is not the slightest evidence that any bill of lading was made out to the order of the manufacturer and, in view of Hogan\u2019s evidence, I think we must conclude that it was made out to the Dealers. The appellants did not take an assignment of the bills of lading, but, even if they had, the assignment would not have afforded them any protection unless there had been a bona fide sale to them of the automobiles, or a bona fide assignment of the Dealers\u2019 contract. The evidence, in my opinion, establishes that no such bona fide sale or assignment took place.\nOn examination before the Registrar, Hogan said:\u2014\nI took the invoice down to the Industrial Acceptance Corporation\u2019s office, the invoice I received from the factory, and asked them to wholesale this automobile for a period of three or four months, and Mr. Casey made out a cheque for me for fourteen hundred and seventy-six dollars and seven cents.\n*****\nQ. It was understood that this cheque was to be used to pay for this car?\u2014A. Not necessarily that cheque. They advanced us so much money on the car to help us unload it.\nQ. It was understood this cheque was given in consideration of this transaction?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And for the purpose of paying off the factory draft?\u2014A. To help pay off the factory draft.\nAnd further on:\u2014\nQ. You know the cheque was given to pay off the draft on those specific cars?\u2014A. The cheque was given as a loan towards those automobiles.\nIt is clear from this evidence that Hogan\u2019s conception of the transaction was the obtaining of an advance on the automobiles out of the arranged credits to help them to pay the manufacturer\u2019s draft. The appellants\u2019 respective managers do not say they had any idea of buying the automobiles outright or of taking an assignment of the Dealers\u2019 contract. Would it, therefore, be reasonable to infer from the execution of the conditional sales agreements alone that the Dealers were absolutely assigning all their interest in their contract with the manufacturer in consideration of the cheques received, and paying the appellants either 10% or 15% of the invoice price to take the contract off their hands? In my opinion it would not. Yet that is what we must infer if we accept the argument of the appellants.\nIn view of the fact that none of the parties to the conditional sales agreements ever suggested at any of their interviews that the Dealers were selling to the appellants the automobiles, or their right to acquire them from the manufacturer, and in view of the arrangements made for a line of credit and the giving of that credit by means of cheques, I can arrive at no other conclusion than that these transactions were merely loans to the Dealers upon the security of the conditional sales agreements. These agreements, being simply conveyances intended by the parties to operate as mortgages of goods and chattels and not being in the form or evidenced in the manner required by section 2 of the Bills of Sale Act, are void as against the trustee in bankruptcy.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed with costs.\nCannon J. (dissenting).\u2014This case should be decided, as all other cases, on the material before the court, and not on what the appellants might or should have done, or what they now wish they had done to protect their money. What have the parties done to help us to ascertain the ownership of the automobiles at the time of the signature of the conditional sale agreements by the appellants and Smith & Hogan, Ltd., now insolvent?\nWe have:\n(1) In the statement of facts admitted by the parties the following:\nAfter the transactions took place * * * Smith and Hogan, Ltd., took up the bill of lading, secured delivery of the cars from the Railway and placed them on their floor for sale at retail.\n(2) Moreover, Mr. Anglin, before the trial judge, put the case for the appellant in the following way:\nThe question is whether we are secured because we sold under this conditional sales agreement. To be secured and (to have) sold under that conditional sales agreement we have to have title to the cars first. The cars come forward from the factory and we admit to Smith and Hogan that they own them. They come in with the invoice to our office and ask to have the transaction financed. We say that would be all right if they sell us their interest in the cars while they are still in the hands of the railway and we sell the cars back to them reserving the title for security. We feel that in equity we are entitled to that security and that your Lordship after hearing the evidence will be able to imply although specific language apparently was never used by the dealer with the manager of the acceptance corporation to the effect that the dealer was selling first to the acceptance corporation. Yet our contention is that the dealer in buying them back and executing that document admitted they are buying them back from one who is holding the security title, and it surely could be implied in law that they first sold their interest in the cars to the acceptance corporation. So that the acceptance corporation could be in a position to sell back, reserving the security title.\n(3) Casey, the manager of the Industrial Acceptance Corporation, admits that he cannot remember or prove any specific conversation with Hogan as to whether the latter was selling his interest in the cars to the appellants and the latter were buying it before they sold it back to him. Ogilvie\u2019s evidence, as manager of the Canadian Acceptance Corporation, the other appellant, does not prove any such agreement.\n(4) Hogan himself explains the situation as follows:\nA. When we wanted a car load of automobiles we would send a wire from our company to the manufacturer and ask him to ship us so many cars, sight draft, bill of lading attached. The cars would be shipped direct to us. The Hupp Motor Oar Corporation in March shipped to Smith & Hogan, Limited. The bill of lading and the draft would come in to the bank of Nova Scotia and they would call us up and let us know it was there. And the invoice or bill for the cars would come through the mail to us from the automobile manufacturers. I would take the invoice down to the finance company\u2019s office and they would advance me eighty-five or ninety per cent, of the value of the invoice and they would make me out a cheque payable to Smith & Hogan, Limited, for that amount. I would take\u2014\nQ. Did you sign any document?\u2014A. Yes, I would have to sign a sales agreement.\nQ. Do you recognize that as an agreement?\u2014A. Yes, I would sign a document and take the cheque and it would be deposited in our bank account. I would either deposit it or somebody from our company would do so. Then one of our company would have to accept the sight draft at the bank which would be charged to our account, and he would get the bill of lading, so we could unload the cars.\nQ. (By the Court). Then you would have the cars discharged from any lien of the manufacturers, and the finance company would have paid ninety per cent, of it you paid the other ten per cent, yourselves?\u2014A. Yes, the finance company would advance us a cheque for ninety per cent, and I would put it in the bank and accept their draft which would be ten per cent, larger than the cheque.\nQ. Then you signed this agreement between yourselves and the finance corporation whereby you acknowledged them to be the owners of the property, and you agreed to pay for it at a certain time and the property remained in them?\u2014A. I was asked a question in the Bankruptcy Court, who I considered had the title to the automobiles and I answered that I considered we had the title to the cars, but we admitted we owed the finance company the ninety per cent.\nMr. Anglin: What Mr. Hogan said in answer to the question, on the examination, he said that he considered he owned the cars, on the examination.\nCourt: When you sold those cars around to Mr. Jones or Mr. Smith, did the finance corporation release their lien upon the cars?\u2014A. Upon payment of the amount outstanding against them, the ninety per cent.\nQ. Did you ever suggest to Mr. Casey or Mr. Ogilvie or either member of their firm, that you use this particular document rather than any other document?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Or a chattel mortgage?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Did they ever suggest it to you?\u2014A. No.\nAnd also:\nQ. What was your idea of what you were giving them?\u2014A. What we were giving the finance company?\nQ. Yes?\u2014A. When I took the invoice down we would pay some money down on the car that they were advancing us a portion of the invoice price. We had to sign some kind of a time contract and also sign a note to the finance company to come due either two, three, four or five months.\nQ. What was your idea as to what you were giving them by signing this contract when you also signed a note?\u2014A. I could not tell you. I didn\u2019t know whether I was giving them a lien or a chattel mortgage or what I was giving them. I never read it through to see what I was giving them.\nQ. Do you know the difference between a lien and a chattel mortgage?\u2014A. No, I never read one of those contracts to see what I was giving them.\nQ. But you feel you were giving them some kind of security on the cars?\u2014A. I knew the practice with our cars, when either Ogilvy or Casey would come around and check our cars at the last of the month, we had to pay them for the cars that we had sold that were on our financed cars, once they asked us to pay out.\nQ. Did you know or feel that they had any rights in these cars under that contract?\u2014A. I knew that they advanced us so much money on the car.\nQ. Who did you consider owned the car?\u2014A. I considered we owned the car.\nQ. Did you consider they had any rights in the car?\u2014A. They had a certain interest in the car.\nQ. How would you define their interest?\u2014A. I would pay them back what they advanced us when they car-checked us.\nQ. You would pay them what they advanced you people, but what interest would they have in the car, suppose you had not paid?\u2014A. If I did not pay it to them at the time, it would still be owing to them.\nQ. Suppose you never paid it, what interest would they have in the car?\u2014A. If the car was sold I don\u2019t think they would have any interest in it. Q. If the car was not sold?\u2014A. That money would still be owing to them.\nQ. If you did not pay it when the note came due what would their rights, if any, be in the car?\u2014A. Their interest in the car would be what they advanced us on it.\nFacing this evidence, it is impossible for me to reach the conclusion that the learned trial judge and the four members of the Court of Appeal for New Brunswick certainly erred in refusing to infer from these facts the implied tacit contract which Mr. Anglin very fairly stated was necessary to establish a preference in favour of the appellants. I believe, like the trial judge and the Appeal Court, that the record and the admissions of the parties clearly establish that the real transaction in this case was a loan to the dealer. It is remarkable that there is no evidence at all whereby the court could come to any other finding. Not one of the appellants\u2019 witnesses even suggested that the dealer sold them the cars. Their counsel argues that before the appellants conditionally sold the cars to the dealer, they must have first obtained title to the cars in some manner which is left a matter of conjecture. The trial judge has found as a fact that the transaction was really a loan on the security of the conditional sale which was invalid because, as a matter of fact, the appellants were never owners of the cars.\nThis decision has been affirmed in the Court of Appeal and we are practically in the same situation as the House of Lords in Maas v. Pepper[9]; and, using the words of Lord Halsbury, at page 104, I would say that the trial judge came to the right conclusion on a question of fact. It also seems to me that the whole evidence points in the one direction. I do not think that the sale was a reality; these were loans on the security of chattels, without due compliance with the requirements of the law of New Brunswick for the protection of creditors; the bankrupts may have acquired more credit than they ought, when the appellants left in their open and public possession as owners to retail to the public the cars which they now claim as their own. This alleged secret and tacit separation of the legal and beneficial property leaving the alleged assignor with the possession of the property allegedly conveyed as reputed owner, would leave the appellants liable to the casualties of Smith & Hogan\u2019s trade, and therefore, in equity, after the latter\u2019s failure, they are only entitled to come in pari passu with the rest of the creditors.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.

His application, made a part of the policy, stated, item 4, that the automobile \u201cwill be chiefly used for private purposes only\u201d; and, item 8, that he had made no claim for loss by fire within the last three years preceding the application in respect of the ownership or operation of any automobile; and that if the applicant knowingly misrepresented or omitted to communicate any circumstance required by the application to be made known to the insurer, the contract should be void as to the risk undertaken in respect of which the misrepresentation or omission was made. The policy provided, under the heading \u201cExclusions from Perils,\u201d that respondent should not be liable for loss or damage arising while the automobile was being used otherwise than for the purposes specified in said item 4, or \u201cif rented or leased.\u201d During the term of the policy, appellant, who had taken the car to B.\u2019s garage for repair, agreed, on request of B. who stated he was overhauling his own car and promised, for his use of appellant\u2019s car, to make certain adjustments and repairs, to allow B. to use his car and to leave it in B.\u2019s garage until said work was done, but stipulated that appellant or his wife could use the car whenever they wished, and they did use it while it remained at B.\u2019s garage. While B. was driving the car it took fire (supposedly from self-ignition caused by the wires having become wet). B. had as yet made no adjustments or repairs. Appellant sued respondent to recover the loss by fire.\nHeld: Appellant was entitled to recover. Judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, 4 M.P.R. 280, reversed, and judgment of Carroll J., ibid, restored.\nPer Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ.: (1) The arrangement made with B. did not amount to a renting or leasing within the meaning of the policy. (The limitation intended by the words \u201cif rented or leased,\u201d and the nature of the arrangement with B., discussed). Even if it did, the provisions of the Fire Insurance Policies\u2019 Act, R.S.N.S., 1923, c. 211, applied, and the clause excluding liability if the car was rented or leased was a variation in or addition to the statutory conditions and, not being evidenced in the form required by the Act, was not binding on appellant.\n(2): The arrangement with B. could not be held to constitute a \u201cchange material to the risk,\u201d so as to avoid the policy, under statutory condition 3 of said Act. The onus was on respondent to shew that it was a \u201cchange material to the risk\u201d; there was no evidence on the point, nor was the case so clear that the court could itself say that it was; in fact, the use of the car from time to time by other qualified drivers, with appellant\u2019s consent, was a thing likely, and should be held, to have been within the contemplation of the parties. Semble, moreover, giving a reasonable effect to the word \u201cchiefly\u201d in said item 4 of the application, the latitude contemplated would cover such an arrangement as that made with B.\n(3): The fact that, prior to his application, a car of appellant\u2019s was damaged by fire and the damage ($95) paid by an insurer, which occurrence, appellant explained, had entirely escaped his memory when making his application now in question, did not, upon the facts and circumstances, void the policy as being a misrepresentation in said item 8 of the application. The policy provided that all statements made by the insured upon the application should, in the absence of fraud, be deemed representations and not warranties. This distinguished the present case from Dawsons Ltd, v. Bonnin, [1922] 2 A.C. 413. Being simply representations, they affected respondent\u2019s liability only if material to the risk; and the non-disclosure in question was not material to the risk, as, upon the evidence, the proper inference was that full disclosure would not have influenced respondent, or any other reasonable insurers, to decline the risk or stipulate for a higher premium (Western Assur, Co. v. Harrison, 33 Can. S.C.R. 473, distinguished on the facts).\nAnglin C.J.C. and Duff J. agreed in the result. Duff J. held that there was no renting or leasing; there was a bailment of a very exceptional character, not within the contemplation of the condition relied upon under the head of \u201cExclusions from Perils\u201d; that, as to statutory condition 3, there was no material change proved; it did not appear that appellant did anything not within the contemplation of the policy; that, in so far as the contract was one of insurance against fire, the statutory conditions in said Act took effect, where not inapplicable by reason of the special nature of the subject matter of the contract. APPEAL by the plaintiff (on leave granted by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco) from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1], which, reversing the judgment of Carroll J.1 (Paton and Ross JJ. dissenting), dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action, which was brought to recover, under an insurance policy issued by the defendant company, the amount of his loss by destruction by fire of his automobile.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Lamont J. now reported. The appeal to this Court was allowed, with costs here and in the provincial appellate court, and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nJ. A. Walker for the appellant.\nF. D. Smith K.C. for the respondent.\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014I agree in the result of the judgment in this case, but, for want of opportunity to consider and analyze it in detail, cannot commit myself on the various propositions of law which it incidentally enounces.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur with the conclusion of my brother Lamont.\nSection 3 of the Nova Scotia statute (cap. 211, R.S.N.S., 1923) settles the question of the applicability of the statutory conditions. In so far as the contract is a contract of insurance against fire, the conditions take effect, where not inapplicable by reason of the special nature of the subject-matter of the contract; otherwise they do not.\nAs to the special arrangement with which we are concerned, there was, plainly, no rent, and I do not think there was a lease; there was a bailment of a very exceptional character not within, I am satisfied, the contemplation of the condition relied upon, under the head of \u201cExclusions from Perils.\u201d\nAs to condition 3, there was no material change proved, because, here again, I am not satisfied that the insured did anything not within the contemplation of the policy.\nThe appeal must be allowed, with the usual consequences. The judgment of Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014The appellant insured his automobile with the respondent (hereinafter called the Company) by a policy which made the application a part thereof and in which the appellant stated that the automobile \u201cwill be chiefly used for private purposes only\u201d (item 4), and that he had made no claim for loss by fire within the last three years preceding the application in respect of the ownership or operation of any automobile (item 8). By the policy the Company agreed to indemnify the appellant against loss or damage suffered by him in various specified ways, including loss by fire. Under the heading of \u201cExclusions from Perils\u201d the policy provided that the Company should not be liable for loss or damage arising while the automobile was being used (a) otherwise than for the purposes specified in item 4 of the application, or (c) if rented or leased. The policy was to be in existence for one year, from noon on October 7, 1929.\nIn the latter part of February, 1930, the appellant\u2019s wife, who also drove the automobile, complained of the manner in which the clutch was working. The appellant took the car to the garage of one George Bryden, a friend of his, who had previously made repairs on other cars owned by the appellant, and had the clutch fixed. When he came for the car two days later Bryden asked him if he was using his car for any particular purpose, and, on being informed that he was not, he stated that he was overhauling his own car and asked if he might use the appellant\u2019s car when the appellant did not require it. For such use he said he would remove the carbon from the valves and tighten up any part of the machinery which might require it. To this the appellant agreed, and also agreed to leave the car in Bryden\u2019s garage, which was heated, until Bryden had made the necessary adjustments and repairs; but stipulated that whenever his wife or himself wanted the car they were to have it, and in fact they both used it while it remained at Bryden\u2019s garage. Bryden had the car some two or three weeks when he drove it to a neighbouring village. A severe storm having set in, he remained at the village all night. Next morning he started for home. The roads were heavy and the car wet with the rain and, going up a hill, it took fire. As Bryden had nothing with which to extinguish the fire, the woodwork of the car was completely destroyed. The adjuster fixing the damage done by the fire at $1,200. The Company declined to indemnify the appellant for the loss he had suffered, and the appellant brought this action.\nThe Company contends that it is under no liability in respect of the policy, for the following reasons:\u2014\n1. That by the terms of the policy the Company was not to be liable while the automobile was rented or leased, and that, at the time the fire occurred, it was being operated by George Bryden under an arrangement which amounted to a renting or leasing.\n2. That statutory condition 3 of the Nova Scotia Fire Insurance Policies\u2019 Act provides that \u201cany change material to the risk, and within the control or knowledge of the assured, shall avoid the policy as to the part affected thereby, unless the change is promptly notified in writing to the insurer or its local agent\u201d; that the arrangement with Bryden, even if it did not amount to a renting or leasing, was a change material to the risk and that no notice thereof in writing or otherwise was given to the Company.\n3. The policy is void for misrepresentation.\nThe learned trial judge gave judgment in favour of the appellant. He held that the arrangement between the appellant and Bryden amounted to a renting or leasing within the meaning of the clause in the policy headed \u201cExclusions from Perils,\u201d but that the Company could not take advantage of that clause because it imported a variation in or addition to the statutory conditions which formed part of the policy, and was not evidenced in the manner prescribed by the Act and, therefore, not binding upon the appellant (s. 5). On appeal to the Supreme Court en banc, the judgment of the trial judge was reversed (Paton and Ross JJ. dissenting), on the ground that the arrangement made with Bryden constituted a change material to the risk and notice of it should have been given to the Company, as required by statutory condition 3.\n1. In my opinion, the arrangement made between the appellant and Bryden did not amount to a renting or leasing within the meaning of the policy. It is undoubtedly true that goods and chattels may be rented or leased, though the terms \u201clandlord\u201d and \u201ctenant\u201d are inapplicable to the relationship created by such a letting. \u201cRent\u201d in legal language may be defined as the compensation which a tenant of the land or other corporeal hereditament makes to the owner for the use thereof. It is frequently treated as a profit arising out of the demised land. In this sense the word \u201crent\u201d as applied to an automobile would not be appropriate. The word \u201clease\u201d is used in various senses: it is sometimes applied to term or estate created, and sometimes to the conveyance creating the estate. To constitute a lease, however, the possession of the lessee must be exclusive. Glenwood Lumber Company v. Phillips[2].\nThe distinction between a lease and a licence to use, as I conceive it, is that under a lease the lessee\u2019s right to possession is exclusive until the expiration of the term agreed upon; while under a licence the licensee has no exclusive possession, and his right both to the possession and the use may be revoked at any time by the licensor, unless the licence is coupled with an interest or the circumstances raise equitable considerations to which the court will give effect. Plimmer v. Mayor, etc, of Wellington[3]; Hurst V. Picture Theatres, Limited[4].\nThe limitation which, in my opinion, the parties intended to place upon the Company\u2019s liability under the policy by the employment of the words \u201cif rented or leased\u201d was that there should be no liability if the appellant for a consideration turned over to another the exclusive possession and control of the car for a fixed period or even at will. What they were endeavouring to exclude was the farming out of the car. The arrangement between the appellant and Bryden cannot, in my opinion, be construed as a farming out. It did not give Bryden the exclusive possession and the appellant could at any time have taken his car away and retained possession of it. The arrangement was simply a licence to Bryden to use the car which was revocable by the appellant, for, at the time of the fire, Bryden had not made any repairs or adjustments to it. His licence was, therefore, neither coupled with an interest nor were there any equitable considerations to prevent revocation. But even if the arrangement had amounted to a renting or leasing it would not assist the Company, for I agree with the courts below in holding that the provisions of the Nova Scotia Fire Insurance Policies\u2019 Act apply, and that the clause excluding liability if the car was rented or leased was a variation in or addition to the statutory conditions and, not being evidenced in the form required by the Act, was not binding upon the appellant.\n2. Then did the arrangement constitute a change material to the risk? Of this there is not, as pointed out by Mr. Justice Paton, any evidence whatever. No one familiar with the business of fire insurance was called to testify that such an arrangement would be considered by any reasonable insurer as in any way affecting the risk. Where an insurer resists payment of a policy on the ground that the policy is voided by reason of a change in the risk prejudicial to him, the onus is upon him to prove it. In Porter\u2019s Laws of Insurance, 6th ed., at page 116, the author says:\u2014\nWhere it appears that the loss is due to fire, under a fire policy, the burden is upon the insurers to prove all the facts necessary to exclude the loss from the risk.\nNo evidence having been put in on the point, is the case so clear that we can ourselves say that the arrangement was a change material to the risk? In my opinion we cannot. The fire is supposed to have resulted from self-ignition caused by the wires having become wet. I can see no greater danger of that happening when the car was being driven by Bryden than by the appellant. It seems to me most improbable that any reasonable insurer would refuse insurance if he knew that the insured might allow his friend or neighbour, a licensed driver, to have the use of his car on occasion. Indeed it seems to me that the likelihood of the insured allowing another licensed driver to sometimes have his car would be one of the things to be expected and which the parties at the time the contract of insurance was entered into would contemplate as likely to happen. That would be part of the risk insured against, whether the appellant got any compensating favour for the use of his car or not. Moreover, on the language of the policy itself such an arrangement as was here made was not, in my opinion, excluded. The car was to be \u201cchiefly\u201d used for private purposes only. Some effect must be given to the word \u201cchiefly\u201d; the use is not limited solely to private purposes; some latitude is contemplated, and, in my opinion, that latitude may well cover the arrangement here made. I, however, wish to rest my judgment on the broad ground above stated, that the use of the car from time to time by other qualified drivers, with the appellant\u2019s consent, must be held to have been within the contemplation of the parties.\n3. The misrepresentation which it is contended voided the policy is the statement of the appellant in the application that he had made no claim for loss by fire, in respect of the ownership of an automobile, within three years immediately preceding the application, whereas in fact in the year 1928 a car of his which was then standing in front of his office in some way took fire and, before it was put out, the fire had caused damage to the extent of $95, which the company with which it was insured immediately paid without cancelling or altering the policy of insurance. The appellant\u2019s explanation of his statement is that it was such a trifling matter it entirely escaped his memory. The application contained a clause to the effect that if the applicant knowingly misrepresents or omits to communicate any circumstance required by the application to be made known to the insurer, the contract shall be void as to the risk undertaken in respect of which the misrepresentation or the omission is made.\nThe first statutory condition of the policy provides that all statements made by the insured upon the application for his policy shall, in the absence of fraud, be deemed representations and not warranties. This distinguishes the present case from Dawsons Limited v. Bonnin[5]. Being simply representations, they affect the Company\u2019s liability only if material to the risk. Every fact is material which would, if known, reasonably affect the minds of prudent and experienced insurers in deciding whether they will accept the contract, or in fixing the amount of premium to be charged in case they accept it.\nMr. Freeman, the general agent of the Company in Nova Scotia, was called as a witness. Although pressed he would not say that the policy would have been refused if the appellant had disclosed his previous fire and the fact that he had claimed and received the $95. The furthest he would go was to say that the Company would have obtained a mercantile report on the appellant.\nIn view of the unwillingness of the Company\u2019s agent to negative the acceptance of the risk with full knowledge, and in view of the fact that the then insurers of the car paid the loss and continued the insurance, the proper inference, in my opinion, is that full disclosure would not have influenced the Company, or any other reasonable insurers, to decline the risk or stipulate for a higher premium.\nThe non-disclosure, not being material to the risk, affords the Company no defence to the appellant\u2019s action.\nWe were referred to the case of Western Assurance Co. v. Harrison[6], where the application which formed the basis of the contract of insurance contains the following:\u2014\nQ. 12. Have you, or if a firm, has any member of it, ever had any property destroyed by fire?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. 13. Give date of fire, and if insured name of company interested;\u2014A. 1892. National, and London & Lancashire.\nThe evidence disclosed that the insured had, prior to the application for insurance, three fires while living on the same property in which the insured property had been destroyed, and the insurance by the policy granted on the application in question was on property which replaced that destroyed by the latter fires. The distinction between this case and the one before us is obvious, as it certainly would be material to the risk to know that an insurer was having numerous fires.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be allowed with costs; the judgment below set aside, and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

Appellant claimed for damages caused by his motor car being struck by respondent's gasoline electric coach on respondent's railway, at a highway level crossing near Colinton Station, Alberta, about noon on July 4, 1930. The coach was used for an inspection trip and was for the first time in that locality. Appellant knew the times of the regular trains, that they stopped at the station, and that none was due. He had reason to expect workmen coming on hand-cars or speeders. The coach bell was not rung. Its horn was sounded, but its noise did not resemble that made by a steam whistle, but rather that of a motor-bus horn. Appellant, in approaching the crossing, looked once in the direction from which the coach was coming, but did not see it, as the station (at which the coach did not stop) obstructed his view, and he did not look again. He had heard the horn once, and now heard it again, but thought it was from a car behind him (there was none in fact) whose driver wished to pass him, and he looked back. At no time did he see the coach. Just before the collision the coach operator, as appellant apparently was not going to stop, applied his brakes. Ford J. ([1913] 2 W.W.R. 886) held that respondent, in not ringing the bell, was guilty of negligence causing the accident, and that appellant, under the circumstances, was not guilty of contributory negligence. His judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division (26 Alta. L.R. 49), which held (by a majority) that appellant was guilty of contributory negligence which was the causa causans of the accident.\nHeld (Rinfret and Smith JJ. dissenting), that, under all the circumstances, appellant was not guilty of contributory negligence, and was entitled to recover.\nPrinciples applicable discussed, and authorities referred to.\nCanadian Pacific Ry.

(Anglin C.J.C. concurring) but discussed and negatived by Rinfret J. (Smith J. concurring) (dissenting). APPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta [1] which, by a majority, allowed the defendant's appeal from the judgment of Ford J. [2]in favour of the plaintiff Green, in an action for damages for personal injuries and for destruction of his motor car, caused by a collision between the defendant's gasoline electric coach on defendant's railway and the plaintiff Green's motor car at a highway level crossing. The Appellate Division1 dismissed the action.\nThe plaintiff Breckenridge was the assignee of the interest of the plaintiff Green in the judgment obtained at trial, and was subsequently added as a party plaintiff.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported, and are indicated in the above headnote. The plaintiffs' appeal to this Court was allowed, with costs in this Court and in the Appellate Division, and the judgment of the trial judge restored. Rinfret and Smith JJ. dissented.\nS. Bruce Smith for the appellants.\nN. D. Maclean, K.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. and Cannon J. was delivered by\nCANNON, J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, reversing (Clarke and Lunney, JJ.A., dissenting) Ford, J., and dismissing with costs the plaintiff Green's action for damages for personal injury; the proceeds of the judgment have been assigned to his father-in-law, Breckenridge, the co-plaintiff.\nThe action arises out of a collision of July 4, 1930, about noon, at Colinton, on the Edmonton to Athabasca line of the respondent, between a motor car driven by Green and a gasoline electric coach owned and operated by the railway company for an official inspection and then for the first time in that locality. Green was proceeding northerly on a street which parallels the railway line, at about 135 feet west of it, and turned east, towards the railway crossing. He was travelling at a speed of about fifteen miles an hour. Before he reached the turn to go easterly, he heard a horn signal which sounded like a \"bus\" horn or a \"studebaker\" horn; and as he was turning the corner, he gave a glance southerly towards the station, to see if any obstruction were on the track. He did not see, approaching from the south, the car which was then hidden by the station to the south of which he could not see from the point where he then was. As he got around the corner, he again heard the horn, but thought it was a bus or automobile on the road, behind him. He did not again look southerly to see if any train was coming along the track and slowly drove up on to the track, where he collided with the railway car. His companion was killed, his car damaged and himself seriously injured.\nGreen knew nothing of the approach of the gas electric car; the sound of the whistle, the exhaust from the gasoline motor, and the shouts of one Meyer standing about 22 yards northeast of the crossing, who, seeing that Green was looking in a northerly direction, rushed towards the crossing, waving his hand and shouting in a vain attempt to warn him, were insufficient to attract his attention, which seems to have been riveted on the discovery of the doings of the automobile which he mistakingly supposed was signalling in his rear.\nIt is common ground that the bell of the gas electric car was not at any time material to the issue now before us used by Dean, the engineer, and the trial judge found that had the bell been ringing the accident could and would have been avoided.\nThe Chief Justice of Alberta and two of his colleagues found that plaintiff's own negligence in crossing the line in broad daylight, without noticing the approaching car, was the main and proximate cause of his injuries.\nSection 308 of the Railway Act enacts that when any train (which includes, under subsections 25 and 34 of section 2, any description of car designed for movement on its wheels), is approaching a highway at rail level, the engine whistle shall be sounded at least eighty rods before reaching such crossing, and the bell shall be rung continuously from the time of the sounding of the whistle until the engine has crossed such highway. On the 30th May, 1930, previous to the accident, by 20-21 Geo. V, ch. 36, section 301 of the Railway Act was repealed and the following substituted therefor:\n301. Every locomotive engine propelled on the railway by steam shall be equipped and maintained with a bell of at least thirty pounds weight and a whistle; and every locomotive engine, car or other mechanism, propelled on the railway otherwise than by steam, shall be equipped and maintained with such signalling appliance or appliances as may be approved by the Board.\nThere is no evidence that the Railway Board have approved of, or determined that any device should be used as a signal by cars propelled otherwise than by steam. The company had, however, equipped this particular car with a horn and a bell, no doubt to be used by their employees as signals to avoid possible danger to the public.\nThe respondents' car, which was travelling for the first time on this short and not extensively used branch line, was thus equipped with a horn and a bell as signalling devices. It appears from the evidence on discovery of James L. Cameron, the superintendent of the Edmonton Division of the respondents' railway, that the noise of the horn in no way resembled that made by a steam whistle. Its sound is somewhat similar to that of the horn heard on motor \"busses\". This official has no knowledge of any order of the Railway Board authorizing the use of such gas-electric coaches.\nThere was no horn, at the time of the accident, at the end of the car then used as the front, although we are told by Cameron that there should have been a horn at each end. The bell is operated by the engineer turning a valve which releases air and runs a little engine which works the clapper on the bell. The bell would ring continuously until stopped, while the sound from the horn would be intermittent.\nIt is admitted that the bell upon the railway coach was not rung at any time material to this accident. Green knew that there was no train due at that time. There is a regular schedule of only eight trains a week, all stopping at Colinton station. The plaintiff was justified in thinking that no train from the south was due at that hour. Nor is he to be blamed for thinking that all trains would stop at the nearby Colinton station, as was the invariable practice, and that the crossing was safe. These circumstances and the use as a special train by respondents of a new and unfamiliar coach, with a signalling horn never before used in that locality on a railway train, and resembling an ordinary motor \"bus\" signal, afford a reasonable excuse for the plaintiff not knowing of the approach of the train.\nCounsel for the respondent at trial put in as part of his evidence portions of the examination for discovery of Green which are as follows:\nQ. What impression did the sound cause on your mind?\u2014A. Well naturally that someone wanted to go by and I no more than got around the corner when it blew again and I went on a little west and it had not passed me and I looked back to see what was wrong.\nQ. And as you approached the railway track you were more or less looking backward over your left shoulder to see whether anything was coming up behind you on the highway?\u2014A. Yes. I looked back to see what had happened to it.\nQ. And are you satisfied now that what you actually heard was the horn from this gas electric coach coming up the track?\u2014A. Well I suppose it would be if that was the only horn blowing.\nQ. Do you know of any other horn?\u2014A. No I know of no other horn.\nQ. And are you satisfied that was the only vehicle trying to pass you? \u2014A. Well there was none passed me as far as I know.\nQ. And you did not see any when you made attempts to see what was behind you?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Did you have a rear mirror?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Did you look in the mirror?\u2014A. Yes, when I looked over my shoulder.\n* * *\nQ. And as nearly as you can recollect after taking the glance southerly along the track at the corner you did not again look southerly along the track until the accident happened?\u2014A. No I did not. On account of this horn blowing I looked back to see what was coming behind.\nQ. Your attention was distracted by what you thought was coming behind you?\u2014A. Yes.\nThe engineer Dean states that, when he got opposite the station or at the north end of the station, he noticed the automobile just in the act of turning the corner.\nThe evidence is that the last time that Dean sounded the horn was when the coach was immediately north of the station. The station was approximately 480 feet from the crossing.\nDean apparently kept his eyes upon the car from the time he first saw it, for the following appears in Dean's cross-examination :\nQ. Did you watch the automobile as it came along?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. All the time?\u2014A. Yes.\nTo quote Lord Hatherly in Dublin, Wicklow & Wexford Railway Co. v. Slattery[3], if a special statutory duty were imposed on a company of whistling at a station, it might be said that this mode of warning strangers, and no other, is what a stranger is entitled to depend upon. The Railway Act imposed on the respondent the duty, when a train approached this highway crossing at rail level, of sounding the engine whistle at least eighty rods before reaching such crossing and of ringing the bell from the time of the sounding of the whistle until the engine has crossed such highway. Parliament thought that the combined sounds of the whistle and of the bell would be a sufficient warning to any stranger of the approach of a train. It is a fair inference that the sounding of the whistle, without the bell signal, would not be a sufficient warning. Indeed, in this case, even assuming that the opening clause of section 301 of the Railway Act as amended does not apply to this peculiar gas electric railway coach or engine, the substitution by the respondent of the horn for the steam whistle, according to all witnesses, justifies the remark of the trial judge, when refusing the motion for non-suit, that \"the sounding of the horn was really a menace rather than a warning\nMoreover, the placing of a bell by the respondent on this coach affords evidence, as against them, of a standard of reasonableness in regard to the precautions to be taken concerning the management of cars in matters affecting the safety of persons using the highways at railway crossings. See Brenner et al. v. Toronto Ry. Co.[4], and Preston v. Toronto Ry. Co.[5].\nCan the appellant be excused for not having seen the approaching coach? He appears to have been in an anxious and perhaps flurried state of mind on account of the peculiar sound of the horn, which made him believe that a car was coming behind him trying to pass him. He omitted looking again to the left when approaching nearer the railway crossing. I believe that if the driver of the coach had started the continuous ringing of the bell, the confusion caused by the horn would have disappeared from the appellant's mind; his attention would have been called to his immediate danger and his movement across the line might have been arrested. But even if Green was not entirely excused for the failure to see the train, there is much to be said in favour of the trial judge's finding that when Dean realized the danger and told to his assistant Gardner: \"I don't think them fellows is going to stop\", he had been guilty of ultimate negligence by not attempting to turn on the bell or again use the horn.\nThe trial judge has decided that the use of the horn and the omission to ring the bell on the part of the train, and not the want of reasonable care on the part of the deceased was the causa causans of the accident. This, in my opinion, is a reasonable inference from the facts, and not a mere guess. In cases like this one, such elements of knowledge and ignorance must be taken into account and the victim's conduct must be viewed in relation to the conduct of the defendant in determining the causa proxima (See Long v. Toronto Railway Company[6], from which leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee was refused). I believe that the cause of the accident was the persistent failure on the part of the engineer in his duty of giving a complete warning, and that Green's want of care is rather to be considered one of the conditions or circumstances on which Dean's continuous failure of duty took effect.\nIn H. & C. Grayson Ltd. v. Ellerman Line Ltd.[7], Lord Birkenhead, in the House of Lords, speaks of the \"different standards\" of care that circumstances may impose on persons in relation to one another. I also believe that different standards were imposed on the parties herein. The respondent owed a direct and definable duty to the appellant. The appellant owed no comparable duty to the respondent, who was bound to warn him that the crossing, which Green had good reason to believe safe at that particular time, had become dangerous by the unexpected presence of this special coach. In some jurisdictions, the driver of a motor car is under statutory obligation to stop at railway crossings; but it is not so in Alberta; there, attenuating circumstances may even be considered to excuse the driver who does not \"look and listen See: Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Griffith[8]; Ottawa Electric Railway Co. v. Booth[9], and Canadian Northern Ry. Co. v. Prescesky[10].\nIn my opinion, the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nLAMONT J.\u2014This is an action for damages for injuries sustained by the appellant Green by reason of a collision between his automobile, driven by himself, and a gasoline electric coach (hereinafter called \"the coach\") belonging to the respondent railway. The collision took place at Colinton, seven miles south of Athabasca, on the respondents' Edmonton-Athabasca line, at a point where the highway crosses the line at level rail. The question for determination is whether, having regard to the circumstances, there was a reasonable excuse for Green's failure to perceive the approach of the coach by which he was injured.\nGreen lived in Colinton and was familiar with the crossing, which was 480 feet north of Colinton station. He knew on what days of the week the respondents' trains passed. There were two regular passenger trains per week north from Edmonton to Athabasca, passing through Colinton on Tuesdays and Fridays respectively, at 9.11 p.m. There were also two regular passenger trains per week south from Athabasca to Edmonton, on the same days, due at Colinton at 7.19 a.m. There were also two regular mixed trains per week each way: those from the north were due in Colinton in the morning and those from the south in the evening. Green knew the time when these trains were due to arrive, and also knew that no train was due around noon. He further knew that all these trains were due to stop at Colinton.\nAt twelve o'clock (noon) on July 4, 1930, Green drove his automobile north along Railway street, which is parallel to the railway track and 134 feet distant from it, until he came to the road running east over the respondents' line. As he turned to go east on this road he looked south along the railway and saw there was no train in sight nor was there anything on the track between the crossing and the station. Of this part of the line he had a clear and unobstructed view. He could not see the track farther to the south as his view was obstructed by the station. Just before Green turned east he heard a horn which sounded like the horn of a motor bus or automobile, but he paid no attention to it. After he had gone about 20 or 30 feet easterly towards the crossing, he again heard the horn and thought it was a motor car behind him whose driver wished to go by. He drove on, he says at about 15 miles per hour, expecting this car to pass, and, as none went by, he said to his companion: \"What the devil is wrong with the fellow?\" Still going on he turned his head and looked back, and this was about the last thing he remembered. He neither saw nor heard the coach and did not know what happened to him. The evidence shews that he was struck by the coach, which came from the south and passed through the station without stopping or slacking speed. The collision smashed the automobile to pieces, grievously injured Green and killed his companion. According to Dean, who was operating the coach, Green had just turned east when the coach was passing the station. The coach, therefore, ran 480 feet to the crossing, while Green ran 134 feet. The coach was fitted with a bell but it was not rung; it was also fitted with a horn or whistle, but it is common ground that the sound it produced did not at all resemble the steam whistle ordinarily used on the respondents' trains on that line. It was the horn of the coach that Green heard. This was the first time that any gasoline electric coach had ever run on this line, and Green had never seen one. The coach was run as a special or extra train, and there is no evidence that any but the regular scheduled trains had ever run on this line after the respondents began to operate it.\nOn the evidence, Mr. Justice Ford, the trial judge, found that the respondents were guilty of negligence in not ringing the bell as required by statute when approaching a highway crossing, and that this negligence was the efficient cause of the accident. He also found that Green had not been guilty of contributory negligence. His finding that the respondents were guilty of negligence in not ringing the bell is not now questioned. It is, however, contended that Green was guilty of contributory negligence in not again looking south before going on the track, and that it was this negligence on his part, and not that of the respondents, which was the causa causans of the accident. This contention was upheld by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta (Clarke and Lunney, JJ. A., dissenting), and the judgment of the trial judge was set aside. From the decision of the Appellate Division this appeal is brought.\nIn Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Griffith[11], Anglin J. (now Chief Justice) stated the law in the following language:\u2014\nWe have, however, the fact that Parliament has deemed it wise to enact that railway trains approaching highway crossings shall give certain signals not for the purpose of attracting the attention of those who are already on the alert and need no warning, but for the purpose of arousing those who are distracted or whose attention is absorbed owing to whatever cause and who, therefore, need warning. Parliament has specified the particular signals which in its judgment are best fitted to serve this purpose. Where it is clearly proved that those signals have been omitted and that an accident, which the giving of them might have prevented, has occurred, it must, I think, always be within the province of a jury to say whether or not, having regard to all these circumstances, the breach of statutory duty should be taken to be the determining cause of the accident.\nIt was, however, pointed out by counsel for the respondents that in the Griffith case[12], as in Dublin, Wicklow & Wexford Ry. Co. v. Slattery[13], and the great majority of cases cited to us, the question which the court was called upon to determine was whether there was sufficient evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant to justify leaving the case to the jury; while in the present case, the action being tried without a jury, the question before the trial judge was not whether there was evidence to go to the jury and on which the jury might find one way or the other, but whether the evidence established negligence on the part of the respondents, which was the proximate cause of Green's injuries. As negligence on the part of the respondents is no longer disputed, we have only to decide whether the conduct of Green has not so clearly proved him the author of his own wrong that it would be unreasonable to attribute the collision to the negligence of the respondents. Our attention was also directed to the fact that there is a difference between the duty of an appellate court where the action is tried with a jury, and where it is tried by a judge alone. In the former case, if there is evidence of negligence which the jury can connect with the accident in the sense of being the cause of it, and the jury does so connect it, an appellate court will not set aside the jury's finding, for it is the function of the jury to find the facts; whereas in an action tried without a jury an appellate court may review the findings of fact of the trial judge. If it is satisfied, after giving due consideration to his findings, that they are not justified upon the evidence, it may set aside the findings and give the judgment which, in the opinion of the court, the trial judge should have given. This rule is, however, subject to a limitation, namely: that where a finding of fact made by a trial judge is based upon the credibility of the witnesses, the weight which an appellate court should accord to his finding is scarcely distinguishable from the weight which would be given to it had it been found by a jury. In the case before us but little depends upon the credibility of the witnesses. Green's testimony as to his knowledge of the practice of the respondents in the operation of their trains at Colinton, the hours at which they were due to arrive, their stopping at the station and the distraction of his mind by the horn of the coach, is not contradicted and was accepted by the trial judge. The chief controversy between the parties on the argument before us was as to the duty devolving upon each of them under the circumstances, and the inferences to be drawn from the facts established in evidence.\nThe duty of the respondents when their train was approaching the crossing was to make known its approach to Green, who was lawfully about to cross. Green's duty was to take reasonable care for his own safety\u2014by this is meant the care which a reasonable and prudent man would take under the circumstances. There is no difficulty about the principle to be applied; the difficulty is in determining just what a prudent man would do in Green's situation. What amounts to reasonable care depends entirely on the circumstances of the particular case as known to the person whose conduct is the subject of the inquiry. Whether, in those circumstances, as so known to him, he used due care\u2014that is, whether he acted as a reasonable and prudent man\u2014is a mere question of fact as to which no legal rules can be laid down. (Salmond's Law of Torts, 7th ed., at p. 28). Being a question of fact, we cannot hope for much assistance from cases decided on facts different from those before us. There are, however, some cases in which the circumstances in certain material respects were similar to those in the case at bar, and the judgments in which contain expressions which indicate what, in the opinion of the courts pronouncing them, would be reasonable conduct under the given circumstances.\nIn the Slattery case[14], a train ran through a station without whistling when it ought to have whistled. The deceased, without looking to see if a train was approaching, attempted to cross the railway company's line at a point where the company permitted persons to cross, and was struck by the train and killed. The accident occurred at night. In an action for damages the jury found for the plaintiff. On appeal to the House of Lords, Lord Cairns, at page 1166, expressed the following opinion:\u2014\nIf a railway train, which ought to whistle when passing through a station, were to pass through without whistling, and a man were, in broad daylight, and without anything, either in the structure of the line or otherwise, to obstruct his view, to cross in front of the advancing train and to be killed, I should think the judge ought to tell the jury that it was the folly and recklessness of the man, and not the carelessness of the company, which caused his death.\nAlthough Lord Cairns was of this opinion, he upheld the verdict of the jury in favour of the plaintiff because, on all the facts, His Lordship thought the conduct of the deceased might be open to two different views, in which case it was for the jury to decide, and they having decided in favour of the plaintiff, their verdict should not be disturbed. The members of the court made it quite plain however, that, had they been deciding the case as a jury, they would have exonerated the company from liability, because, in their opinion, the real cause of the accident was the recklessness and folly of the deceased in not looking to see if a train was coming, and not the negligence of the company.\nIn the above quoted illustration it will be observed that Lord Cairns' opinion is predicated upon the facts as stated by him, and is, therefore, applicable only in cases where the facts are similar, as in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Smith[15]. His Lordship was not there dealing with the rule which would be applicable where the injured person was misled into believing it was safe to cross by the failure of the railway company to observe a customary practice of stopping all trains at the station. Lord Selborne, who agreed with the conclusions reached by Lord Cairns, dealt with this point at page 1193, in the following language:\u2014\nThe cases of Wanless [16] and Bridges [17] in this House (with which that of Jackson [18] is consistent), determined, as I understand them, that a man is not necessarily to be regarded as having caused or contributed to his own death by * * * crossing a line of railway, in a manner prima facie dangerous and imprudent (from which his death actually followed), if there is evidence of acts or omissions on the part of the company by which he might have been put off his guard and led to suppose that he might safely act as he did.\nSee also Pressley v. Burnett[19]; Rex v. Broad[20]; Sharpe v. Southern Ry.[21].\nEven though a plaintiff has been thrown off his guard, yet, notwithstanding that, if the probability of injury was so obvious that it would have been present to the mind of a prudent and reasonable man in the same circumstances, the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover. Mercer v. S.E.&C. Rly. Co.[22].\nIn Clerk and Lindsell on Torts, 8th ed., there is a passage which bears closely on the facts in the case at bar. At page 461 the learned authors state the law as follows:\nAlthough there may be no universal duty upon those in charge of a train to whistle on approaching a level crossing, still if the company have made a practice of so doing, and that practice is known to the plaintiff, the latter will, if he hears no whistle when he is about to cross the line, be justified in assuming that it is unnecessary for him to look about to see whether a train is coming.\nSee also Smith v. South Eastern Ry. Co.[23], 21 Halsbury, page 449, par. 762.\nIn view of these authorities I am of opinion that, where a collision occurs at a level crossing to which the public have access, anyone lawfully using the crossing is entitled to assume the existence of such protection as the public have, through custom, become justified in expecting.\nGreen was lawfully using the crossing. Having looked along the track and having found it clear to the station, he says it did not occur to him to look again. He knew that, according to the respondents' practice, no train would arrive for hours, and that when it did arrive it would stop at the station. If a train had been standing in the station he knew he could be over the crossing before it could start and reach him. As he did not hear the bell or any whistle which would give him notice of danger approaching on the track, he assumed it safe to cross. That he was justified in making that assumption the trial judge has held.\nIn reversing the judgment of the trial judge the majority of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta were, as I read the judgment of the Chief Justice, influenced by two considerations,[24] by the argument that although there was no evidence that any train other than those scheduled to stop at Colinton had ever run over this branch of the respondents' line, yet it was Green's duty to assume that there might be a special or extra train running north and not stopping at Colinton. In his judgment the learned Chief Justice says:\u2014\nThe evidence shews that the regular trains were few and that they stopped at the station but what other traffic there was on the line does not appear and certainly there is no warrant for anyone assuming that there will be nothing on a railway line except regular trains.\nIf this language means that a level crossing is in itself a warning of probable danger to which a person lawfully entitled to cross must pay attention at his peril, I am, with deference, unable to agree. That view, in my opinion, is inconsistent with the view of Lord Selborne in the Slattery case24, quoted above, as well as that expressed in the above passage from Clark and Lindsell on Torts.\nAs I have already said, what amounts to reasonable care on Green's part depends entirely upon the circumstances as they were known to him. If he reasonably believed that any train coming from the south would stop at the station, why should he apprehend danger from that direction? I quite agree that if, to Green's knowledge, it had been customary for special trains to run to and fro at irregular hours, and to pass the station without stopping, the degree of care which would reasonably be required from him would be very different from the degree of care required from a person who is not going to encounter a known risk, but is entitled to assume that there is no risk whatever. But here there is no evidence that any but regular trains had gone over this line and I am not disposed to assume, in favour of the respondents, a fact which they could easily have proved if it had been true.\nThe second consideration which appears to have influenced the majority of the court below arose from what I consider a misapprehension of the facts in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Smith[25], and a misconception of the purport of that decision. In his judgment the learned Chief Justice of Alberta says:\u2014\nThough in the Smith case25 above mentioned there was also the distraction of the driver by a motor horn which was even more distracting because there was in fact a motor following and the driver's attention continued to be distracted in the endeavour to reach a suitable place for the following motor to pass him.\nIn Canadian Northern Ry. Co. v. Prescesky[26], my brother Duff, in referring to the Smith case25, pointed out that, although it had been suggested by Smith's counsel that his attention had been distracted by the horn of a motor car following him, the suggestion had no support in Smith's own testimony. In that case Smith had a clear and unobstructed view of the C.P.R. tracks for half a mile before he reached the crossing, and a view along the tracks for a very considerable distance. Yet, in broad daylight, he drove on to the crossing without looking to see if a train was approaching although he knew that one was due about that time. In his testimony Smith did not even suggest, much less affirm, that his mind was distracted by the horn behind him. In my opinion, the Smith case is applicable only where the facts are similar; where there is nothing in the structure of the line or otherwise to obstruct the plaintiff's view and nothing to distract his mind nor any act or omission on the defendant's part to mislead him into thinking it safe to cross. It cannot have any application here. There was in that case no act or practice on the part of the railway company which could possibly have led Smith to believe he could cross in safety. Here, Green's mind was distracted and he was thrown off his guard by the acts and omissions of the respondents in not following their ordinary practice of having all trains stop at Colinton.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that Green was justified in proceeding upon the assumption that the respondents would follow the theretofore universal practice, or give him due warning if they changed it. In holding that he was justified in the circumstances I am not overlooking the fact that it is open to a railway company, at any time; to alter the schedule on which its trains shall run or add a special train or trains to those already in operation. But, if it does so, it must observe the duty of giving reasonable warning that a train is approaching to anyone legally using the crossing. The statute (Railway Act, ss. 301-308) has prescribed what form the warning shall take. In this case, in my opinion, there was no sufficient warning given to Green: the bell was not rung and I do not think that signalling by means of a horn, whose sound resembles that of a motor bus or automobile which may be heard every day on the highways, is sufficient to call the attention of anyone approaching the crossing to the fact that he should apprehend danger on the track.\nI therefore agree with the trial judge that, in the circumstances, there was a reasonable excuse for Green's failure to see the approach of the coach by which he was injured.\nThe appeal should be allowed; the judgment below set aside and that of the trial judge restored.\nThe appellants are entitled to costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Smith JJ. (dissenting) was delivered by\nRINFRET, J.\u2014This was a collision, at a highway crossing, between a motor car driven by Green and an electric coach operated by the railway company.\nIt came about in this way:\nThe highway ran parallel to the railway for a certain distance, then turned at right angles and continued fo r 134 feet up to the railway track, which it crossed on the level.\nThe electric coach was equipped with a bell and a whistle sounding like a bus horn. Thirty or forty feet before he reached the turn, Green heard the whistle but mistook it for the horn of an automobile intending to pass him. Green knew there was a railway crossing. In the words of the trial judge, he \"was familiar with the railway and the time for the regular trains\". He also knew there were employees working at a bridge in the vicinity and, as it was noon-time, that they were to be expected to come back on speeders or hand-cars for their midday meal.\nWhen he turned into the stretch of the highway leading straight to the railway track, he took \"just a glance over his right shoulder\" to see if a train was coming. He saw none. He had then 134 feet to travel before he reached the track. He did not look again.\nHe had \"no more than got around the corner\" when the locomotive horn blew a second time. He again mistook it for an auto horn, wondered why the auto did not pass him, and \"looked back to see what was wrong\". We will now transcribe the next question and answer:\nQ. And as you approached the railway track you were more or less looking backward over your left shoulder to see whether anything was coming up behind you on the highway?\u2014A. Yes. I looked back to sec what had happened to it.\nThe country surrounding the highway crossing was flat and, all along the straight stretch to the railway track, there was absolutely nothing to obstruct the view from the track for a distance of at least 500 feet. Green was asked the question:\nQ. And if at any time after you had made the turn you had looked south you could doubtless have seen anything that was coming on the track?\nand he answered:\nA. Yes, sir.\nDavid Dean, the engineer driving the electric coach, had noticed Green's car on the portion of the highway parallel to the railway and then on the other portion leading towards the crossing. He fully expected that it would stop. He says it is \"an every day occurrence that automobiles come up to the crossing and stop just short of the tracks\". But, when Dean got 30 or 35 feet from the crossing, he said to his companion: \"I don't think them fellows is going to stop\", and he applied the brakes in emergency and \"then (they) came together When Dean made this remark and applied the brakes, Green's car was 10 to 15 feet away from the crossing. The bell on the electric coach was not ringing.\nThe trial judge said the problem was as follows:\n* * * negligence on the part of the Defendant being clearly proved, and it being admitted by the Plaintiff that he did not see the train approaching, when by looking he could have seen it in time to avoid the accident, are the circumstances such as to afford a reasonable excuse for his failure to see the train?\nTo that problem the trial judge gave the following solution:\nApart from the one glance over his right shoulder made before he completed the turn into the road leading to the crossing, and the one glance he made to the north, Green did not look north or south on the railway track. It did not occur to him to look again to the south. He did not ask his companion to look. There is no doubt the horn Green heard was the horn on the Defendant's electric coach which collided with his car. There is no doubt that the sounding of this horn, which he had no difficulty in hearing over the sound of the engine of his own car, when it sounded the last time before the accident, distracted his attention from the railway track to the investigation of what he thought was behind him wanting to pass or wanting him to stop. Green had never seen one of these electric coaches before. He had never heard the sound of the horn of one of them before. He had never known a train to go through the station at Colinton before without stopping at the station. He did not see the coach at all. He did not know what happened until told some time after the collision. If he had seen the coach when he was ten feet west of the track he could have stopped his car. I have no doubt that if the bell had been rung continuously even from the time the coach cleared the station to the time it reached the crossing the accident would not have happened. I am also of the opinion that if Green's attention had not been distracted by the sounding of the horn of the coach he would have seen the approaching train in time to avoid the accident.\n* * *\nApart from any other consideration, I think it was negligence having a causal relation to the accident and the injury to the Plaintiff that the bell was not rung. I think the circumstances attending the occurrence of the accident were such as to afford a reasonable excuse for the Plaintiff not seeing the approaching train. Under the circumstances I find that his failure to see the approaching train was not contributory negligence on his part and there is no other ground for holding that he was guilty of contributory negligence debarring him from recovering damages.\nThe majority of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta reversed that decision.\nThe learned Chief Justice of Alberta delivered the judgment of the majority; and we agree with his conclusions and, in the main, with his reasons.\nThe trial judge found that the railway company was negligent because the bell of the electric coach was not rung. On the other hand, he found Green negligent because he did not look, \"when by looking he could have seen (the train) in time to avoid the accident\".\nOn these findings, Green's contributory negligence disentitled him from recovering unless, as Harvey, C.J., expressed it: \"the established facts, for there is no conflict of testimony of importance, furnish sufficient excuse for the failure of the plaintiff to take more care than he did before going upon the track.\"\nWe adopt as our own the following passages of the judgment of the majority in the Appellate Division:\nThe evidence shows that the regular trains were few and that they stopped at the station but what other traffic there was on the line does not appear and certainly there is no warrant for anyone assuming that there will be nothing on a railway line except regular trains. * * * * Indeed the Plaintiff had reason to expect hand cars and speeders at this place at this time and therefore knew that he should have kept a watch. Just north of the crossing on a siding were some box cars housing a bridge building crew the members of which would at noon come in for their lunch. Those working south of the crossing would require to cross the highway, but those working to the north would not.\nThat a person about to pass over a railway crossing upon a level should look to see whether or not a train is approaching is not only the result of all the decided cases, but is a matter of plain common sense. In fact, the trial judge did not dispute that proposition and he exculpated Green only because, in his opinion, the circumstances afforded him a reasonable excuse for not looking. That excuse he found in the fact that \"Green's attention had been distracted by the sounding of the horn of the coach\". He did not find any other excuse.\nWhile it is obvious that, in litigation such as this, the special facts of each case must be considered, and a previous decision in one accident case can rarely be relied on as complete authority for a subsequent accident case, one can hardly escape pointing out the striking similarity between the circumstances of the present case and those in Canadian Pacific By. Co. v. Smith[27], where it was also suggested that the driver's attention had been distracted by the tooting of an automobile behind him which he thought wished to pass him. The holding was that, notwithstanding the assumed negligence of the railway company owing to the absence of statutory warnings, the driver of the car must be held negligent in attempting to cross the tracks without looking for the approaching train, as no evidence was given of circumstances which would warrant a jury in finding he was excused from doing so. And this court dismissed the action of the driver.\nIn that case, there was in fact an automobile behind the plaintiff's car and the sound of the horn heard by the driver came from that automobile. In this case, the presence of another car was only imaginary; the sound came from the horn of the electric coach of the railway company; but we do not think the difference is of the slightest importance. We do not consider that a circumstance of such a character: just because a driver thinks an automobile behind him intends to pass him, could excuse him for looking backwards while he approaches a railway track which he knows to be there. But, moreover, the horn from the electric coach was heard by Green when, in his own words, he had \"no more than got around the corner\". He was then still about 120 feet from the crossing. In a moment, the distraction was removed or ought to have been removed. It should not take 120 feet for a man to find out whether a car is behind him or not. The road was wide enough and all he had to do was to go a little more to one side, signal with his hand (if he wanted to) and let it pass. It was an absurd thing to do to look backwards; and, like the Appellate Division, we are unable to accede to the proposition that the circumstances afforded a reasonable excuse for the appellant's failure to perceive the approach of the train by which he was injured.\nIf Green's failure to look was inexcusable in the circumstances, then he was negligent and his negligence debars him from recovering from the railway company. If, notwithstanding the fact that his momentary distraction might be justifiable, yet after the distraction ought to have been removed, he had sufficient time \"in which to use his senses as a careful man about to cross a railway track\", still he was negligent and again his action fails.\nBut it was argued\u2014and the trial judge so held\u2014that \"when Dean, knowing the kind of train he was operating, should have seen the plaintiff's car and realized the danger, he could have avoided the result of (Green's) contributory negligence by using the means provided\", that is: by ringing the bell. That holding is based on the theory of ultimate negligence, which is that, notwithstanding the negligence of one or the other or both of the parties to the accident, \"there is a period of time, of some perceptible duration, during which both or either may endeavour to avert the impending catastrophe\" (per Lord Sumner in British Columbia Electric Ry. Co. v. Loach[28]).\nIn the present case, there is no occasion for the application of the doctrine. The breach of the statutory duty to ring the bell continued up to the time of the collision; but so also did the plaintiff's failure to look continue up to the moment of the impact. It is said that if the bell had been rung even 35 feet before the coach reached the crossing, the accident might have been avoided. With great respect, for reasons about to be stated, we cannot accept that finding, which was set aside by the Appellate Division and which is, in our view, purely a conjecture (See Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co. v. Earl[29]). However, assuming that to be the fact, it was equally found as a fact that \"if Green had seen the coach when he was ten feet west of the track he could have stopped his car\". If he did not see it, it was because he did not look. That means that if he had looked, even when he was at ten feet from the track, the accident might have been avoided. Surely by that time any effect from the so-called distraction must have vanished. No excuse was left for not looking at least at that spot. And we fail to understand why the ruling which fastens negligence on the railway company should not equally apply to fasten negligence on the plaintiff.\nIn spite of the absence of warning, if the plaintiff had kept his eyes about him, he would have perceived the approach of the train and would have kept out of mischief. If that be so, his action must fail, for he was certainly guilty of contributory negligence. He owed his injury to his own fault, and whether his negligence was the sole cause or the cause jointly with the railway company's negligence does not matter (British Columbia Electric Railway Company Limited v. Loach[30]).\nBe that as it may, the doctrine of ultimate negligence is predicated on the assumption that the defendant might, by the exercise of care on his part, have avoided the consequences of the neglect or carelessness of the plaintiff (Tuff v. Warman[31]); and the duty to exercise that special care, breach of which constitutes ultimate negligence, only arises when the plaintiff's danger was or should have been apparent. (Loach case[32].)\nIn Long v. Toronto Railway Co.[33], the motorman admitted he realized the danger almost immediately when he first saw the deceased. Here, even if we accept the version that Green was in a distracted state of mind because he thought an automobile was about to pass him, that state of mind could neither be discovered nor foretold by the engineer, who was not endowed with the art of divination. According to the trial judge's finding, the likelihood of Green putting himself in danger became apparent when the coach was at most 35 feet from the crossing. On the evidence and at the rate of speed the coach was going, 35 feet would be covered in not quite one second. In that extremely short time, the engineer had to make up his mind, and do one of three things: ring the bell, blow the whistle or apply the brakes. It must be a matter of extreme doubt whether, at that time, either of these things could still be effective. The engineer could not do the three things, nor even two of them. He applied the brakes; and, the moment after, the coach and the motor car were together. Like the Appellate Division, we do not think ringing the bell would have brought a different result. At all events, applying the brakes was a reasonable thing to do, it was the most natural and instinctive thing to do, and even assuming it would have been wiser to ring the bell, the engineer can hardly be blamed, in the emergency, to have adopted the course he did. In the Loach case[34], when the motorman saw the cart and realized the danger, he was 400 feet from the crossing and the evidence was that, with a brake in good order, the car should have been stopped in 300 feet. In our view, it is clear from the facts of the present case that when Dean became aware of the dangerous position of Green there could have been no time for Dean to do anything to avoid the impact. (Swadling v. Cooper[35].)\nAt most, this is one of the cases spoken of by Viscount Birkenhead, L.C., as being \"at the other end of the chain\" (The Volute case[36]), and of which he gives the following illustration:\nA's negligence makes collision so threatening that though by the appropriate measure B. could avoid it, B. has not really time to think and by mistake takes the wrong measure. B. is not held to be guilty of any negligence and A. wholly fails: The Bywell Castle[37]; Stoomvaart Maatschappy Nederland v. Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co.[38].\nIt is our view that Dean's and Green's negligence was contemporaneous or \"synchronous,\" as put by the House of Lords in the Volute case[39], and that it is impossible to find a period at which Green's negligence had ceased and after which Dean's ultimate negligence had begun. At all events, we do not find it possible to say that \"a clear line can be drawn,\" after which the supposed subsequent negligence of Dean alone could be regarded. Here, both acts of negligence were so mixed up with the state of things as to make it a cause of contribution (The Volute case[40]). Green's negligence, if not the sole cause of his being injured, was at least a contributing cause quite as proximate and immediate as the breach of the statutory duty by the railway company's employee (Grand Trunk Pacific Ry. Co. v. Earl[41]), and we would like to conclude with the remarks of Duff J. in the Earl case[42]: To distinguish this case from the hypothetical case put by Lord Cairns or from the case of Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Smith[43], or, indeed, from a number of other authorities which could be named would, I think, with the greatest respect, be approaching perilously near to frittering away the substance of the doctrine (of contributory negligence) which it is the duty of the court to apply.\nOf the cases relied on by the learned trial judge, or to which we were referred by counsel for the appellant, the following should be said: Most of those cases were jury trials; and, as pointed out by Lord Penzance in Dublin, Wicklow & Wexford Ry. Co. v. Slattery[44],\nin all these cases the question which the Court was deciding was not whether the plaintiff was negligent, but whether there was evidence to go to the jury of negligence by the defendants such as caused the injury.\nIn many of those cases, the courts clearly indicated that their own opinion was different from that expressed in the verdict; but they would not reverse it because it appeared to them that to reverse, in the words of Lord Cairns (Dublin, etc., Ry. Co. v. Slattery[45]), \"would seriously encroach upon the legitimate province of a jury.\" Other cases cited concerned street railway accidents; and, in our view, street railway accidents should not be decided according to the same standards as other railway cases; for railway companies, like the respondents herein, are on their own private right of way, while street railways are run on public streets where the people have equal access and the conditions are different.\nThe appeal should be dismissed, with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 26 Alta.

By his will, he left to his wife (who actually survived him only eight days) the entire income during her life, with provision for payments to her out of principal if required; after her death the estate was to be converted into cash and distributed as follows: specified amounts to four individuals, aggregating $2,500; specified amounts to various charities, aggregating $4,600; then, by clause 5, \u201cAll money remaining after payment of the legacies and bequests made herein shall be paid to the said legatees in equal shares, and in case my said estate shall not be sufficient to pay all of the said legacies and bequests in full then I direct that the legacies and bequests shall abate proportionately.\u201d Clause 6 provided: \u201cIn the event of any of the legatees dying leaving a child or children, then the share which would have gone to the said legatee shall go to the child or children of such legatee in equal shares, and in case any of the said legatees die without leaving a child or children then the share to which they would have been entitled to shall become part of my residuary estate, and shall be divided as aforesaid.\u201d The question for determination was whether the residue dealt with in clause 5 was bequeathed to the four individual legatees, or was to be divided in equal shares among them and the charities.\nHeld, that, upon the true construction of the will as a whole, and considering the circumstances surrounding and known to the testator when he made it, and in view of the effect of the other construction, and the nature of some of the charities, the testator must be taken to have intended the word \u201clegatees\u201d in clause 5 to mean the four individual legatees only; that he intended a distinction between the \u201clegacies\u201d and the \u201cbequests\u201d in clause 5, applying \u201clegacies\u201d to his gifts to the individuals, and whom he referred to as \u201clegatees,\u201d and \u201cbequests\u201d to his gifts to charities.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Ont., [1932] 1 D.L.R. 595, reversed.\nIn construing a testator\u2019s language, where ambiguous, the court may consider not only the provisions of the will, but also the circumstances surrounding and known to him when he made it, and adopt the meaning most intelligible and reasonable as being his intention.\nWhile the words \u201clegacies\u201d and \u201cbequests\u201d are indiscriminately used in testamentary dispositions to mean gifts of personalty, yet a testator may use them to distinguish donations to different classes, and his intention to do so, if clear, will be given effect.\nIt is not to be imputed to a testator, unless the context requires it, that he uses additional words for no purpose (Oddie v. Woodford, 3 My. & Cr. 584, at 614).\nAPPEAL by certain of the individual beneficiaries named in the will of Theophilus Tyhurst, deceased, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], which (reversing, on the question at issue, the judgment of Raney J.[2]) declared that the individual beneficiaries in question and the charitable beneficiaries in question (except, as settled in the formal judgment, the City of Chatham for upkeep of cemetery plot) were all entitled to share equally in the residue of the estate of the said deceased.\nThe material facts of the case and the question in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Lamont J. now reported, and are indicated in the above head-note. The appeal to this Court was allowed.\nG.P. Campbell for the appellants.\nJohn M. Godfrey K.C. for the respondent, the Muskoka Hospital for Consumptives.\nJ.A. McNevin K.C. for the respondents, the Trustees of the Home of the Friendless in the city of Chatham.\nH.D. Smith K.C. for the respondents, the Trustees of the Children\u2019s Shelter of the city of Chatham, and the Salvation Army of the city of Chatham.\nA.T. Whitehead for the respondents, the Home Mission Fund of the United Church of Canada, the Superintendent of the Sunday School of the United Church at Charing Cross, and the Superintendent of the Sunday School of the Zion United Church, Creek Road, county of Kent.\nMcGregor Young K.C, Official Guardian, for the respondent Harvey Mitton, an infant (contending the same as appellants).\nH.E. Grosch for the Executors of the Estate of the said deceased.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur with my brother Lamont.\nOne cannot, I think, properly overlook the juxtaposition of the words \u201clegacies\u201d and \u201cbequests,\u201d at several points in article 5 of the will. The argument on behalf of the respondents has not convinced me that this clause does not recognize some distinction between a bequest, as connoting a gift proceeding from something in the nature of a charitable intention, in the legal sense, and a legacy as something in the nature of a personal gift.\nI think the use of the term \u201csaid legatees,\u201d in the second line of article 5, points in the same direction. In article 6 we have the same term \u201clegatee\u201d continued throughout: this term in both articles is unmistakably limited to gifts of the second of the above mentioned classes. It is true that there is no word so precisely descriptive of the recipient of a bequest as of the recipient of a legacy. But I think if the testator had intended all the gifts to be on the same footing, in relation to the provisions of article 6, a very slight modification of the language would have been sufficient to make it clear.\nThe appeal should be allowed; except as to any disposition of costs in the courts below, which is not disturbed. There should be only one set of costs in this court, payable, respectively, to the appellants and to the respondents out of the estate; two counsel fees may be allowed in each case; the Official Guardian will, of course, have his costs as usual.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014This appeal involves the interpretation of the will of Theophilus Tyhurst, deceased, made the 12th day of March, 1928.\nAfter making provision for the payment of his just debts and testamentary expenses, the testator devised and bequeathed the remainder of his estate to his executors upon trust:\n1. To pay to his wife the entire income of the estate during her lifetime and to make payments to her out of the principal if, in her discretion, she considers the income insufficient for her personal requirements.\n2. After the death of the wife the executors were directed to convert the estate into cash and distribute it as follows:\nTo John D. Smith, $500.\nTo his daughter Rose Verna, $500.\nTo his niece Lillian Roseburg, $500, and To Harvey Mitton the sum of $1,000.\nTo the Trustees of the Home of the Friendless in the city of Chatham, $1,000.\nTo the Trustees of the Children\u2019s Shelter in the city of Chatham, $1,000.\nTo the Home Missionary Fund of the United Church of Canada, the sum of $500.\nTo the Muskoka Hospital for Consumptives at Gravenhurst, the sum of $1,000.\nTo the Salvation Army at the city of Chatham, $500.\nTo the Superintendent of the Sunday School of the United Church at Charing Cross, $200 for Sunday School purposes.\nTo the Superintendent of the Sunday School of Zion United Church, Creek Road, in the county of Kent, $200 for Sunday School purposes.\nTo the proper officials of the City of Chatham, the sum of $200 for the maintenance and upkeep of the family cemetery plot in the Maple Leaf Cemetery.\nThen clause 5 of the will reads:\nAll money remaining after payment of the legacies and bequests made herein shall be paid to the said legatees in equal shares, and in case my said estate shall not be sufficient to pay all of the said legacies and bequests in full then I direct that the legacies and bequests shall abate proportionately.\nThe neat question for determination in this appeal is whether upon the true construction of the will the residue (which amounts to $48,000) is bequeathed to the four individual legatees, or whether it is to be divided in equal shares among them and the above mentioned charitable beneficiaries.\nIn construing a will the duty of the court is to ascertain the intention of the testator, which intention is to be collected from the whole will taken together. Every word is to be given its natural and ordinary meaning and, if technical words are used, they are to be construed in their technical sense, unless from a consideration of the whole will it is evident that the testator intended otherwise.\nThe learned judge of the first instance construed clause 5 to mean that the residue was to be divided among the four individual legatees only. On appeal to the Second Appellate Division his judgment was reversed (Latchford C.J. dissenting). From the judgment of the Appellate Division this appeal is brought.\nThe contention of the respondents, to which effect was given by the Appellate Division, is that the \u201clegatees\u201d mentioned in the second line of clause 5, who are to share in the residue, comprise all beneficiaries receiving under the will a gift of personal estate; that the words \u201clegacy\u201d and \u201cbequest\u201d in a will have exactly the same meaning and that the word \u201clegatee\u201d is just as apt to describe the recipient of a gift intended as support for charity as the recipient of a gift intended as a personal donation.\nIt cannot be denied that the words \u201clegacies\u201d and \u201cbequests\u201d are indiscriminately used in testamentary dispositions to mean gifts of personal property. A testator, however, is entitled to use them to distinguish donations to different classes and his intention will be given effect to provided he has made it clear what his intention was. As has often been said, a will ought as far as possible to be its own dictionary. In determining whether the testator used \u201clegacies\u201d and \u201cbequests\u201d as synonomous terms or as specifying gifts to different groups, we must bear in mind the canon of construction laid down by Lord Cottenham in Oddie v. Woodford[3]:\nNow I take it to be one rule in the construction of a will, that you are not to impute to a testator, unless the context requires it, that he uses additional words except for some additional purpose; that you are not to suppose he uses additional words for no purpose.\nTurning now to what may be called the plan of the will, it will be seen that the testator has made three classes the objects of his bounty: first his wife; second the four personal legatees, each of whom was a relative or friend, and third the charitable beneficiaries. His gifts to the latter two classes were to take effect only after the death of his wife. Contemplating, or, to use the term employed by Blackburn J. in Grant v. Grant[4], \u201csoliloquizing\u201d as to what distribution he would make of his property after the death of his wife, the testator directs his executors to pay to the beneficiaries, both individual and charitable, the specific sums above set out. These amounted to $2,500 for the four individuals and $4,600 for the charitable bequests. His property at the time was worth in the neighbourhood of $55,000, so that, after payment of these specific gifts, there would be to dispose of a residue of some $48,000. This he disposes of in clause 5 by providing that, after the payment of the \u201clegacies\u201d and \u201cbequests\u201d made herein, all the money remaining shall be paid to the \u201csaid legatees.\u201d Here he designates the specific sums which he directed to be paid as \u201clegacies\u201d and \u201cbequests,\u201d and it is contended for the appellants that, by doing so, he was making a distinction between the two terms and applying \u201clegacies\u201d to the payments made to the four individuals (who may be referred to as Group 1), and \u201cbequests\u201d to the charitable beneficiaries (who may be said to constitute Group 2).\nIt will be observed that in clause 5 the testator uses the terms legacies and bequests no less than three times. If these words meant, to his mind, exactly the same thing, why use the two words? And why repeat them? It is said that one must be considered as surplusage, but words are only to be treated as surplusage when the will or the circumstances to which we are entitled to look satisfies us that the testator could not have been making a distinction between them. In the light of the testator\u2019s use of the two words it may not be unimportant to ask if it is not more in accordance with the prevailing custom to refer to gifts to charity, as charitable bequests, rather than as charitable legacies?\nThe respondents contend that the provision in clause 5, that if the \u201cestate shall not be sufficient to pay all of the said legacies and bequests in full,\u201d they shall abate proportionately, shews that two considerations were present to the testator\u2019s mind: (1) a possibility that when his wife should die his estate might not amount to $7,100, the amount of the specified legacies and bequests, and (2) that he desired all the beneficiaries of Groups 1 and 2 to be treated alike. While a man would naturally put such a provision in his will, because it is well known that riches have wings, I find it difficult to conclude that the testator was contemplating as a real possibility that his wife would use up not only the income but the greater part of the corpus of the estate as well, or that there would not be a considerable residue to distribute (the wife survived the testator only eight days). As to the argument that the provision indicated an intention that all beneficiaries should be treated equally, it does not follow, in my opinion, that because he might, in case of deficiency, desire all gifts to abate proportionately, he would, in case of a surplus, desire all beneficiaries to share in it to the same extent.\nThe appellants rely upon clause 6, which reads:\u2014\nIn the event of any of the legatees dying leaving a child or children, then the share which would have gone to the said legatee shall go to the child or children of such legatee in equal shares, and in case any of the said legatees die without leaving a child or children then the share to which they would have been entitled to shall become part of my residuary estate, and shall be divided as aforesaid.\nIt is contended that in this clause the word \u201clegatee\u201d is clearly limited to the beneficiaries of Group 1, for they are the only ones who might have children, and that, the testator having indicated in this clause the sense in which he uses the word \u201clegatee,\u201d that meaning must given to it in clause 5. The only answer made to this contention is that the words \u201cany of the legatees\u201d apply only to such as might have children, but do not exclude other legatees from participating in the residue.\nIn construing the language of the testator where it is ambiguous, we are entitled to consider not only the provisions of the will, but also the circumstances surrounding and known to the testator at the time when he made the will, and adopt the meaning most intelligible and reasonable as being his intention. If the respondents\u2019 contention is right, each of the beneficiaries of Groups 1 and 2 will obtain out of the residue an additional sum of $4,000. Referring to the last three charitable bequests, is it reasonable to think that the testator ever contemplated a gift of $4,000 to each of the superintendents of the two Sunday Schools mentioned, for Sunday School purposes, in addition to the specified gift of $200, and that without knowing who the superintendents might be or what they might consider Sunday School purposes? Or can we reasonably conclude that he contemplated a like contribution to be made to the officials of the City of Chatham for the maintenance and upkeep of his family cemetery plot?\nReading the will as a whole and in the light of the above considerations, I am of opinion that the testator intended to make a distinction between the \u201clegacies\u201d and the \u201cbequests\u201d in clause 5, applying the word \u201clegacies\u201d to his gifts to the individuals comprising Group 1, and whom he referred to as \u201clegatees,\u201d and the word \u201cbequests\u201d to his gifts to charities.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed with costs but the costs payable out of the estate will be limited to one set each for appellants and respondents. The Official Guardian\u2019s costs will also be payable out of the estate.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Shaw & Shaw.\nSolicitors for the respondents, the Trustees of the Home of the Friendless in the City of Chatham: Kerr, McNevin & Kerr.\nSolicitors for the respondents, the Trustees of the Children\u2019s Shelter of the City of Chatham, and the Salvation Army of the City of Chatham: Smith & Smith.\nSolicitors for the respondent, the Muskoka Hospital for Consumptives: Godfrey & Corcoran.\nSolicitor for the respondents, the Home Mission Fund of the United Church of Canada, the Superintendent of the Sunday School of the United Church at Charing Cross, and the Superintendent of the Sunday School of the Zion United Church, Creek Road, County of Kent: A.T.

APPEAL by the plaintiff (by leave granted by the Appellate Division, Alta.) from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta [1] allow- ing (Clarke and McGillivray, JJ.A., dissenting) the defendant's appeal from the judgment of Boyle J. in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff and defendant were neighbouring farmers, living near Crowfoot, Alta., and in 1928 they had large quantities of wheat, which they assisted each other in hauling, most of which was shipped through different elevators, but two carloads were shipped directly into the cars over the railway platform. The whole question for determination was whether, on conflicting evidence, the wheat in one of these cars belonged to the plaintiff or to the defendant.\nOn the appeal to this Court, after hearing argument of counsel, the Court reserved judgment, and on a subsequent day delivered judgment allowing the appeal with costs in this Court and in the Appellate Division, and restoring the judgment of the trial judge. Written reasons were delivered by Anglin C.J.C. and by Smith J. Smith J., with whom Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ. concurred, after discussing the evidence at some length and after discussing the judgments below, expressed the view that this was an ordinary case of a trial judge hearing and seeing the witnesses and, from their conduct in the box and the circumstances, arriving at a conclusion as to which side was right as to the facts. After reading all the evidence very carefully, the learned judge was not prepared to say that he would have differed with the trial judge on his finding of fact on the whole evidence, and therefore his judgment should prevail. Anglin C.J.C. stated that he concurred in the result of the judgment on the simple ground that the case involved nothing but a question of fact, upon which the trial judge had made a specific finding based upon evidence which, apparently, fully warranted it, and there was nothing in the case to justify the action of the Appellate Division in setting that finding aside, based, as it was, chiefly upon the credibility of witnesses.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nO.

Anglin C.J.C., and Cannon J. dissented.\nWritten reasons were delivered by Smith J., with whom Rinfret and Lamont JJ. concurred, and by Anglin, C.J.C. (dissenting), and by Cannon J. (dissenting). All the reasons discussed the evidence at some length.\nSmith J. (Rinfret and Lamont JJ. concurring), after discussing the evidence, stated that \u201cit was for the trial judge to determine the credibility of the witnesses appearing before him in the box, and he has believed the evidence of the appellant and Blanchard and concludes that the respondent, after a severe illness and the long lapse of years, has forgotten the real terms of the agreement\u201d between him and the appellant\u2019s husband. He stated his opinion, not only that the trial judge should not be reversed where the whole matter turns on the credibility of witnesses, but also, on examination of the evidence, that the trial judge arrived at the correct conclusion.\nAnglin, C.J.C. (dissenting), held that the circumstances were such that it was impossible to grant the relief prayed for; it is well established law that rectification of a deed, such as was here sought, can be granted only where there has been mutual mistake, and an agreement between the parties contrary to the tenor of the deed is established beyond question by irrefragable evidence (Clarke v. Joselin[3]), which should be such as to produce on all minds alike the conviction that the deed is wrong and should have been made to conform to the substance of the agreement (McNeill v. Haines[4]; Rowland v. McDonald[5]). After discussing the evidence, he stated that, on the whole record, he was satisfied that no case whatever had been made for rectification, either because the deed had been shown to be false, or because an agreement as to the division as alleged by appellant had been shown to have had pre-existence; if it should come down to a question of preference, as to their credibility, of witnesses, he would certainly prefer to believe the respondent rather than the witness Blanchard. He approved of the reasons of Mellish J. in the court below.\nCannon J. (dissenting) was of opinion, after a careful perusal of the evidence (which he discusses in his reasons), that it was impossible to say that there was a mutual mistake with respect to the boundaries of the land conveyed; the court cannot make a new contract unless it is absolutely certain that in so doing it is rectifying a mistake and giving effect to the clearly proved intention of the parties; they have chosen to make a solemn contract in writing and the court must not substitute another for it after the death of one of the parties and the lapse of 25 years, except upon evidence which is reasonably free from doubt; rectification can be granted only if the mistake is mutual and the evidence of the mutual mistake is clear and unambiguous; moreover (a point also referred to by Anglin, C.J.C.), the evidence on appellant\u2019s behalf as to where the division line should be drawn lacked certainty and would not enable the court to prepare an unchallengeable description for a new deed.

According to the specification, the invention was particularly applicable for detachably retaining blades in safety razors and blade stropping mechanism. A particular feature claimed was that a word or symbol, such as a trade-mark, might be outlined in the blade by means of apertures therein and the projection or projections on the holder might be arranged so as to enter one or more of said apertures to retain the blade in the holder. Another feature claimed was that the projections might be formed in the holder at one period to engage certain of the blade apertures and at another period the projections might be located in a position to receive any other of the apertures, thus enabling the manufacturer, by shifting the position of the projections, to preclude the use in the holder of blades produced by an unauthorized manufacturer. Respondent claimed that appellants had infringed the patent by selling blades, with certain positioned apertures, for use in respondent\u2019s holder. Respondent relied on, and its action for infringement was confined to, two claims in the specification, which were those having to do with the blade itself. Held: Respondent\u2019s action should be dismissed. Judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, [1932] Ex. C.R. 54, reversed.\nAnglin C.J.C. and Duff J. agreed in the result.\nPer Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.: Having regard to what was the sole subject matter in the issue, to the nature and scope of the claims in question, to the evidence, to the characteristics in the blade as presented by the claims, and to the purpose of the blade\u2019s design, there was no patentable invention in the blade, the claims in question in regard thereto in the specification were invalid and void, and therefore the present action for infringement did not lie.\nThe claim, in a specification, being primarily designed for delimitation, the monopoly is confined to what the patentee has claimed as his invention (British United Shoe Machinery Co. Ltd. v. A. Fussel & Sons Ltd., 25 R.P.C. 631, at 650; Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd v. Tubeless Pneumatic Tyre and Capon Heaton, Ltd., 15 R.P.C. 236, at 241).\nThe inventor must in his specification describe in language free from ambiguity the nature of his invention and he must define the precise and exact extent of the exclusive property and privilege which he claims (French\u2019s Complex Ore Reduction Co. v. Electrolytic Zinc Process Co., [1930] Can. S.C.R. 462).\nThe idea of merely impressing a trade-mark in a razor blade by means of apertures in the blade, is not patentable.\nA device designed exclusively for the protection of the particular manufacturer lacks utility within the meaning of the patent law and does not amount to invention in the patentable sense.\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding that the plaintiff\u2019s patent in question was valid and that the defendants, by selling (as found by Maclean J.) razor blades for use in the plaintiff\u2019s blade holder, and containing, besides other apertures, all the apertures contained in the plaintiff\u2019s blade, and positioned as in the plaintiff\u2019s blade, thus enabling the blades sold by the defendants to be used in the plaintiff\u2019s blade holder, had infringed the plaintiff\u2019s patent.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Rinfret J. now reported and in the said judgment of Maclean J. appealed from. The appeal was allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and M. B. Gordon for the appellants.\nG. F. Henderson K.C. and E. G. Gowling for the respondent. Anglin C.J.C.\u2014I agree in the result of the judgment in this case, but, for want of opportunity to consider and analyze it in detail, cannot commit myself on the various propositions of law which it incidentally enounces.\nDuff J.\u2014I agree in the result.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ. was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The respondents brought action against the appellants, in the Exchequer Court of Canada, for the alleged infringement of certain claims of Canadian letters patent No. 287, 676 owned by the respondents. The appellants filed a statement of defence denying infringement and invoking the invalidity of the claims. The court held the patent valid and found it had been infringed by the appellants[2]. Hence the present appeal.\nThe patent was applied for and granted \u201cfor an alleged new and useful improvement in Blade Holders.\u201d In the specification, it is stated that the invention relates to improvements in blade holders and is particularly applicable for detachably retaining blades in safety razors and blade stropping mechanism.\u201d\nOne object of the invention is stated to be:\nto provide a blade holder provided with one or more projections adapted to co-operate with a corresponding opening or openings in the interior of the blade between its marginal edges to retain the blade in the holder.\nA particular feature of my invention is that a word or symbol, such as a Trade-Mark, may be outlined in the blade by means of apertures therein and the said projection or projections on the holder may be arranged in such a manner as to enter one or more of said apertures to retain the blade in the holder for shaving or stropping purposes.\nThere follows a description of the mechanical device whereby the blade is retained between the members of the holder, and then the specification runs as follows:\nA further feature of my invention is that the means that retain the members of the holder together for use are provided with means in position to co-operate with the blade for positioning it in the holder when the members of the holder are separated to receive the blade, which last named means will release the blade when the retaining means is in position to retain the members of the holder against the blade, so that a blade that is not properly provided with apertures for the previously mentioned projections on the holder will not be retained therein for use. Reference is then made to the drawings, followed by a minute description of the blade holder and of the blade, of which it is declared that\nit is provided with notches or recesses at its ends near the corners adjacent to the heel of the blade opposite its cutting edge, providing projections at the inner corners of the blade which are adapted to be opposed by lugs or projections located upon the inner portions of the arms or latches (attached to the holder) to oppose the blade projections.\n(the function of these arms or latches being described);\nand in order to retain the blade between said members (of the holder) when clamped against the blade I provide the blade with apertures (indicated) to receive corresponding projections extending inwardly from member 1 (of the holder) * * * The apertures of the blade are shown related in such a manner to one another as to produce a designation, such as a word or symbol. In the example illustrated the symbol DEFGH is shown * * *\nIt is stated that, by means of the projections, \u201cthe blade will be prevented from sliding.\u201d\nAnother feature of the invention mentioned in the description is that the projections may be formed in the holder at one period to engage certain of the apertures of the blade, whereas at another period the projections may be located in a position to receive any other of the apertures. \u201cBy means of (this) arrangement,\u201d\nin case an unauthorized manufacturer of the blades should produce blades having apertures that correspond in location to the projections of (the holder) that have been made by the original manufacturer at one period, the latter manufacturer, by shifting the position of the projections * * * at another period would preclude the use in the holder of such unauthorized blades, because the apertures would not register with the last named projections * * *.\nThe description then goes on to explain how the improved blade holder is adapted for use in a safety razor\u201d and it winds up in this way:\nWhile I have particularly referred to my invention with utilizing a designation, such as a Trade-Mark, name or symbol in a safety razor blade, it will be understood that my invention is not limited to such use since the designation may be formed by apertures or depressions in any desired member to indicate the manufacture of the same, which apertures or designations are so located with reference to positioning means carried by another member as will cause said members to properly register with respect to each other when the apertures or depressions and the projections are in co-operation.\nHaving thus described the invention and its operation or use as contemplated by the inventor, the specification ends with thirteen claims, two of which are limited to the razor blade, while the balance refers to the blade holder only or to the combination of the blade and the blade holder.\nAs between the parties, the case was concerned solely with the two claims dealing with the razor blade alone. This was made clear at the trial both by counsel for the respondents and by their expert witnesses. The action was confined exclusively to claims 1 and 2; and, in order to ascertain the exact scope of these claims, it will be preferable to transcribe them verbatim:\n1. A razor blade having apertures or depressions in the form of a designation to indicate the manufacture of the said blade, the said apertures or depressions being so shaped and located that they will co-operate with different holders, such holders having sets of projections differing inter se but such that any one of such sets will prevent such razor blade from sliding or turning on the said holder.\n2. A variation of the invention claimed in Claim 1 in which the apertures or depressions in the blade are so shaped and located that they will co-operate with different holders, such holders having sets of projections which have some but not all of the projections in common as and for the purposes set out in the first claim.\nThe only case the appellants were called upon to meet was whether or not the razor blade described in claims 1 and 2 was patentable as a new and useful manufacture and, if so, whether these claims had been infringed by them.\nThe question of the patentability of the blade is therefore first to be considered, for, if it be answered in the negative, the issue as to infringement becomes immaterial. On that question, as we read the judgment appealed from, the true effect of the findings of the learned trial judge is that there was invention in the combination of the blade and the blade holder, but that there was none in the blade itself.\nThe learned judge said:\nWhether or not there is invention in Gaisman may first be considered. During the course of the trial I formed the opinion that the patent lacked subject matter but upon a more careful consideration of the case, I have reached another conclusion. I think there is subject matter and that the patent should be sustained. The patented improvement, and it is only an improvement, is, I think, novel; it cannot be said that the blade and blade holder combined in the manner described in the specification does not possess utility; there is no effective evidence of anticipation by prior publication. The general idea or principle of the alleged invention seems an ingenious one, and, I think, involved the exercise of the inventive mind. The means for holding the blade in position has advantages over the means formerly or presently employed in safety razors, for example, the well known Gillette safety razor, where the blade was pushed sidewise into a spring holder, and which, according to the evidence, was difficult at times to remove, and there was also the danger in so doing of the user cutting his hand. Frequently, it was stated in evidence, that safety razors of this type had to be returned to the manufacturer in order to have the blade removed. The plaintiff\u2019s blade is very easily inserted in and removed from the blade holder, and with safety, and in this one respect alone the combination is, I think, an improvement over other known methods of retaining a blade in a blade holder. The idea of employing a blade holder of the type described with projections in the upper plate of the holder to co-operate with apertures in the blade, for holding the blade in the required position, must have required some, if only a small amount, of ingenuity. It cannot be said to be a common idea, or a natural development of an old idea, or one which would readily occur to workers in this particular art. No one had previously suggested it. The invention may be slight, and the patent a narrow one, but that does not mean there is not subject matter for a patent. The invention of course produces no new result and, I think, is protected only in respect of the particular means set forth in the specification. The other feature of the invention, that is, the provision of apertures in the blade by perforating a word or symbol, such as a trade-mark, may possess very practical merits, but that, I think, is but an optional method of using the invention the substance of which lies in the employment of a particular blade holder, with projections in the holder to co-operate with corresponding apertures or openings in the blade.\nAnd later:\nThe apertures which the plaintiff has selected for the blade happen to spell its trade-mark, but the real importance of such apertures, so far as this case is concerned, is that the apertures\u2014not the trade-mark\u2014are definitely positioned to co-operate with the projections in the upper plate of the blade holder. It is the particular holder and the projections in the holder plate, and the apertures in the blade, designed to co-operate the one with the other, that constitutes the invention.\nIn our view, that was really conclusive of this case and, on these findings, having regard to the only issue between the parties, the action ought to have been dismissed.\nThe specification has two purposes. It must\ncorrectly and fully describe the invention and its operation or use as contemplated by the inventor (sec. 14, subs, (a)).\nAnd the reason for that is that the information it gives must be sufficient to enable persons skilled in the art to make use of the invention after the expiration of the patent privilege. Further, it must \u201cstate\u201d distinctly the\nthings or combinations which the applicant regards as new and in which he claims an exclusive property and privilege.\nAnd the object of that second requirement of the Act is to define the ambit of the monopoly and the exact extent of the exclusive rights granted in the patent.\nNow, if we turn our attention solely to the specific claims relied on by the respondents as defining the article alleged to have been infringed, and if we analyze them, we find that the new blade is declared to be possessed of two characteristics: (a) apertures or depressions \u201cso shaped and located that they will co-operate with different holders, such holders having sets of projections differing inter se but such that any one of such sets will prevent such razor blade from sliding or turning on the said holder\n(b) these apertures or depressions should be \u201cin the form of a designation to indicate the manufacture.\u201d\nLet us\u2014as we should\u2014examine the subject-matter of the invention so described, in the light of the evidence given at the trial by those having the technical skill and knowledge enabling them to understand the novelty or the utility of the new manufacture (French\u2019s Complex Ore Reduction Co. V. Electrolytic Zinc Process Co.[3]), always bearing in mind that claims Nos. 1 and 2 alone are to be taken into consideration.\nAs understood by the experts heard at the trial, these claims disclose the following:\n(1) \u201cthe idea of prominently, indelibly and conspicuously indicating the origin of the manufacture of the blade\u201d;\n(2) \u201cthe combination of apertures which serve to locate the blade\u201d and of other apertures \u201cwhich have no other function\u201d but to \u201cindicate the origin\u201d or, in other words, \u201cperforations indicating origin and locating means\u201d;\n(3) \u201cperforations which extend longitudinally across the blade so as to form a resilient section having anything to do with the cutting edge\u201d;\n(4) \u201capertures adapted to take more than one fixed design of lugs.\u201d\nOf these alleged characteristics, the one having reference to longitudinal perforations and resulting resiliency must be eliminated at once. Admitting for argument\u2019s sake that the perforations so made might \u201cbring about a degree of elasticity in the blade which would enable it to assume a curved position\u201d and that the blade would be improved if, instead of being solid, the \u201cperforations make it more elastic and give it the desired curve,\u201d the trouble is that the patentee made absolutely no claim for elasticity or flexibility.\nThe claim, in a specification, being primarily designed for delimitation, the monopoly is confined to what the patentee has claimed as his invention. (Fletcher-Moulton L.J., in British United Shoe Machinery Co, Ltd v. A. Fussel & Sons, Ltd,[4]; Lindley M.R., in Pneumatic Tyre Co, Ltd. v. Tubeless Pneumatic Tyre and Capon Heaton, Ltd., et al.[5].) We must envisage the invention as claimed in the patent, not the invention which the patentee might have claimed if, in the words of Romer, J., \u201che had been well advised or bolder.\u201d (Nobel\u2019s Explosives Co, v. Anderson[6].) For that reason, the point about resiliency or elasticity is irrelevant. Further, it should be noted that it was not retained by the trial judge.\nThe next characteristic claimed for the blade in the shape of novelty is the combination of perforations indicating origin and locating means or\u2014which is the same thing\u2014of apertures adapted to take more than one fixed design of lugs and of others having no function other than to indicate the origin.\nLeaving aside, for the moment, the object of indicating the origin (as to which something more will be said later), we are of opinion that the characteristic just mentioned is not invention, at least in the legal sense, even if, as a matter of fact, it may be asserted that there was novelty in the conception of the idea.\nIn that connection, the Story patent, dating back to the 5th of December, 1911, would have to be considered as a possible anticipation. Under that patent, the blade is provided with a polygonal orifice, preferably cruciform, strongly suggestive of a possible form of designation or trade-mark, co-operating with a projection in the holder; and, as in the impugned patent, certain parts of the orifice or aperture in the blade are alternatively functioning and functionless.\nAssuming novelty, the apertures in the respondent\u2019s blade, so it is contended, are so shaped as to permit the projections on the holder to be varied or shifted from time to time and still anchor the blade to it. What obtained before, it is said, was a blade with two holes which could fit only with one kind of holders; the improvement consists in the fact that the new blade fits with several holders. But it is sufficient to resort to the evidence to discover the fallacy of that contention. What the patentee really intended and what he wished to have patented was not a razor blade which could fit with several holders produced by different manufacturers, but a razor blade so perforated that it could fit only with his own holder on which he retained the faculty of shifting the projections from time to time. If that be so, at least two consequences follow: (a) the blade the patentee has claimed can be used only in cooperation with the holder he has described and, in that case, the subject-matter is a combination of which the blade is only an element; (b) the blade was devised exclusively for the protection of the manufacturer of the holder, and therefore it has no utility within the meaning of the patent law and there was no invention in the patentable sense. A patent granted for an invention of that kind lacks consideration, for the so-called invention is of no use to the public. Once it is designed merely for the protection of the particular manufacturer, the subject-matter, is transferred from the field of patent law to that of the Trade-Mark and Design Act.\nThat brings us to examining the remaining characteristic claimed by the patentee and emphasized by the experts: the idea of prominently, indelibly and conspicuously indicating the origin of the manufacture of the blade or, as expressed in the claim itself, \u201ca designation to indicate the manufacture of the blade.\u201d\nDuring the course of the trial, it was suggested that the invention consisted in letters\u2014\u201can aggregation of letters * * * with something added to them.\u201d In fact, the drawings sent in with the application and annexed to the patent contain only the letters DEFGH. That would hardly meet the requirements of definiteness imperatively prescribed in the Patent Act. The inventor must describe in language free from ambiguity the nature of his invention and he must define the precise and exact extent of the exclusive property and privilege which he claims (French\u2019s Complex Ore Reduction Co. v. Electrolytic Zinc Process Co.[7].) It does not seem probable that the patentee intended to claim the exclusive right of perforating any and all forms of holes in a razor blade. If he did, the claim would be too wide and the specification in that respect would be void. Giving it a benevolent interpretation, we will accept one of the experts\u2019 suggestion that, \u201cin order to satisfy the idea of the patent, (the perforations) must be in the form of a trade designation.\u201d Claim No. 1 refers to \u201capertures in the form of a designation.\u201d The description in the specification further indicates the \u201cdesignation\u201d as being \u201csuch as a Trade-Mark, name or symbol,\u201d and states that it \u201cmay be formed by apertures or depressions in any desired member to indicate the manufacture of the (blade).\u201d In that sense, the claim enters the domain of trade-mark and is inspired by nothing more than the idea of protection for the manufacturer of the razor. Making apertures to indicate the manufacture of an article is plain common trade-marking. It comes to this that, to have any value at all, the apertures must impress the one particular trade-mark on the razor blade. In the respondent\u2019s case, it is the word \u201cValet.\u201d\nWhat the patentee claims is really an obvious method of impressing a trade-mark on the razor blade. It does seem practical and useful, but, as was said by Lord Watson in Morgan & Co. v. Windover & Co.[8], utility alone, however great it may be, cannot by itself and in the absence of invention support a grant of letters patent. And we are unable to accede to the proposition that a man may patent the idea of impressing his trade-mark in a razor blade by means of apertures in the blade, without more, and thus prevent another man from impressing his trade-mark in a similar way in the blades manufactured by him. We would repeat with the trial judge:\nThe other feature of the invention, that is, the provision of apertures in the blade by perforating a word or symbol, such as a trade-mark, may possess very practical merits, but that, I think, is but an optional method of using the invention the substance of which lies in the employment of a particular blade holder, with projections in the holder to co-operate with corresponding apertures or openings in the blade.\nAs we have pointed out, the latter part of the above holding applies to the combination of holder and blade protected by the claims of the patent which were not in issue between the parties in this case. As for claims Nos. 1 and 2, they do not present characteristics of such a nature as may be made the subject of a patent privilege, and they should be declared invalid and void.\nIt thus becomes unnecessary to consider the complaint about infringement. The appeal should be allowed and the action should be dismissed, with costs both here and in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Smart & Biggar.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Henderson, Herridge & Gowling.\n[1] [1932] Ex.

A. Macdonald J.[2] .\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the judgment now reported.\nGeo. F. Henderson K.C. and D. K. MacTavish for the appellants.\nAlfred Bull K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSMITH J.\u2014On the 25th day of September, 1925, the appellant, G. E. Duke, entered into a contract with Josephine Promis, Augusta Col, Sophia, Sophia Promis, Mary Gillespie and Oscar Promis for the purchase of certain real estate in the city of Victoria, in the province of British Columbia.\nThe contract reads:\nWe the undersigned (naming the above vendors) have this day granted, transferred, sold and conveyed to G. E. Duke the following described real property situated in Victoria city, B.C., Dominion of Canada.\nThen follows the particular description, the price, $55,000 payable $10,000 cash and a note for $45,000 to be secured by a mortgage on certain property in the city of Berkeley, in California,\nthe said mortgage to be subject to an existing encumbrance now of record in the sum of $22,150 as a first lien on the property.\nThere is then the following provision:\nUpon evidence of good merchantable title being vested in G. E. Duke, he will immediately cause to be paid in to the Alameda County Title Insurance Company the sum of ten thousand ($10,000) dollars U.S. lawful money, together with note and mortgage to be delivered to the vendors.\nAll the parties to the contract were, at the time, residents of California, and the survivors and executors of the two vendors, who died shortly after the date of the contract, have continued to be residents of that state.\nThis contract or another conveyance was placed in the hands of the Alameda County Title Insurance Company, it is claimed in escrow, which company handed over the contract or the other conveyance to the defendant George E. Duke, who registered same and thus became the registered owner of the Victoria property, which he conveyed to his wife, the defendant Margaret E. Duke, who mortgaged it for $30,000.\nThe vendors brought action in the Superior Court of the state of California in and for the county of Alameda, against the defendants, to rescind and cancel the contract and the mortgage, and to require the defendants to re-convey to the plaintiffs the Victoria property, alleging that George E. Duke obtained possession of the conveyance without the knowledge of the plaintiffs and without complying with the terms of the agreement, and in violation of the escrow agreement, \" in this,\" that he delivered the mortgage stipulated for subject to an encumbrance of $9,605 in addition to the encumbrance of $22,150 mentioned in the agreement.\nThe defence to the complaint about the $9,605 encumbrance, stated shortly, was that the vendors falsely represented to defendant G. E. Duke that the Victoria property was then producing net earnings of $6,775 per year, and that the then tenants were ready and anxious to obtain new leases on the same terms as the existing leases, whereas in fact the net earnings were not greater than $3,903 per year, and the then tenants were unwilling to renew their leases on the same terms, but were preparing to quit unless extensive repairs were made, and that, to retain them, repairs costing $11,525 had to be made, which sum defendant G. E. Duke claimed as damages for false representations inducing him to make the contract, and which he was entitled to set off against the $9,605 encumbrance.\nThe defence further alleged that the Alameda County Title Insurance Company was authorized by the plaintiff to cause the deed to be recorded, vesting the title to the Victoria property in defendant G. E. Duke before any part of the consideration therefor was to be paid or delivered by the defendant to the plaintiffs, \" all in conformity to said contract.\"\nI take it that this means that such is the proper construction to be put on the terms of the contract.\nThe learned trial judge in the California court found that defendant G. E. Duke agreed to deliver the $45,000 mortgage free and clear of the $9,605 encumbrance before taking title to the Victoria property, and that there were no false representations, and no set off, as alleged.\nHe also finds that the defendant G. E. Duke got possession of the deed without paying the $10,000, though there is no such claim in the plaintiff's pleadings, the only noncompliance with the terms of the agreement alleged being that referred to above.\nThe judgment entered in the Superior Court of California, omitting the style of cause, is as follows :\nThe Court having made and filed its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law herein, now, therefore, in accordance therewith,\nIt is ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the defendants, G.

ALLEN,\nJudge.\nThe defendants refused to execute a conveyance, as ordered by this judgment, and a conveyance was executed in their name by George E. Gross, County Clerk and Commissioner of the Superior Court, pursuant to the terms of the judgment.\nThe plaintiffs then brought the present action in the Supreme Court of British Columbia for a declaration that, by virtue of the conveyance referred to, or, alternatively, by virtue of the conveyance and of the judgment referred to, and in the further alternative by virtue of the judgment alone, the plaintiffs are the owners of and entitled to be registered as owners in fee simple of the Victoria property in question, subject to the mortgage of $30,000 and interest, mentioned above. There is the further claim that the court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction to implement the judgment of the Superior Court of the State of California, do vest the property in the plaintiffs.\nJudgment was given, declaring that, by virtue of the judgment of the Superior Court of California and of the conveyance made in pursuance of it, the plaintiffs are the owners of the property in Victoria subject to the $30,000 mortgage and a certain registered lease, and that the property vest in the plaintiffs, subject to these charges.\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, by a majority of three to one, varied this judgment by striking out the first adjudicating paragraph and substituting a paragraph in different language, vesting the property in the plaintiffs.\nMr. Justice McPhillips, dissenting, would have allowed the appeal and dismissed the action.\nFrom this judgment of the majority, the present appeal is taken.\nThe question involved is whether or not the judgment of the foreign court on the question of title and ownership of this real property situate in British Columbia is to be recognized as final and to be enforced by the courts of British Columbia.\nThe general rule that the courts of any country have no jurisdiction to adjudicate on the right and title to lands not situate in such country is not disputed.\nConsidering the operation of foreign law in regard to real and immovable property, Story's Conflict of Laws (8th ed.), p. 591, says:\nAnd here the general principle of the common law is, that the laws of the place where such property is situate, exclusively govern, in respect to the rights of the parties, the modes of transfer, and the solemnities which should accompany them. The title therefore to real property can be acquired, passed and lost only according to the lex rei sitae. This is generally, although (as we shall see) not universally, admitted by courts and jurists, foreign as well as domestic.\nThen, at page 757, paragraph 543, dealing with the jurisdiction of a nation over a person in its domain, there is the following:\nA suit cannot, for instance, be maintained against him, so as absolutely to bind his property situate elsewhere, and, a fortiori, not so as absolutely to bind his rights and titles to immovable property situate elsewhere. Dicey's Conflict of Laws (4th ed.), p. 393, citing Story and Piggott (3rd ed.), has the following :\nThe courts of a foreign country have no jurisdiction\u2014(1) to adjudicate upon the title, or the right to the possession, of any immovable not situate in such country; or (2) (semble) to give any redress for any injury in respect of any immovable not situate in such country.\nThe undoubted rule, in short, is that, if a court pronounce a judgment affecting land out of the jurisdiction, the courts of the country where it is situated\u2014and, it is presumed, also the courts of any other country\u2014are justified in refusing to be bound by it, or to recognize it; and this even if the judgment proceed on the lex loci rei sitae.\nThis rule is merely an application of a more general principle that no court ought to give a judgment the enforcement whereof lies beyond the court's power, and especially if it would bring the court into conflict with the admitted authority of a foreign sovereign, or what is the same thing, the jurisdiction of a foreign court.\nThere is, however, a long line of cases in which it has been held that English courts will enforce rights affecting real estate in foreign countries if such rights are based on contract, fraud or trust, and the defendant resides in England.\nAn early case of this kind is Penn. v. Lord Baltimore[3], where an agreement in reference to lands in Pennsylvania made in England was sought to be enforced, the residence of the parties being in England. It was held that there was jurisdiction. The Lord Chancellor says, p. 447:\nThe conscience of the party was bound by this agreement, and, being within the jurisdiction of this Court, which acts in personam, the court may properly decree it as an agreement, if a foundation for it.\nSee also Deschamps v. Miller[4].\nIn numerous decisions, however, besides Penn. v. Lord Baltimore[5] , it has been pointed out that, in exercising jurisdiction in such cases, the courts act in personam.\nIn the case of Lord Cranstown v. Johnston[6] , defendant, being a creditor of the plaintiff, obtained judgment in the Island of St. Christopher, and at the sale under the execution, of which the plaintiff had no notice, purchased the plaintiff's interest in lands of plaintiff there at much less than the value. Both parties residing in England, it was held there was jurisdiction, and the defendant was ordered to reconvey on payment of the amount owing.\nIn Norton v. Florence[7] , Jessels, M.R., states that the decision in Lord Cranstown v. Johnston[8] must be understood as limited to jurisdiction in personam. In Paget v. Ede[9], it was held than an equity of redemption is not an estate but merely a right, and that a decree of foreclosure, being a decree in personam, could be made in England as the mortgagor and mortgagee resided in England, though the lands were not in England.\nIn Re Pollard, Ex. P. In re Thomas Courtney and George Courtney[10] , there is the following passage in the judgment :\nIt is true that in this country contracts for sale or (whether expressed or implied) for charging lands, are in certain cases made by the courts of equity to operate in rem; but in contracts respecting lands in countries not within the jurisdiction of these courts, they can only be enforced by proceedings in personam, which courts of equity are constantly in the habit of doing, not thereby in any respect interfering with the lex loci rei sitae.\nIn Angus v. Angus[11] :\nTo a bill brought for possession of lands in Scotland and for discovery of the rents and profits and of deeds and fraud in obtaining them, it was pleaded that the matter was out of the jurisdiction.\nThe Lord Chancellor says:\n\" This court acts upon the person as to the fraud and discovery, therefore the plea must be over-ruled. To have made this a good plea, there ought to have been a further averment, that the defendant was resident in Scotland. This had been a good bill as to fraud and discovery if the land had been in France, if the persons were resident here, for the jurisdiction of the court as to fraud is upon the conscience of the party.\n\" I am in doubt as to parts of the bill for relief; for I cannot give the plaintiff possession any other way than by compulsion on the defendant's person whilst it is within the jurisdiction of the court.\"\nIn British South Africa Company v. Companhia de Mo\u00e7ambique[12] , it was held by the Queen's Bench Division that the courts in England had no jurisdiction to entertain an action for a declaration of title to lands in South Africa; and by the House of Lords, no jurisdiction to entertain an action for damages in such lands. Lord Herschell, p. 624, says:\nNo nation can execute its judgments, whether against persons or movables or real property in the country of another. On the other hand, if the courts of a country were to claim, as against a person resident there, jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the title to land in a foreign country, and to enforce its adjudication in personam, it is by no means certain that any rule of international law would be violated ***.\nAnd, at p. 626:\nWhilst courts of equity have never claimed to act directly upon land situate abroad, they have purported to act upon the conscience of persons living here. Lord Halsbury, at p. 631, says :\nThere is a concurrence of opinion of most jurists, if not all, as to the difference between what we call realty and personalty, by whatever words those things are distinguished in the jurisprudence of foreign countries, which affects very materially the right to try. Vattel distinguishes the questions which may properly be tried when defendant has his settled place of abode, but always subject to this, that, if the matter relates to an estate in land or to a right annexed to such an estate (quoting Vattel) \" in such a case, inasmuch as property of the kind is to be held according to the laws of the country where it is situated, and as the right of granting it is vested in the ruler of the country, controversies relating to such property can only be decided in the state in which it depends.\"\nIn Henderson v. Bank of Hamilton[13] , in this court it is pointed out that courts of equity held that where personal equities existed between parties over whom they had jurisdiction, though such equities might have reference to lands situate without the jurisdiction, they would give relief by a decree operating not directly upon the lands, but strictly in personam, and that such decrees would have been unenforceable in the foreign jurisdiction, and might have brought the courts decreeing them into collision with the former, within whose local jurisdiction the lands were situated. British South Africa Co. v. Companhia de Mo\u00e7ambique, just referred to[14], is cited and relied on.\nThe title to real property therefore must be determined by the standard of the laws relating to it of the country where it is situated. The grounds upon which, and the circumstances under which a conveyance would be set aside under the law of California may differ from those under which it would be set aside under the law of British Columbia. The conveyance from appellant G. E. Duke to his wife, the appellant Margaret E. Duke, could only be set aside in British Columbia by virtue of the statute law of that province, and the courts of one country are not presumed to know the laws of another country.\nIn Norris v. Chambres[15] , a claim was made for a lien on real property in Prussia. After stating a certain manner in which a lien on land may be acquired in England, the decision proceeds:\nAssuming this to be so, this is purely a lex loci which attaches to persons resident in England and dealing in land in England. If this be not the law of Prussia, I cannot make it so, because two out of three parties dealing with the estate are Englishmen, and I have no evidence before me that this is the Prussian law on this subject, and, if it be so, the Prussian courts of justice are the proper tribunals to enforce these rights. An adjudication as to title to the lands in question, to have any effect in British Columbia, must be an adjudication on the basis of British Columbia law relating to real property applied to the facts.\nThe objection to accepting the judgment of a foreign court as conclusive on a question of title to land is shewn by what is laid down by Lord Cottingham, L.C., in Ex Parte Pollard, cited above[16] , in the following language:\nIf, indeed, the law of the country where the land is situate, should not permit or not enable the defendant to do what the court might otherwise think it right to decree, it would be useless and unjust to direct him to do the act, but where there is no such impediment, the courts of this country, in the exercise of their jurisdiction over contracts made here, or in administering equities between parties residing here, act upon their own rules, and are not influenced by any consideration of what the effects of such contract might be in the country where the lands are situate, or of the manner in which the courts of such countries might deal with such equities.\nThe courts of California therefore must be assumed to have based their judgments on California law, without being influenced by any consideration of the effect on the title, of the contract and of equities arising from it and what followed, according to the law of British Columbia, and without any regard to the statute law of British Columbia bearing on the conveyance from George E. Duke to his wife.\nIt may be that on the facts as found, the courts of British Columbia, in applying the laws of British Columbia, would reach the same conclusion as the California courts, but it is to be remembered that findings of fact may in some cases be based on the particular law to be applied to them. For instance, a finding of fraud depends on what constitutes fraud under the particular law to be applied.\nIn any event, we must deal with the question as a general proposition, and not merely from the point of view of the facts in this particular case.\nThe question at issue here has come before the Supreme Court of the United States in a number of cases, but it is to be noted that there is a special clause in the constitution of the United States dealing with the credit to be given by the courts of one state to the judgments of the courts of another. It appears, however, that this clause does not make judgments of the courts of one state dealing with lands in another binding on the courts of the latter. In Carpenter v. Strange[17], the Court of New York State, where the parties resided, decreed that a conveyance of land in Tennessee alleged to be fraudulent was absolutely null and void. The courts of Tennessee refused to recognize this part of the judgment, and were upheld by the Supreme Court. The following is a passage from the judgment:\nThe courts of Tennessee were not obliged to surrender jurisdiction to the courts of New York over real estate in Tennessee, exclusively subject to its laws and the jurisdiction of its courts (p. 106).\nAgain, in Fall v. Eastin[18], in the judgment of the same court there is the following passage:\nA court of chancery, acting in personam, may well decree the conveyance of land in any other state and may well enforce its decree by process against the defendant. But neither the decree itself nor any conveyance under it, except by the person in whom the title is vested, can operate beyond the jurisdiction of the court (p. 9).\nRespondents put much reliance on the case of Houlditch v. Donnegal[19]. Upon a bill in chancery in England by creditors a decree was made to execute the trusts of a deed by which lands in Ireland were vested in trustees for payment of debts. A receiver was appointed and an injunction granted, and a bill was filed in the Court of Chancery in Ireland to carry the former decree into execution. The Irish court held that it had no jurisdiction. It was held, reversing this judgment, that there was jurisdiction. The basis of this decision was that a foreign judgment is only prima facie evidence, and the propriety of the English decree might be enquired into in the Irish court.\nThis doctrine, that a foreign judgment is only prima facie evidence, is now considered erroneous. Dicey's Conflict of Laws, 4th ed., 449, and cases there cited.\nMr. Justice Martin places reliance on the cases of Law v. Hansen[20] ; Nouvion v. Freeman[21] , and, in the House of Lords[22] ; and a number of others of similar import.\nThe remarks that he quotes from these decisions are the enunciation of the general rule that the judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction having the force of res judicata in the foreign country has the like force in England. The question here is whether or not the judgment of the foreign court in question, adjudicating on the right and title to real property in British Columbia, is one of the exceptions to this general rule.\nThe numerous decisions referred to above seem to establish beyond question that such a judgment is in personam only, and affects the conscience of the parties within the jurisdiction of the court, and stands on an entirely different footing in the courts of the country where the land is situated from the ordinary judgment coming within the general rule, such as a foreign judgment for debt.\nIn the present case the plaintiffs sue in British Columbia to enforce a judgment of the California courts deciding that the plaintiffs are the owners of the British Columbia land in question, rather than the defendants, one of whom is the registered owner. In California, it must be conceded that that judgment has effect only in personam, but if the courts of British Columbia were obliged to enforce it between the same parties, without question, there would be no practical difference, in effect, between such a judgment and a judgment for a debt, and the distinction so much insisted on in the authorities referred to would be of no real consequence.\nIn my opinion the rule stated by Dicey quoted above, that the courts of a foreign country have no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the title or the right to the possession of any immovable not situate in such country, and the statement in the authorities referred to, that controversies in reference to land can only be decided in the state in which it depends, and that judgments of foreign courts purporting to deal with the title and with rights to lands in another country can only be enforced by proceedings in personam, shew that the judgment of the court of California here in question does not, in British Columbia, affect the title to the lands in question, and is not a judgment that should be enforced by the courts of British Columbia as binding there on the parties.\nThe appeal should be allowed, and the action dismissed, with costs to defendants throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Crease & Crease.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Walsh, Bull, Housser, Tupper & Molson.\n[1] (1931) 45 B.C.

Highways Act, section 19.\nOn a foggy night, at about seven o'clock, the appellant's minor son in a roadster (about 5 feet, 10 inches wide), and the respondent's employee (the other respondent) in an auto truck with an overhanging rack (about 7 feet wide), approached a small bridge or culvert on a highway from opposite directions. The bridge was twelve feet long having 4 x 4 rails on each side, four feet high and its width between the railings on each side was seventeen feet, the floor or travelled part consisting of 3-inch planking and being 141\/2 feet wide. The respondent's truck reached the bridge first and when somewhere on the bridge the overhanging rack scraped the left side of the appellant's car; and, as the appellant's son while driving allowed his left elbow to protrude slightly from the open window to his left, the rack also struck his arm, which was severely injured. The trial judge found that the respondent's truck in crossing the bridge was as near the right railing as he could safely go, but that the real cause of the accident was the overhanging rack, of which the appellant's son had no knowledge, owing to fog and darkness. He found both drivers at fault, awarding 1\/4 of the fault to the appellant's son and 1\/4 to the respondent's employee. The majority of the Court of Appeal reversed this judgment on the ground that on the facts it was impossible to find negligence on the part of the respondents.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal (45 B.C.R. 234), Rinfret and Lamont JJ. dissenting, that the judgment of the trial judge should be restored. The respondents owed a special duty, under the circumstances of the case fully stated in the judgment, on a foggy night, to the appellant's son on account of the wide vehicle under his control and he should have used special care in approaching the narrow bridge.\nPer Rinfret and Lamont JJ. dissenting. According to the finding of the trial judge, the respondent's employee was, at all times material to the action, \" to the right from the centre of the travelled portion of the highway,\" as provided by section 19 of B.C. Highways Act; and the only way the collision could have happened was by the appellant's son driving over to respondent's side of the centre line. Therefore respondents cannot be held to have been in any way responsible for the collision.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, McDonald J., and dismissing the appellants' action for injuries sustained owing to the alleged negligence of the respondent's employee (also respondent) while driving a motor-vehicle.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nR. L. Maitland K.C. and E. F. Newcombe K.C. for the appellant.\nW. B. Farris K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court, Smith, Cannon and Crocket JJ., was delivered by\nCANNON J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia setting aside (Martin and McPhillips JJ.A. dissenting) a judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice J. A. McDonald whereby the plaintiff St. George P. Baldwin was awarded $1,086.34 for special damages, and the plaintiff Gordon St. George Baldwin $2,250 general damages for injuries sustained in an automobile accident. The amount of special damages would not be sufficient to give jurisdiction to this Court; but the Court of Appeal for British Columbia gave leave to St. George P. Baldwin to appeal to this Court.\nThe appellant St. George P. Baldwin sued on his own behalf and as next friend to his son Gordon St. George Baldwin.\nThe respondent Hay is a truck driver employed by John W. Bell; and, on the occasion in question, was driving on the latter's business. The accident occurred about seven o'clock p.m., on November 4, 1930, on a road near Kelowna, known as the Okanagan Mission Road, at or near a small bridge or culvert having 4 x 4 rails on each side, four feet high, and a total width between the rails of seventeen feet. The floor or travelled part consists of 3-inch planking and is 14 1\/2 feet wide. The respondent Hay admits that he used only this portion of the bridge and that it would not be possible to travel between the running part and the rail. There is no appreciable turn in from the side of the road to the bridge; and the side of the road, to use an expression of the witness Thomas G. Norris, \"sort of melts into the bridge.\"\nThe respondent Hay was driving, in a northerly direction, a truck with a rack seven feet wide (for holding wood) on the chassis of the said truck which rack extended out at both sides. Gordon St. George Baldwin was driving in the opposite direction a Chevrolet closed car 5' 10\" wide over all. The cars met at this small bridge; but neither could distinguish the nature of the car the other was driving. Hay naturally knew that he had this overhanging rack; and he says that he was aware of the fact that plaintiff could not know that he had such an overhanging rack. It is common ground that, at the time, one could only see the lights of an approaching car and that the visibility was poor.\nThe appellant approached the bridge at about fifteen miles per hour. He observed the light of the respondent's truck; but could not tell the nature of the vehicle, nor that it had an overhanging rack. He swears that he was drivslowly and on the right hand side of the road.\nThe respondent Hay approached the bridge at twenty-five miles per hour. He swears that he slowed a little to see if he had time to cross and then speeded up from twenty to twenty-five miles per hour. He says that he proceeded to cross the bridge on the right hand side and that, as he was leaving the end of the bridge, the other car came across the road; that he swerved on to the grass and, as he was leaving the road, the two cars met and slid along. He had no light on the overhanging part of the truck.\nThe drivers disagree as to the exact locus of the accident.\nThe appellant says it happened on the bridge; and glass was found by some of his witnesses and a piece of bone on the truck. One found part of the handle of the car on the bridge.\nThe respondent admits that he crossed two preceding bridges that night in the centre and that he anticipated that this particular bridge was clear and did not expect to meet the other car on the bridge.\nThe appellant driver was resting his elbow on the ledge of the window of his car; and as the cars passed each other, the overhanging rack cut off the appellant's elbow and also the door handle of the Chevrolet. Young Baldwin's arm was very seriously injured and he will suffer a permanent disability.\nThe respondent Hay knew and admitted in his evidence that the other driver did not know that he was driving with an overhanging rack.\nMr. Norris, a barrister, met the respondent shortly before the accident. He says he did not know he had a rack until he got right on to the vehicle and had to swing right over to his right to avoid the overhanging rack hitting him. Hay was then driving on the centre of the road and did not alter his course at all. Norris had to swing his car to prevent the overhanging rack hitting him.\nThe respondent Hay states that he did turn out to his own side of the road when he met Norris.\nThe trial judge made no finding as to the exact spot where the accident happened; but he finds that the real cause of the accident was the overhanging rack, which took more space than would an ordinary car; that the respondent Hay knew that and that the appellant did not; that all that could be seen by the two drivers were two headlights and this is the case whether the accident took place actually on the bridge or a few feet off the bridge; and, although, in his opinion, the respondent had the right to drive a truck upon the road with an overhanging rack and the plaintiff should have anticipated this possibility, the trial judge found both drivers at fault; but, inasmuch as the defendan Hay had a certain knowledge which the plaintiff's driver did not possess, to the latter was imputed one-fourth and to Hay three-fourths of the fault. The trial judge found indications that, at the time of the collision, the defendant's truck was being driven well over to the right side of the road. The majority of the Court of Appeal found that the respondent had not proven his case, while the two dissenting judges found that gross carelessness had been proven against Hay, although they did not feel that the assessment made by the trial judge should be disturbed.\nAfter a careful and somewhat anxious consideration of this case, we have reached the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed and the first judgment restored. We agree with the trial judge that the real cause of the accident was the overhanging rack which occupied more space than would an ordinary motor car. We also believe that, in the parallel position which the two cars occupied at the time of the accident, the plaintiff would have suffered no injury, had it not been for the overhanging of the rack on the respondent's truck.\nThe appellant drove his car in such a manner as to pass safely the vehicle coming in the opposite direction, if it had been of ordinary, and not of abnormal, width. The width available to travel on that bridge made it dangerous to negotiate, to the knowledge of Hay, for his truck covering 7 feet width, and an ordinary car, like the appellant's, which needed 5' 10\", leaving at most 3' 2\" actual leeway.\nIn Wintle v. Bristol Tramways and Carriage Co. Limited[2], the road was 16 feet wide, the plaintiff's lorry 6 feet 4 inches and the defendant's 6 feet 10 inches meeting at night. The court found that, even compliance with a statute under which one was bound to carry one light, would not lessen the common law liability and does not prevent one from being under the necessity of taking reasonable and proper care to indicate his position in the road to approaching vehicles; the care to be exercised must depend on the nature of the vehicle, the character of the highway and the general circumstances of the case.\nIn LeLi\u00e8vre v. Gould[3], Lord Esher, M.R., says:\u2014\nIf one man is near to another *** a duty lies upon him not to do that which may cause a personal injury to that other *** for instance, if a man is driving along a road, it is his duty not to do that which may injure another person whom he meets on the road, or to his horse, or his carriage. *** If a man is driving on Salisbury Plain, and no other person is near to him, he is at liberty to drive as fast and as recklessly as he pleases. But if he sees another carriage coming near to him, immediately a duty arises not to drive in such a way as is likely to cause an injury to that other carriage. So, too, if a man is driving along a street, in a town, a similar duty not to drive carelessly arises out of contiguity or neighbourhood.\nWe therefore reach the conclusion that the defendant Hay owed a special duty, under the circumstances of the case, on a foggy night, to the appellant, on account of the wide vehicle under his control. He should have used special care in approaching this narrow bridge. He might have stopped; but he probably misjudged the distance of the approaching car and speeded up and took a chance of clearing the bridge before meeting the car. It was not taking the necessary care to proceed as he did and without having the windshield wiper working, under the weather conditions prevailing that night.\nThe circumstances which are to be considered for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was negligence are:\n1st. The nature of the physical object by which the accident was caused. A greater degree of care is required where the use of the object is, in the circumstances, attended with special danger.\n2nd. The place of the accident. Greater care was required approaching this bridge by the owner of the wider vehicle.\n3rd. The physical conditions prevailing at the time of the accident; the time of the day and the weather, which witness Baldwin describes as follows: \"At that time, it was very foggy. The fog was the worst I have known in the Okanagan at that place, the fog from town out,\" although he admits that they could see the lights.\n4th. The conduct of the persons.\nIn this case, in the ordinary course, the accident could not have happened if Hay, who had the management of the wider vehicle, had exercised proper care. The evidence shews that he was negligent in driving into a narrow bridge, in a dense fog, at a rate of speed immoderate under the conditions, which disabled him from avoiding an accident in the emergency; this seems to be what the trial judge had in his mind. Like the minority judges in the Court of Appeal, we do not feel that we should disturb his assessment of damages as between the parties.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and the judgment of the trial judge restored. The judgments of Rinfret and Lamont JJ. (dissenting) were delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014The collision which caused the injuries for which damages are sought to be recovered in this action took place between the automobile of the appellant, St. George P. Baldwin, driven by his seventeen year old son Gordon, and a truck belonging to the respondent Bell, driven by the respondent Hay. The accident occurred about 7 p.m. on the evening of November 4, 1930, on the Okanagan Mission Road, B.C., at or near a point where the road crosses, by a narrow bridge, the north branch of Saw Mill Creek. Gordon was driving south and Hay was driving north. It was a foggy night and the headlights of both vehicles were on. The bridge was only 12 feet 2 inches from north to south, and 17 feet from east to west. It was really only a culvert. There was a railing about 4 feet high on each side of the bridge. The evidence as to the point of collision is contradictory: Gordon Baldwin says it was right on the bridge, while Hay says it was about 15 feet to the north thereof. A friend of Gordon's, one Collett, who was riding in the back seat of the automobile, might have definitely fixed the place of the accident but, although he was in the court at the time of the trial, he was not called by either party. Wherever the accident took place, the truck, which was seven feet wide, came in contact with Gordon's left elbow, which was resting on the ledge of the window of the left front door, and crushed it causing serious and permanent injury. Each driver testified that at the moment of impact he was well over on his own side of the road, and each claimed the other had crossed the centre line and invaded his half of the road. Hay was driving about twenty-five miles per hour and Gordon about fifteen. Gordon did not know that the vehicle the headlights of which he saw coming towards him was a truck, or that it was wider than an ordinary automobile. Hay testified that crossing the bridge he was running as close as he reasonably could to the east side thereof, and that the side of his truck was only 4 or 5 inches from the railing. He said that when he was leaving the north end of the bridge the car approaching turned towards him and he, fearing a collision, swerved to the right and drove on to the grass, and that the car and his truck grazed each other as they passed. He looked back and saw the other car stop; he stopped too, and heard someone yelling, so he drove off the grass on to the road and backed up over the bridge to see what had happened. He found Gordon Baldwin was hurt but was being attended to, and that young Collett was cut. He drove Collett home and then returned to the scene of the accident with Collett's father. About two hours later he went over the scene with Mr. Lysans who had a flashlight and he shewed Lysans the tracks which he said were made by his wheels on the right hand side, and where, at 6 feet north of the bridge, they turned off onto the grass. They discovered glass about 15 feet north of the bridge where Hay says the accident took place. Next morning, in company with Mr. C. W. A. Baldwin, uncle of Gordon, he again visited the scene of the accident and shewed him the same tracks that he had pointed out the night before to Lysans. They also saw the pile of glass about 15 feet north of the bridge. Lysans corroborates Hay to this extent: that Hay shewed him the wheel tracks he claimed were his. Lysans testified that, with the aid of the flashlight and the light from the automobiles then gathered there, it was easy to follow the track and that at 6 feet north of the bridge he distinctly saw where the wheels went over onto the grass. He says they found a pile of glass 15 feet north of the bridge, and, in addition to the pile of glass, they found a piece of a nickle door handle 2 inches long like those used on an automobile. The appellants admit that the collision broke off the handle of the left front door of their automobile. Lysans also says that he saw the wheel tracks on the inside of the east rail of the bridge at a distance, he thought, of about 15 inches from the rail, and stated he did not think Hay could have driven any closer to the rail. Glass was also found on the bridge together with a piece of a nickle door handle. Whether it was the same part of the door handle which Lysans found north of the bridge the night of the accident the evidence does not shew. One of the witnesses, Thomas Apsey, testified that the glass on the bridge seemed to him \" to be scattered over the bridge.\" Counsel for the respondents contended that the finding of glass and part of the door handle 15 feet north of the bridge and the finding of glass on the bridge, would indicate that the collision took place north of the bridge; that the truck smashed the glass in the left rear door, which is established by the evidence, and that some part of the glass fell to the ground and some remained on the running board of the car and was shaken off on the bridge.\nThe learned trial judge found as follows:\u2014\nI am satisfied that the defendant's wheel marks were those which were afterwards seen by the defendant Hay and the witness Lysans. This would indicate that at the point of collision the defendant's truck was being driven well over to the right side of the road and in fact as far to the right as it could be driven if a collision between the right side of the truck-rack and the railing of the bridge was to be avoided. The real cause of the accident was I think that the defendant's rack overhung the truck and took more space than would an ordinary car. The defendant Hay knew this and the plaintiff did not know it.\nThis, in my opinion, is a finding that, whether the accident occurred on the bridge or on the road immediately to the north thereof, Hay was, at all times material to the action, east of the centre of the road. This finding is justified by the evidence and, in my opinion, must be accepted. From that finding it necessarily follows that the only way the collision could have happened was by Gordon Baldwin driving over to Hay's side of the centre line. If that is how the collision occurred, can Hay be held to have been in any way responsible for it? Both drivers had a right to be on the road with the vehicles they were driving. Both, however, were under a duty to take reasonable precautions to avoid a collision. In Hambrook v. Stokes Bros.[4], Atkin L.J. said:\u2014\nThe duty of the owner of a motor car in a highway is not a duty to refrain from inflicting a particular kind of injury upon those who are in the highway. If so, he would be an insurer. It is a duty to use reasonable care to avoid injuring those using the highway.\nThe precautions which both drivers were under a duty to take to avoid a collision are set out in the statute. Section 19 of the British Columbia Highways Act, provides:\u2014\n19. In case a person travelling or being upon a highway in charge of a vehicle drawn by one or more horses or other animals, or propelled by some other means, meets another vehicle drawn or propelled as aforesaid, he shall reasonably turn out to the right from the centre of the travelled portion of the highway, allowing to the vehicle so met one-half of the travelled portion of the highway. If this statutory provision had been observed by both drivers in the present case it is clear the accident would have been avoided.\nIf we accept the finding of the trial judge as to the position of the truck at the time of the accident, and, as I have already said, I think we must accept it, that finding means that Hay performed the duty resting upon him under the statute and that Gordon did not. That being so, I am unable to see how Hay could have been guilty of negligence causing the accident unless he became aware or had an intimation that Gordon was about to cross the centre of the travelled portion of the highway, and he (Hay) failed to avoid a collision being able to do so. Upon this point Hay was examined and he testified that it was not until the front of Gordon's car was on the centre of the road that he feared a collision, and that he immediately swerved to the east. He, therefore, had no intimation that Gordon was not going to comply with the statute until it was too late to get out of his way. Under the circumstances there was, in my opinion, no duty resting upon Hay to anticipate that Gordon would commit a breach of the statute. It is not suggested that after the danger become apparent Hay could, by any act of his, have avoided a collision. What is charged against him is that:\nthe overhanging rack of the appellant's truck occupied more space than would an ordinary motor car and that he knew this and Gordon Baldwin did not, and that he was driving too fast under the circumstances.\nNone of these circumstances, however, could have brought about the collision if Gordon had remained on his own side of the road. The truck was not an outlaw on the highway. It had a perfect right to be there so long as its overhanging rack did not prevent its driver from giving to a vehicle going in the opposite direction one-half of the travelled portion of the highway. The fact that Hay knew the width of the truck and that Gordon did not, cannot, in my opinion, be said to have caused or contributed to the accident for, as the trial judge pointed out, anyone driving at night and seeing the lights of an approaching car must anticipate that it may be a truck.\nIt was contended by counsel for the appellants that as the road was narrow, the night foggy and the respondent's truck wider than an ordinary automobile, there was a duty resting upon Hay to be extra careful not to injure anyone using the highway and that he should have had a light to mark the left side of his truck. It is established that the bridge was seventeen feet wide, and that the road leading up to the bridge had no ditch on the right hand side so that, if the accident occurred north of the bridge, as I think it did, the road was sufficiently wide for the cars to pass in safety and have a satisfactory margin to spare. There was some fog which made the windshield misty, unless the windshield wipers kept it clear. Only one of Gordon's wipers was working, which one the evidence does not disclose, but he drove with his head out of the window the better to see, until just before the accident when he withdrew it. Then, looking through the windshield he saw the railing of the bridge on the right hand side\u2014he thought it was at the southwest corner. If it was his right hand wiper which was working and through which he saw the railing, and the wiper directly in front of him was not working and the windshield covered with mist, it would account for his failure to see the truck after he drew in his head. Notwithstanding the evidence of some fog, Hay says he could see the railing of the bridge on his right hand side, and he was able to run his truck within a few inches of it. Furthermore a speed of twenty-five miles per hour does not seem to me excessive, so long as the light is such that a driver can see to keep his own side of the road.\nIn support of the argument that Hay should have had a light to mark the left hand side of the truck, the appellants cited the case of Wintle v. Bristol Tramways & Carriage Co., Limited[5]. In that case the plaintiff claimed damages from the defendants in respect of the alleged negligent driving by night of their petrol lorry or trolley, when the plaintiff's steam lorry was run into and damaged. The negligence alleged was that the defendants were burning only one light on their trolley when they should have had two. The defence was that the statute required only one light and that the defendants had complied with the statute. In his judgment, at page 242, McCardie J. says:\u2014\nUnder the Locomotives on Highways Act of 1896 and the regulations made thereunder the defendants were bound to carry one light on their trolley. In the absence of doing so they are exposed to certain penalties. That provision does not, in my opinion, lessen their common law liability, and compliance with the regulation does not prevent them from being under the necessity of taking reasonable and proper care to indicate their position in a roadway to pedestrians and approaching vehicles. In this case the defendants carried only one light. There was evidence before the deputy Judge that it was usual for lorries to carry two lights, and he no doubt thought that the defendants ought to have had two lights on their lorry.\nThis judgment was affirmed on appeal[6].\nIt will be observed that in that case there was evidence that it was usual for lorries to carry two lights and, as stated in 21 Halsbury, page 449, a person is entitled to rely upon the other party taking reasonable care and precautions, and, in places to which the public have access, is entitled to assume the existence of such protection as the public have, through custom, become justified in expecting. See also Smith v. South Eastern Rly. Co. [7].\nThe non-observance by an automobile driver of the precautions prescribed or duties imposed by the legislature is usually prima facie evidence of negligence and, if damage results from such non-observance, he will be liable therefor. It is, however, not disputed that the statutory enactment is not in every case to be taken as the measure of the duty of the individual. As in the Wintle case[8] a person may comply with the terms of the statute and yet find that he has omitted some other duty of care which involves him in liability. Precessly v. Burnett[9]. In such cases, however, the common law duty has been relied upon by the plaintiff because the statutory provision, if complied with, was not sufficient to prevent the accident and did not afford the plaintiff the measure of protection to which he was entitled. These cases, it seems to me, can have no application to the case at bar for here, if Gordon Baldwin had performed the statutory duty resting upon him the accident could not have happened. We were not referred to any case in which a plaintiff has successfully invoked the aid of a common law duty to take care, to excuse his failure to perform a statutory requirement which, if complied with, would have prevented the accident.\nAs, in my opinion, Hay was entitled to expect that Gordon would use reasonable care and take proper precautions in passing on the highway, and as, in particular, he was entitled to assume that he (Gordon), would observe the requirements of section 19 of the Highways Act, I am unable to reach any other conclusion than that Gordon Baldwin was the author of his own wrong.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Maitland and Maitland.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Farris, Farris, Stultz & Sloan.\n[1] (1932) 45 B.C.

If, at the time of the sale, the action against the third party by the vendor be pending before the courts, the purchaser has the right to substitute himself to the plaintiff vendor by way of intervention, and deal with the case as he thinks fit.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Surveyer J. and maintaining respondent\u2019s contestation of the intervention filed by the appellant company.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the judgment now reported.\nThomas Vien K.C. for the appellant.\nP. Bercovitch K.C. and J. J. Spector for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nCannon J.\u2014This appeal is asserted from the unanimous judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench for the province of Quebec, which set aside the judgment of the Superior Court in favour of the intervenant, which declared that respondent, on the 28th November, 1928, sold to Louis P. G\u00e9linas his whole undertaking as a going concern and further all his rights, title and interest whatsoever in all movable property forming part of its undertaking; that the said G\u00e9linas, on the 28th November, 1928, transferred his rights to J. E. Savard; that, on the 27th November, 1928, the said J. E. Savard had transferred all such rights to the appellant; that on the date on which the appellant acquired the rights and assets of the respondent, the present action was pending before the court; that appellant automatically acquired all the respondent\u2019s rights against the defendant in the present action.\nAs appears from the above, the whole question to be determined is whether or not the intervenant did, on or about November 28, 1928, acquire from plaintiff its claim against defendant and whether or not, as a consequence, it is authorized to substitute itself to plaintiff and deal with it ais it thinks fit.\nThe Provincial Transport Company purchased, not from respondent, but from J. Ernest Savard, under the following deed:\nWhereas the vendor has previous to this date entered into various contracts of sale in favour of the present vendor as purchaser whereby he has acquired as a going concern various organizations for the operation of autobus transportation and sightseeing service throughout the province of Quebec; and\nWhereas the company-purchaser was incorporated on the 22nd of November, 1928, for the purpose of carrying on the business of operating omnibusses, sightseeing busses, cabs, taxicabs and other vehicles, and of carrying on the business of running motor busses and motor trucks both on regular routes and for special trips, and of acquiring franchises or rights to operate the same, with an authorized capital divided into twenty thousand (20,000) shares having no nominal or par value and into twenty thousand (20,000) Six per cent (6%) non-cumulative preference shares of the par value of one hundred dollars ($100) each.\nNow, therefore, it is hereby agreed by and between the parties as follows:\u2014\n1. The vendor sells and the company-purchaser purchases all the vendor\u2019s rights, title, interest and good-will whatsoever in the various contracts of sale entered into by various individuals and companies carrying on the operation of autobus transportation and sightseeing services, in favour of the present vendor as purchaser, which said contracts, in each case, transfer to the present vendor the whole of the enterprise and undertaking of the respective vendors mentioned therein, the said contracts of sale being enumerated in the schedule annexed hereto, * * *\n2. The company-purchaser hereby acknowledges the receipt of the original contracts of sale set forth in the schedule mentioned above, which contracts have been delivered to it previous to this day.\nOne of the contracts enumerated in the schedule annexed to the memorandum of agreement was one with the company respondent therein acting and represented by its president and its treasurer, thereunto duly authorized by a resolution of the shareholders of the company adopted at a regularly constituted meeting held on the 24th day of November, 1928, of which a certified copy annexed to the contract reads as follows:\u2014\nIt was regularly moved, seconded, and unanimously carried, that an offer of sale made by J. Ernest Savard of the entire assets of the company for cash consideration of forty thousand dollars ($40,000) be and is hereby accepted, and that the president Mr. W. N. Karp, and the treasurer, R. Rutenberg, be hereby authorized on behalf of the company to sign any documents necessary for the completion of the sale.\nThese duly authorized officers of the respondent signed a contract which contains the following:\nWhereas the company-vendor is at present carrying on a system of sightseeing tours and the operation of sightseeing autobuses in the city of Montreal; and\nWhereas the said company-vendor is authorized by its charter to sell its enterprise, franchises and rights, in whole or in part, for such consideration as may be deemed advisable; and\nWhereas the purchaser is desirous of purchasing the whole of the undertaking of the company-vendor as a going concern,\nNow, therefore, it is hereby agreed by and between the parties as follows:\n1. The company-vendor conveys, sells, assigns and transfers to the purchaser, hereby accepting, the whole of its enterprise and undertaking as a going concern, including its good-will and clientele and, in particular, the company-vendor hereby sells, conveys, assigns and transfers to the purchaser all its rights, title and interest whatsoever in the following equipment, namely:\n\u201c(a) Three (3) autobuses, namely:\nAutobus\nNumber of\nPassengers\nSeries\nEngine\nYear\n1. Reo Sedan\n25 .. .. .. .. ..\nS.D. 679\nC18656\n1928\n1. Reo Sedan\n24 .. .. .. .. ..\n59587\n1926\n1. Reo Sedan\n24 .. .. .. .. ..\n94937\n1926\n\u201c(b) All the accessories and autobus parts actually possessed by it and all moveable property of any nature whatsoever composing and forming part of the undertaking presently carried on by the company-vendor;\n\u201c(c) Two (2) parking permits allowing it to park its cars at the corner of Metcalfe and St. Catherine streets, in the city of Montreal, and at the corner of Peel and Cypress streets, in the said city; 2. The company-vendor further undertakes to do all in its power to transfer and assign to the purchaser all licences, permits or franchises of any nature or kind whatsoever presently held by it in connection with the operation of its undertaking.\n3. The present sale is made for and in consideration of the sum of forty thousand dollars ($40,000), which has been paid cash this day, and the company-vendor hereby acknowledges having received the said sum from the purchaser and gives a full and final discharge therefor.\n4. The company-vendor declares that the only debts due by it do not exceed in amount the sum of six thousand dollars ($6,000), and the company-vendor undertakes to pay the said sum not later than the 15th of December, 1928, it being understood between the parties that the purchaser will not be held responsible for any debts incurred by the company-vendor prior to signing of the present agreement.\n5. The said company-vendor hereby undertakes and agrees to sign and execute all deeds, documents, matters and things which are convenient or necessary, or which counsel may advise for more completely and effectually carrying out the intention of these presents, and for vesting in the purchaser the property comprised in this agreement.\n6. The present sale shall take effect from the date hereof and the purchaser shall, from the signing of these presents, have possession of the whole of the enterprise and undertaking above mentioned.\nThe trial judge gives the following reasons for his finding in favour of the intervenant (present appellant):\nConsidering that what the resolution intends plaintiff to sell, and the purchaser intends to buy, is \u201cthe entire assets\u201d of the company plaintiff; that is that no sort of assets, whether corporeal or incorporeal, was excluded from the said sale (Words and phrases judicially defined, 10th series, Vo. Assets; 3rd series, Vo. Entire:).\nConsidering that the preamble of the contract entered into between the parties states that the purchaser is desirous of purchasing the undertaking of the company-vendor as a going concern;\nConsidering that by clause 1 of the said contract, \u201cThe company-vendor conveys, sells, assigns and transfers to the purchaser, hereby accepting, the whole of its enterprise and undertaking as a going concern, including its goodwill and clientele\u201d;\nConsidering that subsequently to the said agreement, the president of the plaintiff company, who was its principal representative, handed to the purchaser\u2019s assignee the charter and minute book of the plaintiff company; that the said charter and minute book were secured for the purpose of securing a surrender of plaintiff company\u2019s charter; that whatever may have been the outcome or legality of such negotiations, they show that the parties intended a complete transfer of plaintiff\u2019s assets of whatever nature, plaintiff, by the said contract, assuming its own liabilities;\nConsidering that rules of interpretation cannot be invoked to restrict the scope of a contract when the words used and the parties\u2019 behaviour show no intention to restrict it;\nIt might be added that, under its charter, the company-respondent was authorized to dispose, by lease, sale or otherwise, of the business, assets and undertaking of the company, or any part thereof. The Court of King\u2019s Bench, however, has reached the conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the General Motors Products of Canada, Ltd., was not included in the above sale, for the following reasons:\nConsidering that the appellant\u2019s claim for damages against General Motors as set forth in its action is not expressly mentioned in the said contract of sale nor is it included by implication among the rights and things or categories of rights and things specifically mentioned; in particular it is not part of the equipment set forth in paragraphs \u201ca\u201d and \u201cc\u201d of the clause hereinabove quoted, nor does it form part of the autobus accessories or parts referred to in paragraph \u201cb\u201d;\nConsidering that the said claim is for the return of moneys paid and for the loss of profits which the appellant pretends would have been earned for it by autobus contracted for, if it had been delivered by the defendant as stipulated, and if such profits had been earned they would have been distributed to the shareholders or held in reserve for dividend purposes and so would not have formed part of the enterprise and undertaking carried on by the appellant at the time of the sale to the respondent;\nConsidering that the said claim was not at the time of the sale established as being an asset of the appellant, and that whether it will eventually prove to be an asset or a liability is contingent upon whether the action will be successful or not, and so it could not be included in the moveable property of the appellant which composed or formed part of its undertaking at the time of the sale;\nConsidering, therefore, that the said claim or right of action was not transferred by the sale to the respondent and that its intervention in the said action is unfounded:\nIt seems to me that the wording of the resolution, the preamble of the contract, and the first clause of the contract, mentioning the whole of the enterprise and undertaking as a going concern and all moveable property of any nature whatsoever composing and forming part of the undertaking then carried on by the company respondent is clear and unambiguous, if one is to give the words their ordinary meaning. The Court of King\u2019s Bench limits the scope of the deed to the particulars: three autobuses, all their accessories and autobus parts then possessed by the respondent, together with the two parking permits.\nThis interpretation, to my mind, goes against the well known rule which is embodied in 1021 C.C.\nWhen the parties in order to avoid a doubt whether a particular case comes within the scope of a contract, have made special provision for such case, the general terms of the contract are not on this account restricted to the single case specified;\nand also against the other found in article 1018:\nAll the clauses of a contract are interpreted the one by the other, giving to each the meaning derived from the entire act. The application of these two articles, however, must be tempered by article 1020:\nHowever general the terms may be in which a contract is expressed, they extend only to the things concerning which it appears that the parties intended to contract.\nIt appears by the title deed of the intervenant company that it purchased Savard\u2019s right, title, interest and goodwill whatsoever in the contract signed by the respondent which, as represented to the appellant, was transferring to G\u00e9linas and Savard, the whole of the enterprise and undertaking of the respective vendors as a going concern. The contract entered into between the appellant and the General Motors Products of Canada, Ltd., which forms the object of the original action into which the appellant wishes to intervene, was transferred to the appellant as an accessory of and as forming part of the enterprise and undertaking of the respondent; and the claim made in respect of the said contract must, in our opinion, also form part of the rights and interests assigned and transferred to the appellant for the cash consideration of $40,000.\nMoreover, the contract with the General Motors Products, basis of the present action, is essentially connected with the business undertaking of the plaintiff, has not yet been resiliated and therefore is still in existence. Plaintiff\u2019s declaration sets forth their demand as follows:\nWherefore plaintiff prays that the contract entered into between the parties and herewith filed as plaintiffs exhibit P-1 be resiliated for all purposes of law and that the defendant be condemned to pay and satisfy unto the plaintiff the said sum of $5,960 damages, a further sum of $500 in cash paid to the defendant at the time that the said contract was entered into, the return of the Packard Twin Six motor car with two bodies, or the value thereof, to wit, $900, and a further sum of $1,300 the difference between the price he was to pay the defendant for the bus in question, and the price he is obliged to pay for a new bus of a similar kind, or a total in all of eight thousand six hundred and sixty dollars ($8,660), the whole with interest from date of service hereof, and all costs.\nIf the purchasers of the transportation business of the respondent deem it advisable to withdraw the demand for cancellation and damages, and will rather carry out this agreement, or substitute thereto another agreement with the General Motors Products of Canada, Ltd., it seems to me that the letter and the spirit of the sale, for which the respondent received $40,000 cash, would entitle the intervenant to their conclusions, and that the trial judge was right when he declared the intervenant to be, for the purposes of this suit, in all the rights of the plaintiff in the present action; that the transfer of rights from plaintiff to Gelinas and Savard and from the latter to the intervenant did include all the plaintiff respondent\u2019s right in the present action and allowed intervenant to follow up, in plaintiff\u2019s place and stead and to the exclusion of plaintiff, the last valid proceeding originally had in the suit.\nI would therefore maintain the appeal and restore the judgment of the Superior Court with costs against respondent in the Court of King\u2019s Bench and here.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Vall\u00e9e, Vien, Beaudry, Fortier & Mathieu.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bercovitch, Cohen & Spector.\n",

Bowsley (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nBritish Canadian Trust Company (Defendant) Respondent\n1932: October 11, 12; 1932: December 23.\nPresent:\u2014Rinfret, Lamont, Smith, Cannon and Crocket JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA\nContract\u2014Construction\u2014Claim, under agreement, to possession and control of theatre property\u2014Claimant suing his assignors' trustee in bankruptcy for damages for dispossession by trustee\u2014Nature, purpose and effect of the agreement, and extent of claimant's rights and security thereunder\u2014Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 11, ss. 64, 54\u2014\"Change of possession\" of chattels (Bills of Sale Act, Alta., 1929, c. 12, s. 2 (b)). Appellant, claiming that he was entitled to possession and control of theatre property under an agreement with B. & H., and that respondent, to whom B. & H. had made an assignment under the Bankruptcy Act, had wrongfully dispossessed him, sued respondent for damages.\nHeld (affirming, Crocket J. dissenting, the judgment of the Appellate Division, Alta., 26 Alta. L.R. 393): On construction of the agreement, appellant's personal interest in the equitable interest assigned by the agreement to him was, at most, to hold it as his security for the 5% of the gross receipts which he was to receive for his wages as man- ager. His contract for services as manager ended with the assignment in bankruptcy. He would have no right to retain possession of the property to enforce a contract for personal services (Stocker v. Brockelbank, 20 L.J. Ch. 401; Frith v. Frith, [1906] A.C. 254); his only remedy being an action for damages for breach of contract (Ogden v. Fossick, 4 DeG. F. & J. 426): (As to provision made in the agreement for the payment of a debt of B. & H. to one Hoar (who was not a party to the agreement or the action)\u2014it was very doubtful if that provision made the property in appellant's hands a security for that debt. Appellant, who was suing only for his own personal damages, could not rely on any rights of Hoar. Moreover, if the agreement and transfer was to secure Hoar's account, it was for that purpose fraudulent and void as against respondent). Appellant, after the assignment in bankruptcy, had no personal right to possession, either of the realty or chattels. Further, as to the chattels, there was not such a \"change of possession\" as denned by the Bills of Sale Act, Alta.; moreover, respondent was protected by the provisions of s. 54 of the Bankruptcy Act.\nPer Crocket J. (dissenting): The agreement was not essentially a contract for personal services. Its terms, as well as the whole evidence as to the acts and conduct of the parties under it, indicated rather that its main purpose was to vest in appellant all the title and interest of B. & H. in the property, and to transfer to him the actual possession and complete control thereof, in order that the business might be placed on a profitable basis in the interest and for the benefit of both parties. If appellant was in any sense an agent of B. & H. under the agreement, it was an agency created to secure some benefit to him beyond his mere remuneration as agent, and therefore an agency irrevocable until its purposes were fulfilled. B. & H. had no right to interfere with appellant's possession and control until completion of the payments on Hoar's account (for which appellant was personally liable) and the fulfillment in other respects of the agreement; (Frith v. Frith, supra, and Ogden v. Fossick, supra, distinguished); nor, unless the agreement was impeachable as a fraud upon creditors, had respondent any right so to interfere. (Ex parte Holthausen; In re Scheibler, L.R. 9 Ch. App. 722, at 726). The agreement was not impeachable under s. 64 of the Bankruptcy Act, as no intent to hinder, delay or defeat creditors or to give a preference could properly be imputed. S. 54 of said Act did not apply.'\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], dismissing his appeal from the judgment of Ewing J. dismissing his action for damages for dispossessing him of certain theatre property. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs, Crocket J. dissenting.\nJ. B. Barron for the appellant.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and M. B. Gordon for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ.) was delivered by\nSMITH J.\u2014James A. Booth and Cecil J. Hughes owned and were operating a motion picture theatre at Macleod, Alberta, under the firm name of Booth & Hughes.\nBusiness became bad, and they were running without making any profit, and were unable to pay their debts. They had purchased from the Canadian Orchestraphone Limited, of which the appellant was manager, a sound equipment called a Talkatone on a conditional sale agreement which had been assigned to and discounted with one C. M. Hoar, on which there was a balance unpaid of $970.\nUnder these circumstances they opened negotiations with the appellant, an electrical engineer engaged in the motion picture business at Calgary and having an interest in a circuit of some thirty theatres, giving him, as he claims, apart from his personal experience and ability, the advantage of a large buying power and facilities for the economical and effective operation of theatres. On October 24, 1931, the appellant visited Booth and Hughes at their request, when they arrived at an agreement which the appellant, on his return to Calgary, reduced to typewriting, dating it 25th October, 1931, and sent by letter, Exhibit 2, dated 25th October, 1931, to Booth and Hughes, requesting them to sign and return it, stating that on receipt of it he would sign and return to them their copy. This letter has the following paragraph:\nReferring to subsection 6 of paragraph 6 of the agreement and paragraph 7, you will retain the full amount, this letter being your authority, but in accordance with our conversation, do not let the film companies know of this.\nThe date on the agreement was altered to 4th November, 1931, and signed by Booth and Hughes and returned to Dowsley, who says he received it on the 2nd November. The following is the agreement, Exhibit 3:\nAGREEMENT\n\"J.A.B.\" \"E.J.H.\"\nTHIS AGREEMENT MADE this 4th day of November, 1931\nBetween:\nBOOTH & HUGHES theatre operators, of the Town of Macleod, in the Province of Alberta, of the Party of the First Part, hereinafter called\n\"BOOTH & HUGHES\"\nand\nC. L. DOWSLEY, of the City of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, the Party of the Second Part, hereinafter called,\n\"THE MANAGER.\"\nWHEREAS Booth & Hughes, operating the Empress Theatre in the Town of Macleod, in the Province of Alberta, are indebted to C. M. Hoar, of the City of Calgary, for certain amounts owing on talking picture equipment, which amount is now all in arrears, and whereas Booth & Hughes are unable to pay any of this money at the present time, and whereas Booth & Hughes are purchasing the said Empress Theatre under an Agreement of Sale, there being considerable balance still owing on said Agreement of Sale and to avoid being forced out of business by seizure Which might be forced by the said C. M. Hoar, with the consequent loss of all money invested to date in the Empress Theatre by Booth & Hughes, it is agreed as follows:\n1. Booth & Hughes hereby assign their complete equity in the said Empress Theatre Building and Equipment to C. L. Dowsley, Manager, Party of the Second Part.\n2. Date of possession of the said theatre by the manager shall date from November 4th, 1931, at which time the manager shall assume complete control.\n3. The manager shall not be responsible for any debts contracted by Booth & Hughes nor shall he assume any film contracts made by Booth & Hughes.\n4. Upon completion of payments on C. M. Hoar's account and fulfillment of all other terms of this agreement, but in no event under three years, the manager then agrees to make a new agreement with Booth & Hughes, returning to them their equity in the Empress Theatre as transferred to C. L. Dowsley, the manager, by this Agreement.\n5. Proceeds from sale of Amusement Tax tickets shall be deposited daily in separate account \"In Trust for Amusement Tax Return.\"\n6. Gross receipts from the operation of the theatre exclusive of amusement tax will be deposited daily in trust account to the credit of the Empress Theatre, and withdrawals from this account will be made as follows:\n1. In payment of film, express and advertising.\n2. In payment of electric service, water and heat.\n3. Payment of $50 per month to C. M. Hoar.\n4. Payment of 5% of gross receipts to the manager. 5. Payment of other expenses, such as taxes, interest, licences, payments on property and equipment and miscellaneous theatre expense.\n6. Balance divided equally between Booth & Hughes and the Manager.\n7. Booth & Hughes will give their services to the Empress Theatre for one year, without any additional charge other than amounts they may receive under subsection 6 of this agreement.\n8. This agreement has been made in consideration of the sum of One Dollar ($1.00) in hand paid, by each party hereto to the other party hereto, receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, and in consideration of the premises and covenants hereinbefore set forth.\n\"J. A. BOOTH\"\n\"E.J. BOOTH\"\nBOOTH & HUGHES.\nWitness:\n\"C. H. Cooney\"\n\"C. L. DOWSLEY\"\nC. L. DOWSLEY.\n\"F. D. Cook\"\n(As to signature of C. L. Dowsley).\nBefore signing and returning this agreement to Dowsley, Booth & Hughes, on 28th October, 1931, executed a transfer of the theatre property to one Augustus T. Leather, in which the consideration is stated to be $7,582, made up by the transferee, Leather, assuming two mortgages on which there was owing $4,576 and $2,080 respectively, and an amount of $926 for insurance, taxes and other charges assumed by the transferee.\nThey also made a bill of sale to Leather, bearing date the 31st day of October, 1931, of the equipment in the theatre, reciting that all of the lot, buildings and equipment had been sold as a going concern by Booth and Hughes to Leather for $8,882. These documents were duly registered.\nOn the 28th day of October, 1931, Leather made a lease to Booth and Hughes of the land, theatre and equipment for a term of one year and three days from the 28th day of October, 1931, at a yearly rental of $1,200.\nThe appellant was not informed of this sale to Leather and lease to Booth and Hughes, and therefore did not realize that the change of date in the agreement from 25th October, 1931, to 4th November, made the agreement subsequent to these transactions with Leather. He therefore claims that this sale and lease was a fraud upon him and also a fraud on creditors. He is, however, not in a position to ask relief here upon these claims, because he has not sued to set aside the transaction, either on his own behalf or on behalf of creditors, and Leather is not a party.\nOn learning of the transactions with Leather, on the 4th December, 1931, the appellant drew a rider to agreement of 4th November, Exhibit 9, and had same signed by Booth and Hughes. This rider reads as follows:\nMacleod, Alta., December 4th, 1931.\nRIDER TO AGREEMENT DATED NOV. 4th, 1931, made between Booth & Hughes, of Macleod, Alta., and C. L. Dowsley of Calgary, Alta.\n(a) C. L. Dowsley shall have the right to cancel this agreement at any time without prior notice, and shall be entitled to withdraw from all active operation or interest in the Empress Theatre, and shall not be liable for any debts from the operation of the said theatre, except for monies received over and above the amount of expenditures made.\n(b) C. L. Dowsley shall have the right to make arrangements for the installation of sound-on-film reproducing equipment on a rental basis, and it shall be understood that Booth & Hughes shall have no interest in this equipment whatsoever and that it may be removed at any time, without prior notice, either by C. L. Dowsley or the Installing Company, or by both.\n(c) All monies expended by C. L. Dowsley on account of the operation of the Empress Theatre, either in operation repairs or maintenance, over and above the monies received in receipts, shall constitute a direct debt on the part of Booth & Hughes to C. L. Dowsley.\n(d) This RIDER shall be read and construed as being part of, and forming part of the above mentioned agreement between Booth & Hughes and C. L. Dowsley, dated Nov. 4th, 1931.\nBooth & Hughes\nPer: \"J. A. Booth.\"\nWitness :\n\"C. Cooney,\" Macleod.\nOn 22nd December, 1931, Booth and Hughes made an assignment under the Bankruptcy Act to the respondents. On the same day, Mr. Leather went to the theatre and took possession of the cash on hand from the cashier, Mrs. Cook, and gave a receipt for it on behalf of one Kirk; but the evidence shows that neither Leather nor Kirk had any authority to act for the respondents at that time. Notice of their appointment as Custodians was first received from the Official Receiver on the morning of the 23rd, and, after this, on the same day, Shearer, for respondents, notified Kirk to take possession of the property of the assignors on their behalf, which was done. After the respondents had received notice of their appointment as Custodians, and before telephoning Kirk to take possession, the appellant demanded from them possession of the property, claiming to be entitled to same under the agreements cited above. This was refused, and appellant sues, on his own behalf, the respondents in their capacity as a legal entity, and not as liquidators, for damages caused to him by what he claims to have been wrongful dispossession by the respondents.\nHis right to possession, if any, rests entirely upon the terms of the written contract as modified by the letter, Exhibit 2, and the rider, Exhibit 9, set out above. By these documents, Booth and Hughes purported to assign their complete equity in the Empress Theatre building and equipment to the appellant, the date of possession being from 4th November, 1931, at which time the manager (appellant) is to assume complete control.\nIt is argued on behalf of the appellant that, by virtue of section 4 of the agreement, he held the equitable interest in the theatre assigned to him as security for the payments to Hoar and fulfilment of all other terms of the agreement. The appellant is suing for his own personal damage, and must base his action on his own personal rights under the contract. He does not, by the contract, agree to advance any moneys, and if he did advance moneys, as he claims, they became, as provided by the rider, a direct debt of Booth and Hughes to him; but there is no provision that the equitable interest assigned to him is to be held as security for repayment of such advances.\nIf the appellant, as he claims, holds the equitable interest assigned to him as security for any personal interest that he has under the contract, that interest is the five per cent. of gross receipts that he is to receive for his wages as manager, and which is made the fourth charge on these gross receipts. The first and second charges are for the expenses of running the theatre, for which Booth and Hughes alone were liable. The third charge is for the payment of $50 per month to Hoar; the fifth is again for payment of other expenses connected with the theatre, for which Booth and Hughes alone were liable; the sixth is for the balance of gross receipts, all of which, by appellant's letter, Exhibit 2, were to go to Booth and Hughes. At most, therefore, the appellant's interest in the equitable interest assigned to him was to hold it as his security for his wages as manager; that is, for the five per cent. of gross receipts. His contract for services as manager came to an end with the assignment, and, as pointed out by Mr. Justice Clarke in his reasons, the cases of Stocker v. Brock-elbank[2], and Frith v. Frith[3], show that the appellant would have no right to retain possession of the property to enforce a contract for personal services. He would be left to his action for damages for breach of the contract as his only remedy. Ogden v. Fossick[4].\nWhen Mr. Justice Clarke remarks that the contract was simply one of hiring and of service, he is no doubt referring to the contract so far as it concerned the appellant's personal interest. It is argued, however, that the contract amounts to more than a mere contract of hiring and service. This argument is grounded on the provision made for payment of Hoar's account. The appellant, by the contract, was to be a manager in complete control, so that he was to receive, and to be accountable for, the receipts; and the contract simply provides for the order in which he was to disburse these receipts. It is very doubtful if the provision, that in the third place $50 a month was to be paid to Hoar, made the property in the appellant's hands a security for Hoar's debt. Hoar is not a party to the agreement, and the appellant is not suing to enforce the security on Hoar's behalf; he is suing for his own personal damages, and cannot rely on any rights of Hoar, who is not a party to the action. Moreover if, as appellant contends, the agreement and transfer of the property of the bankrupts was to secure Hoar's account, the terms of the document itself show that it was for that purpose fraudulent and void as against the liquidator.\nThe appellant therefore, as has been found by the learned trial judge and the majority of the judges in the Appellate Division, had no personal right to possession after the assignment was made.\nAs to the assignment to the appellant of the chattels belonging to Booth and Hughes, the same rule would apply, and in addition it is evident, as pointed out by Mr. Justice Clarke, that there was not such a change of possession as is defined by the Bills of Sale Act, namely, such change of possession as is open and reasonably sufficient to afford public notice thereof. Again, the respondents are protected by the provisions of sec. 54 of the Bankruptcy Act.\nThe appeal is therefore dismissed, with costs.\nCROCKET J. (dissenting).\u2014With all deference, I find myself unable to agree with the interpretation which the judgment appealed from places on the agreement entered into between the appellant and Booth & Hughes, viz: that it was essentially a contract for personal service. In my opinion, its terms\u2014as well as the whole evidence regarding the acts and conduct of the parties under it\u2014indicate rather that its main purpose was to vest in Dowsley all Booth & Hughes's title and interest in the theatre property and its equipment, and to transfer to him the actual possession and complete control thereof, in order that the business might be placed on a profitable basis in the interest and for the benefit of both parties. No doubt the taking over of possession and complete control had the effect of conferring managerial powers on Dowsley, as the learned trial judge put it, but not, I think, as a mere agent for Booth & Hughes, with no other interest than the securing of five per cent. of the gross receipts for his wages as manager.\nAlthough, as pointed out by our brother Smith, Dowsley did not expressly agree by the contract to advance any moneys, it is apparent that it contemplated that substantial sums of money should be advanced by him, as the evidence shews substantial sums were, in fact, advanced by him in the few weeks which elapsed between the date of the agreement and rider and December 23, when the respondent company went into possession under the bankruptcy assignment, in addition to the personal responsibility he assumed for the installation of the new sound-on-film equipment and the future supply of films, amounting together to over $4,000. It is true that paragraph 3 of the agreement of November 4th provided that Dowsley should not be responsible for any debts contracted by Booth & Hughes, nor for any film contracts- made by them, but it is clear that the intention was, once Dowsley took over the possession and control, he and not they would provide the films. It is also true that clause (c) of the rider of December 4, which was executed after Dowsley discovered the deception the firm had practised upon him by conveying their equity to Leather in all the theatre property, and taking back from the latter a lease for one year and three days, provided that all moneys expended by Dowsley on account of the operation of the theatre over and above the moneys received in receipts, should constitute a direct debt on the part of Booth & Hughes to him, but it is none the less significant for that reason of the intention that Dowsley was to make advances of money for these purposes.\nThese considerations, in my opinion, in themselves shew that it was not intended that Dowsley should go into possession as a mere agent or servant of Booth & Hughes. There is no mention in the agreement of Dowsley himself undertaking to render any personal services, any more than there is of his undertaking to advance any money for operating expenses, or to pledge his credit for the supply of future films\u2014nothing beyond his description as \"the manager.\" While these words, no doubt, designate him as manager of the Empress Theatre, they do not necessarily import that he was to become manager merely as Booth & Hughes's servant and agent. As a matter of fact, the only specific mention of personal services in the agreement is found in clause 7 of paragraph 6, where Booth & Hughes agree to \"give their services to the Empress Theatre for one year,\" without any additional charge other than the amounts they may receive under clause 6\u2014that is, from any balance that might be left after payment of the sums indicated in clauses 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, which items cover, not only all operating and miscellaneous expenses and Dowsley's commission, but capital payments on property and equipment and $50 per month on the C. M. Hoar lien note indebtedness of $970, on which Dowsley was personally liable.\nApart from the question, however, as to whether Dowsley bound himself by the agreement to advance any moneys or credits, which, as I have pointed out, the evidence shews he did in fact do, the agreement unquestionably did provide for the payment of the Hoar indebtedness, for which he was personally liable, and is thus distinguish able from the agreement dealt with in Frith & Frith[5], which is so strongly relied upon by the respondent. In addition to this, clause 6 of paragraph 6 of the agreement provides for the equal division of the net profits after payment of the sums indicated in clauses 1 to 5, between Booth & Hughes and Dowsley. It is true, that for some reason or other Dowsley had, before the execution of the agreement, promised to waive his right under this clause and to allow Booth & Hughes the whole balance, on the understanding that they were not to let the film companies know. The motive for the insertion of the clause in the agreement is doubtful, but it would appear from the terms of the letter to be found in the dealings of one or other of the parties with the film companies. The fact remains, however, that, notwithstanding the statement in the letter, both parties afterwards executed the agreement. Whether, in the circumstances, clause 6, as it appears in the executed agreement, or the letter, fixes the rights of the parties in respect of the \"balance\" referred to, the letter clearly demonstrates, not only that there was no thought of Dowsley acting under the agreement as the mere servant and agent of Booth & Hughes, but that he was the dominant authority, who controlled even the terms of the agreement itself. Moreover, the agreement must, I think, be interpreted in the light of the admitted and indisputable fact that Dowsley was an electrical engineer, who had been engaged for many years in the moving picture business and owned, operated or had an interest in an extensive circuit of moving picture theatres throughout the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and that this fact was well known to Booth & Hughes. This would itself point to the unlikelihood of his entering into an agreement to serve Booth & Hughes's interest solely for the remuneration provided\u2014five per cent. of the gross proceeds. It will be noted in this connection that clause 6 of the rider provided that Dowsley should have the right to make arrangements for the installation of sound-on-film reproducing equipment, and that Booth & Hughes should have no interest whatsoever in this equipment. In my opinion, if Dowsley is to be regarded in any sense as an agent of Booth & Hughes, under the terms of the agreement, it was an agency which was created for the purpose of securing some benefit to him beyond his mere remuneration as such agent, and an agency which was, therefore, irrevocable within the meaning of the passage quoted and approved by Lord Atkinson from Story on Agency in Frith v. Frith[6], until its purposes were fulfilled.\nWith regard to the case of Ogden v. Fossick[7], referred to in the judgments of both Clarke and Mitchell JJ.A., it is to be observed that in that suit, which was one for specific performance, the defendant was the party who, in the agreement, had both engaged his services and covenanted to grant the lease of the coal wharf. In the case at bar the agreement itself purported at least to assign Booth & Hughes's whole equity to Dowsley, who, it is claimed, was the party who had covenanted to render the personal service, and he was in actual possession and complete control of the theatre under the terms of the agreement and already had, as pointed out by McGillivray, J.A., all that a decree for specific performance could have given him. It is not a question of whether he could have succeeded in maintaining a suit against Booth & Hughes for specific performance of their agreement to give him possession and control of the theatre, had they refused to do so, but a question of whether, he having gone into possession and assumed control, under the terms of the agreement, Booth & Hughes, if they had not assigned, could have rightly ejected him, failing any breach of the agreement on his part.\nIf the view I have intimated be the correct view of the agreement, Booth & Hughes had no right to interfere in any way with Dowsley's possession and control of the theatre property, until the completion of the agreed payments on C. M. Hoar's account and the \"fulfillment of all other terms of the agreement\" at least. The question directly involved here is as to whether the trustee in bankruptcy had any legal right to oust him of that possession and control. As to this, the dictum of James L.J., in Ex parte Holthausen; In re Scheibler[8], quoted by McGillivray J.A., enunciates the governing rule of law as follows:\nIf a bankrupt or a liquidating debtor, under circumstances which are not impeachable under any particular provision connected with his bankruptcy or insolvency, enters into a contract with respect to his real estate for a valuable consideration, that contract binds his trustee in bankruptcy as much as it binds himself.\nSo that, unless the agreement here in question is impeachable as a fraud upon Booth & Hughes's creditors, the respondent company as custodian in bankruptcy would have no more right to interfere with Dowsley's possession and control of the theatre than Booth & Hughes themselves would have.\nRegarding the contention that the agreement was fraudulent and void under the Statute 13 Elizabeth and sec. 64 of the Bankruptcy Act, whatever may be said of the conveyances which were arranged between Booth & Hughes and Leather behind Dowsley's back before the execution of the Booth & Hughes-Dowsley agreement, I am of opinion that no intent to hinder, delay or defeat other creditors can properly be imputed to the latter, nor any intent to give Hoar an undue preference over other creditors. Unlike the conveyances to Leather, which made no provision for any other creditor than Leather himself, the whole scheme of the Dowsley agreement was to place the Empress Theatre business on a paying basis so that the debts of Booth & Hughes might be paid, not Hoar's alone, as contended, but payments made as well on property and equipment. The preamble of the agreement itself, which it is said indicates the purpose only to give Hoar a preference, mentions as well the balance owing on the agreement of sale of the theatre itself.\nIn any event, before this or any court would be justified in holding the agreement fraudulent under the provisions of sec. 64 of the Bankruptcy Act, it must be satisfied that it was made \"with a view of giving such creditor (Hoar) a preference over the other creditors\" of Booth & Hughes. For the reasons already indicated, I do not think that any such finding is warranted. The provision that $50 a month was to be applied out of the receipts on account of the Hoar note, secured as it was by a right of seizure, whereby Hoar could force the firm out of business at any moment, was clearly one which gave Hoar no advantage over his existing security.\nSection 54 of the Bankruptcy Act has no application, I think, to a case of this kind, where the debtor had wholly divested himself of his equity and possession and control of the property involved.\nFor all these reasons, some of which have been discussed more fully by McGillivray J.A., in his dissenting judgment, I have come to the same conclusion as he upon the whole case, and would therefore allow the appeal with costs, set aside the judgment with costs and refer the action back to the trial judge to assess damages with or without further evidence as he may decide.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 26 Alta, L.R. 393; [1932] 2 W.W.R. 601; [1932] 4 D.L.R. 97; 14 C.B.R. 53.\n[2] (1851) 20 L.J.

The respondent company bought the property in 1922. According to the books of the appellant municipality in 1926 and previously, the land and the buildings were not described on the valuation roll under consecutive numbers nor on the same pages of the book. Accounts for municipal and school taxes were sent and paid by the respondent company. It was not disputed that the taxes on the buildings were paid; but the municipality claimed taxes were due on the land. The appellant municipality, in the public notice of sale for unpaid taxes, described the whole lot as being (to be sold without indicating that the buildings were excluded. In 1928, title to the property was delivered to the purchaser at the tax sale by the appellant. The respondent company had no knowledge of the sale until 1929 when notified by the purchaser and then took an action to annul the sale.\nHeld that the tax sale was null and void ab initio, and that the title of the purchaser should be set aside.\nHeld, also, that, in a case of absolute nullity, the provisions of article 747 M.C. enacting limitation of the action in annulment of the sale do not apply.\nHeld, further that the declarations and statements contained in authentic deeds as well as in deeds under private seal are considered as proved until they are challenged and contrary evidence is adduced, and it is so, not only as between the parties to the deeds, but also against third parties.\nJudgment of the Court of Kings Bench (Q.R. 52 K.B. 458) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, d\u2019Auteuil J. and maintaining the respondent company\u2019s action to annul sale of mining property for unpaid taxes.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above headnote and in the judgment now reported.\nJ.

(ad hoc).\u2014Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une action en d\u00e9claration de nullit\u00e9 de vente, pour taxes municipales, d\u2019un immeuble situ\u00e9 dans la municipalit\u00e9-appelante, et dont le mis-en-cause, Robutel Th\u00e9berge, s\u2019est port\u00e9 adjudicataire, le 3 mars 1926, \u00e0 une vente faite par la corporation du comt\u00e9 de M\u00e9gantic, sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 des dispositions des articles 726 et suivants du code municipal.\nCet immeuble d\u00e9sign\u00e9 au cadastre comme \u00e9tant la partie sud-est du lot n\u00b0 19 du 10e rang du canton de Coleraine, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 originairement conc\u00e9d\u00e9, en 1906, par la couronne, comme concession mini\u00e8re, \u00e0 Charles King, de Boston, et dame Marie-Louise King, veuve de feu Sir Adolphe Chapleau. Ces derniers apparaissaient encore, en 1926, aux: r\u00f4les d\u2019\u00e9valuation et de perception de la municipalit\u00e9-appelante, comme propri\u00e9taires du fonds dudit immeuble, les b\u00e2tisses sus-\u00e9rig\u00e9es \u00e9tant inscrites sur lesdits r\u00f4les au nom de la compagnie-intim\u00e9e, et c\u2019est pour les taxes qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 dues par lesdits King et Lady Chapleau, comme propri\u00e9taires dudit fonds de terre, que ledit immeuble a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu et adjug\u00e9 audit mis-en-cause Th\u00e9berge, en mars 1926.\nLe 26 mars 1928, le retrait pr\u00e9vu par l\u2019article 740 du code municipal n\u2019ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9, un acte de vente dudit immeuble a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9 audit mis-en-cause-adjudicataire par ladite corporation de comt\u00e9, et c\u2019est cette vente qui fait maintenant l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente demande en nullit\u00e9.\nLa demanderesse-intim\u00e9e invoque, au soutien de son action, que ladite vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite super non domino et non possidente; que lorsque cette vente a eu lieu, elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 propri\u00e9taire dudit immeuble depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, par bons titres, et que son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 au conseil municipal et au secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier de la corporation-appelante, que frauduleusement et sans droit, le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier de la corporation-appelante avait omis de porter l\u2019intim\u00e9e au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, comme propri\u00e9taire dudit immeuble, quant au fonds, laissant sur ledit r\u00f4le, comme propri\u00e9taires dudit fonds, les propri\u00e9taires originaires, et n\u2019inscrivant l\u2019intim\u00e9e sur ce r\u00f4le que comme propri\u00e9taire des b\u00e2tisses sus-\u00e9rig\u00e9es; qu\u2019un \u00e9tat des taxes municipales et scolaires lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis et qu\u2019elle avait toujours acquitt\u00e9 les taxes qu\u2019on lui avait demand\u00e9es, mais que, frauduleusement et sans droit, la corporationappelante avait omis de d\u00e9noncer \u00e0 la compagnie-intim\u00e9e les taxes ill\u00e9galement impos\u00e9es sur ladite concession mini\u00e8re, ind\u00e9pendamment des b\u00e2tisses.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e ajoute que ce n\u2019est qu\u2019au cours de 1929 que ledit adjudicataire Robutel Th\u00e9berge lui a d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 ses droits sur ledit lot; que jusqu\u2019alors, elle avait toujours ignor\u00e9 ladite vente municipale, et que c\u2019est apr\u00e8s avoir connu les pr\u00e9tentions dudit adjudicataire Th\u00e9berge qu\u2019elle a intent\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente action en nullit\u00e9 de vente. La corporation-appelante soutient \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cette action:\u2014\n1. Que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire dudit immeuble ainsi vendu pour taxes, et que, cons\u00e9quemment, elle n\u2019a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 intenter son action;\n2. Que l\u2019es ventes pour taxes municipales faites sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 des articles 726 et suivants du code municipal ne sont pas dirig\u00e9es contre les personnes, mais contre les immeubles et que, pour cette raison, ces ventes ne sauraient \u00eatre assimil\u00e9es aux ventes d\u2019immeubles par le sh\u00e9rif qui doivent \u00eatre faites sur la personne condamn\u00e9e qui les poss\u00e8de, ou est r\u00e9put\u00e9e les poss\u00e9der animo domini (art. 699 C.P.C.); que la vente pour taxes dont l\u2019intim\u00e9e demande la nullit\u00e9 a eu lieu l\u00e9galement sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s inscrites au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019ayant jamais d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9;\n3. Que l\u2019action est prescrite, aux termes de l\u2019article 747 du code municipal.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu l\u2019action de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi si\u00e9geant en appel, monsieur le juge Tellier dissident.\nPremi\u00e8re question: L\u2019intim\u00e9e a-t-elle prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019immeuble en question, tant pour le fonds que pour les b\u00e2tisses, lorsque ladite vente pour taxes a eu lieu?\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e a produit trois documents pour \u00e9tablir son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9:\nLe premier est un acte de transport-cession, en date du 25 octobre 1919, fait sous son seing priv\u00e9, en la cit\u00e9 de New-York, par un nomm\u00e9 Parker Sloane \u00e0 la United States Ferro Alloys Corporation.\nIl est d\u00e9clar\u00e9, dans cet acte de transport-cession, que le c\u00e9dant Parker Sloane transporte \u00e0 ladite compagnie United States Ferro Alloys Corporation une somme de $8,633.75, cette somme \u00e9tant une balance due et qui lui est payable en capital et int\u00e9r\u00eat, aux termes d\u2019un acte de vente consenti le 24 juillet 1918 par Charles A. King et les ex\u00e9cuteurstestamentaires de Lady Chapleau \u00e0 J.-Val\u00e8re B\u00e9langer, de ladite partie sud-est du lot n\u00b0 19 du 10e rang du canton de Coleraine, enregistr\u00e9 au bureau d\u2019enregistrement du comt\u00e9 de M\u00e9gantic, le 30 juillet 1918, sous le n\u00b0 57886, et ledit acte ajoute:\nas acquired by the said Charles A. King and Lady Chapleau under Grant of Mining Concession from the Department of Colonization, Mines and Fisheries of the Province of Quebec, of date the 8th August 1906, and registered in the Registry Office for the County of Megantic, at Inverness, on the 2nd November 1907, in Register B, Vol. 46, No. 43113. A cet acte de transport-cession compara\u00eet ledit J.-Val\u00e8re B\u00e9langer lequel, apr\u00e8s avoir pris connaissance dudit acte, d\u00e9clare en \u00eatre satisfait et s\u2019engage \u00e0 payer ladite somme de $8,633.75 \u00e0 ladite compagnie-cessionnaire, United States Ferro Alloys Corporation.\nCet acte sous seing priv\u00e9, fait \u00e0 New-York, est sign\u00e9 par toutes les parties, il est authentiqu\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi, et le double produit au dossier porte le certificat du r\u00e9gistrateur du comt\u00e9 de M\u00e9gantic, comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9, le 3 novembre 1919, sous le n\u00b0 60271.\nLe deuxi\u00e8me document produit par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, pour \u00e9tablir son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, est un acte de vente pass\u00e9 devant le notaire Joseph Sirois, \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, le 30 mai 1922.\nPar cet acte, la United States Ferro Alloys Corporation, \u00e0 qui le nomm\u00e9 Parker Sloane avait consenti le transportcession ci-dessus relat\u00e9, vend \u00e0 la compagnie-intim\u00e9e ledit lot de terre connu comme \u00e9tant la partie sud-est du lot n\u00b0 19 du 10e rang du canton de Coleraine,\nas acquired (d\u00e9clare encore ledit acte) by Charles A.

B\u00e9langer Mining Company, Limited, known as the south-east portion of lot 19 of the 10th Range of the Township of Coleraine, containing, etc. * * * Le troisi\u00e8me document produit par la compagnie-intim\u00e9e, comme preuve de son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, est un autre acte de vente pass\u00e9 devant Mtre Sirois, notaire, en date du 31 janvier 1923, encore entre ladite United States Ferro Alloys Corporation et ladite compagnie-appelante, The Colonial Chrome Company Limited.\nPar cet acte de vente, la United States Ferro Alloys Corporation vend de nouveau \u00e0 la compagnie-intim\u00e9e, non seulement tout ce qu\u2019elle lui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vendu par l\u2019acte de vente pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent du 30 mai 1922, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire ladite concession mini\u00e8re, avec les b\u00e2tisses dessus \u00e9rig\u00e9es, mais elle lui transporte en m\u00eame temps toutes les r\u00e9clamations qu\u2019elle poss\u00e8de contre J.-V. B\u00e9langer Mining Co. Limited, en vertu de certains jugements \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s audit acte.\nParmi ces jugements, il y en a un au montant de $50,859.36 en acompte duquel la venderesse d\u00e9clare qu\u2019un cr\u00e9dit de $16,705.05 doit \u00eatre donn\u00e9, ce dernier montant repr\u00e9sentant le prix r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par la vente du sh\u00e9rif des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de ladite compagnie J.-V. B\u00e9langer Mining Co. Limited.\nCet acte de vente contient de plus la d\u00e9claration suivante:\u2014\nThe properties, mills, machineries and rights sold * * * belong to the Vendor under and in virtue of a deed from the Sheriff for the District of Arthabaska, dated the (seventeenth of December last (1921) and registered in the Registry Office for the County of Megantic (Inverness) on the nineteenth of the same month and year as number 64274.\nAccording to a certificate given by the sheriff of the District of Arthabaska on the fifteenth of June nineteen hundred and twenty-two, registered in the Registry Office for the. Registration Division for the District of Megantic on the nineteenth of the same month and year as No. 20369, the purchase price mentioned in the deed of sale from the sheriff has been paid and satisfied in full, and the security bond of the United States Ferro Alloys Corporation for the said sum $19,000 was and is discharged.\nCe demier acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi enregistr\u00e9 au long au bureau d\u2019enregistrement du comt\u00e9 de M\u00e9gantic, \u00e0 Inverness, le 6 f\u00e9vrier 1923, sous le n\u00b0 66107, ainsi qu\u2019il appert au certificat du r\u00e9gistrateur \u00e0 l\u2019endos de la copie dudit acte qui est au dossier.\nVoil\u00e0 les titres que la compagnie-intim\u00e9e a produits comme preuve de son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, aussi bien dudit lot de terre partie sud-est du n\u00b0 19 du 10e rang du canton de Coleraine, que des b\u00e2tisses \u00e9rig\u00e9es sur ledit lot. La corporation-appelante pr\u00e9tend que ces titres ne sont pas suffisants pour d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019intim\u00e9e est propri\u00e9taire dudit immeuble, tant pour le fonds que pour les b\u00e2tisses. Elle soutient que les titres produits d\u00e9montrent bien que la Colonial Chrome Company, Limited, a achet\u00e9 le lot de terre en question, mais qu\u2019ils ne d\u00e9montrent pas que son vendeur en \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire, en d\u2019autres termes, que ces titres ne remontent pas aux lettres patentes.\nIl est vrai, dit l\u2019appelante dans son factum, que dans les ventes de la United States Ferro Alloys Corporation \u00e0 la Colonial Chrome Company, Limited, la compagnie-venderesse d\u00e9clare que son titre est une vente du sh\u00e9rif, mais, ajoute l\u2019appelante, cette d\u00e9claration ne fait pas de preuve, car l\u2019acte de vente du sh\u00e9rif n\u2019est pas produit.\nSur ce point, monsieur le juge Tellier qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dissident en appel s\u2019exprime comme suit:\u2014\nLa demanderesse est-elle propri\u00e9taire du terrain qui a fait l\u2019objet de la vente qu\u2019elle attaque?\nLe titre qu\u2019elle produit se rapporte bien \u00e0 ce terrain. Il lui vient de la United States Ferro Alloys Corporation. Il est en date du 31 janvier 1923. Dans ce titre, la venderesse a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir acquis du sh\u00e9rif du district d\u2019Athabaska, le 17 d\u00e9cembre 1921, ledit terrain qu\u2019elle vendait. Cette d\u00e9claration, qui, naturellement, ne fait pas preuve, est-elle vraie? Noua n\u2019en savons rien, le contrat de vente du sh\u00e9rif n\u2019\u00e9tant pas produit.\nLa demanderesse a en outre mis au dossier un acte de cession et. transport (transfer and assignment), dat\u00e9 de New-York, le 25 octobre 1919, et attestant que, ce jour-l\u00e0, M. Parker Sloane a c\u00e9d\u00e9 et transport\u00e9 \u00e0 M. J.-Val\u00e8re B\u00e9langer, pour bonne et valable consid\u00e9ration, une somme de $8,633.75, \u00e9tant la balance du prix de la vente du terrain en question, consentie le 24 juillet 1918, par M. Harry R. Fraser, procureur de M. Charles A. King, et par M. Albert J. Brown, pour les ex\u00e9cuteurs-testamentaires de feu Lady Chapleau. Cet acte de cession ou transport fait preuve, \u00e9videmment, de la vente de cr\u00e9ance qui en fait l\u2019objet, mais il ne prouve rien de plus.\nAvant la vente municipale, dont la nullit\u00e9 est demand\u00e9e, le terrain dont il s\u2019agit figurait aux noms conjoints de M. C. A. King et de Lady Chapleau, sur le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation de la d\u00e9fenderesse. C\u2019est sur eux que ladite vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. La demanderesse pr\u00e9tend que ledit r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, de m\u00eame que le r\u00f4le de perception, auquel il servait de base, \u00e9tait erron\u00e9. Cela se peut; mais, encore faut-il qu\u2019elle le d\u00e9montre. Et, pour cela, elle a besoin de toute une cha\u00eene de titres, remontant jusqu\u2019\u00e0 C. A. King et Lady Chapleau. En l\u2019absence d\u2019une cha\u00eene ininterrompue de titres, je ne vois pas comment on pourrait la reconna\u00eetre comme propri\u00e9taire, au lieu et place de C. A. King et Lady Chapleau.\nAvec beaucoup de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour l\u2019opinion exprim\u00e9e par l\u2019honorable juge, je suis d\u2019avis que les actes produits au dossier par l\u2019intim\u00e9e sont suffisants pour \u00e9tablir la cha\u00eene des titres, \u00e0 partir de la concession faite par la Couronne \u00e0 Charles A. King et Lady Chapleau, de ladite concession mini\u00e8re, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019acquisition d\u2019icelle par la compagnieintim\u00e9e de la United States Ferro Alloys Corporation.\nLa doctrine et la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aises, commentant les articles 1319 et 1320 du Code de Napol\u00e9on, auxquels correspondent les articles 1210 et 1222 du Code Civil de Qu\u00e9bec, affirment que les d\u00e9clarations et \u00e9nunciations contenues dans les actes authentiques, aussi bien que dans les \u00e9critures priv\u00e9es, ont force probante jusqu\u2019\u00e0 preuve contraire, non seulement entre les parties mais aussi contre les tiers.\nOr, comme dans la cause actuelle, la corporation-appelante n\u2019a fait aucune preuve \u00e0 l\u2019encontre desdites d\u00e9clarations et \u00e9nonciations contenues dans ces actes, il en r\u00e9sulte que ces d\u00e9clarations et \u00e9nonciations font pleine foi.\nLes articles 1210 et 1222 du Code Civil de Qu\u00e9bec sont. dans les termes suivants:\u2014\n(1210) L\u2019acte authentique fait preuve compl\u00e8te entre les parties, leurs h\u00e9ritiers et repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux:\n1. De l\u2019obligation qui y est exprim\u00e9e;\n2.

L\u2019\u00e9nonciation \u00e9trang\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019obligation ou \u00e0 l\u2019objet qu\u2019avaient en vue les parties en passant l\u2019acte ne peut servir que comme commencement de preuve.\n(1222) Les \u00e9critures priv\u00e9es reconnues par celui \u00e0 qui on les oppose, ou l\u00e9galement tenues pour reconnues ou prouv\u00e9es, font preuve entre ceux qui y sont parties, et entre leurs h\u00e9ritiers et repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux, dem\u00eame que des actes authentiques.\nLes articles correspondants du Code Napol\u00e9on se lisent, comme suit:\u2014\n(1319) L\u2019acte authentique fait pleine foi de la convention qu\u2019il renferme entre les parties contractantes et leurs h\u00e9ritiers ou ayants cause. * * *\n(1320) L\u2019acte, soit authentique, soit sous seing priv\u00e9, fait preuve entre les parties, m\u00eame de ce qui n\u2019y est exprim\u00e9 qu\u2019en termes \u00e9nonciatifs, pourvu que l\u2019enonciation ait un rapport direct \u00e0 la disposition. Les \u00e9nonciations \u00e9trang\u00e8res \u00e0 la disposition ne peuvent servir que d\u2019un commencement de preuve.\nM. Mignault, dans son trait\u00e9 de Droit Civil Canadien, vol. 6, p. 21, commente ainsi l\u2019article 1210 du Code Civil ci-dessus cit\u00e9:\u2014\nCet article, s\u2019inspirant des articles 1319 et 1320 du code Napol\u00e9on, a reproduit une inexactitude de r\u00e9daction que tous les commentateurs ont reproch\u00e9e \u00e0 ces articles. Comme eux, il confond la force probante avec la force obligatoire de l\u2019acte. Il est bien entendu que les contrats authentiques ou sous seing priv\u00e9, n\u2019obligent que les parties, leurs h\u00e9ritiers ou. repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux. Au contraire, leur force probante est indivisible et elle existe \u00e0 l\u2019egard de tout le monde.\nCorrigeons donc la formule de l\u2019article 1210 en disant que l\u2019acte authentique fait preuve compl\u00e8te, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des tiers comme des parties, de l\u2019obligation qui y est exprim\u00e9e, et aussi de tout ce qui y est exprim\u00e9 en termes \u00e9nonciatifs, etc., en ce sens que l\u2019existence de l\u2019acte, de l\u2019obligation, ou de l\u2019\u00e9nonciation, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, suivant le mot de Dumoulin, rei gest\u0153, ne peut \u00eatre contest\u00e9e par les tiers sans recourir \u00e0 l\u2019inscripion de faux.\nMais cette force probante s\u2019\u00e9tend-elle de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re \u00e0 tout ce que cet acte contient?\nOn distingue les mentions qu\u2019on ne peut contester sans mettre en question la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de l\u2019officier public et celles qu\u2019on pourrait nier sans attaquer cette v\u00e9racit\u00e9. Dans le cas des premi\u00e8res on d\u00e9cide qu\u2019on ne peut les contester sans recourir \u00e0 l\u2019inscription de faux. Les autres font foi jusqu\u2019\u00e0 preuve contraire, mais on peut les mettre en question sans inscription de faux. Ainsi un acte de vente constate que le prix a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 devant le notaire; cette mention ne peut \u00eatre ni\u00e9e que par l\u2019inscription de faux. Mais il en serait autrement s\u2019il \u00e9tait dit que le vendeur reconnaissait avoir re\u00e7u le prix ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 l\u2019acte; cette mention prouverait le fait de cette reconnaissance, mais on pourrait nier le fait du paiement sans mettre en question la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 du notaire et partant l\u2019inscription en faux ne serait pas n\u00e9cessaire. * * *\nNous en arrivons maintenant \u00e0 la distinction que l\u2019article 1210 fait entre l\u2019obligation et l\u2019enonciation. Par l\u2019obligation, on doit entendre les d\u00e9clarations des parties, car l\u2019acte peut bien ne renfermer aucune obligation, et par l\u2019\u00e9nonciation, les explications que contient l\u2019acte. Il n\u2019y a aucune difficult\u00e9 quant aux d\u00e9clarations des parties, ou, pour employer l\u2019expression de Pothier (Obligations, n\u00b0 735), quant au dispositif de l\u2019acteIl ne peut y avoir d\u2019embarras qu\u2019au sujet des \u00e9nonciattions, car celles-l\u00e0 seules sont authentiques qui ont un rapport direct \u00e0 l\u2019obligation ou \u00e0 l\u2019objet qu\u2019avaient en vue les parties en passant l\u2019acte, les autres ne pouvant servir que comme commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit. A quel signe reconna\u00eetre une \u00e9nonciation qui a un rapport direct \u00e0 l\u2019obligation ou \u00e0 l\u2019objet que les parties avaient en vue? Pothier nous indique le moyen de les distinguer en disant qu\u2019une \u00e9nonciation \u00e0 laquelle la partie adverse aurait int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 s\u2019opposer si elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vraie, est une \u00e9nonciation qui a un rapport direct \u00e0 la disposition. Ainsi l\u2019acte de reconnaissance d\u2019une rente dit que tous les arr\u00e9rages de cette rente ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s. Le cr\u00e9ancier, partie \u00e0 l\u2019acte, aurait int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 s\u2019opposer \u00e0 cette \u00e9nonciation et son silence est un aveu. Au contraire, dans le m\u00eame acte le d\u00e9biteur d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il tient l\u2019h\u00e9ritage charg\u00e9 de la rente de la succession de son fr\u00e8re; le cr\u00e9ancier ni aucun antre des parties n\u2019a d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 s\u2019opposer \u00e0 cette \u00e9nonciation, partant elle est \u00e9trang\u00e8re \u00e0 la disposition et elle ne pourra valoir que comme commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit contre le d\u00e9biteur.\nMM. Planiol et Ripert, dans leur Trait\u00e9 Pratique de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, derni\u00e8re \u00e9dition (1931), vol. VII, p. 771, s\u2019expriment aussi comme suit:\u2014\n1435. R\u00e8gles communes \u00e0 tous les actes. All\u00e9gations qui font preuve. D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 1320, \u201cl\u2019acte soit authentique soit sous seing priv\u00e9 fait foi entre les parties, m\u00eame de ce qui n\u2019y est exprim\u00e9 qu\u2019en termes \u00e9nonciatifs pourvu que l\u2019\u00e9nonciation ait un rapport direct avec la disposition. Les \u00e9nonciations \u00e9trang\u00e8res \u00e0 la disposition ne peuvent servir que de commencement de preuve.\u201d Ainsi y a-t-il lieu de faire unie distinction essentielle, dans tout acte \u00e9crit, entre la disposition et les \u00e9nonciations. Ces deux expressions supposent exactement comme celles de dispositif et de motifs dans les minutes des jugements. La disposition est la partie de l\u2019acte qui en constitue l\u2019objet m\u00eame, celle o\u00f9 le d\u00e9biteur reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il s\u2019est engag\u00e9 envers le cr\u00e9ancier ou dans laquelle le cr\u00e9ancier reconna\u00eet que le d\u00e9biteur l\u2019a pay\u00e9. C\u2019est la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de l\u2019acte. Les \u00e9nonciations sont les all\u00e9gations de l\u2019acte qui n\u2019ont pas essentiellement pour but d\u2019engager ou de lib\u00e9rer les parties, les simples explications qui n\u2019auraient pas suffi \u00e0 elles seules \u00e0 d\u00e9cider les parties \u00e0 dresser l\u2019acte. Dans l\u2019intention des parties, elles ne sont pas relat\u00e9es pour faire preuve de quoi que ce soit mais pour les raisons les plus diverses. N\u00e9anmoins les \u00e9nonciations ayant un rapport direct avec la disposition ont la m\u00eame valeur probante que la disposition; leur insertion dans l\u2019acte a d\u00fb attirer l\u2019attention des parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es; si elles ont laiss\u00e9 passer cette \u00e9nonciation sans protester c\u2019est que le fait relat\u00e9 est vrai. Les \u00e9nonciations n\u2019ayant pas de rapport direct avec la disposition ne peuvent au contraire servir que de commencement de preuve. Le fait \u00e9nonc\u00e9 n\u2019est alors pas prouv\u00e9 par l\u2019acte; il est seulement vraisemblable, ce qui aura pour effet de rendre admissibles tous les compl\u00e9ments de preuve autoris\u00e9s par la loi: t\u00e9moins, pr\u00e9somptions, serment suppl\u00e9tif. Les juges du fait appr\u00e9cient souverainement s\u2019il y a ou non rapport direct entre l\u2019\u00e9nonciation incidente et le dispositif.\nNous pouvons aussi r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 sur cette question \u00e0 Laurent, vol. 19, nos 133 et suivants.\nToute la doctrine et la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise, sur cette mati\u00e8re, est d\u2019ailleurs expos\u00e9e dans le Juris-Classeur Civil, sous les art. 1319 et 1320 du Code Napol\u00e9on.\nMe basant sur ces autorit\u00e9s, il me semble qu\u2019il ne peut y avoir aucun doute que l\u2019\u00e9nonciation qui est faite dans l\u2019acte de transport consenti par Sloane \u00e0 la United States Ferro Alloys Corporation, et suivant laquelle il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le montant de $8,633.75 qui fait l\u2019objet dudit transport est une balance due, aux termes d\u2019un acte de vente consenti par Charles A. King et les ex\u00e9cuteurs-testamentaires de Lady Chapleau \u00e0 J.-Val\u00e8re B\u00e9langer, de la concession mini\u00e8re en litige, est une \u00e9nonciation qui a un rapport direct \u00e0 l\u2019objet en vue par les parties en passant cet acte. En effet, cette \u00e9nonciation est pour ainsi dire n\u00e9cessaire pour la validit\u00e9 dudit transport, puisqu\u2019elle d\u00e9termine la source de la cr\u00e9ance qui fait l\u2019objet de ce transport. Cette somme de $8,633.75, transport\u00e9e par Sloane \u00e0 la United States Ferro Alloys Corporation, ne peut \u00eatre une somme ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e; il faut bien n\u00e9cessairement que le c\u00e9dant indique au cessionnaire le titre de la cr\u00e9ance qu\u2019il lui transporte, et partant, l\u2019\u00e9nonciation contenue dans ledit acte de transport qui r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 ce titre de cr\u00e9ance est une \u00e9nonciation directe \u00e0 l\u2019obligation, pour ne pas dire que cette \u00e9nonciation ne fait pas partie du dispositif m\u00eame de l\u2019acte.\nJe suis donc d\u2019opinion que l\u2019acte de transport sous seing priv\u00e9 entre Parker Sloane et la United States Ferro Alloys Corporation, en date du 25 octobre 1919, ayant, aux termes de l\u2019article 1222 du Code Civil, la m\u00eame force probante qu\u2019un acte authentique, \u00e9tablit, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 preuve contraire, vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers, comme entre les parties, que le 24 juillet 1918, Charles A. King et les ex\u00e9cuteurs-testamentaires de feu Lady Chapleau ont vendu \u00e0 J.-Val\u00e8re B\u00e9langer le lot de terre connu comme \u00e9tant la partie sud-est du lot n\u00b0 19 du 10e rang du canton de Coleraine, tel qu\u2019acquis par lesdits Charles A. King et Lady Chapleau, du d\u00e9partement de la Colonisation, des Mines et P\u00eacheries de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, le 28 ao\u00fbt 1906, et que cet acte de vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9 au bureau d\u2019enregistrement d\u2019Inverness, comt\u00e9 de M\u00e9gantic, le 30 juillet 1918, sous le n\u00b0 57886.\nPour des motifs analogues, les deux actes de vente ci-dessus relat\u00e9s, dat\u00e9s respectivement le 30 mai 1922 et le 31 janvier 1923, entre la United States Ferro Alloys Corporation et la Colonial Chrome Co., Limited, deux actes notari\u00e9s et par cons\u00e9quent authentiques (art. 1208 C.C.) font preuve, non seulement entre les parties, mais aussi vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 preuve du contraire, non seulement du fait que la United States Ferro Alloys Corporation a bien vendu, aux termes de ces deux actes, \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Colonial Chrome Co., Limited, le lot de terre ci-dessus d\u00e9crit, avec toutes les b\u00e2tisses \u00e9rig\u00e9es sur icelui, mais aussi du fait, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 preuve contraire, que la United States Ferro Alloys Corporation est devenue propri\u00e9taire de ce qui fait l\u2019objet desdites ventes, en vertu d\u2019un titre du sh\u00e9rif du district d\u2019Arthabaska, en date du 17 d\u00e9cembre 1921, et d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9 au bureau d\u2019enregistrement du comt\u00e9 de M\u00e9gantic, le 19 du m\u00eame mois, sous le n\u00b0 64274; que suivant certificat du sh\u00e9rif, en date du 15 juin 1922 et d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9 sous le n\u00b0 20369, le prix de vente mentionn\u00e9 audit acte du sh\u00e9rif a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment pay\u00e9 par la United States Ferro Alloys Corporation, et que cette vente du sh\u00e9rif a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite sur J.-V.

B\u00e9langer Mining Co., Limited, appara\u00eet encore comme propri\u00e9taire desdites b\u00e2tisses sur le r\u00f4le de perception, et il n\u2019y a encore que la maison de pension et la maison du g\u00e9rant qui soient tax\u00e9es pour ces ann\u00e9es.\nPour les ann\u00e9es 1923-1924, 1924-1925 et 1925-1926, c\u2019est l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui appara\u00eet propri\u00e9taire desdites b\u00e2tisses au r\u00f4le de perception et, pour ces ann\u00e9es, il n\u2019y a encore que la maison de pension et la maison du g\u00e9rant qui soient tax\u00e9es, le moulin et ses accessoires qui sont \u00e9valu\u00e9s \u00e0 $20,000 ne semblent pas avoir jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 tax\u00e9s.\nNous avons vu ci-dessus, par l\u2019analyse des titres de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, que le 24 juillet 1918, Charles A. King et les ex\u00e9cuteurs-testamentaires de Lady Chapleau avaient vendu ledit lot de terre \u00e0 J.-Val\u00e8re B\u00e9langer et que ladite vente avait \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e au bureau d\u2019enregistrement du comt\u00e9 de M\u00e9gantic, le 30 juillet 1918, sous le n\u00b0 57886.\nNous avons vu aussi que ce m\u00eame lot de terre, avec les b\u00e2tisses dessus \u00e9rig\u00e9es, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu par le sh\u00e9rif sur J.-V. B\u00e9langer Mining Co., Limited, le 17 d\u00e9cembre 1921, et que cette vente avait \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e au bureau d\u2019enregistrement du comt\u00e9 de M\u00e9gantic, le 19 du m\u00eame mois.\nNous avons vu enfin que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait acquis ledit immeuble, le 31 janvier 1923, de la United States Ferro Alloys Corporation, et que cette vente avait aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9e.\nOr, comment se fait-il que malgr\u00e9 ces ventes successives, \u00e0 partir de 1918, Charles A. King et Lady Chapleau soient rest\u00e9s inscrits comme propri\u00e9taires du fonds dudit immeuble au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, aussi bien qu\u2019au r\u00f4le de perception, jusqu\u2019en 1926?\nPour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1918-1919 qui est l\u2019ann\u00e9e durant laquelle B\u00e9langer a achet\u00e9 le lot de terre en question de Charles A. King et Lady Chapleau, le r\u00f4le de perception mentionne que c\u2019est B\u00e9langer qui a pay\u00e9 les taxes impos\u00e9es sur le fonds, et \u00e0 partir de 1920, c\u2019est J.-V. B\u00e9langer Mining Co., Limited, qui appara\u00eet comme propri\u00e9taire des b\u00e2tisses \u00e9rig\u00e9es sur ledit lot. En 1923, qui est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l\u2019ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 la compagnie intim\u00e9e a achet\u00e9 ledit immeuble, son nom appara\u00eet, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, comme propri\u00e9taire, mais des b\u00e2tisses seulement.\nIl importe de faire remarquer, en plus, que sur ces diff\u00e9rents r\u00f4les d\u2019\u00e9valuation, pour chacune des ann\u00e9es que nous avons mentionn\u00e9es, le fonds et les b\u00e2tisses ne figurent pas sous le m\u00eame num\u00e9ro d\u2019ordre (C.M. art. 654, par. 1).\nLes b\u00e2tisses sont inscrites \u00e0 un num\u00e9ro d\u2019ordre qui, suivant les ann\u00e9es, varie du num\u00e9ro 196 au num\u00e9ro 231. Le fonds est inscrit \u00e0 un num\u00e9ro d\u2019ordre qui, \u00e9galement suivant les ann\u00e9es, varie du num\u00e9ro 349 au num\u00e9ro 446. En plus, dans les inscriptions relatives aux b\u00e2tisses, il n\u2019y a aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au num\u00e9ro cadastral du fonds sur lequel ces b\u00e2tisses sont construites.\nOr, le code municipal permet bien de d\u00e9signer sur le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation \u201ctoute partie d\u2019immeuble de la municipalit\u00e9, poss\u00e9d\u00e9e ou occup\u00e9e s\u00e9par\u00e9ment\u201d (art. 654, par. 2); mais il va de soi que pour d\u00e9signer correctement et l\u00e9galement au r\u00f4le un immeuble qui est poss\u00e9d\u00e9 ou occup\u00e9 s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019inscrire cet immeuble \u00e0 un seul num\u00e9ro d\u2019ordre, d\u2019indiquer son num\u00e9ro cadastral, si le cadastre est en force; puis de mentionner les nom et pr\u00e9noms de chaque propri\u00e9taire, locataire ou occupant de chaque partie de l\u2019immeuble qui est poss\u00e9d\u00e9 et occup\u00e9 s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, sans quoi le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation ne se trouve pas \u00e0 donner d\u2019une fa\u00e7on compl\u00e8te, ni surtout compr\u00e9hensible, les indications qui concernent la totalit\u00e9 de l\u2019immeuble.\nEn portant au r\u00f4le s\u00e9par\u00e9ment le fonds et les b\u00e2tisses dessus construites dans deux endroits distincts, ayant des num\u00e9ros d\u2019ordre diff\u00e9rents et \u00e9loign\u00e9s les uns des autres, et surtout sans r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 aucun num\u00e9ro cadastral dans l\u2019inscription relative aux b\u00e2tisses, la corporation appelante ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9e aux exigences du par. 2 de l\u2019art. 654, et elle a fait des entr\u00e9es irr\u00e9guli\u00e8res, qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu aux cons\u00e9quences que nous allons maintenant examiner.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019art. 673 C.M.,\nApr\u00e8s chaque mutation de propri\u00e9taire, d\u2019occupant ou de locataire d\u2019un terrain mentionn\u00e9 au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation en vigueur, le conseil local, sur demande par \u00e9crit \u00e0 cet effet, et sur preuve suffisante, doit biffer le nom de l\u2019ancien propri\u00e9taire, occupant ou locataire et y inscrire celui du nouveau. Nous avons vu que, dans sa d\u00e9claration, la demanderesseintim\u00e9e a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 au conseil municipal, mais que ce dernier aurait ill\u00e9galement omis de la porter au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation comme propri\u00e9taire du fonds et qu\u2019il aurait, sans aucun droit, laiss\u00e9 sur ledit r\u00f4le, comme propri\u00e9taire du fonds, les propri\u00e9taires originaires, en inscrivant l\u2019intim\u00e9e sur le r\u00f4le comme propri\u00e9taire des b\u00e2tisses sus-\u00e9rig\u00e9es.\nOr, comme le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, nous pensons, que l\u2019examen du r\u00f4le fait pr\u00e9sumer que cette affirmation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est exacte. Pourquoi le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, \u00e0 partir de 1920, mentionne-t-il d\u2019abord J.-V. B\u00e9langer Mining Co., Limited, et ensuite la compagnie-intim\u00e9e, comme propri\u00e9taire des b\u00e2tisses seulement? L\u2019explication sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante dans son factum est que cette inscription a d\u00fb \u00eatre faite d\u2019apr\u00e8s les renseignements fournis aux \u00e9valuateurs par des repr\u00e9sentants de la compagnie qui se trouvaient sur les lieux lors de la confection du r\u00f4le.\nCette hypoth\u00e8se n\u2019est pas vraisemblable, car si l\u2019appelante s\u2019\u00e9tait renseign\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s des repr\u00e9sentants de la compagnie-intim\u00e9e, ces derniers n\u2019auraient pas pu lui dire que la Colonial Chrome Company \u00e9tait simplement propri\u00e9taire des b\u00e2tisses, car ils n\u2019avaient aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 ne pas d\u00e9noncer totalement le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nIl r\u00e9sulte plut\u00f4t des inscriptions faites au r\u00f4le que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment aux exigences du Code Municipal.\nL\u2019appelante ajoute, dans son factum, que l\u2019on peut, dans certains cas, pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019une pr\u00e9somption existe que le propri\u00e9taire du fonds est le propri\u00e9taire des b\u00e2tisses, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune pr\u00e9somption que le propri\u00e9taire des b\u00e2tisses soit aussi le propri\u00e9taire du fonds.\nL\u2019article 414 du Code Civil dit, en effet, que\nLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du sol emporte la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du dessus et du dessous;\net l\u2019art. 415 ajoute que:\nToutes constructions, plantations ou ouvrages sur un terrain ou dans l\u2019int\u00e9rieur, sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s faits par le propri\u00e9taire, \u00e0 ses frais, et lui appartenir, si le contraire n\u2019est prouv\u00e9.\nmais c\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 raison de cette pr\u00e9somption que l\u2019appelante aurait d\u00fb indiquer pourquoi elle avait inscrit l\u2019intim\u00e9e au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, comme elle l\u2019a fait, sans en m\u00eame temps biffer les inscriptions ant\u00e9rieures, en laissant subsister les noms de Charles A. King et Lady Chapleau comme propri\u00e9taires du fonds.\nIl me semble que, dans les circonstances, il appartenait \u00e0 la corporation-appelante de se justifier d\u2019avoir fait les entr\u00e9es comme elle l\u2019a fait; et, en l\u2019absence d\u2019explications suffisantes, on peut pr\u00e9sumer que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 ses titres au conseil municipal, que, dans l\u2019application r\u00e9guli\u00e8re de l\u2019art. 673 C.M., les noms des anciens propri\u00e9taires, Charles A. King et Lady Chapleau, auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre biff\u00e9s, et que l\u2019inscription au nom de l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait pour but d\u2019indiquer qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de la totalit\u00e9 de l\u2019immeuble, fonds et b\u00e2tisses. Il s\u2019ensuivrait, ou bien que l\u2019immeuble figurait au r\u00f4le pour le tout au nom de deux propri\u00e9taires diff\u00e9rents, ou bien que l\u2019inscription aux noms de Charles A. King et Lady Chapleau \u00e9tait une inscription factice, rest\u00e9e l\u00e0 par oubli ou par omission, qui n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre l\u00e0 et qui ne pouvait servir de base \u00e0 un r\u00f4le de perception, \u00e0 une imposition de taxes et \u00e0 une vente pour taxes municipales.\nIl faut, en effet, bien consid\u00e9rer que l\u2019inscription au nom de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, tout en \u00e9tant irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re, parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019y r\u00e9f\u00e9rait pas au num\u00e9ro cadastral et parce qu\u2019elle ne figurait pas au r\u00f4le au num\u00e9ro d\u2019ordre qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb avoir (ainsi que nous l\u2019avons indiqu\u00e9 plus haut), \u00e9tait, en soi, suffisamment compr\u00e9hensive pour faire croire qu\u2019elle comportait la totalit\u00e9 de l\u2019immeuble. Elle \u00e9tait faite de telle fa\u00e7on que, \u00e0 l\u2019examen du r\u00f4le, l\u2019intim\u00e9e pouvait raisonnablement croire qu\u2019elle indiquait l\u2019immeuble tout entier. Il est vrai que chaque b\u00e2tisse y est mentionn\u00e9e nomm\u00e9ment; mais cela s\u2019expliquait par le fait que certaines b\u00e2tisses \u00e9taient non-imposables, une autre appartenait \u00e0 un monsieur Gagn\u00e9 (qui \u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9e s\u00e9par\u00e9ment); et il devenait donc n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9rer les b\u00e2tisses \u00e0 raison desquelles l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait appel\u00e9e \u00e0 payer taxes. Au surplus, l\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9ration de toutes les constructions sur le terrain, imposables et non imposables, contribuait davantage \u00e0 donner \u00e0 cette inscription sur le r\u00f4le le caract\u00e8re d\u2019une entr\u00e9e qui couvrait la totalit\u00e9 de l\u2019immeuble.\nEt cela r\u00e9pond \u00e0 l\u2019objection de l\u2019appelante qu\u2019il appartenait \u00e0 la compagnie intim\u00e9e de surveiller le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation afin de constater si son nom \u00e9tait bien inscrit comme propri\u00e9taire. A la vue du r\u00f4le et de l\u2019entr\u00e9e qui la concernait, l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait justifiable de croire que l\u2019immeuble tout entier \u00e9tait port\u00e9 \u00e0 son nom et n\u2019\u00e9tait pas appel\u00e9e \u00e0 aller v\u00e9rifier si, dans un autre endroit du r\u00f4le et \u00e0 un num\u00e9ro d\u2019ordre compl\u00e8tement diff\u00e9rent, le conseil municipal n\u2019avait pas, par hasard, laiss\u00e9 subsister l\u2019ancienne entr\u00e9e au nom des anciens propri\u00e9taires.\nEn plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9e recevait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement, chaque ann\u00e9e, ses comptes de taxes municipales et scolaires se rapportant \u00e0 cet immeuble; et, chaque ann\u00e9e, elle acquittait les taxes qui lui \u00e9taient r\u00e9clam\u00e9es. Comment pouvait-elle supposer que, dans l\u2019esprit du conseil municipal, elle n\u2019\u00e9tait port\u00e9e au r\u00f4le que comme propri\u00e9taire des b\u00e2tisses, lorsque la vue du r\u00f4le lui-m\u00eame devait raisonnablement lui faire croire le contraire?\nL\u2019appelante veut pr\u00e9tendre que les comptes qu\u2019elle adressait \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne comportaient que les taxes pour les b\u00e2tisses. Aucun compte ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la vente pour taxes n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit. Le seul qui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni en preuve est celui qui \u00e9tait contenu dans la lettre du 9 octobre 1926. Cette lettre est post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la vente. Elle ne prouve rien \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette derni\u00e8re, ni quant aux faits qui affectent cette cause. En plus, le compte qui y est contenu est, pour le moins, aussi ambigu que le r\u00f4le lui-m\u00eame; et, mis en regard de l\u2019inscription au r\u00f4le, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas susceptible d\u2019apporter \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e une information diff\u00e9rente de celle que le r\u00f4le lui donnait, et ne voulait pas dire n\u00e9cessairement que les taxes r\u00e9clam\u00e9es se rapportaient uniquement aux b\u00e2tisses, \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion du fonds sur lequel elles \u00e9taient \u00e9rig\u00e9es. Comme nous l\u2019avons dit, il appert au r\u00f4le de perception que remplacement du moulin proprement dit \u00e9tait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 non imposable. Il appert aussi qu\u2019il y avait sur le lot n\u00b0 19 une maison appartenant \u00e0 un M. Oram Gagn\u00e9. Comment indiquer, dans les comptes adress\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, que le moulin n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tax\u00e9 et que le compte n\u2019incluait pas non plus les taxes pour la maison Oram Gagn\u00e9, sinon en d\u00e9crivant les divers emplacements tax\u00e9s par la d\u00e9signation des b\u00e2tisses sus \u00e9rig\u00e9es? L\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait donc parfaitement justifiable de croire que les comptes de taxes qu\u2019elle recevait comprenaient, non seulement les taxes pour les. b\u00e2tisses, mais aussi pour le fonds sur lequel ces b\u00e2tisses \u00e9taient situ\u00e9es. En vue de tout ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, il ne nous para\u00eet pas que l\u2019intim\u00e9e puisse \u00eatre bl\u00e2m\u00e9e et puisse souffrir de ne pas s\u2019\u00eatre plainte du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation tel qu\u2019il \u00e9tait fait.\nIl se peut cependant que la seule raison des irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s fonci\u00e8res que nous constatons au r\u00f4le n\u2019e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisante en soi pour faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la vente pour taxes et qu\u2019elle e\u00fbt plut\u00f4t donn\u00e9 un recours en dommages contre la corporation municipale appelante.\nNous ne croyons pas qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire de nous prononcer sur ce point dans la cause actuelle, qui est avant tout une cause d\u2019esp\u00e8ce; et nous pr\u00e9f\u00e9rons r\u00e9server notre opinion sur cette question, car nous croyons que la vente doit \u00eatre mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9 pour le motif qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu \u00e0 la fois par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et par la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi et qu\u2019il nous reste \u00e0 exposer. Nous nous sommes expliqu\u00e9s longuement sur toutes ces questions concernant la confection du r\u00f4le, pour bien d\u00e9montrer que, \u00e0 notre avis, le conseil local de la corporation appelante doit \u00eatre tenu pour avoir eu connaissance de tous les faits relatifs au titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019immeuble dont il s\u2019agit.\nCe qui est d\u00e9cisif, c\u2019est que le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation faisait, au moins, voir que la totalit\u00e9 de l\u2019immeuble qui a fait l\u2019objet de la vente municipale pour taxes \u00e9tait poss\u00e9d\u00e9e, \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taires, \u00e0 la fois par Charles A. King et Lady Chapleau d\u2019une part, et par Colonial Chrome Co., Ltd., d\u2019autre part.\nEn pr\u00e9parant, au mois de novembre, l\u2019\u00e9tat mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 726 du Code municipal, le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier de la corporation appelante devait indiquer\nles noms et \u00e9tats de toutes personnes endett\u00e9es envers la corporation pour taxes municipales, tels qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9s au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, s\u2019ils y sont entr\u00e9s;\net, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019art. 729, le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier de la corporation de comt\u00e9 devait pr\u00e9parer, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cet \u00e9tat qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis par le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier local, et devait publier, par avis suivant les formalit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues au Code municipal, la liste des immeubles qui devaient \u00eatre vendus \u00e0 l\u2019ench\u00e8re publique pour les taxes auxquelles ils \u00e9taient affect\u00e9s. Cette liste devait indiquer\nla d\u00e9signation de tous les immeubles situ\u00e9s dans la municipalit\u00e9 du comt\u00e9 et affect\u00e9s au paiement de taxes municipales ou scolaires dues, avec les noms des propri\u00e9taires, tels qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9s au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation. L\u2019avis de vente et de publication d\u00e9montre que l\u2019immeuble en litige a \u00e9t\u00e9 annonc\u00e9 en vente comme suit:\u2014\nMunicipalit\u00e9\npar de of\nCanton\nColerain\nPropri\u00e9taires\nChas.A. King\nLady Chapleau\nRang\n10\nLot\n1\/2 S.E. 19\nEtendue\n360\nTaxes\n$96.90\nL\u2019acte d\u2019adjudication\nc\u00e8de, transporte et vend * * * ce certain lot de terre situ\u00e9 dans le canton de Coleraine dans le comt\u00e9 de M\u00e9gantic, connu et d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme la moiti\u00e9 sud-est du lot n\u00b0 19 du 10e rang du canton de Coleraine, contenant 360 acres, plus ou moins.\nL\u2019appelante a donc annonc\u00e9 en vente, et a vendu, le lot tout entier, sans aucune indication \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les b\u00e2tisses dessus construites \u00e9taient exclues de la vente.\nOr, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le sous-paragraphe 28 de l\u2019art. 16 du Code Municipal,\nle mot \u201clot\u201d d\u00e9signe tout terrain situ\u00e9 dans un rang * * * avec (les) b\u00e2timents et autres am\u00e9liorations.\nCet article est d\u2019ailleurs conforme aux principes du Code Civil en vertu desquels\nLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du sol emporte la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du dessus et du dessous et\nToutes contractions, plantations et ouvrages sur un terrain ou dans l\u2019int\u00e9rieur sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s faits par le propri\u00e9taire, \u00e0 ses frais, et lui appartenir, si le contraire n\u2019est prouv\u00e9\ntel que le comportent les articles 414 et 415, auxquels nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9.\nIl est clair, par cons\u00e9quent, que, pour effectuer l\u00e9galement une vente pour taxes de l\u2019immeuble dont il s\u2019agit, et pour d\u00e9signer cet immeuble, depuis les proc\u00e9dures initiales de la vente jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019adjudication, conform\u00e9ment aux exigences du Code Municipal, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire en le d\u00e9signant \u201ctel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation\u201d, il \u00e9tait essentiel, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, de pr\u00e9ciser que le fonds seul du lot devait faire l\u2019objet de la vente et que les b\u00e2tisses en seraient exclues. C\u2019\u00e9tait la seule fa\u00e7on de se conformer aux inscriptions du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, en les interpr\u00e9tant de la fa\u00e7on la plus favorable \u00e0 la corporation appelante. En annon\u00e7ant et en vendant le lot d\u2019apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9finition m\u00eame qui en est donn\u00e9e dans le Code municipal, on a annonc\u00e9 et on a vendu \u00e9galement les b\u00e2tisses qui s\u2019y trouvaient construites et qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le r\u00f4le, appartenaient \u00e0 la compagnie intim\u00e9e. On a donc annonc\u00e9 et vendu comme un seul tout un immeuble qui comprenait des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s port\u00e9es au r\u00f4le lui-m\u00eame aux noms de personnes qui n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9es nulle part dans aucune des proc\u00e9dures ou des actes relatifs \u00e0 cette vente; et, ce qui est plus grave, des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s appartenant \u00e0 des personnes qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas \u201cendett\u00e9es envers la corporation pour taxes municipales\u201d (C.M. arts. 726, par. 1, 727, 728 et 729), et alors que, au contraire, toutes les taxes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es. Nous sommes d\u2019accord avec la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi pour dire qu\u2019une pareille vente est nulle ab initio, d\u2019une nullit\u00e9 radicale et absolue. Il y avait donc lieu, sur ce point, de maintenir l\u2019action de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en d\u00e9claration de nullit\u00e9.\nTroisi\u00e8me question:\u2014L\u2019action \u00e9tait-elle prescrite aux termes de Tart. 747 C.M.?\nCet article se lit comme suit:\nL\u2019action pour faire annuler une vente d\u2019immeubles faite en vertu des dispositions du pr\u00e9sent chapitre, ou le droit d\u2019en invoquer l\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9, se prescrit par deux ans \u00e0 compter de la date de l\u2019adjudication.\nLe Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, ainsi que la Cour du Banc du Roi, ont, toutes deux, r\u00e9pondu dans la n\u00e9gative; et nous sommes d\u2019avis qu\u2019elles ont eu raison.\nL\u2019article parle des actions \u201cpour faire annuler une vente\u201d, ou du \u201cdroit d\u2019en invoquer l\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9\u201d. Il ne s\u2019agit pas ici d une simple ill\u00e9galit\u00e9, non plus que d\u2019une action pour faire annuler la vente. Comme nous l\u2019avons dit plus haut, nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une vente absolument nulle, et nulle ab initio, parce que, depuis le commencement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin, les conditions ne se sont jamais rencontr\u00e9es pour que l\u2019immeuble tel qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu puisse faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une vente municipale pour taxes. L\u2019appelante a vendu comme incorpor\u00e9e \u00e0 un tout indivis une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui appartenait \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e telle qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9e au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation et qui ne devait aucune taxe. Cette vente n\u2019\u00e9tait pas seulement annulable; elle \u00e9tait, l\u00e9galement parlant, inexistante; et la Cour n\u2019avait pas besoin de l\u2019annuler; elle n\u2019avait qu\u2019\u00e0 en constater la nullit\u00e9, et \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer cette nullit\u00e9.\nEn arrivant \u00e0 cette conclusion, nous nous conformons \u00e0 une ancienne jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, qui ne semble pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9savou\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent. Dans une cause de Lovell v. Leavitt[2], la Cour du Banc du Roi, en 1893, interpr\u00e9tant cet article 747, s\u2019exprime comme suit dans deux des consid\u00e9rants de son jugement:\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant que d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019art. 1591 C.C., les r\u00e8gles applicables aux ventes forc\u00e9es, en vertu des dispositions du code municipal sont celles applicables g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement au contrat de vente, et qu\u2019en vertu de l\u2019art. 1487 CO., une vente faite super non domino et non possidente est absolument nulle;\nConsid\u00e9rant qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence la vente invoqu\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pu lui conf\u00e9rer, non plus qu\u2019\u00e0 ses auteurs, aucun droit sur le terrain revendiqu\u00e9, et que la prescription de l\u2019art. 1015 du code municipal ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e pour couvrir ladite nullit\u00e9;\nMaintient l\u2019appel * * *\nIl n\u2019est pas sans \u00e0 propos de rapporter ici les remarques de monsieur le juge Blanchet dans cette cause:\nMais l\u2019intim\u00e9 invoque un autre moyen : Il pr\u00e9tend que la vente municipale est une vente publique, notifi\u00e9e au r\u00e9gistrateur du comt\u00e9, qui l\u2019enregistre; que Davis et ses ayants cause n\u2019ayant pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de retraire ou de racheter le lot en question dans le d\u00e9lai de deux ans fix\u00e9 par l\u2019article 1008, l\u2019acte de vente qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti par la corporation du comt\u00e9 de Compton lui a transf\u00e9r\u00e9, comme cessionnaire de l\u2019adjudicataire, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 absolue de ce quart de lot, et que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 1015, l\u2019action pour faire annuler une semblable vente ou le droit d\u2019en invoquer l\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 se prescrivant par deux ans, \u00e0 compter de la date de l\u2019adjudication, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a plus le droit, ce d\u00e9lai expir\u00e9, de demander, ainsi qu\u2019il le fait, la nullit\u00e9 de la vente en question.\nIl s\u2019agit, comme on le voit, de d\u00e9terminer quel est l\u2019effet ou l\u2019\u00e9tendue de cette disposition exorbitante du droit commun et qui, par cons\u00e9quent, doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e strictement.\nLes termes de cet article: l\u2019action pour faire annuler la vente ou le droit d\u2019en invoquer l\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9, sont-ils suffisamment clairs pour autoriser les tribunaux \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer qu\u2019ils couvrent non seulement les irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s et les informalit\u00e9s qui peuvent se rencontrer dans les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s des conseils relativement \u00e0 ces ventes, mais m\u00eame les nullit\u00e9s absolues r\u00e9sultant de l\u2019omission des formalit\u00e9s requises lorsqu\u2019il doit n\u00e9cessairement en r\u00e9sulter de graves injustices.\nNe serait-ce pas faire dire \u00e0 la loi, contrairement aux principes \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires de saine l\u00e9gislation, qu\u2019elle a voulu encourager par une protection sp\u00e9ciale, l\u2019inobservation de ses dispositions? Une semblable interpr\u00e9tation ne nous para\u00eet pas autoris\u00e9e par le texte m\u00eame de cet article. Elle serait contraire non seulement aux r\u00e8gles ordinaires du code civil et du code de proc\u00e9dure, mais \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des dispositions du code municipal lui-m\u00eame qui d\u00e9clare, \u00e0 l\u2019art. 16, que des objections \u00e0 la forme peuvent \u00eatre admises, si une injustice r\u00e9elle doit r\u00e9sulter de leur rejet, et que l\u2019omission de formalit\u00e9s, m\u00eames imp\u00e9ratives, donne lieu, dans le m\u00eame cas, \u00e0 la m\u00eame exception qu\u2019aurait celui qui invoquerait une nullit\u00e9 formellement prononc\u00e9e par le code.\nDans le cas actuel, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une injustice qui, si elle \u00e9tait consacr\u00e9e, permettrait \u00e0 un d\u00e9biteur r\u00e9calcitrant ou malhonn\u00eate de payer ses dettes avec le bien d\u2019autrui et un propri\u00e9taire se verrait ainsi d\u00e9pouill\u00e9 de ses droits en vertu de proc\u00e9d\u00e9s sommaires non autoris\u00e9s par la loi. En pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un texte qui est loin d\u2019\u00eatre explicite, nous pr\u00e9f\u00e9rons lui donner une interpr\u00e9tation restreinte et conforme \u00e0 l\u2019esprit g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de notre droit sur des sujets analogues.\nNous n\u2019avons gu\u00e8re d\u2019h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 en arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, car les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s du conseil de Clifton, quant \u00e0 la confection des r\u00f4les de perception relativement aux taxes r\u00e9clam\u00e9es de Davis, sont tellement irr\u00e9guliers qu\u2019il est possible de pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019il n\u2019ont jamais eu d\u2019existence l\u00e9gale et l\u2019adjudicataire du terrain r\u00e9clam\u00e9 qui n\u2019a jamais tent\u00e9 de se mettre en possession, ne para\u00eet pas m\u00eame avoir pay\u00e9 les taxes dues depuis la vente avant d\u2019obtenir son titre d\u00e9finitif, ces taxes ayant toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es depuis par l\u2019appelant sans prot\u00eat de la part de la corporation de Clifton.\nNous sommes d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel doit, en cons\u00e9quence, \u00eatre maintenu et l\u2019action de l\u2019intim\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e.\nDeux autres jugements dans le m\u00eame sens sont cit\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9e: Bartley v. Boon[3] et Coady v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[4].\nLes deux premi\u00e8res d\u00e9cisions sont bien ant\u00e9rieures au nouveau code municipal qui est devenu en force en 1916. Il n\u2019est pas \u00e0 pr\u00e9sumer que les commissaires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9s de la r\u00e9daction de ce code ignoraient alors cette ancienne jurisprudence, et s\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de changer le texte de l\u2019art. 747 qui correspond \u00e0 l\u2019ancien art. 1015, c\u2019est qu\u2019ils en sont venus \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation jusqu\u2019alors donn\u00e9e par nos tribunaux \u00e9tait conforme \u00e0 l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur. A ce sujet, nous ne saurions mieux faire que de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux remarques de monsieur le juge Rinfret dans la cause de la Corporation du village de la Malbaie v. Bouliane[5].\nPour toutes ces raisons, je suis encore d\u2019avis que ce troisi\u00e8me moyen invoqu\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9.\nJe renverrais donc l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Louis Morin.\nSolicitors for the respondent: R\u00e9millard & Boisvert.\n[1] [1932] Q.R. 52 K.B. 458.\n[2] [1893] Q.R. 2 Q.B. 324\n[3] [1874] 1 Q.L.R. 33.\n[4] [1915] 22 R.L. n.S. 67.\n[5] [1932] S.C.R. 389.\n",

Each appellant appealed to the Minister of Immigration and Colonization, and also, before the Minister\u2019s decision, applied for discharge from custody under the Liberty of the Subject Act, R.S.N.S., 1923, c. 231, and obtained ex parte an order nisi in the nature of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid. To this order the Board made its return. Carroll J. refused the applications (5 M.P.R. 151), his decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc (ibid), and appellants appealed to this Court.\nHeld: Appellants were entitled to apply to the court. Broadly speaking, every alien who has been admitted into and is actually in Canada and who has been taken into custody on a charge for which he may be deported, is entitled to the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus to test in court if his detention is according to law.\nAppellants\u2019 detention was authorized under the Immigration Act, and their applications for release were rightly dismissed.\nThe complaint was sufficient, notwithstanding that it did not state the date when, or the particular place where, the acts charged had been committed. All that is necessary is that it makes known with reasonable certainty to the person against whom the investigation is directed his alleged conduct, in violation of the Act, to which objection is taken. (Samejima v. The King, [1932] Can. S.C.R. 640, distinguished). There is no analogy between a complaint under the Immigration Act and an indictment on a criminal charge (The King v. Jeu Jang How, 59 Can. S.C.R. 175, Immigration Act, ss. 33 (2), 42 (2), referred to). Moreover, the objection of insufficiency in the complaint was not open to appellants because (1) they did not challenge the return, which stated that the case was considered by a Board of Enquiry constituted under the provisions of the Immigration Act, and, under English law, the facts stated in a return to a writ of habeas corpus or order in lieu thereof are taken to be true until impeached; and (2) in the proceedings before Carroll J. and the Court en banc they did not question the regularity or sufficiency of the complaint or the warrant; and, before this Court, they stated they were not impeaching the validity of the warrant.\nAfter the Board\u2019s decision, and pending the Minister\u2019s decision on the appeals to him, the appellants were lawfully detained under s. 21 of the Immigration Act.\nThe, court was not entitled to examine the evidence as to its sufficiency to justify the Board\u2019s decision (McKenzie v. Huybers, [1929] Can. S.C.R. 38; Samejima v. The King, [1932] Can. S.C.R. 640, referred to).\nAPPEALS (consolidated) from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1] dismissing the present appellants\u2019 appeals from the judgment of Carroll J.1 refusing the appellants\u2019 applications, on the return of an order nisi in the nature of habeas corpus under the provisions of the Liberty of the Subject Act, R.S.N.S., 1923, c. 231, to discharge them from custody. They were kept in custody under the provisions of the Immigration Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 93. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeals to this Court were dismissed.\nL. A. Ryan and M. Garber for the appellants.\nC. B. Smith K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014This is an appeal by Stefan Worozcyt and seven others from the judgment of the court en banc of Nova Scotia1 affirming the judgment of Mr. Justice Carroll1 who refused the appellants\u2019 application for their discharge from custody. The facts briefly are as follows:\u2014\nEach of the appellants was taken into custody by virtue of a warrant or order issued by the Deputy Minister of Immigration and Colonization under the provisions of section 42 of the Immigration Act (R.S.C., 1927, ch. 93) pursuant to a complaint by the Commissioner of Immigration. The complaint in the case of Stefan Worozcyt reads as follows:\u2014\nTo the Minister of Immigration and Colonization.\nComplaint is hereby made under Section 41 of the Immigration Act and Regulations that Steve Worozcyt, Montreal, is a person other than a Canadian citizen, who advocates in Canada the overthrow by force or violence of the Government of Canada, the overthrow by force or violence of constituted law and authority and by word or act creates or attempts to create riot or public disorder in Canada.\nSgd. A. L. Joliffe,\nCommissioner of Immigration.\nThe complaint in the case of each of the other appellants was to the same effect.\nThe warrant described the offence practically in the terms of the complaint and directed that the person charged therein \u201cbe taken into custody and detained for examination and an investigation of the facts alleged in\u201d the complaint. The examination was to be made by a Board of Inquiry or officer acting as such.\nOn arrest each appellant was conveyed to the immigration station at Halifax and there brought before a Board of Inquiry and informed of the complaint against him. He was given the opportunity of having counsel and three of them in fact had counsel at the hearing. Each was separately examined by the Board of Inquiry as to the charges alleged in the complaint and each was found guilty of the acts therein stated, and a resolution for his deportation was passed. After the resolution had been carried the Chairman of the Board stated to each of the appellants that he had a right to appeal from the decision of the Board to the Minister of Immigration and Colonization. They all appealed and the appeals are still pending before the Minister. Section 20 of the Act provides that notice of appeal shall act as a stay of all proceedings until a final decision is rendered by the Minister.\nInstead of waiting for the decision of the Minister, each of the appellants made an application to Mr. Justice Carrol in Chambers for his discharge from custody under and by virtue of the provisions of the Liberty of the Subject Act (R.S.N.S., 1923, ch. 231), and obtained ex parte an order nisi in the nature of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid. The order in the Worozcyt case directed that the Board of Inquiry \u201cdo have before me or such other Judge of the Supreme Court as may be presiding in chambers at the County Court House, Spring Garden Road in the City of Halifax, on Monday, the 16th day of May, A.D. 1932, at the hour of 11 o\u2019clock * * *.\u201d (a) the body of Stefan Worozcyt with the cause of his detention;\n(b) the warrant of the Deputy Minister, and\n(c) the depositions, minutes of evidence, minutes of proceedings and all such other orders and proceedings had and taken before the Board of Inquiry respecting the detention of said Stefan Worozcyt.\nTo this order the Board certified a return which, inter alia, set out:\u2014\n2. That the applicant is now detained in custody by virtue of the warrant or order of the Deputy Minister of Immigration and Colonization under the provisions of the Immigration Act.\n3. That Exhibit \u201cA\u201d is a true copy of the said warrant or order.\n4. That Exhibit \u201cB\u201d is a true copy of the complaint upon which the warrant or order was granted.\n5. That on May 2nd, 1932, the case of the said applicant was considered by a Board of Inquiry constituted under the provisions of the said Immigration Act, and that Exhibit \u201cC\u201d is a copy of the record of the proceedings and the decision of the Board.\n6. That the said applicant has appealed from the said decision of the Board to the Minister under the provisions of section 19 of the said Act, and the Minister has not yet rendered decision in the said appeal.\n7. Pending the decision of the Minister the said applicant is kept in custody at the Immigration Station at Halifax aforesaid under the provisions of section 21 of the said Act.\nOn perusing the return made by the Board, Mr. Justice Carroll dismissed the application of each of the appellants and his decision was unanimously affirmed by the court en banc. The appellants now appeal to this court.\nAlthough the applications were made by the appellants individually, they have been consolidated and this appeal includes them all.\nThat the appellants were acting within their rights in making their applications to the court is, I think, not open to dispute. Broadly speaking, every alien, who has been admitted into and is actually in Canada and who has been taken into custody on a charge for which he may be deported, is entitled to the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus to test in court if his detention is according to law. If it is not, the applicant may be released. If, however, his detention is authorized by law his application must be refused.\nIt is generally considered that by the law of nations the supreme power in every state has the right to make laws for the exclusion and expulsion of aliens and to provide the machinery by which these laws can be effectively enforced. In the distribution of legislative powers between the Dominion and the provinces made by the B.N.A. Act, 1867, the exclusive legislative jurisdiction over \u201cnaturalization and aliens\u201d was given to the Dominion (section 91 (25)). In the exercise of the power thus given Parliament passed the Immigration Act. The question, therefore, in this appeal, is whether the Immigration Act authorizes the detention of the appellants.\nSection 41 of the Act provides that any person guilty of the acts therein described (among which are those alleged against the appellants in the complaints) shall, for the purposes of the Act, be considered and classed as an undesirable immigrant, and that it is the duty of every officer becoming cognizant thereof, and the duty of the officials of the municipality wherein such person may be, to forthwith send a written complaint thereof to the Minister, giving full particulars. Then section 42 provides:\u2014\n42. Upon receiving a complaint from any officer, or from any clerk or secretary or other official of a municipality against any person alleged to belong to any prohibited or undesirable class, the Minister or the Deputy Minister may order such person to be taken into custody and detained at an immigrant station for examination and an investigation of the facts alleged in the said complaint to be made by a Board of Inquiry or by an officer acting as such.\n* * * * *\n3. If upon investigation of the facts such Board of Inquiry or examining officer is satisfied that such person belongs to any of the prohibited or undesirable classes mentioned in the two last preceding sections of this Act, such person shall be deported forthwith, subject, however, to such right of appeal as he may have to the Minister.\nUp to the decision of the Board of Inquiry there can be no question that the appellants were properly detained under the warrant of the Deputy Minister provided the conditions precedent called for by the Act had been complied with. The only grounds upon which the appellants challenge the judgments below are:\n1. That the complaint was bad in that it did not set out full particulars of the offences alleged, that is to say it did not state the date when, and the place where, the appellant had been guilty of the acts charged in the complaint, and\n2. That the evidence did not warrant the findings of the Board.\nThe first of the above grounds is really not open to the appellants, because,\n1. They do not challenge the return, which states that the case was considered by a Board of Inquiry constituted under the provisions of the Immigration Act, and, under English law, the facts stated in a return to a writ of habeas corpus or order in lieu thereof, will be taken to be true until impeached. Short & Mellor\u2019s Practice of the Crown Office, 2nd ed., page 326.\n2. In all the proceedings before Mr. Justice Carroll and the court en banc, they did not question the regularity or sufficiency of the complaint or the warrant of the Deputy Minister, and, even on the opening of the argument before us, the leading counsel for the appellants stated that he was not impeaching the validity of the warrant. If the warrant is valid so also must be the complaint upon which it is founded.\nAssuming, however, that the objection had been taken before Mr. Justice Carroll and was still open to the appellants, it cannot, in my opinion, prevail. A perusal of section 41 shews that the particulars called for by that section can only be those in the possession of the officer or official making the complaint. The Act does not call for an investigation by the officer or official to ascertain the particular place where, or the particular time when, the act alleged against the immigrant was committed. These particulars are within the knowledge of the immigrant himself. The very fact that the appellants did not challenge the complaint until now shews that they understood it and did not consider they were prejudiced through lack of particulars. In fact, until near the close of the argument before us, the appellants\u2019 objection to the complaint was not that it contained insufficient particulars but that it contained a multiplicity of charges\u2014a contention subsequently withdrawn.\nAll that is necessary, in the complaint, in my opinion, is that the allegation shall make known with reasonable certainty to the person against whom the investigation is directed, the conduct on his part, in violation of the Act, to which objection is taken. There is no analogy between a complaint under the Immigration Act and an indictment on a criminal charge. The King v. Jeu Jang How[2]. In the latter case the Crown cannot compel the accused to go into the witness box and answer all questions put to him, while, under the Immigration Act, the immigrant is detained \u201cfor examination and an investigation\u201d into the facts alleged, and he must answer the questions put to him. (Section 33 (2) and section 42 (2).) The object of making provision for a Board of Inquiry is to have at hand a tribunal which can without delay inquire into the truth of the allegations made in the complaint. In many cases the immigrant himself must necessarily be the chief witness.\nIt was argued that the complaint in this case brought it within the principle of Samejima v. The King[3]. In my opinion there is no similarity whatever: in the Samejima case3 the complaint was that Samejima \u201cwas in Canada contrary to the provisions of the Immigration Act, and had effected entrance contrary to the provisions of section 33, subsection (7) of the said Act.\u201d Such a complaint did not inform the immigrant of the charge made against him and which he had to meet; while in the case before us the complaint sets out in clear and unambiguous language, in fact in the very words of the statute, the acts charged against these appellants. This ground of appeal therefore fails.\nThe complaint and other proceedings up to the time the Board gave its decision being valid, there was statutory authority for detaining the appellants under the warrant of the Deputy Minister. After the Board gave its decision the appellants appealed to the Minister. That brought section 21 into play. It reads:\u2014\n21. Pending the decision of the Minister, the appellant and those dependent upon him shall be kept in custody at an immigrant station, unless released under bond as hereinafter provided. As the Minister has not yet given his decision the appellants are lawfully detained, as the return states, by virtue of this section. Their applications for release were, therefore, rightly dismissed.\nThe second ground of appeal\u2014that the evidence does not warrant the finding of the Board, must also, in my opinion, be determined against the appellants.\nAs a general rule in habeas corpus matters we are not entitled to look at the evidence to see if it is sufficient to justify the decision arrived at. In McKenzie v. Huybers[4], the appellants were imprisoned under the Collection Act, R.S.N.S., 1923, c. 232, for fraudulently contracting a debt which formed the subject of a judgment in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, they \u201cintending at the time of the contracting of said debt not to pay the same.\u201d The appellants made an application to Mr. Justice Mellish for discharge from custody. He refused their application. There was then an appeal to the court en banc and, by special leave, to this court. In giving the judgment of this court, Anglin, C.J., said:\u2014\nThe evidence cannot be gone into for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was anything in it to warrant the finding of fraud.\nSee also Samejima v. The King[5].\nMoreover, the appellants having appealed from the decision of the Board of Inquiry to the Minister, the sufficiency of the evidence is a matter with which the Minister can deal in the appeal but unless he reverses the finding of the Board its decision is final.\nThe appeal must therefore be dismissed.\nAppeals dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellants: L. A. Ryan.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C. B. Smith.\n[1] (1932) 5 M.P.R. 151.\n1 (1932) 5 M.P.R. 151.\n1 (1932) 5 M.P.R. 151.\n1 (1932) 5 M.P.R. 151.\n[2] (1919) 59 Can. S.C.R. 175.\n[3] [1932] Can.

(Plaintiff) Respondent\n1932: November 2; 1932: November 28.\nPresent: Rinfret, Lamont, Smith, Cannon and Crockett JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nAppeal\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Judgment by appellate court quashing appeal for failure to give security\u2014Matter in controversy\u2014Supreme Court Act, section 39.\nThe appellant, having appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court and having apparently failed to give security within the delays prescribed by the code, the respondent obtained a certificate of default from the prothonotary and moved the appellate court to have the appeal declared abandoned. The appellate court granted the motion and from that judgment the appellant appealed to this court.\nHeld that there is no jurisdiction in this court to entertain the appeal. \u2014In appeals from judgments upon demurrers or from judgments dismissing actions upon points of law, the title to the relief claimed is in controversy. Here, the only question involved is the regularity of the particular proceedings in appeal. Gatineau Power Co. v. Cross [1929] Can. S.C.R. 35 followed.\nMOTION to quash for want of jurisdiction an appeal from a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, quashing an appeal to that court for failure by the appellant to give security.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion, K.C., for the motion.\nGustave Mouette, K.C., contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014Under the Code of Civil Procedure of the province of Quebec, proceedings in appeal must be brought within thirty days from the date of the judgment of first instance. They are brought by means of an inscription filed in the office of the court which rendered the judgment and, within prescribed delays, the appellant must give good and sufficient security that he will effectually prosecute the appeal and that he will satisfy the condemnation and pay all costs and damages adjudged in case the judgment appealed from is confirmed. (Arts. 1209, 1213 and 1214, C.C.P.)\nIf security be not given within the prescribed delays, the opposite party may obtain from the prothonotary a certificate of default and the inscription in appeal is thereupon held to be abandoned and of no effect, saving any recourse which may appertain to the appealing party (Art. 1213, C.C.P.)\nIn this case, the appellant, having appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in the city of Quebec, apparently failed to give security within the delays, the respondent obtained a certificate of default from the prothonotary and moved the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side) to have the appeal declared abandoned. Whereupon that court rendered the following judgment:\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant que le cautionnement requis par l\u2019article 1214 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, sur le pr\u00e9sent appel, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni dans les d\u00e9lais prescrits par l\u2019article 1213 dudit code;\nConsid\u00e9rant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a obtenu du protonotaire de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, un certificat constatant le d\u00e9faut de l\u2019appelant de fournir tel cautionnement;\nConsid\u00e9rant que le pr\u00e9sent appel est ainsi d\u00e9sert\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019obtention du dit certificat;\nLa dite inscription en appel est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e d\u00e9sert\u00e9e et la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour rejet d\u2019appel, est accord\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nThe appeal to this Court is from the above judgment and the respondent moves to quash for want of jurisdiction on the ground, amongst others, that there is no amount involved in the appeal and that special leave was not obtained.\nFor the purposes of appeal to this Court, \u201cthe amount or value of the matter in controversy\u201d depends, not on what is claimed in the action, but on what may be contested in the proposed appeal (Dreifus v. Royds[1]; Jack v. Cranston)[2].\nThe only matter in controversy in this appeal is whether the Court of Appeal rightly decided that the appellant\u2019s proceedings should be held to have been abandoned, in view of the special provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nThe question whether there exists jurisdiction in this Court to entertain an appeal of that kind is concluded by our decision in Gatineau Power Co. v. Cross[3]. In fact the situation there was even more favourable to the appellant than it is here. In the Gatineau Power case3, the matter in controversy was the right of appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, and it was decided that \u201csuch right was not appreciable in money.\u201d In the present appeal, the only point involved is the regularity of the appellant\u2019s particular proceedings before the Court of King\u2019s Bench. His right of appeal is not in question. If he was still within the delays, he might yet have filed a new inscription, as, under art. 1213, the proceedings are held abandoned, \u201csaving any recourse which may appertain to the appealing party\u201d.\nIf, in the premises, the appellant is deprived of the means to effectively prosecute his appeal, it is not the direct result of the judgment appealed from, but only the collateral or consequential effect of that judgment in the special circumstances (Bulger v. Home Insurance Co.)[4].\nThe present appeal, contrary to what the appellant urged before us, cannot be assimilated to appeals from judgments upon demurrers or from judgments dismissing actions upon a plea of prescription or upon other points of law. That question was discussed in Davis v. Royal Trust[5], where reference was made to Ville de St. Jean v. Molleur[6] and to Dominion Textile Co. v. Skaife[7]. In appeals of that character the right of action is involved; the matter in controversy is the title to the relief claimed. Judgments upon these matters, to borrow the expression of Lord Watson (Dech\u00eane v. City of Montreal)[8], have \u201creference to the title or want of title in the plaintiff to institute and maintain\u201d his suit. So that the amount or value involved in such appeals is the amount or value of the title to the claim itself. Here, the utmost relief which the appellant can obtain on the appeal is merely the right to have the Court of King\u2019s Bench entertain his particular proceedings before that court. The original claim of the appellant is not before us for judicial determination.\nThe motion of the respondent should be allowed and the appeal quashed with costs.\nMotion granted with costs.\n[1] (1922) 64 Can.

The provision in s. 157 of the Alberta School Act, 1981, that, except in the month of June, no notice terminating a teacher's engagement should be given by a school board without the approval of an inspector previously obtained, which provision was first introduced into the school law by said Act (1931, c. 32), which replaced the former Act (R.S.A., 1922, c. 51), was held to apply in regard to the termination (after said Act of 1931 came into force) of an agreement of engagement entered into prior to the enactment of said provision.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Alta., [1932] 1 W.W.R. 849, [1932] 3 D.L.R. 262, affirming judgment of Ewing J., [1932] 1 W.W.R. 315, affirmed.\nRinfret J. dissented.\nAPPEAL by the defendant (by leave given by the Appellate Division, Alta.) from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], dismissing its appeal from the judgment of Ewing J. [2], answering in favour of the plaintiff the questions submitted in a special case stated for the opinion of the court, pursuant to Rule 114 of the Alberta Rules of Court.\nThe defendant Board and the plaintiff entered into an agreement dated June 28, 1929, whereby the Board agreed to employ the plaintiff as teacher from and after September 3, 1929. Clause 6 of the agreement provided:\n6. This agreement shall continue in force from year to year, unless it is terminated as hereinafter provided, or unless the Certificate of the Teacher has been revoked in the meantime.\nEither party hereto may terminate the agreement by giving thirty (30) days' notice in writing to the other party: Provided that no such notice shall be given by the Board until the Teacher has been given the privilege of attending a meeting of the Board (of which five clear days' notice in writing shall be given to the Teacher) to hear and to discuss its reasons for proposing to terminate the agreement.\nThe following is stated in the special case (which is dated November 18, 1931):\n\"2. The defendant desiring to terminate the said agreement complied with the provisions of paragraph 6 thereof in the following manner, namely, that the plaintiff was given the privilege of attending a meeting of the Board, of which five clear days' notice in writing was given to the plaintiff by service of a notice to that effect upon him, which meeting was held to hear and to discuss its reasons for proposing to terminate the agreement, such notice being served on or about the 4th day of July, 1931, and a meeting was held pursuant to such notice on the 14th day of July, 1931, at Acme, in the province of Alberta, and a resolution having been passed by the defendant Board that the said agreement should be terminated, a notice was duly served upon the plaintiff by the defendant Board on or about the 18th day of July, 1931, notifying the plaintiff that the agreement would be terminated at the expiration of such period of thirty days from the date of service of said notice, no approval of an inspector having been previously obtained by the defendant Board.\n\"3. The plaintiff brings this action complaining that the said agreement has been wrongfully terminated in that the provisions of The School Act, Statutes of Alberta (1931), Chapter 32, Section 157, have not been complied with by the defendant in giving such notice of termination.\n\"4. The questions for the opinion of the Court are:\n(1) Can the agreement in question be terminated by compliance only with the provisions of Section 6 thereof?\n(2) Are the provisions as to termination of an agreement, as set forth in The School Act, Statutes of Alberta (1931), Chapter 32, Section 157, applicable to an agreement entered into between a teacher and a Board of School Trustees in the province of Alberta prior to the 1st day of July, 1931? The said Act, c. 32 of 1931, was assented to on March 28, 1931, and came into force on July 1, 1931.\n(Said section 157 has since been amended by c. 34 of 1932).\nEwing J. answered the first question in the negative and the second question in the affirmative, and his decision was affirmed by the Appellate Division. By the judgments now reported, the appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs, Rinfret J. dissenting.\nH. E. Crowle for the appellant.\nO. M. Biggar, K.C., for the respondent.\nLAMONT, J.\u2014I agree with the conclusion of my brother Crocket. Section 157 of the present School Act of Alberta came into force on July 1, 1931. It, in part, reads as follows:\u2014\n157. Subject to the conditions hereinafter set out in this section, either party thereto may terminate the agreement of engagement between the teacher and the Board by giving thirty days' notice in writing to the other party of his or its intention so to do;\nProvided always:\n(a) that except in the month of June no such notice shall be given by a Board without the approval of an inspector previously obtained;\n(b) that except in the months of June and July no notice of the termination of a contract shall be given by a teacher without the approval of an inspector previously obtained;\nThe School Act of 1931 repealed the School Act in force prior to that time (R.S.A. 1922, c. 51). Under the former Act the agreement of engagement between a teacher and the Board of Trustees of a school could be terminated by either party giving to the other party thirty days' notice in writing of his or its intention to terminate it unless otherwise provided in the agreement. In this action the agreement of hiring between the teacher and the Board was entered into in 1929. In the month of July, 1931, the appellant gave notice to the respondent that the agreement between them would be terminated at the expiration of thirty days. Therefore the question for determination is, whether or not the appellant, in July, 1931, could give a valid notice terminating the agreement without having previously secured the approval of the inspector.\nThe question involves the construction of section 157. In the Sussex Peerage case[3], Lord Chief Justice Tindal, in delivering the opinion of the judges, said:\u2014 My Lords, the only rule for the construction of Acts of Parliament is, that they should be construed according to the intent of the Parliament which passed the Act. If the words of the statute are in themselves precise and unambiguous, then no more can be necessary than to expound those words in their natural and ordinary sense. The words themselves alone do, in such case, best declare the intention of the lawgiver.\nIf, however, any doubt as to the legislative intention exists after a perusal of the language of the Act, then, as Lord Hatherly, L.C., said in Pardo v. Bingham[4]:\u2014\nWe must look to the general scope and purview of the statute, and at the remedy sought to be applied, and consider what was the former state of the law, and what it was that the Legislature contemplated.\nIn this Court in the case of Upper Canada College v. Smith[5], Mr. Justice Duff, at page 419, pointed out various ways in which the legislative intention might be expressed. He said:\u2014\nThat intention may be manifested by express language or may be ascertained from the necessary implications of the provisions of the statute, or the subject matter of the legislation or the circumstances in which it was passed may be of such a character as in themselves to rebut the presumption that it is intended only to be prospective in its operation.\nReferring first to the language of the section, we find the legislature declaring that \"subject to the conditions hereinafter set out either party may terminate the agreement of engagement between the teacher and the Board The legislature here was providing by whom and in what circumstances agreements of engagement might be terminated. The old Act provided for such termination, but that Act was being repealed by the Act of 1931, it was, therefore, necessary to make provision in the new Act for terminating the agreements. Giving to the words employed in section 157 their natural and ordinary meaning, we have a section general in its character, and susceptible of application to every agreement of engagement between teacher and trustees. Why then should the section be construed as relating to future agreements only?\nThe appellant contends that to construe the section as applying to agreements in existence prior to the coming into force of the Act would be to violate two well known rules of construction. The first is that statutes are not to be construed as having retrospective operation unless such a construction appears very clearly in the terms of the Act, or arises by necessary or distinct implication; the second is they should not be given a construction that would impair existing rights, unless that effect cannot be avoided without doing violence to the language of the enactment.\nThat these are well recognized general rules of construction is not questioned. Rules of construction, however, are only useful in ascertaining the true meaning of a statute where the language is not clear and plain. If the intention of the legislature can be ascertained all rules of construction must yield to the legislative intention.\nThe foundation upon which the above rules rest is that it would be unfair and unjust to deprive people of rights acquired by transactions perfectly valid and regular at the time they were acquired, and that the legislature is not to be presumed to act unjustly. The right of the Board under the previous Act to give a thirty days' notice of the termination of the agreement of engagement without the consent of the inspector amounted, in my opinion, to something more than a mere matter of procedure. Therefore a legislative intention to deprive the Board of that right will not be presumed. But the legislature was competent to take away that right, and we have to determine whether a legislative intention to take it away is not a necessary implication from the language of the Act, particularly in view of its scope, the mischief it was designed to prevent and the remedy provided.\nBriefly, the Act had for its object the amendment and revision of the former school law so as to present in one Act the law governing the formation and organization of school districts, the erection of schools and the control and management thereof, including the employment and dismissal of the teacher by Boards of Trustees. The provisions of the Act clearly indicate a legislative intention to give the Minister what may be termed a supervising control over the employment of the teacher and the termination of that employment by either the Board or the teacher. (Sections 155 to 158). The right under the former Act that one party could at any time give to the other a thirty days' notice of the termination of the agreement permitted a Board of Trustees to dismiss a teacher, or a teacher to quit the school, during the term, no matter how detrimental to the efficiency of the school and the pupils' courses of studies the termination of the agreement at such a time might be. That was the mischief struck at by subsections (a) and (b) of section 157. The remedy provided was to require the consent of the inspector before notice of termination was given, except during the months specified in those subsections. Thus to the inspector was committed the duty of deciding whether the reasons for desiring the termination of the agreement were, in the circumstances of the particular case, sufficient to justify the impairment in efficiency of the school which would likely follow upon a break in the course of the pupils' studies.\nConsidering the nature and scope of the Act and the control over the agreement of engagement between teacher and Board retained by the Minister, and considering also that the mischief for which the legislature was providing a remedy was a presently existing evil which the legislature proposed to cure by making the right of either party to terminate the agreement depend upon the consent of the inspector, I am of opinion that sufficient has been shewn to rebut the presumption that the section was intended only to be prospective in its operation. I can find nothing that would justify us in construing section 157 as if it read: \"Either party may terminate any future agreement between the teacher and the Board.\" In order to give the section the meaning contended for by the appellant we should have to read into it words which limit its prima facie operation and which would make it something different from and smaller than what its terms express. As Bowen, L.J., said in The Queen v. Liverpool Justices of the Peace[6]:\u2014\nCertainly we should not readily acquiesce in a non-natural construction which limits the operation of the section so as to make the remedy given by it not commensurate with the mischief which it was intended to cure.\nIn my opinion section 157 was passed to remedy an evil which had been found to exist. It should, therefore, be construed in conformity with the well established rule that all cases within the mischief aimed at by that statutory provision are, if the language permits, to be held to fall within its remedial influence. In Craies on Statute Law, 3rd ed., at page 336, the author says:\u2014\nIf a statute is passed for the purpose of protecting the public against some evil or abuse, it will be allowed to operate retrospectively, although by such operation it will deprive some person or persons of a vested right.\nAnd in West v. Gwynne[7], Buckley, L.J., points out that most Acts of Parliament do in fact interfere with existing rights.\nThe case at bar, in my opinion, is similar to that of West v. Gwynne[8]. In that case the statutory provision was as follows:\u2014\nIn all leases containing a covenant, condition or agreement against assigning, underletting, or parting with the possession, or disposing of the land or property leased without licence or consent, such covenant, condition or agreement shall, unless the lease contains an express provision to the contrary, be deemed to be subject to a proviso to the effect that no fine or sum of money in the nature of a fine shall be payable for or in respect of such licence or consent.\nThe lessees applied to the landlord for his consent to their subletting the demised land. The landlord replied that he was only prepared to grant the plaintiffs a licence to underlet on condition that he should thenceforward receive for himself one-half of the surplus rental to be obtained from the lessees in respect of the demised premises over and above the rent payable under the lease. An action was brought for a declaration that the lessees could make a valid underlease without his consent. The question was, as in the present case, whether the statutory provision applied to all leases or only to those executed after the passing of the Act. It was held to apply to leases already existing as well as to those to be executed in the future, on the ground that the Act was passed for the purpose of correcting a state of the law which was lending itself to grave abuse.\nThe appellant relies upon the case of Upper Canada College v. Smith[9]. That case, in my opinion, is clearly distinguishable, for there, if the statutory enactment had been given a retrospective operation it would have deprived an agent who had earned a commission on the sale of land, under a contract valid when entered into, from recovering that commission. The statutory provision in that case prohibited the bringing of an action to recover the commis- sion \"unless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought shall be in writing * * * and signed by the party to be charged therewith * * * As Mr. Justice Duff pointed out at page 422, \"the words 'shall be in writing' point to a writing to be brought into existence after the passing of the Act\". It was there held that the enactment was prospective only in its operation.\nIn the case at bar there is, in my opinion, nothing whatever to indicate an intention that the section was to be more restricted in its operation than the language employed would convey given its ordinary meaning.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nThe judgment of Smith and Crocket JJ. was delivered by\nCROCKET J.\u2014This case arises out of the repeal by the Legislature of Alberta, in the year 1931, of the School Act of that province, chap. 51, R.S.A. (1922), and its replacement by a revised Act, which came into force on July 1 of that year.\nWhile the old Act was in force, on June 28, 1929, the respondent, a qualified teacher, entered into a contract with the appellant Board as teacher in the above school district at a salary of $2,200 per year. The contract, which was in the form approved by the Minister of Education in accordance with the provisions of the old Act, contained, inter alia, the following provision, as clause no. 6, which is the only one with which this appeal is concerned:\u2014\n6. This agreement shall continue in force from year to year, unless it is terminated as hereinafter provided, or unless the certificate of the teacher has been revoked in the meantime.\nEither party hereto may terminate the agreement by giving thirty (30) days' notice in writing to the other party.\nProvided that no such notice shall be given by the Board until the teacher has been given the privilege of attending a meeting of the Board (of which five clear days' notice in writing shall be given to the teacher) to hear and to discuss its reasons for proposing to terminate the agreement.\nOn July 14, 1931, after the new Act came into operation, the appellant gave the respondent thirty days' notice in writing of the termination of the agreement, as provided by the above clause, but failed to obtain the approval of a school inspector to such notice, in accordance with the provisions of section 157 of the new Act, chap. 32 of the Statutes of Alberta for the year 1931, which had come into force on July 1 of that year.\nThe respondent having brought an action against the appellant to recover damages for the alleged wrongful termination of the contract, on the ground that the provisions of sec 157 of chap. 32, Statutes of Alberta, 1931, had not been complied with, a special case was stated for the opinion of the court, pursuant to Rule 114 of the Alberta Rules of Court, the questions submitted to the court being:\u2014\n(1) Can the Agreement in question be terminated by compliance only with the provisions of Section 6 thereof?\n(2) Are the provisions as to termination of an Agreement, as set forth in The School Act, Statutes of Alberta (1931), Chapter 32, Section 157, applicable to an Agreement entered into between a teacher and a Board of School Trustees in the Province of Alberta prior to the 1st day of July, 1931?\nThe case was argued before Ewing, J., who answered the first question in the negative and the second question in the affirmative[10]. On appeal these answers were affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[11].\nThe text of sec. 157 of the new Act, in so far as it is relevant to the question involved, is as follows:\u2014\n157. Subject to the conditions hereinafter set out in this section, either party thereto may terminate the agreement of engagement between the teacher and the Board by giving thirty days' notice in writing to the other party of his or its intention so to do:\nProvided always:\n(a) that except in the month of June no such notice shall be given by a Board without the approval of an inspector previously obtained;\n(b) that except in the months of June and July no notice of the termination of a contract shall be given by a teacher without the approval of an inspector previously obtained.\nThis section is one of sixteen sections\u2014154 to 169 inclusive\u2014comprising Part XIII of the Act under the principal caption \"Relating to the Teacher.\" Sec. 154 appears under the sub-caption \"Qualification,\" while sections 155 to 158 inclusive are under the sub-caption \"Engagement and Contract.\" Sec. 159 follows under the sub-caption \"Suspension and Dismissal\" and the remaining sections of this Part of the Act, are set out under such sub-captions as \"Board of Reference\" (for the investigation of disputes between school boards and teachers), \"Payment of Teachers,\" \"Duties of Teachers,\" etc. The agreement here in question, as already pointed out, provided for its termination on thirty days' notice in writing by either party. Had it not done so it would have been terminable in the same way by virtue of subsec. 2 of sec. 199 of the old Act, which read as follows:\u2014\nUnless otherwise provided for in the contract either party thereto may terminate the agreement for teaching between the teacher and the board of trustees by giving thirty days' notice in writing to the other party of his or its intention so to do.\nIt will be noticed that the change which sec. 157 of the new Act effected in the law regarding the termination of teaching agreements was to require the previous approval of an inspector to the thirty days' notice of termination by the Board of Trustees, except in the month of June, and the like approval of an inspector to the notice of termination by the teacher, except in the months of June and July. In the month of June the Board of Trustees can, as before, terminate on thirty days' notice, without previously obtaining the approval of an inspector, and in the months of June and July the teacher also has the same privilege, as formerly. The object evidently was to prevent, except for some sufficient reason, the cancellation of teachers' contracts during the teaching days of the school year, and the disturbing and detrimental effects thereof upon the work of the schools. The change, undoubtedly, deprives the Board of Trustees of the right to terminate the teaching agreement on its own motion, except by notice given in the month of June, as it deprives the teacher of the right to do so on his own motion, except in the months of June and July.\nIn behalf of the appellant, it is contended that section 157 was not intended to apply to existing teachers' contracts, but only to contracts entered into after July 1, 1931, when the new Act came into force, and that the trial judge and the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta erroneously gave it a retroactive operation.\nI am of opinion that Ewing, J., and the Appeal Division correctly construed the section, as enacted in 1931, as applicable to all teachers' contracts, those entered into before the coming into force of the Act, as well as those entered into afterwards.\nWhether or not such a construction really involves giving retroactive operation to the section, having regard to the fact that its new provisions relate only to the manner in which exising contracts may subsequently be terminated or to the right of terminating them in the future, I am satisfied that the clear intention of the legislation was that it should apply to all teachers' contracts alike just as all other provisions of Part XIII were clearly intended to apply to all teachers alike, whether engaged before or after the coming into force of the Act.\nReading the section in question with its context in Part XIII and as part of an Act passed as a complete revision and consolidation of the former School Act, which it repealed, and to which all schools, school boards, teachers, teaching contracts and all else pertaining to the maintenance and administration of schools were subject, I cannot for my part find, either in the language of the section itself or in its context, any indication whatever that the legislature intended to exclude all existing teachers' contracts from its operation.\nIt was argued that the use of the word \"shall\" in the two previous sections, 155 and 156, indicated an intention that these sections should apply only to future contracts. It goes without saying that, in so far as the provisions of these two sections relate to the manner and authority in and under which teachers shall be engaged and the form and terms of the contract which they shall enter into, they could not possibly apply to contracts which had already been entered into, but it does not follow from this fact that none of their provisions shall have any application to existing contracts, where it is clear they may apply to existing and future contracts alike. For example, subsec. 3 of sec. 156 provides that \"unless the employment be stated in the contract to be for a definite period, the contract shall, subject to the following provisions, continue in force from year to year unless and until the certificate of the teacher shall have been revoked.\" Unquestionably, this latter provision may apply to existing as well as to future contracts. As a matter of fact, it is a re-enactment of an identical provision in the repealed Act. Every teacher's contract in which the employment is not stated to be for a definite period would on the face of the subsection itself fall within its terms. The word \"shall\" in the phrase \"the contract shall continue, etc.\" throws no light whatever upon the question whether the intention was to exclude or to include existing contracts. It is true that its provisions could operate only prospectively, so far as the contract continuing in force from year to year is concerned, but this does not mean that the subsection cannot and does not apply to existing as well as to future contracts.\nSimilarly, when sec. 157 is examined it will be seen that it treats exclusively of the manner of terminating \"the agreement between the teacher and the Board\". It provides in its main clause that \"either party may terminate the agreement between the teacher and the Board\". Its provisions, so far as the terminating of teachers' contracts is concerned, could likewise operate only prospectively, but this is not to say that they cannot and do not apply to existing as well as to future agreements. The question wholly turns upon the meaning of the words \"the agree ment between the teacher and the Board.\" Were they intended to embrace all teachers' contracts, existing as well as future, as they undoubtedly did as they stood in the former Act when it was repealed, or are they now to be limited as applying only to such contracts as might be entered into after the coming into force of the new Act?\nWere it not for the addition of the provisoes (a) and (b), no one would suggest that the phrase \"either party may terminate the agreement between the teacher and the Board\" in the main clause of sec. 157 has any different meaning in the new Act than it had in the repealed Act, where it seems to me to be perfectly clear that it referred, not to any agreement that might be entered into in the future, but was used as a form to designate all teachers' agreements. In my opinion, it does this quite as effectually as if the words \"either party may terminate any agreement between a teacher and a board\" had been used. If the intention had been as argued in behalf of the appellant, how simply it could have been shewn by inserting the words \"hereafter entered into.\" If the meaning I have indicated be the true meaning of the words of the opening clause, the addition of the provisoes cannot alter that meaning. They are the controlling words and if they apply to all teachers' contracts, existing as well as future, the provisoes likewise apply to all. If the language of the section itself and its immediate context left any doubt as to its general application, the implications arising from its remedial object, the nature of the agreement and of the right affected and the extent to which it is affected, the fact of the amendment being made in a general revision and consolidation of the former Act, and the whole frame and scope of the new Act, which, though passed on March 28, did not come into operation until July 1, would, in my judgment, put the matter beyond all question.\nTo confine the words to future contracts only would be, if not entirely to defeat the remedial object of the enactment, at least to render it ineffective for years to come in the great majority of the schools of the province. There would, of course, be no contracts to which it could apply in any way at the time the Act was passed or at the time it came into force, and after that it would only be as existing contracts were cancelled and new ones substituted here and there that the legislation could begin to speak. It would be impossible for the Department of Education to know whether it was in effect at all without an examination of all teaching contracts, to ascertain whether they were entered into before or after the coming into force of the Act. It would necessitate the division of all teaching contracts into two classes: those entered into before July 1, 1931, and those entered into afterwards, and thereby entail such inconvenience and confusion in the administration of the provincial school system as to render the new enactment extremely difficult, if not practically impossible, of observance.\nMoreover, public school teachers' contracts are of a public character. The School Boards are essentially public corporations representing the rate-payers of the different school districts. The teachers are licensed by the Board or Minister of Education. The Minister of Education was authorized by the former School Act, as he is authorized by the new Act, to prescribe a standard form for all teachers' contracts, and to determine the terms and conditions which all teachers' contracts uniformly should and shall contain. They are contracts which affect the rights and interests of the whole population of every school district. The contracts themselves and the School Boards and teachers being so peculiarly subject at all times to public control, I find it impossible to conclude that when the legislature revised and consolidated the entire school law of the province and provided in that revision that a notice terminating a teacher's contract in the middle of a teaching term should require the approval of a school inspector, it did not intend that provision to have any present operation or indeed any future operation until some new teachers' agreement should be entered into. If there were any presumption that the legislature did not intend to affect such an existing right, which I very much question, such a presumption must yield to the language of the enactment read in the light of the circumstances and considerations I have mentioned. As was said by Buckley, L.J., in West v. Gwynne[12], practically every legislative enactment does affect to some extent existing rights. The rights affected by the legislation now in question were mere potential rights, upon which no causes of action had accrued, and the modification of which to the extent indicated could cause no substantial injustice to either the Board of Trustees or the teacher. Each party, had it been desired to terminate the contract without the approval of the inspector, had the interval between the passage of the Act and its coming into force, to do so. Even had the Act come into force on the date it was assented to, the trustees in the case at bar could have acted under its provisions in the month of June.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nCANNON J.\u2014The contract, admittedly, was in the form approved by the Minister of Education under a regulation made in accordance with the provisions of the old Act. This old Act was repealed and \"other provisions were substituted by the repealing enactment for the provisions or regulations thereby repealed.\" Section 14 of the Interpretation Act (R.S.A., 1922, ch. 1) provides that in such a case\n(b) all proceedings taken under the old enactment or regulation or which may require to be instituted shall be continued or instituted as the case may be under the substituted provisions, so far as applicable;\n(c) all by-laws, orders, regulations and rules made under the old enactment shall continue good and valid in so far as they are not inconsistent with the substituted provisions, until they are annulled or others are made in their stead; In my opinion, the various steps regulating the dismissal of a teacher were always subject to change by regulation or statute and the teacher and the Board were both subject to such contingency\u2014which excluded the possibility of any right, as to notice, becoming incommutably vested in either party.\nEven assuming that such right or advantage had accrued or become vested, it would always be subject to the application of section 12 of the same Interpretation Act, which expressly reserves to the Legislative Assembly the power of revoking, restricting or modifying any advantage vested or granted by any Act of the Legislature to any person or party, whenever such repeal, restriction, or modification is deemed by the Legislative Assembly to be required for the public good. This has been done in a matter of public policy, and I would therefore answer the questions as follows :\n1. No.\n2. Yes.\nand dismiss the appeal with costs.\nRINFRET J. (dissenting).\u2014With deference, I think the appeal in this case ought to be allowed.\nWe have to construe section 157 of the School Act, being c. 32 of the Statutes of Alberta (1931).\nIn the Act, section 157 forms part of a fasciculus of sections (ss. 155-158) under the sub-heading \"Engagement and Contract\"; and, so as to understand its full purport, I think all the sections must be reproduced in the order in which they appear:\n155. A teacher shall not be engaged except under the authority of a resolution of the Board passed at a regular or special meeting of the Board.\nProvided always that in case the chairman or secretary sends any communication in writing to an applicant for engagement as a teacher by the Board, to the effect that the Board has decided to engage such applicant, and if the applicant delivers or causes to be delivered to the chairman or secretary of the Board a communication in writing to the effect that the applicant accepts such engagement, either by actual delivery or by mail or by telegraph, not later than the fifth day after the day upon which the communication from the chairman or secretary was mailed or otherwise despatched, the Board and the applicant shall be thereupon under a legal obligation to enter into a contract in the standard form, subject only to such variation as may be approved by the Minister; otherwise such communications shall not be effective to create any contract whatsoever between the Board and the applicant. 156. (1) The contract of employment shall contain such agreements, terms, conditions and restrictions as may be approved by the Minister, who may prescribe a standard form of contract.\n(2) In the event of any alteration or amendment of the standard form being made without the approval of the Minister, the standard form shall have effect as if such alteration or amendment had not been made.\n(3) Unless the employment be stated in the contract to be for a definite period, the contract shall, subject to the following provisions, continue in force from year to year, unless and until the certificate of the teacher shall have been revoked.\n157. Subject to the conditions hereinafter set out in this section, either party thereto may terminate the agreement of engagement between the teacher and the Board by giving thirty days' notice in writing to the other party of his or its intention so to do; Provided always\n(a) that except in the month of June no such notice shall be given by a Board without the approval of an inspector previously obtained;\n(b) that except in the months of June and July no notice of the termination of a contract shall be given by a teacher without the approval of an inspector previously obtained;\n(c) that any such notice may be given either by delivering the same to the person to whom it is addressed or sending the same in a duly addressed and prepaid cover by registered mail, and in the latter case the notice shall be deemed to have been given upon the day on which it is mailed;\n(d) that a teacher may notify the secretary of a post office address to which any notices may be sent, and in that event, all notices shall be sent to that address, but if no such address is furnished to the secretary, any notice sent by mail shall be deemed to have been duly addressed if addressed to the teacher at the last known post office address of such teacher.\n158. The contract shall be signed by the teacher and by the chairman, or, in the absence of the chairman, by another trustee on behalf of the Board.\nThe question is whether the new enactment applies to contracts entered into before the Act came into force.\nThe fundamental rule is that, prima facie, statutes are to be construed as prospective. The rule is \"one of construction only\" and \"will certainly yield to the intention of the legislature.\" (Moon v. Burden[13].) But, as pointed out by Duff J. in Upper Canada College v. Smith[14], there is high authority for the proposition \"that the intention to affect prejudicially existing rights must appear from the express words of the enactment\"; and he quotes Fry J. in Hickson v. Darlow[15]; Rolfe B. in Moon v. Burden[16]; and a passage of Erle, C.J., in Midland Ry. Co. v. Rye[17], approved by the Privy Council in Young v. Adams[18]; and \"words not requiring a retrospective operation so as to affect an existing status prejudicially ought not to be so construed\" (per Lord Selborne in Main v. Stark[19]). For, as a general principle, legislation introduced for the first time, \"ought not to change the character of past transactions carried on upon the faith of the then existing law.\" (Phillips v. Eyre[20].)\nWright J., in In re Athlumney[21], laid down the principle as follows:\nNo rule of construction is more firmly established than this: that a retrospective operation is not to be given to a statute so as to impair an existing right or obligation, otherwise than as regards matter of procedure, unless that effect cannot be avoided without doing violence to the language of the enactment. If the enactment is expressed in language which is fairly capable of either interpretation, it ought to be construed as prospective only.\nThe above rule was referred to and followed by this Court only recently in Electric Motor & Machinery Co. v. The Bank of Montreal[22].\nNow, if the principle and the rule be applied first to the language of section 157, there exists no difficulty in giving to it a meaning which makes it prospective only in its operation and, on the contrary, there is nothing \"on the face of the enactment putting it beyond doubt that the legislature meant it to operate retrospectively.\" (Rolfe B., in Moon v. Burden[23].)\nThe following passage of the trial judge's judgment has my fullest concurrence:\nAt the outset I find myself unable to agree with the argument that sec. 157 of the new Act merely effects a change in procedure and has therefore a retrospective effect. Under the contract and under the old Act the Board had the complete and unassailable right to terminate\u2014subject only to the requirements as to notice and as to giving the Teacher the privilege of attending a meeting of the Board to hear and discuss the reasons for proposing to terminate the contract. It lay easily within the power of the Board to comply with these requirements. Under the new Act the Board is required, except in the month of June, to get the approval of an Inspector, which it may or may not be able to get. Failing to get the approval of an Inspector the Board has no power to terminate the contract\u2014except in the month of June. This provision therefore seriously limits the contractual powers of the Board. There are many dicta to the effect that statutes which make alterations in procedure are retrospective. There is Lord Blackburn's well known dictum in Gardner v. Lucas[24], viz:\u2014\n\"I think it is perfectly settled that if the Legislature intended to frame a new procedure, that instead of proceeding in this form or that, you should proceed in another and a different way; clearly there bygone transactions are to be sued for and enforced according to the new form of procedure.\"\nBut in the case at bar the Legislature has not merely altered the form by which a thing shall be done, but it has taken away from the Board in certain contingencies the power to do it at all. New disabilities and obligations are created and the change in this respect cannot therefore be a mere matter of procedure.\nBut I cannot follow the learned judge further when he says:\u2014\nBut to declare that sec. 157 applies to contracts, still in effect, although entered into before sec. 157 came into force, with respect to acts done or events happening after sec. 157 came into force is not to declare that the section is retrospective.\nIf these acts are done pursuant to the rights of the parties under the existing contracts, and if the parties are told that they may no longer act in accordance with their contracts mutually agreed upon, clearly their legal rights are prejudicially affected retrospectively and the legislation is given a retroactive operation upon the contracts themselves. I do not think the intention to deprive the parties of their contractual rights and to substitute a new contract is manifested in sec. 157, either by express language or by necessary implication. Still less can I come to that conclusion, when I look at the heading under which and the sections among which section 157 is to be found in the Act.\nThe heading is a key to the interpretation of the sections ranged under it. It must be read in connection with them and the sections interpreted by the light of it. (Brett, L.J., in The Queen v. Local Government Board[25]; Lord Herschell in Ingliss v. Robertson[26]; Toronto Corporation v. Toronto Ry. Co.[27]). As already mentioned, the heading reads \"Engagement and Contract,\" which imports the idea of a future agreement.\nThen sections 155 and 156 which precede and section 158 which follows section 157 clearly refer to contracts to be entered into in the future. They are all sections under the same heading. Moreover, subsec. 3 of sec 156 is made \"subject to the following provisions,\" namely, those of sec. 157, and therefore connects the latter with the former. It is in accordance with the ordinary rules of interpretation, that the words \"the agreement of engagement\" in sec. 157 should be held to bear the same meaning as the words \"the contract of employment\" in the surrounding sections under the same heading. There is no sufficient indication that sec. 157 should be treated as an isolated enactment, wherein the legislature jumped from one subject-matter to another, viz., from the subject of future contracts to that of contracts already in existence, again to return to the subject of future contracts in the following section. It seems more natural and more logical to interpret all four sections as dealing with the same kind of contracts, namely, future contracts.\nFor these reasons, I would allow the appeal with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1932] 1 W.W.R. 849; [1932] 3 D.L.R. 262.\n[2] [1932] 1 W.W.R. 315.\n[3] (1844) 11 Cl. & F. 85, at 143; 8 E.R. 1034, at 1057.\n[4] (1869) 4 Ch.

APPEAL from the judgment of Coderre and Denis JJ.[1] sitting as trial judges under the provisions of the \u201cDominion Controverted Elections Act,\u201d R.S.C. (1927), c. 50, in the matter of the controverted election of a member for the Electoral District of Yamaska in the House of Commons of Canada, rendered on the 23rd of June, 1932, maintaining the respondent\u2019s petition as to the claim for the voiding of the election and dismissing it as to the other claims, without costs, and declaring the appellant\u2019s election void.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the judgment now reported.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the appellant.\nEdouard Masson and Aim\u00e9 Chass\u00e9 for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSmith J.\u2014At a Dominion election held on the 28th day of July, 1930, the appellant and one Paul Fran\u00e7ois Comtois were the candidates in the Electoral District of Yamaska and the appellant was returned as elected.\nA petition against the appellant was presented under the Dominion Controverted Elections Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 50) by the respondent, a duly qualified elector of the said electoral district.\nThis petition, after numerous allegations of corrupt and illegal acts, committed on behalf of the appellant, concludes as follows:\nPourquoi le p\u00e9titionnaire conclut \u00e0 ce que l\u2019\u00e9lection du d\u00e9fendeur Aim\u00e9 Boucher, notaire, comme d\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00e0 la Chambre des Communes, pour la division \u00e9lectorale d\u2019Yamaska, soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit; et \u00e0 ce que le dit d\u00e9fendeur soit frapp\u00e9 de toutes les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s, sanctions et incapacit\u00e9s que prescrit la loi; et \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il soit retranch\u00e9 du nombre de suffrages qui paraissent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s en faveur du d\u00e9fendeur, un vote pour chaque personne qui a vot\u00e9 \u00e0 la dite \u00e9lection, et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 suborn\u00e9e, r\u00e9gal\u00e9e, ill\u00e9gitimement influenc\u00e9e et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9e et employ\u00e9e moyennant r\u00e9tribution, tel que ci-haut mentionn\u00e9; et \u00e0 ce que le candidat Paul Fran\u00e7ois Comtois, agriculteur, domicil\u00e9 et r\u00e9sidant dans la paroisse de St. Thomas de Pierreville, district judiciaire de Richelieu, soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e9lu d\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00e0 la Chambre des Communes du district \u00e9lectoral d\u2019Yamaska; le tout avec d\u00e9pens contre le dit d\u00e9fendeur, y compris les d\u00e9pens incidents et autres occasionn\u00e9s par la pr\u00e9sente contestation. Sections 48 and 49 of the Act are as follows:\n48. If, on the trial of an election petition, claiming the seat for any person, a candidate is proved to have been guilty, by himself or by any person on his behalf of bribery, treating, or undue influence with respect to any person who voted at such election, or if any person retained or employed for reward by or on behalf of such candidate, for all or any of the purposes of such election, as agent, clerk or messenger, or in any other employment, is proved on such trial to have voted at such election, there shall, on the trial of such election petition, be struck off from the number of votes appearing to have been given to such candidate, one vote for every person who voted at such election, and who is proved to have been so bribed, treated or unduly influenced, or so retained or employed for reward as aforesaid.\n49. If it is found by the report of the trial judges that any corrupt practice has been committed by a candidate at an election, or by his agent, whether with or without the actual knowledge and consent of such candidate, or that any illegal practice has been committed by a candidate or by his official agent or by any other agent of the candidate with the actual knowledge and consent of the candidate, the election of such candidate, if he has been elected, shall be void.\nSection 9 provides that the petition may be in form \u201cB\u201d in the schedule to the Act; and the concluding clause of that form reads as follows:\nWherefore your petitioner prays that it may be determined (that * * * was duly elected or returned or that * * * ought to have been returned or that the election is void, as the case may be) (the words \u201cas the case may be\u201d are in italics).\nThe trial judges found that the claim to the seat on behalf of the candidate Comtois should be rejected because the proof on this point does not justify this part of the conclusions of the petition and also because of the admission of the petitioner himself in the record.\nThey further found the appellant guilty by agents of corrupt practices sufficient to void the election and declared same void accordingly. From this decision voiding the election the appeal is taken.\nThe ground of appeal is that because the seat is claimed for the defeated candidate the function of the trial judges was limited to striking off votes from the number given for each candidate as provided by s. 48 and to finding by this means who \u201chad\u201d the majority of lawful votes and of declaring the candidate, so found to have the majority, elected.\nIt is argued that a claim to the seat on behalf of a candidate defeated according to the return and a claim for the voiding of the election are incompatible claims that cannot be set up side by side; or, in the alternative, because, if the election of Boucher is first declared either valid or void, it is not then possible to reverse this on a computation of votes under s. 48; and, on the other hand, that if such computation under s. 48 is first made, the Court must award the seat to the candidate having the majority by such computation, and cannot then proceed to void the election because, the judges having eliminated all the votes of each candidate tainted with illegality, there are left only the good or untainted votes, and the party having the majority of these is entitled to be declared elected; and all the illegal votes cast for him having been disallowed, these and the means by which they were procured cannot be made a ground for unseating him.\nI am of opinion that this reason is not tenable. It means that if the seat is claimed by or on behalf of a candidate who has been defeated according to the return, the trial judges, quite regardless of any large amount of corruption and illegality practised on behalf of both candidates, must declare one of them elected.\nTo confirm the successful candidate according to the return in the seat under such circumstances would be directly contrary to the provisions of s. 49.\nSection 10 (5) of the Act provides that the sitting member, whose election and return is petitioned against, may file a petition, complaining of any unlawful and corrupt act by any candidate at the same election who was not returned or by his agent with his privity, and s. 47 provides as follows:\nOn the trial of a petition under this Act complaining of an undue return and claiming the seat for any person, the respondent may give evidence to show that the election of such person was undue in the same manner as if he had presented a petition complaining of such election.\nThe language of this section is peculiar, inasmuch as it treats or speaks of any person for whom the petition claims the seat as an elected person whose \u201celection\u201d may be attacked in the prescribed manner. It seems a misnomer to speak of the \u201celection\u201d of a candidate who by the return is not elected. I am of opinion, however, that the section means that a candidate who has not been declared elected, on whose behalf a petition against the candidate returned as elected claims the seat, may be proceeded against in the same manner as if a counter petition had been filed against him under s. 10 (5) referred to.\nIt follows that a defeated candidate for whom the petition claims the seat is in the same position, so far as corrupt or illegal practices are concerned, as the successful candidate against whom the petition has been filed. Where, therefore, the evidence establishes against the candidate declared elected, and also against the candidate for whom the seat is claimed, corrupt and illegal acts sufficient to void an election, the trial judges are not bound to declare one of them elected on a computation of votes pursuant to s. 48, but may declare the election void.\nSection 57 provides that at the conclusion of the trial, the trial judges shall determine whether the member whose election or return is complained of or any and what other person was duly returned or elected, or whether the election was void.\nThe trial judges here, as expressly empowered by this section, have declared that neither the appellant nor Comtois, for whom the seat was claimed, was duly returned or elected, and that the election is void.\nI am of opinion that there was jurisdiction so to declare, and, this being the only question submitted to us, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Adolphe Allard, Elie Salvos.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Chass\u00e9 & Duguay.\n[1] (1932) Q.R. 70 S.C. 339.\n",

The learned trial judge was in error in refusing to admit in evidence certain letters written by the accused and found undelivered in his cell.\n2. The learned judge was in error in refusing to permit the ballistic expert witness, Dr. Rosalier Fontaine, to give evidence expressing his opinion as to the mortal bullet having been fired from the revolver in the possession of the accused.\n4. The learned judge was in error in his charge to the jury on the question of corroboration:\n(a) in instructing the jury that they should not convict instead of warning them of the danger of convicting on the evidence of an accomplice unless corroborated in some material particular implicating the accused;\n(b) in placing undue stress on the point that they should not convict on the evidence of an accomplice unless corroborated in some material particular implicating the accused; and\n(c) in instructing the jury as follows:\nIf you have found that corroborative evidence and believe the evidence of Wallace Pitre and if you find that he has been corroborated in the way in which I have marked out to you, then your duty is to convict and to find the prisoner guilty. If you find the evidence of Wallace Pitre has not been corroborated in the way which I have marked out, then your duty is clear to acquit him.\nThe appeal is from this judgment, setting aside the acquittal on these three grounds.\nThe evidence excluded, which is referred to, in the first of the grounds mentioned, was that of Audina Auber, who was called to prove that certain letters, found in the cell of the accused, were in his handwriting. She testified that she had known the accused for six months, and that he had been \u201ckeeping company\u201d with her; that he was away from home last winter, and sent her two post cards, which she read, but did not keep. She further testified that since the appellant had been in jail, she had received two letters from him, brought to her by some boys, one of whom she recognized.\nRelying on the receipt, in this way, by the witness of the two post cards and the two letters, and on nothing else, the Crown proposed to prove by her that the paper writing produced marked \u201cM\u201d was in the handwriting of the appellant. This evidence was objected to, and the Court ruled, \u201cI will not allow that evidence at present\u201d; and the witness stood aside. She was recalled, at a later stage, but the Crown made no further effort to examine her as to the appellant\u2019s handwriting.\nIt is not necessary to prove handwriting by an expert witness, but it must be established that the witness has in some way become competent to testify as to the handwriting; and it has been laid down that a witness may be competent by reason of having become familiar with a person\u2019s handwriting through a regular correspondence or through having frequently seen the person\u2019s handwriting. On the bare facts established here, I do not think the learned trial judge erred in refusing to accept the witness as one competent to testify as to the appellant\u2019s handwriting. Two post cards and the letters, unanswered, without any indication as to their contents, or any circumstances brought out to indicate that the witness had reason to believe that these two post cards and two letters were actually in the handwriting of the accused, do not go far enough, in my opinion, to constitute a regular correspondence within the meaning of the rule laid down by Lord Coleridge in Rex v. O\u2019Brien[1], as follows:\nTo prove handwriting, it is necessary that a witness should have either seen the person write, or corresponded regularly with him, or acted upon such a correspondence. Then the witness may swear to his belief as to the handwriting, but without one of these foundations for his belief the question is inadmissible.\nThe Crown was not precluded by the ruling from further questioning the witness to show grounds for her belief that the documents she had received were really in the handwriting of the accused, but simply dropped the matter.\nAs to the second ground quoted above, Dr. Fontaine, a qualified expert, had examined the bullet of .38 calibre that caused the death, and had examined also a .38 calibre revolver shown to have been in the possession of the accused the day before the murder, and had fired another bullet from this revolver, and then compared by a microscope and photographs the marks left on the two bullets by the barrel of the revolver from which they had been fired. He found seven similar marks on each bullet. He was asked, as an expert, from the experiment and observations he had made, his opinion as to whether or not the bullet which caused the death had been fired from the revolver mentioned. He testified that he was in a position to give an opinion, and was finally asked:\nAnd what would be your opinion?\nThe Court: I will not allow him to express an opinion. I will shut it out.\nThis ruling was wrong, but it is claimed that the effect of it is modified by what followed. The witness is next asked if the points of similarity would indicate anything to him, and what, and he answered:\nThat indicates that the two bullets compared were fired from the same revolver.\nThe Court: They are indications\u2014\u2014\nA. It is an opinion, not a certitude.\nThe Court: You say that positively\u2014\u2014?\nA. They might indicate\u2014\u2014\nThe Court: They are indications\u2014\u2014?\nA. They are indications\u2014\u2014\nThe Court: That the two bullets might have come from the same revolver?\nA. Yes.\nThe Court: And that is as far as any man can go?\nA. Yes.\nIt is argued from this that the witness actually gave his opinion, and that all he could say was that these two bullets, both of .38 calibre, might have come from the same revolver. It would hardly take an expert of Dr. Fontaine\u2019s experience and capacity, with his microscopes and experiments, to be able to say that two bullets of .38 calibre might have been fired from the same revolver of .38 calibre. Under these circumstances, it can hardly be said that the original ruling out of his opinion had much effect.\nThe fourth ground upon which the setting aside of the acquittal is based is therefore the serious one.\nThe learned trial judge, in instructing the jury in his charge as to what they should do with regard to the uncorroborated evidence of the accomplice, many times gave them misdirection. At p. 159 he says:\n* * * although you may convict upon Wallace Pitre\u2019s evidence alone uncorroborated you should not do so. I am warning you that Wallace Pitre being an accomplice his evidence should be corroborated by other testimony implicating Rufus in some of the material particulars of the offence, and I am repeating it to you because it is important and I want you to understand it\u2014that a jury although they may convict on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, they ought not to do so and it is the duty of the trial judge to warn you not to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, in this case, Wallace Pitre is an accomplice of Rufus Pitre, and you should not convict on his evidence alone unless you find it is corroborated in some material particular by independent evidence implicating Rufus Pitre.\nAt p. 168, he says:\n* * * I have explained to you how although you may convict on his uncorroborated evidence, that you should not unless it was corroborated by independent evidence of witnesses testifying as to independent particulars implicating the accused.\nAt p. 169, he says:\nIf you find the evidence of Wallace Pitre has not been corroborated in the way which I have marked out then your duty is clear to acquit him.\nAgain, on the same page, he says:\n* * * although you may convict on the uncorroborated evidence of Wallace Pitre who is an accomplice, you should not do so unless his evidence is corroborated in some material particular by evidence implicating the accused * * *.\nThe rule as to what direction should be given to a jury concerning the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice was settled in The King v. Baskerville[2].\nIn the subsequent case of Rex v. Beebe[3], Lord Hewart C.J., gives in a few words the rule laid down in the Baskerville case2, as follows:\n[The jury should be told] that it is within their legal province to convice; they are to be warned in all such cases that it is dangerous to convict; and they may be advised not to convict.\nHe further points out that a direction in such a case to the jury that they ought to convict would not be according to the law laid down in the Baskerville case2.\nThese judgments have been referred to and acted upon in a number of cases in this Court, particularly Gouin v. The King[4]; Brunet v. The King[5]; and Vigeant v. The King[6].\nIn the Baskerville case2 Lord Reading quotes from Rex v. Everest[7], as follows:\nThe rule has long been established that the judge should tell the jury to acquit the prisoner if the only evidence against him is that of an accomplice, unless that evidence is corroborated in some particular which goes to implicate the accused;\nand, commenting on this quotation, says:\n\u201cTell the jury to acquit\u201d should read \u201cWarn the jury of the danger of convicting.\u201d Again he says, on the same page, that the Everest case statement quoted above goes too far in saying that the judge should direct the jury to acquit.\nIn the present case, it will be seen that the learned trial judge, in the quotations set out above, misdirected the jury in telling them on these various occasions throughout the charge that they should not convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the accomplice, and that it was their duty to acquit.\nIn the reasons of the Court of Appeal, one of the passages from the learned trial judge\u2019s charge, quoted above, is set out, as follows:\n* * * a jury although they may convict on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, they ought not to do so and it is the duty of the trial judge to warn you not to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice;\nand the following comment is made on it:\nThe latter sentence is correct; the former is an error.\nI am of opinion that the latter sentence is not correct. The learned trial judge was entitled to advise the jury not to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, or to warn them that it was dangerous to convict.\nThere was, of course, evidence before the jury corroborating the evidence of the accomplice and implicating the accused; and it was only in the event of the jury disbelieving or discarding such corroborative evidence that they were called upon to make a finding upon the uncorroborated evidence of the accomplice; and it becomes difficult to understand why the learned judge kept impressing upon the jury so many times their duty to acquit on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice. In addition to the fact that these repeated directions were wrong, they probably had the effect of leading the jury to believe that the case must be disposed of on the theory that there was no evidence corroborating the accomplice. Under all the circumstances, the repeated misdirections of the learned trial judge probably had a material effect upon the minds of the jury.\nThe appeal therefore should be dismissed.\nCrocket J.\u2014I am of opinion that the learned trial judge in his directions to the jury regarding the corroboration of the testimony of the accomplice, Wallace Pitre, went beyond the rule laid down in Rex v. Baskerville[8], and adopted by this Court in Gouin v. The King[9] and Vigeant v. The King[10]. While he had the right, if in his discretion he deemed it wise to do so, to advise the jury not to convict in the absence of independent evidence corroborating the testimony of the accomplice in some material particular implicating the accused, the effect of the several passages quoted from the judge\u2019s charge by my brother Smith is such that the jury might well have supposed that, no matter how fully they may have believed in the truth of the testimony of the accomplice, they could not convict upon it alone. The statement \u201cIf you find the evidence of Wallace Pitre has not been corroborated in the way which I have marked out then your duty is clear to acquit him\u201d could leave no other impression than that of an imperative and positive direction to acquit in the absence of corroboration. Such a direction cannot, I think, be justified within the rule, as now recognized in the Court of Criminal Appeal in England and in this Court, that a trial judge may in his discretion advise the jury not to convict upon the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice. Whatever formula judges may adopt in giving such advice, when they deem it proper to do so, it ought not to be given in language which may convey to the jury the impression that they cannot convict upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice if they are convinced beyond all reasonable doubt that the testimony of the accomplice is in fact true, and see fit thus to act upon it.\nUpon this ground as well as upon the ground of the refusal of the learned trial judge to allow Dr. Fontaine, the ballistic expert, to state his opinion as to whether or not the mortal bullet was fired from the revolver which was produced in court\u2014a question to which the Crown was entitled to have a definite answer\u2014I think the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick was fully justified under the law, as it now stands in this country, in setting aside the verdict of acquittal and ordering a new trial, and for these reasons would dismiss the appeal.

W.N. 126) set aside awards of the official arbitrator fixing the rentals to be paid on renewals of certain leases, and referred the matter back for reconsideration from the viewpoint of certain aspects of the case, with liberty to the parties to supplement the evidence already given. An appeal to this Court was quashed ([1930] Can. S.C.R. 120) for want of jurisdiction on the ground that the judgment of the Appellate Division was not a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within ss. 2 (b) and 36 of the Supreme Court Act. The arbitrator again made awards, and the Appellate Division again (41 Ont. W.N. 341) set them aside and referred the matter back, in order that the arbitrator \u201cshould, upon the existing evidence, determine\u201d the proper rentals \u201cin conformity with the considerations laid down\u201d in its first judgment. From this second judgment, special leave to appeal (refused by the Appellate Division) was asked from this Court.\nHeld: The judgment sought to be appealed from was not a \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d being not distinguishable in this respect from the one previously appealed from; and this Court was without jurisdiction to entertain an appeal.\nMOTION for an order granting special leave to appeal (refused by the Appellate Division) from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] allowing the present respondents\u2019 appeal from awards of the Official Arbitrator determining the amounts to be paid by the present respondents as rentals for the renewed terms of certain leases from the present appellant to them respectively of properties in the city of Toronto. The Appellate Division vacated and set aside the awards and referred the matter back to the arbitrator for reconsideration, with a direction that \u201cthe arbitrator must consider himself bound by the judgment affecting his previous awards,\u201d and in order \u201cthat he should, upon the existing evidence, determine in conformity with the considerations laid down in the (first) judgment of the Divisional Court what is the proper amount that should be paid by each tenant.\u201d The earlier judgment of the Appellate Division, referred to in the above quoted passages, had set aside previous awards and referred the matter back to the arbitrator for reconsideration, from the viewpoint of certain aspects of the case, with liberty to the parties to supplement the evidence already given[2]. An appeal from said earlier judgment to this Court was quashed[3] for want of jurisdiction, on the ground that the judgment appealed from was not a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within ss. 2 (b) and 36 of the Supreme Court Act.\nThe present motion was dismissed with costs, on the ground that this Court was without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\nG.R. Geary K.C. for the motion.\nF.G. McBrien contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRINFRET, J.\u2014We are all of opinion that, from the viewpoint of jurisdiction, no distinction should be made between the judgment appealed from and the first judgment of the Appellate Division which was previously before this Court.\nOn a former appeal, the present respondents had appealed from earlier awards of the official arbitrator fixing the respective rentals to be paid by them as tenants upon the renewal of certain leases of properties by the City of Toronto. The Appellate Division then set aside the awards on the ground \u201cthat the whole matter (had) been approached in an entirely erroneous way,\u201d and referred \u201cthe matter back to the arbitrator to reconsider the case\u201d from the viewpoint of certain aspects of the situation which, in the opinion of the court, had not been properly worked out upon the evidence and apparently had not been thought of by the arbitrator.\nFrom that first judgment special leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the Appellate Division to the City of Toronto, with a direction that the costs of such appeal should be costs in the cause, payable by the City in any event. But, in the course of argument of counsel for the appellant, this Court mentioned the question of its jurisdiction to hear the case, notwithstanding the order giving special leave; and argument was heard on this question as well as on the merits.\nAt the conclusion of the argument of counsel for the appellant, the court unanimously decided that the judgment appealed from was not a final judgment within the meaning of section 36 of the Supreme Court Act and within the definition of a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d given in section 2 (b) of the Act. It was held, therefore, that the Court was without jurisdiction[4].\nThe official arbitrator made a further award on the 16th December, 1929.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Ontario, that court came to the conclusion that the arbitrator had \u201centirely disregarded the judgment of the Divisional Court\u201d; and, for that reason, the awards were again vacated and set aside and the matters referred back a second time to the artitrator for reconsideration, in order \u201cthat he should, upon the existing evidence, determine in conformity with the considerations laid down in the (first) judgment of the Divisional Court * * * the proper amount that should be paid by each tenant.\u201d\nUpon a motion made unto the Appellate Division on behalf of the City of Toronto for an order granting special leave to appeal to this Court from the latter judgment, leave was refused for the reason, verbally stated, \u201cthat leave could not be given because the decision of the said court * * * was not a \u2018final judgment\u2019.\u201d\nIn our view, the second judgment does not add anything to the first judgment of the Appellate Division. All that it says is that the purport and the salient propositions of the first judgment were well known to the arbitrator; that he ought to have been guided by them; that he has disregarded them in his amended award; and that the matter should go back to him a second time with the intimation that he should determine the amount to be paid by each tenant in conformity with the considerations laid down in the first judgment.\nIf, as was decided by this Court, the first judgment was not a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within the meaning of the Supreme Court Act, the second judgment, which, in our view, goes no further than the first, must also be held not to come within the definition of a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d as given in section 2 (b) of the Act. This Court is without jurisdiction, and the motion for an order granting special leave to appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.M.

(1) The sums heretofore or hereafter appropriated and set apart to aid actual construction work for the protection, safety and convenience of the public in respect of highway crossings of railways at rail level shall be placed to the credit of a special account to be known as \u201cThe Railway Grade Crossing Fund,\u201d and shall (in so far as not already applied) be applied by the Board, subject to the limitations hereinafter set out, solely towards the cost, not including that of maintenance and operation, of actual construction work for the protection, safety and convenience of the public in respect of crossings (railway crossings of highways or highway crossings of railways) at rail level in existence on the first day of April, one thousand nine hundred and nine, and in respect of existing crossings (railway crossings of highway or highway crossings of railways) at rail level, constructed after the first day of April, one thousand nine hundred and nine, provided, however, that the Board shall not apply any moneys out of The Railway Grade Crossing Fund towards the cost of the actual construction work, for the protection, safety and convenience of the public in respect of any existing crossing (railway crossing of a highway or highway crossing of a railway), at rail level, constructed after the first day of April, one thousand nine hundred and nine, unless and except an agreement, approved of by the Board, has been entered into between the company and a municipal or other corporation or person by which agreement the municipal or other corporation or person has agreed with the company to bear a portion of the cost of the actual construction work for the protection, safety and convenience of the public in respect of such crossing (railway crossing of a highway or highway crossing of a railway), at rail level, constructed after the first day of April, one thousand nine hundred and nine.\nThe limitations referred to in the above subsection are set out in subsection 2 of the amending Act (c. 43 of S.C. 1928) and are not material here.\n\u201cCrossing,\u201d for the purposes of section 262, is defined as follows in subsection 4:\n(4) In this section \u201ccrossing\u201d means any railway crossing of a highway, or any highway crossing of a railway, at rail level, and every manner of construction of the railway or of the highway by the elevation or the depression of the one above or below the other, or by the diversion of the one or the other and any other work ordered by the Board to be provided as one work of protection, safety and convenience for the public in respect of one or more raiways of as many tracks crossing or so crossed as in the discretion of the Board determined.\nWe are not concerned with the other subsections of section 262.\nThe \u201cRailway Grade Crossing Fund\u201d was created by c. 32 of the statute of Canada 8-9 Edw. VII, to be applied by the Board solely towards the cost (not including that of maintenance and operation), of actual construction work * * * for the purpose of providing * * * protection, safety and convenience for the public in respect of highway crossings of the railway at rail level (Section 7 of c. 43 of 1909).\nAs originally enacted, the legislation was limited to crossings in existence on the 1st day of April, 1909; but its application was gradually extended by subsequent amendments until it assumed its present form in section 262 already reproduced in part at the beginning of this judgment.\nThe fund is made up of appropriations set apart from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada and of such contributions as the provinces are willing to make, subject to the conditions and restrictions they may impose.\nWe now quote from the case stated by the Board:\nIn dealing with an application for a contribution from The Railway Grade Crossing Fund towards the cost of diversion of a highway which would withdraw a considerable portion of highway traffic from two crossings of the railway, neither of which, however, was closed, the then Chief Commissioner Carvell, in a memorandum dated June 9, 1921, said:\n\u201cI do not think this application can be favourably considered. In my opinion the intention of the Railway Grade Crossing Fund, the appropriation for which is provided for by Section 262 of the Railway Act, is for the protection, safety and convenience of the public in respect of the railway crossing itself, that is, either that the crossing must be eliminated or the protection provided must be such that the danger is lessened and the safety and convenience of the public increased.\nIn subsection (4) of the said section, \u2018crossing\u2019 is defined as\u2014\u2019any steam railway crossing of a highway, or highway crossing of a railway, at rail level, and every manner of construction of the railway or of the highway by the elevation or the depression of the one above the other, or by the diversion of the one or the other, and any other work ordered by the Board to be provided as one work of protection, safety and convenience for the public in respect of one or more railways not exceeding four tracks in all crossing or so crossed.\nWhile it might be argued that the diversion referred to southwest of the Village of Acton will withdraw some of the traffic from the two crossings of the Grand Trunk Railway now existing, yet it in no way reduces the danger or increases the safety and convenience of the crossings themselves. The individual will be just as liable to an accident at either of these crossings after the new highway is constructed as at the present time, the only difference being there will not be as many individuals who possibly might meet with an accident.\nMoreover, I cannot see that the construction of this new highway comes under the definition of \u2018any other work ordered by the Board to be provided as one work of protection,\u2019 etc. This Board has nothing whatever to do with it. Were a grant made in this case, every municipality in Canada which builds a road that might, by argument, withdraw traffic from an existing railway crossing, would be entitled to come to this Board for a contribution. Another question would arise, were we to decide to grant a contribution from the Grade Crossing Fund, as to upon what basis it should be levied. Would be on the cost of .the highway between the two crossings, or would it extend to the east or west (thereof?\nThe whole question present so many difficulties that I think the application should be refused.\u201d\nIn 1928 this view was modified by Chief Commissioner MeKeown, and the following issued as a ruling by the Board:\n\u201cIn the case of highway diversions made for the protection, safety and convenience of the public in respect of highway crossings or railways at rail level whereby such crossings are relieved from a substantial volume of highway traffic, a proper contribution to the expense of such highway diversion may be made from The Railway Grade Crossing Fund although the complete elimination of such crossing be not possible in every instance, and such contributions will be accordingly so ordered.\u201d\nApplications for contributions from the Fund are now pending before the Board in the case of highway diversions which would relieve existing highway rail level crossings from a substantial volume of traffic and which, under the later ruling, would be entitled to grants from The Railway Grade Crossing Fund.\nIt is because of the conflict of views referred to and to determine definitely the Board\u2019s authority that the opinion of the Court is sought by the Board.\nIt does not appear to us that, when enacting the legislation in question, Parliament intended to confer on the Board any special power distinct and independent from its normal railway jurisdiction. The fund was appropriated by Parliament towards actual construction work for the protection, safety and convenience of the public in respect of highway crossings of railways at rail level, and the Board was not to allow contributions from that fund, except in dealing with works over which it held jurisdiction and as an incident of the exercise of its ordinary powers in railway matters. The statute does not contemplate that direct applications for payments out of the fund may be made to the Board to aid works outside the sphere of its usual competence. The intention was that when the Board was regularly seized of an application in respect of an existing crossing at rail level (railway crossing of a highway or highway crossing of a railway), it might, when granting the application and subject to certain conditions and restrictions, order at the same time that a certain sum be allowed out of the Crossing Fund to aid the actual construction work ordered by it. This view is supported by the definition of \u201cCrossing\u201d as applying to that word in section 262. It refers to\na work ordered by the Board to be provided as one work of protection, safety and convenience for the public in respect of one or more railways of as many tracks crossing or so crossed as in the discretion of the Board determined.\nThe section of the Act under which the Board has jurisdiction to make such an order, in respect of an existing crossing, is section 257. That section empowers the Board to order protection works at or on the crossing. In the exercise of the powers so given to it, the Board may order that a highway be permanently diverted, but its jurisdiction in that respect is limited to that portion of the highway which lies at the crossing proper. It\nis confined entirely to the extinguishment of the public right to cross the railway company\u2019s right of way at that particular spot. (In re Closing Highways at Railway Crossings)[1].\nThe authority of the Board upon the highway exists only so far as concerns the crossing. Otherwise, the highway remains under the control of the provincial or municipal authorities and, in the words of Chief Commissioner Carveil, \u201cthe Board has nothing whatever to do with it.\u201d\nMoreover, the question submitted assumes that the rail level crossing will not be eliminated. It follows that there will be no highway diversion at the crossing. The highway will continue to cross the railway. The new highway whereby it is claimed that the crossing is relieved from a substantial volume of traffic, was or will be constructed by the provincial or the municipal authorities entirely of their own motion, without any intervention of the Board and, in fact, without the Board having any right to interfere. It does not, therefore, come within the definition of \u201ccrossing\u201d in section 262 as being\none work * * * in respect of one or more railways of as many tracks crossing or so crossed as in the discretion of the Board determined;\nnor does it come within the classification of construction works ordered or authorized by the Board \u201cin respect of highway crossings of railways at rail level.\u201d\nOur conclusion is that the question submitted ought to be answered in the negative.\nIt is ordered that the matter be remitted to the Board of Railway Commissioners with the present opinion, which will be certified to the Board as being the opinion of the Court on the subject referred to.\nThere will be no costs on the reference.\nQuestion answered in the negative.\n[1] 15 Can.

Cook, [1933] S.C.R. 86\nDate: 1932-12-23.\nAsbestos Corporation Limited (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nWilliam A. Cook (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1932: May 19; 1932: December 23.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Rinfret, Smith and Cannon JJ.\nOn Appeal From The Court Of King\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, Province Of Quebec\nContract\u2014Lease or hire of personal services\u2014Engagement at so much per year\u2014Whether yearly or for an unlimited term\u2014Dismissal\u2014Claim for full year salary\u2014Tacit renewal\u2014Arts. 1642, 1667, 1668, 1670 C.C.\nThe respondent alleged a verbal contract of lease or hire of his services as Assistant Manager of the appellant company \u201cat an annual salary of $6,000 per annum dating from 1st of May, 1927, payable $500 a month\u201d with the free use and occupancy of a dwelling house belonging to the company; and he further alleged that this oral agreement had been confirmed by a letter from the president of the company, dated 5th May, 1927, as follows: \u201cMr. Cook has agreed to join us on the conditions mentioned at $6,000 per annum, and use of Penhale\u2019s house.\u201d The appellant company alleged the oral agreement was for hire from month to month; but the only evidence tendered on either side was the letter of the 5th of May. The respondent continued in the discharge of his duties until the 31st August, 1929, when he was dismissed and paid $1,875, being his salary to that date plus three months\u2019 pay in lieu of notice. The respondent then brought an action claiming the balance of his salary up to the 1st of May, 1930, on the ground that he was entitled to his salary up to the end of the current year.\nHeld, Anglin C.J.C. and Cannon J., dissenting, that the respondent was not entitled to the surplus of salary claimed by him.\nHeld, also, that the respective claims of the parties must be determined by the terms of the letter, as no other evidence had been adduced. According to its literal meaning, a contract of lease or hire of personal services at so much per year or month is not a contract for a fixed term but one for an indeterminate period; and there is no provision in the Civil Code to the effect that a contract of hire of personal services, whose duration has not been agreed upon, will be deemed to have been made for one year when the salary has been fixed at so much per year. Article 1642 of the Civil Code, relating to the lease or hire of houses, is not applicable to lease or hire of personal services.\nAnglin C.J.C. (dissenting) was of the opinion that, under the circumstances of the case, a new trial should be ordered.\nPer Cannon J. dissenting.\u2014According to the terms of the letter coupled with the circumstances of the case fully detailed in the reasons for judgment, the engagement of the respondent\u2019s services by the appellant company was for a term of one year; and such contract had been continued from year to year by tacit renewal.

L. Ralston K.C. and J. D. Kearney K.C. for the appellant.\nE. Languedoc K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Duff, Rinfret and Smith JJ.) was delivered by\nRinfret, J.\u2014L\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait demandeur devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de l\u2019appelante, et il l\u2019a poursuivie en r\u00e9clamation de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats sous pr\u00e9texte de renvoi sans cause et sans avis de cong\u00e9 suffisant. Il a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 un engagement verbal\nat an annual salary of $6,000 per annum dating from the 1st of May 1927, payable $500 a month,\navec, en plus, le droit d\u2019habiter gratuitement une maison appartenant \u00e0 la compagnie, pendant la dur\u00e9e de son engagement. Il a ajout\u00e9 que le contrat d\u2019engagement verbal avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par une lettre, en date du 5 mai 1927, dans les termes suivants:\nMr Cook has agreed to join us on the conditions mentioned, $6,000 per annum and use of Penhale\u2019s house.\nOr, le 29 ao\u00fbt 1929, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a re\u00e7u avis de cong\u00e9 avec trois mois d\u2019indemnit\u00e9. Il a alors fait valoir que l\u2019engagement qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, \u00e9tait pour une ann\u00e9e se terminant le 1er mai 1928 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9 par tacite reconduction jusqu\u2019au 1er mai 1929, puis, de nouveau, jusqu\u2019au 1er mai 1930, et qu\u2019il ne pouvait \u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9 avant cette date; ou, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, qu\u2019il avait droit \u00e0 son salaire et \u00e0 une compensation pour l\u2019occupation de la maison jusqu\u2019\u00e0 cette date.\nDans son plaidoyer, la compagnie a admis la lettre: mais elle a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que le contrat \u00e9tait pour un engagement \u201cfrom month to month\u201d; et, en outre, elle a invoqu\u00e9 justification pour le renvoi. A l\u2019ouverture de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, le procureur de la compagnie fit la d\u00e9claration suivante:\nDefendant declares it has no proof to offer in support of the allegation that the dismissal was for cause, and the issue is, therefore, limited to the question of law as to whether there was an annual engagement expiring on May 1st, 1930.\nDans ses termes, cette d\u00e9claration \u00e9cartait la question de renvoi pour cause, mais elle laissait subsister les deux autres questions d\u00e9battues jusque-l\u00e0 entre les parties: la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019engagement et la dur\u00e9e de son renouvellement, s\u2019il y avait eu tacite reconduction. Je ne crois pas que l\u2019on puisse dire que le d\u00e9bat a \u00e9t\u00e9 autrement limit\u00e9 pour se borner \u00e0 l\u2019unique question de la tacite reconduction. Cela ne ressort pas du texte de la d\u00e9claration faite par le procureur de la compagnie; et si les parties l\u2019eussent interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e dans ce sens restreint le juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019aurait pas manqu\u00e9 de le consigner dans son jugement. Or, on n\u2019y trouve aucune trace de cette restriction, non plus d\u2019ailleurs que dans les notes des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi. En l\u2019absence d\u2019entente entre les procureurs des parties sur ce point, je ne vois pas comment on pourrait y donner effet. Voici d\u2019ailleurs comment l\u2019intim\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame nous soumet le litige dans son factum:\nPoints in issue.\nAs has already been noted, the Appellant has abandoned all pretence of complaint against the Respondent as cause for his dismissal. We take it, therefore, that no question arises but this: Was the contract of engagement an annual one in the intention of the parties, or was it not?\nA l\u2019enqu\u00eate devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, malgr\u00e9 que les deux parties eussent invoqu\u00e9 un contrat verbal effectu\u00e9 entre le pr\u00e9sident de la compagnie et l\u2019intim\u00e9, le 1er mai 1927, ni l\u2019une, ni l\u2019autre n\u2019a tent\u00e9 de faire la preuve de ce contrat. Il n\u2019y a pas un mot au dossier de ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 ce jour-l\u00e0 entre le pr\u00e9sident de la compagnie et l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nToute la preuve consiste dans un examen pr\u00e9alable (on discovery) o\u00f9 la lettre du 5 mai 1927 fut produite, mais qui, au surplus, porte exclusivement sur les all\u00e9gations de renvoi pour cause. En outre, devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est content\u00e9 de fournir des d\u00e9tails sur la maison qu\u2019il avait d\u00fb louer \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 la suite de son d\u00e9part de Thetford-Mines, et de comparer cette maison avec celle que la compagnie avait mise \u00e0 sa disposition. Il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019il a offert cette preuve dans le but d\u2019\u00e9tablir sa r\u00e9clamation pour la valeur d\u2019occupation de cette maison pendant le reste du temps o\u00f9, d\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, son emploi aurait d\u00fb continuer. Il dit bien qu\u2019avant de se rendre \u00e0 Thetford-Mines pour prendre charge de ses fonctions il habitait la ville de Westmount; mais il ne le dit que d\u2019une fa\u00e7on incidente, au cours de la preuve relative \u00e0 la valeur de l\u2019occupation. Il ne dit pas que cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9e avec le pr\u00e9sident de la compagnie le 1er mai 1927, lorsque les conditions de son engagement furent arr\u00eat\u00e9es. Il ne dit pas non plus qu\u2019il a d\u00fb r\u00e9silier le bail de sa r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 Westmount pour se rendre \u00e0 Thetford-Mines, ou que ce changement de domicile lui ait caus\u00e9 le moindre inconv\u00e9nient. Il suffit de lire son t\u00e9moignage pour constater qu\u2019il ne r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 cet incident en aucune fa\u00e7on comme \u00e0 une circonstance qui pouvait \u00eatre de nature \u00e0 affecter les conditions de son engagement. Il ne sugg\u00e8re m\u00eame pas que l\u2019obligation de transf\u00e9rer son domicile \u00e0 Thetford-Mines a eu le moindre effet sur sa d\u00e9cision d\u2019accepter l\u2019engagement. Pour tout ce que l\u2019on en sait: l\u2019on \u00e9tait au 1er mai 1927; d\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi (Art. 1642 C.C.), en l\u2019absence de convention contraire, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, les baux finissent \u201cle 1er jour de mai de chaque ann\u00e9e\u201d, et la pr\u00e9somption est plut\u00f4t que son bail \u00e0 Westmount \u00e9tait termin\u00e9.\nSi toutefois cette question peut avoir la moindre importance, il est exact de dire que, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019on ignore absolument tout des circonstances o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 se trouvait lorsqu\u2019il a accept\u00e9 le contrat d\u2019engagement avec l\u2019appelante. L\u2019on ne sait m\u00eame pas s\u2019il avait un emploi au moment o\u00f9 il a fait ce contrat; et il est tout aussi vraisemblable de pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 cet engagement comme tr\u00e8s avantageux et qu\u2019il s\u2019est empress\u00e9 de l\u2019accepter, que l\u2019on est en droit de supposer le contraire.\nToujours est-il que les parties ont laiss\u00e9 la cour sans aucune preuve du contrat verbal qu\u2019elles avaient all\u00e9gu\u00e9, et qu\u2019elles semblent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaites de laisser d\u00e9cider la cause sur la lettre du 5 mai 1927. La situation ainsi cr\u00e9\u00e9e par les parties s\u2019est donc trouv\u00e9e la suivante:\nLe demandeur a invoqu\u00e9 un contrat verbal pour un an. La compagnie a pr\u00e9tendu que c\u2019\u00e9tait un contrat verbal \u201cfrom month to month\u201d. Entre les deux, jusque-l\u00e0, la question \u00e9tait une question de preuve, o\u00f9 les pr\u00e9somptions de fait sont admises comme tout autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve. Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu la version des deux c\u00f4t\u00e9s, le juge aurait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 quels \u00e9taient les termes exacts du contrat, en tenant compte des pr\u00e9somptions de fait, et il aurait jug\u00e9 en cons\u00e9quence. Pour rendre son jugement, dans cette cause-ci comme dans toute autre cause, il aurait pu tirer des faits les pr\u00e9somptions qui en r\u00e9sultaient.\nMais il reste que, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la preuve des faits n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte. Le demandeur s\u2019est content\u00e9 de la lettre du 5 mai et en est rest\u00e9 l\u00e0. Les parties ont jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de soumettre leur cause sur cette lettre. La preuve du contrat se r\u00e9sume donc \u00e0 cette lettre. Par suite de la fa\u00e7on dont les parties ont proc\u00e9d\u00e9, la cause se pr\u00e9sente exactement comme s\u2019il y avait un contrat d\u2019engagement par \u00e9crit; et le r\u00e9sultat d\u00e9pend de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que l\u2019on doit donner \u00e0 cet \u00e9crit.\nNous comprenons parfaitement que si le juge de premi\u00e8re instance s\u2019\u00e9tait trouv\u00e9 en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une preuve verbale o\u00f9 le demandeur aurait affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9 pour un an et o\u00f9 les t\u00e9moignages de la part de la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse auraient pr\u00e9tendu le contraire, il aurait pu tirer du fait que le prix convenu \u00e9tait de $6,000 par ann\u00e9e la pr\u00e9somption que l\u2019engagement \u00e9tait pour un an, et, par cons\u00e9quent, que la version du demandeur \u00e9tait la vraie. Mais ici, encore une fois, nous n\u2019avons la version ni de l\u2019une, ni de l\u2019autre des parties contractantes. Elles nous soumettent seulement un \u00e9crit, la lettre du 5 mai 1927. Elles font reposer toute leur cause sur cet \u00e9crit et elles nous demandent de d\u00e9cider quel a \u00e9t\u00e9 le contrat en vertu des termes de cet \u00e9crit. Nous ne voyons pas pourquoi nous proc\u00e9derions autrement que dans toutes les autres causes qui d\u00e9pendent de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation d\u2019un \u00e9crit et nous nous inspirerions des circonstances qui ont entour\u00e9 le contrat, except\u00e9 dans le cas o\u00f9 l\u2019\u00e9crit serait ambigu. Il s\u2019agit donc de d\u00e9cider quelle est la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019engagement du demandeur d\u2019apr\u00e8s le texte de l\u2019\u00e9crit qu\u2019il a produit comme l\u2019unique preuve de cet engagement.\nL\u2019on est convenu de consid\u00e9rer l\u2019engagement du demandeur comme \u00e9tant un louage d\u2019ouvrage r\u00e9gi par les articles 1666 et suiv. du Code civil. Le chapitre du code qui traite de ce contrat, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9fini \u201cles principales esp\u00e8ces d\u2019ouvrages qui peuvent \u00eatre lou\u00e9s\u201d, ne contient que trois articles qui peuvent s\u2019appliquer au cas dont il s\u2019agit: les articles 1667, 1668 et 1670. Ils sont \u00e0 l\u2019effet que le contrat de louage de services personnels ne peut \u00eatre que pour un temps limit\u00e9 ou pour une entreprise d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Il peut \u00eatre continu\u00e9 par tacite reconduction. Il se termine par le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de la partie engag\u00e9e, ou lorsque, sans sa faute, elle devient incapable de remplir le service convenu. Il se termine aussi, en certains cas, par le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du locataire, suivant les circonstances.\nLes droits et obligations r\u00e9sultant du bail de services personnels sont assujettis aux r\u00e8gles communes aux contrats. Ils sont aussi, dans les campagnes, sous certains rapports, r\u00e9gis par une loi sp\u00e9ciale; et, dans les villes et villages, par les r\u00e8glements municipaux.\nOn a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle qui veut que le louage de services personnels ne puisse \u00eatre que pour un temps limit\u00e9 comme voulant dire qu\u2019un contrat de ce genre ne peut \u00eatre fait pour toute la vie du locateur, ou pour une p\u00e9riode de temps qui \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 une location permanente. Mais la doctrine et la jurisprudence n\u2019ont jamais compris qu\u2019un louage de services personnels ne pouvait \u00eatre fait pour un temps ind\u00e9termin\u00e9. La seule cons\u00e9quence d\u2019un contrat de ce genre est que l\u2019une des parties peut s\u2019en lib\u00e9rer en donnant un avis de cong\u00e9 raisonnable.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s le sens litt\u00e9ral de l\u2019expression, un contrat \u00e0 tant par an ou \u00e0 tant par mois n\u2019est pas un contrat pour une p\u00e9riode fixe, mais est un contrat pour une p\u00e9riode de temps ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\nCe qui d\u00e9montre clairement que c\u2019est l\u00e0 \u00e0 la fois le sens des mots et le sens dans lequel les codificateurs du code ont compris ces mots, c\u2019est l\u2019article 1642 C.C. Cet article traite un bail de maison dont \u201cle loyer est de tant par an\u201d ou \u201cde tant par mois\u201d ou de \u201ctant par jour\u201d comme un bail dont \u201cla dur\u00e9e n\u2019en est pas fix\u00e9e\u201d; et il pose la r\u00e8gle particuli\u00e8re qu\u2019un bail de maison ainsi consenti sera \u201ccens\u00e9 fait \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e, finissant au premier jour de mai de chaque ann\u00e9e, lorsque le loyer est de tant par an\u201d, etc.\nCette exception fait bien comprendre que, tant d\u2019apr\u00e8s le sens des mots que dans l\u2019esprit des codificateurs, le louage de services personnels \u00e0 \u201ctant par an\u201d est un louage dont, pour me servir des expressions du code, \u201cla dur\u00e9e n\u2019est pas fix\u00e9e\u201d.\nOr, il n\u2019y a rien dans le Code civil \u00e0 l\u2019effet que le contrat de louage de services personnels dont la dur\u00e9e n\u2019est pas fix\u00e9e sera cens\u00e9 fait \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e, lorsque le salaire est de tant par an, etc. L\u2019article 1670 du Code civil, qui s\u2019applique au contrat de louage de services personnels, ne r\u00e9f\u00e8re pas \u00e0 l\u2019article 1642; mais il dit que\nles droits et obligations r\u00e9sultant du bail de services personnels sont assujettis -aux r\u00e8gles communes aux contrats.\nL\u2019article 1642 n\u2019est pas une r\u00e8gle commune aux contrats; ce n\u2019est m\u00eame pas une r\u00e8gle commune \u00e0 tous les contrats de louage des choses; c\u2019est, comme le titre le dit et comme le texte l\u2019indique, une r\u00e8gle particuli\u00e8re au bail de maison. Il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019analogie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale entre un contrat de louage de services personnels et un bail de maison. Je ne vois pas comment on pourrait dire qu\u2019un louage de services personnels dont la dur\u00e9e n\u2019est pas fix\u00e9e serait cens\u00e9 finir \u201cau premier jour de mai de chaque ann\u00e9e\u201d\u2014ce qui serait la cons\u00e9quence de l\u2019application de l\u2019article 1642; et, si le code avait entendu subordonner \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle le contrat de louage de services personnels, il est difficile de comprendre pourquoi il aurait sp\u00e9cialement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que c\u2019est une r\u00e8gle particuli\u00e8re au bail de maison et pourquoi, dans l\u2019article 1670 C.C., il se serait content\u00e9 de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u201caux r\u00e8gles communes aux contrats\u201d.\nSi l\u2019on examine la jurisprudence, l\u2019on trouve deux d\u00e9cisions de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure o\u00f9 un engagement \u00e0 tant par ann\u00e9e para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme un engagement \u201c\u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e\u201d (Tardif v. Ville de Maisonneuve)[1], ou comme \u201ca yearly engagement\u201d (Silver v. Standard Gold Mines[2].\nIl resterait naturellement \u00e0 se demander si un engagement \u201c\u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e\u201d veut dire la m\u00eame chose qu\u2019un engagement pour un an\u2014et, de prime abord, il para\u00eet certainement y avoir entre les deux une nuance importante.\nMais si l\u2019on consulte les autres arr\u00eats qui sont rapport\u00e9s, l\u2019on trouve d\u2019abord, en 1853, le jugement dans Lennan v. The St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad Company (Day, Smith & Mondelet JJ.)[3], o\u00f9 il fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que, dans un contrat de louage d\u2019ouvrage, les mots \u201cyour remuneration will be at the rate of \u00a3300 per annum from the 1st May next\u201d ne constituaient pas un engagement pour un an et qu\u2019un contrat de cette esp\u00e8ce cesse au gr\u00e9 de l\u2019une ou de l\u2019autre des parties.\nDans cette cause, comme dans la pr\u00e9sente, les termes de l\u2019engagement \u00e9taient contenus dans une lettre. Monsieur le juge Day, qui a prononc\u00e9 le jugement de la cour, a pos\u00e9 le principe suivant:\nThe general rule of law in this country is, that when parties engage in service, the contract is determinable at the option of either party. Pothier goes further, and says, at the option of the party who hires. It is true, the reference in the books is to domestiques, but the same rule applies here. If nothing is said as to time, the contract is determinable at the option of either party. If the engagement in this case had been specifically for a year, we should have no difficulty in saying there was a tacite reconduction for the second year; but the terms of the letter do not justify this opinion. It would be going a great way to say that because a salary is fixed at the rate of so much a year, the engagement is for a year (Troplong, Louage, No. 862, and Pothier, there quoted).\nCet arr\u00eat para\u00eet certainement \u00eatre le jugement le plus important sur cette question qui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu avant le Code civil.\nApr\u00e8s le code, nous trouvons les jugements de la Cour du Banc de la Reine dans les causes de: The City of Montreal v. Dugdale[4], et Commissaires des Chemins \u00e0 Barri\u00e8res de Montr\u00e9al vs Rielle[5].\nCes jugements sont respectivement des ann\u00e9es 1880 et 1890.\nDans la premi\u00e8re de ces causes4, le rapport ne fait pas voir les conditions pr\u00e9cises de l\u2019engagement. Monsieur le juge Ramsay, qui faisait partie de la majorit\u00e9, emploie, au cours de son jugement, les expressions suivantes (p. 153): \u201cengaged them for the year 1870 at the rate of $500\u201d, et (page 155):\nA question has been raised whether his re-engagement by tacite reconduction gives him a right to his salary for his services for the period of a year, the original engagement being for that period.\nDe ce jugement, il r\u00e9sulterait que l\u2019engagement du docteur Dugdale \u00e9tait originairement pour une p\u00e9riode fixe d\u2019un an.\nL\u2019arr\u00eat dans la cause de Rielle5 para\u00eet \u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019un salaire de tant par ann\u00e9e constitue un contrat de louage pour une ann\u00e9e, sujet \u00e0 tacite reconduction. Le jugement fut rendu, pour la cour, par monsieur le juge Boss\u00e9, qui fait allusion \u00e0 la jurisprudence en France et \u00e0 la Cour de cassation qui, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 1859, d\u00e9clarait que les engagements de cette nature \u00e9taient pour un temps ind\u00e9termin\u00e9 et, lorsqu\u2019ils \u00e9taient rompus par le ma\u00eetre, qu\u2019il y avait lieu contre lui aux dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nDepuis 1859 (ajoute monsieur le juge Boss\u00e9) l\u2019on trouve de cette m\u00eame cour six arr\u00eats diff\u00e9rente qui jugent le contraire. Mais la doctrine semble condamner cette jurisprudence; et les auteurs les plus r\u00e9cents expriment tous le d\u00e9sir de voir la cour revenir \u00e0 sa premi\u00e8re opinion.\nPuis, il cite: Laurent, vol. 25, nos 511 \u00e0 517; 4 Aubry & Rau, p. 514: Dalloz, vbo Louage d\u2019ouvrage, n08 50 \u00e0 54.\nCes citations permettent de comprendre exactement le sens de cette partie du jugement. Tant avant qu\u2019apr\u00e8s 1859, la Cour de cassation et les auteurs cit\u00e9s consid\u00e9raient les engagements de cette nature comme \u00e9tant pour un temps ind\u00e9termin\u00e9; et la discussion ne portait pas sur ce point, mais sur la question de savoir si le louage d\u2019ouvrage ou de services fait pour un temps ind\u00e9termin\u00e9 peut prendre fin par la seule volont\u00e9 des parties. Laurent (loc. cit.) dit ce qui suit:\nIl s\u2019ensuit que celui qui veut faire cesser la convention doit manifester sa volont\u00e9 en donnant cong\u00e9 \u00e0. l\u2019autre, et le cong\u00e9 implique un certain, d\u00e9lai dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de celui \u00e0 qui il est donn\u00e9; si le d\u00e9lai n\u2019est pas suffisant, il y a lieu \u00e0 dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. (Dalloz, 1876-2-72.)\nAucun des auteurs cit\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9met l\u2019opinion qu\u2019un contrat de louage de services \u00e0 tant par ann\u00e9e est un contrat pour un an. Ils prennent, au contraire, pour acquis que c\u2019est un contrat fait pour un temps ind\u00e9termin\u00e9 et ils discutent la question de savoir de quelle fa\u00e7on les parties peuvent y mettre fin.\nL\u2019Honorable juge Boss\u00e9 poursuit ensuite, en comparant l\u2019arr\u00eat de Lennan v. St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad Company[6] et celui de Corporation de Montr\u00e9al v. Dugdale[7] dont il dit, \u00e0 tort suivant nous, que la cour y aurait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u201cqu\u2019un engagement de cette nature \u00e9tait pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e\u201d (car nous croyons que le rapport ne fait pas voir cela mais que, comme nous avons tent\u00e9 de le d\u00e9montrer, le jugement de monsieur le juge Ramsay indiquerait que le contrat \u00e9tait pour une p\u00e9riode fixe d\u2019un an); et il adopte le point de vue que l\u2019arr\u00eat re Dugdale7 \u201cest plus logique et plus conforme \u00e0 nos m\u0153urs\u201d. Il ajoute:\nDans cette province un commis, employ\u00e9 dans une grande compagnie de chemin de fer ou autre, est, \u00e0 moins de circonstances sp\u00e9ciales d\u00e9montrant le contraire, engag\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e, il est cens\u00e9 ne pas avoir voulu s\u2019exposer \u00e0 un renvoi sans autre motif que le caprice ou l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du ma\u00eetre, et se trouver sans emploi \u00e0 une saison de l\u2019ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 les engagements ne sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas faits. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9 le ma\u00eetre ne peut \u00eatre cens\u00e9 avoir voulu s\u2019exposer \u00e0 tous les inconv\u00e9nients qui pourraient lui r\u00e9sulter de ce que, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, un ou plusieurs de ses employ\u00e9s quitteraient ses bureaux.\nLe passage qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de d\u00e9montrerait qu\u2019il devait se trouver dans le dossier de la cause de Rielle[8] toute une preuve \u00e9tablissant, sous ce rapport, les m\u0153urs de cette province, sans quoi nous ne nous expliquerions pas que le savant juge ait pu prendre connaissance d\u2019office et son raisonnement manquerait de fondement juridique.\nAussi sommes-nous port\u00e9s \u00e0 nous ranger du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019avis de la Cour du Banc du Roi dans Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al v. Davis[9], o\u00f9 l\u2019Honorable juge Lacoste, pronon\u00e7ant le jugement de la majorit\u00e9 de la cour, parle ainsi des deux causes auxquelles nous venons de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment (page 192):\nOn nous a cit\u00e9 les causes de Dugdale et La cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[10] et de Les commissaires des chemins \u00e0 barri\u00e8res de Montr\u00e9al et Rielle8, o\u00f9 l\u2019on pr\u00e9tend que cette cour aurait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019un louage de services \u00e0 tant par ann\u00e9e \u00e9tait un engagement \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e. Il est impossible de conna\u00eetre par les rapports toutes les circonstances de ces actions. Dans Dugdale et La cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al10, les juges \u00e9taient partag\u00e9s d\u2019opinion. Dans Les commissaires des chemins \u00e0 barri\u00e8res de Montr\u00e9al et Rielle8, les employ\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9taient pas renvoy\u00e9s au bon plaisir des commissaires. Je ne crois pas que notre cour ait tir\u00e9 de la fixation du salaire \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e une pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale de la dur\u00e9e du contrat. Je ne connais aucun texte de loi qui cr\u00e9e une semblable pr\u00e9somption en mati\u00e8re de louage de services. C\u2019est tout au plus une pr\u00e9somption de fait qui a plus ou moins de force suivant les circonstances. Dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019engagement a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 le 1er ao\u00fbt sans dur\u00e9e d\u00e9finie, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019usage suivi. Ce n\u2019est que deux mois apr\u00e8s que le salaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 dans une r\u00e9solution o\u00f9 il n\u2019y a aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019engagement, lequel n\u2019a pas, en cons\u00e9quence, \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 dans sa dur\u00e9e laquelle est rest\u00e9e ind\u00e9finie.\nCe passage du jugement est important, d\u2019abord pour indiquer l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que la Cour du Banc du Roi ellem\u00eame donnait, en 1897, aux arr\u00eats de cette cour dans les causes de Dugdale10 et de Rielle8. Puis il d\u00e9finit bien clairement le principe:\nJe ne crois pas que notre cour ait tir\u00e9 de la fixation du salaire \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e une pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale de la dur\u00e9e du contrat. Je ne connais aucun texte de loi qui cr\u00e9e une semblable pr\u00e9somption en mati\u00e8re de louage de services. Ce n\u2019est pas l\u00e0 un principe pos\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement pour les fins de la cause de Davis[11]; c\u2019est l\u2019\u00e9nonciation d\u2019un principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Il est vrai de dire que, dans cette cause de Davis11, le point principal \u00e9tait de d\u00e9cider si la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al avait le droit de renvoyer ses employ\u00e9s suivant \u201cson bon plaisir\u201d et \u201c\u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion\u201d, sans cong\u00e9 pr\u00e9alable. Mais je ne vois pas comment on peut lire ce jugement sans comprendre qu\u2019il a \u00e9galement une port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019il faut donner \u00e0 un contrat de louage de services o\u00f9 le salaire est stipul\u00e9 \u00e0 tant par an.\nSir Alexandre Lacoste (page 191)11 dit:\nLa r\u00e9solution du 1er ao\u00fbt 1892 qui le nomme, ne d\u00e9termine pas la dur\u00e9e de son engagement. Celle du 3 octobre fixe le salaire \u00e0 tant par an, mais l\u2019ann\u00e9e ici n\u2019est prise en consid\u00e9ration, dans notre opinion, que pour la fixation du salaire. Pothier (Louage 176), Troplong (Louage 862) nous donnent des exemples de ce genre. Voy. Rolland de Villargues, vo. Bail d\u2019ouvrage et d\u2019industrie, nos 24, 25.\nPuis, dans le jugement de la cour, on trouve le consid\u00e9rant suivant:\nConsid\u00e9rant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9 pour une dur\u00e9e limit\u00e9e et d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\nCe consid\u00e9rant n\u2019a \u00e9videmment rien \u00e0 voir avec le pouvoir sp\u00e9cial de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al de d\u00e9mettre ses employ\u00e9s suivant son bon plaisir. C\u2019est clairement l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du contrat de Davis, dont le salaire \u00e9tait fix\u00e9 \u00e0 tant par ann\u00e9e.\nCette cause de Davis11 vint ensuite devant la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, o\u00f9 le jugement de la cour[12] fut prononc\u00e9 par l\u2019honorable juge Taschereau et o\u00f9 l\u2019on trouve le passage suivant (page 544):\nChief Justice Sir Alexandre Lacoste\u2019s reasoning for the Court, on both parts of the claim, seems to be unanswerable and I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nLe jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi dans la cause de Davis11 fut rendu le 17 d\u00e9cembre 1896; celui de McGreevy v. Les Commissaires du havre de Qu\u00e9bec, rendu par la m\u00eame cour pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par le m\u00eame juge-en-chef, est en date du 9 novembre 1897. Il n\u2019y est nullement r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat de Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al v. Davis11. L\u2019on ne peut supposer que cette cour aurait chang\u00e9 d\u2019avis, ni surtout qu\u2019elle e\u00fbt voulu mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 l\u2019opinion qu\u2019elle avait exprim\u00e9e re Davis sans le d\u00e9clarer formellement et sans m\u00eame discuter l\u2019arr\u00eat ant\u00e9rieur. Aussi suffit-il de lire le jugement rendu par l\u2019honorable juge Ouimet pour constater qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un cas d\u2019esp\u00e8ce qui semble avoir d\u00e9pendu exclusivement des faits sp\u00e9ciaux de la cause. Il r\u00e9f\u00e8re, entre autres choses, \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention des Commissaires du havre que\nce nouvel engagement ne faisait que continuer l\u2019appelant et ses coll\u00e8gues comme membres permanents du personnel des ing\u00e9nieurs.\nNous pouvons passer rapidement sur la d\u00e9cision dans la cause de Charbonneau v. Publishers Press[13], o\u00f9 l\u2019engagement \u00e9tait \u201cpar \u00e9crit pour le terme d\u2019une ann\u00e9e \u00e0 partir du 5 juin 1911\u201d; et nous arrivons \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour de Revision (Tellier, de Lorimier et Greenshields JJ.) dans Couture v. La cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[14]. La r\u00e9solution suivante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9e par la commission de la voirie:\nR\u00e9solu que MM. (le demandeur et autres) soient nomm\u00e9s cha\u00eeneurs pour la cit\u00e9 \u00e0 raison de $600 par ann\u00e9e.\nIl fut jug\u00e9 que cette r\u00e9solution devait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme ne d\u00e9terminant pas la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019engagement du demandeur et que le mot \u201cann\u00e9e\u201d n\u2019y \u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9 que pour la fixation du salaire du demandeur. On y ajouta que le contrat de louage de services personnels est r\u00e9gi par les dispositions contenues aux articles 1667 et suiv. et 1022 et suiv. du Code civil et que la dur\u00e9e des engagements est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par la nature des conventions, par la nature des travaux et par l\u2019usage des lieux.\nCela veut dire \u00e9videmment que la dur\u00e9e est d\u2019abord d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par la convention, \u00e0 laquelle, comme dans tout autre contrat, on doit suppl\u00e9er les clauses d\u2019usage, quoiqu\u2019elles n\u2019y soient pas exprim\u00e9es (art. 1017 C.C.). Dans cette cause, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure avait \u00e9galement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que \u201cl\u2019engagement du demandeur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e\u201d.\nNous avons ensuite, en 1920, le jugement dans la cause de Bessette v. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme d\u2019Imprimerie Le Pays[15], \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e nous a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s, o\u00f9 le contrat d\u2019engagement \u00e9tait par \u00e9crit, pour une p\u00e9riode d\u2019un an; puis celle de Iverson v. Chicoutimi Pulp Co.[16] cit\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante, et o\u00f9 la r\u00e9solution d\u2019engagement comportait que\nfrom January 1st 1922 to April 15th 1922, the salary of Mr. Iverson will be $6,000 per annum. After April 15th 1922, at the rate of $6,300. Il y fut jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un contrat pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e auquel la compagnie avait pu valablement mettre fin avec un avis de cong\u00e9 suffisant.\nDans la cause de Kidston v. Palmer[17], la Cour du Banc du Roi a unanimement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les pr\u00e9somptions de l\u2019article 1642 relatives au louage de maison ne s\u2019appliquent pas rigoureusement dans le cas de louage d\u2019ouvrage; et adopta l\u2019opinion de Sir Alexandre Lacoste dans la cause de Davis[18], que la fixation du salaire constitue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du terme et de la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019engagement une pr\u00e9somption de fait qui a plus ou moins de force, suivant les circonstances.\nLes termes de l\u2019engagement \u00e9taient contenus dans une lettre et exprim\u00e9s ainsi: \u201cthe proposition of $4,800 per year\u201d.\nDans cette cause, il y avait une preuve de part et d\u2019autre sur les conditions de l\u2019engagement dont la lettre n\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e9ment. L\u2019Honorable juge Dorion, qui a rendu le principal jugement, a analys\u00e9 la preuve testimoniale en d\u00e9tail; et, apr\u00e8s avoir dit (p. 199):\nLes mots \u201c$4,800 per year\u201d ne constituent pas n\u00e9cessairement un engagement \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e; les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es par l\u2019appelante le d\u00e9montrent,\nil en vint \u00e0 la conclusion que la fixation du salaire \u00e0 $4,800 par an constituait, dans cette preuve, une pr\u00e9somption de fait suffisante pour arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que la version de l\u2019employ\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019engagement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour un an \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e.\nOn peut compl\u00e9ter cette revue des arr\u00eats par une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 Gallagher v. Confer[19], o\u00f9 la mention du salaire \u00e9tait faite comme suit:\nat a salary of $2,700 per annum to be paid in twelve regular monthlly instalments of $225 per month.\nIl y avait l\u00e0 \u00e9videmment un engagement de faire douze paiements mensuels de $225, et l\u2019on a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 cette stipulation, avec raison suivant nous, comme liant le patron \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 au moins pour cette p\u00e9riode de douze mois.\nDans Garon v. Security Life Insurance Company[20], l\u2019engagement du g\u00e9rant moyennant un salaire de \u201c$200 par mois\" fut consid\u00e9r\u00e9 tant par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure que par la Cour de R\u00e9vision, non pas comme un engagement pour un mois seulement ; mais comme un engagement au mois pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Enfin, dans Lacasse v. Tucket Tobacco Company[21], il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un engagement d\u2019un voyageur de commerce au salaire de $1,800 par ann\u00e9e, payable mensuellement; et la Cour du Banc du Roi, comme la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure (Philippe Demers, J.), fut d\u2019avis qu\u2019un mois d\u2019avis de cong\u00e9 \u00e9tait suffisant. La Cour du Banc du Roi consid\u00e9ra cependant que le contrat d\u2019engagement, une fois le mois commenc\u00e9, ne pouvait \u00eatre r\u00e9sili\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019expiration du mois suivant et \u00e0 la condition toutefois qu\u2019avis ait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 dans le mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent.\nVoil\u00e0 tous les arr\u00eats que l\u2019on nous a cit\u00e9s ou que nous avons pu trouver. L\u2019on est loin de compte, par cons\u00e9quent, lorsqu\u2019on pr\u00e9tend que la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec est \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019un contrat de louage de services \u00e0 tant par ann\u00e9e constitue un contrat pour un an. Pour notre part, nous ne trouvons rien dans cette jurisprudence qui justifie d\u2019appliquer par analogie, au louage de services personnels, l\u2019article 1642 du Code civil, qui contient une r\u00e8gle particuli\u00e8re au bail de maison, ou de dire que l\u2019on puisse, suivant l\u2019expression de Sir Alexandre Lacoste, dans la cause de Davis[22].\ntirer de la fixation du salaire \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e une pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale de la dur\u00e9e du contrat.\nDans la cause actuelle, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a offert comme preuve de son contrat que la lettre du 5 mai 1927. Cette lettre n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produite seulement comme un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la preuve, mais elle constitue la seule et unique preuve, et toute la preuve, du contrat. C\u2019est un texte \u00e9crit d\u2019o\u00f9 il ressort que l\u2019engagement a \u00e9t\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9finie. Nous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0 nous demander si un engagement de ce genre est raisonnable ou d\u00e9raisonnable. L\u2019intim\u00e9 nous soumet un \u00e9crit et nous n\u2019avons qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9ter, de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que si les parties avaient r\u00e9dig\u00e9 un contrat dans les m\u00eames termes. Dans un contrat de ce genre, la loi le dit et le bon sens le veut, les parties ne sont pas li\u00e9es au del\u00e0 de leur volont\u00e9; et il leur est libre d\u2019y mettre fin, suivant l\u2019expression de Laurent, \u201cen donnant cong\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019autre, et le cong\u00e9 implique un certain d\u00e9lai\u201d. (Comparer: Planiol, Trait\u00e9 El\u00e9mentaire, 6e \u00e9d., Tome 2, p. 606, n\u00b0 1883). Si l\u2019une des parties trouve le d\u00e9lai insuffisant, il reste au tribunal \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier les circonstances et \u00e0 accorder des dommages- int\u00e9r\u00eats, s\u2019il en arrive \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019en effet le d\u00e9lai n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisant. Et, sur ce point, l\u2019article 1657 du Code pose une r\u00e8gle qui peut servir de guide.\nNous ne voyons rien de d\u00e9raisonnable ou de surprenant dans un contrat de ce genre, o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 savait qu\u2019il ne pourrait se terminer que pour une cause suffisante, ou sur un avis raisonnable.\nEt si le contrat \u00e9tait, comme nous le d\u00e9cidons, pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, il ne pouvait \u00eatre question de tacite reconduction. En effet, comme le fait remarquer Mignault, Droit civil canadien, vol. 7, p. 371:\nPour qu\u2019il y ait lieu \u00e0 tacite reconduction, il faut qu\u2019il y ait un terme convenu ou pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 pour la dur\u00e9e du service.\nLa tacite reconduction n\u2019a lieu que si les relations des parties persistent apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la date fix\u00e9e au bail de services; dans le cas d\u2019un louage pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, le cas ne saurait se pr\u00e9senter. Il convient, en effet, de faire remarquer que, pour \u00e9tablir son all\u00e9gation de tacite reconduction, il ne suffisait pas au demandeur-intim\u00e9 de prouver qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e (ce qui comporte n\u00e9cessairement quelque chose d\u2019ind\u00e9fini) ; mais il lui fallait prouver qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9 pour un an, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire pour une p\u00e9riode fixe, \u00e0 l\u2019expiration de laquelle la tacite reconduction aurait pu commencer. Ici, l\u2019appelante a mis fin \u00e0 un contrat de louage pour une p\u00e9riode de temps ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, o\u00f9 le salaire \u00e9tait payable tant par mois, au moyen d\u2019un avis de cong\u00e9 de trois mois; ou, si l\u2019on veut, en remettant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 de trois mois de salaire pour tenir lieu de cong\u00e9. De prime abord, cet avis nous para\u00eet suffisant et il n\u2019y a au dossier aucune preuve d\u2019usage ou d\u2019autres circonstances pour nous justifier de d\u00e9cider le contraire. (La\u00e7asse v. Tuckett Tobacco Company[23].\nIl reste la possibilit\u00e9 que le proc\u00e8s ait \u00e9t\u00e9 fauss\u00e9 par suite d\u2019un malentendu entre les parties r\u00e9sultant d\u2019une certaine ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9claration faite au d\u00e9but de l\u2019enqu\u00eate par les procureurs de l\u2019appelante. En semblable cas, la cour essaie parfois d\u2019apporter un rem\u00e8de en ordonnant un nouveau proc\u00e8s.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, cependant, ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre des parties ne l\u2019a demand\u00e9; cette question n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9e avec leurs procureurs lors de l\u2019audition devant cette cour. Il ne para\u00eet pas y avoir eu de m\u00e9prise sur la nature des questions en contestation. L\u2019appelante affirme dans son factum:\nIt urged both before the trial judge and before the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side) that, as a matter of law, the contract in question was neither a contract of a yearly duration, nor a contract of a monthly duration, but one for an indeterminate period.\nD\u2019autre part, nous l\u2019avons vu, lorsque l\u2019intim\u00e9 en vient \u00e0 d\u00e9finir les \u201cpoints in issue\u201d, il les \u00e9tablit comme suit:\nWe may take it, therefore, that no question arises but this: Was the contract of engagement an annual one in the intention of the parties, or was it not?\nEt, comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait remarquer, le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance et les notes des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi ne se bornent pas \u00e0 la question de tacite reconduction, mais discutent \u00e0 la fois la nature et la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019engagement, ainsi que ses cons\u00e9quences sur la dur\u00e9e de la tacite reconduction.\nLe nouveau proc\u00e8s ne saurait \u00eatre accord\u00e9 simplement pour permettre \u00e0 l\u2019appelante ou \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9velopper davantage les arguments de droit. Il serait utile seulement s\u2019il leur permettait de faire une preuve additionnelle qui aurait pour but d\u2019\u00e9lucider la situation. Sur ce point essentiel: la p\u00e9riode de temps pour laquelle l\u2019engagement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, l\u2019intim\u00e9 se trouve li\u00e9 par l\u2019assertion contenue dans sa d\u00e9claration, que la lettre du 5 mai 1927 confirmait rengagement verbal. Par suite, les termes de cette lettre, et particuli\u00e8rement les mots: \u201csix thousand dollars per annum\u201d, resteront, en d\u00e9finitive, la base du contrat qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter. Le r\u00e9sultat du litige d\u00e9pend du sens qu\u2019il faut donner \u00e0 cette stipulation. S\u2019il y avait d\u2019autres conditions se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 cette question, l\u2019intim\u00e9 les aurait relat\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9claration, ou il les aurait, au moins, mentionn\u00e9es devant l\u2019une des trois cours o\u00f9 il a comparu jusqu\u2019ici.\nDans les circonstances, nous ne nous croirions pas justifi\u00e9s d\u2019ordonner un nouveau proc\u00e8s proprio motu, lorsque l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne le demande pas et n\u2019a expos\u00e9 aucune raison pour laquelle il pourrait l\u2019obtenir, ni surtout lorsque l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de faire valoir les objections qui peuvent militer contre l\u2019octroi de cette faveur \u00e0 son adversaire. Pour ces raisons, nous sommes d\u2019avis de faire droit \u00e0 l\u2019appel et de rejeter l\u2019action avec d\u00e9pens devant toutes les cours.\nAnglin C.J.C. (dissenting).\u2014The trial in this case was unsatisfactory. The parties appear not to have appreciated the issues involved. These were, (a) what, if any, was the duration of the original contract; (b) was there a reconduction; and, (c) if so, for what term?\nIn my opinion, a new trial is inevitable. I, therefore, refrain from any comment on the evidence.\nCannon, J. (dissenting).\u2014Appel d\u2019un jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, du 26 novembre 1931, confirmant \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9 celui de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure (Duclos, J.) du district de Montr\u00e9al, en date du 27 f\u00e9vrier 1931, condamnant l\u2019appelante \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 $3,475 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats et d\u00e9pens.\nL\u2019action all\u00e8gue que le, ou vers le, 1er mai 1927, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fut engag\u00e9 par le pr\u00e9sident de la compagnie appelante, monsieur W. G. Ross, comme assistant-g\u00e9rant, \u00e0 un salaire de $6,000.00, du 1er mai 1927, avec, en outre, l\u2019usage gratuit d\u2019une maison d\u2019habitation \u00e0 Thetford-Mines, et l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 sans frais. Ce contrat verbal aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la lettre suivante, adress\u00e9e le 5 mai 1927 par le pr\u00e9sident Ross au g\u00e9rant de l\u2019appelante \u00e0 Thetford-Mines, monsieur R. P. Doucet:\nDear Mr. Doucet,\nMr. Cook has agreed to join us on the conditions mentioned, $6,000 per annum and use of Penhale\u2019s house.\nHe will go down to Thetford either Sunday or Monday.\nYours very truly,\n(Signed) W. G. Ross,\nPresident and General Manager.\nLe demandeur all\u00e8gue qu\u2019apr\u00e8s son entr\u00e9e en fonctions son salaire fut augment\u00e9, en septembre 1927, \u00e0 $7,500.00 par ann\u00e9e, payable \u00e0 raison de $625.00 par mois; que ce contrat aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9, par tacite reconduction, le 1er mai 1928, et, de nouveau, le 1er mai 1929, alors que les parties se seraient li\u00e9es tacitement pour une autre ann\u00e9e se terminant le 1er mai 1930.\nLe demandeur se plaint d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 le 29 ao\u00fbt 1929, sur paiement de trois mois de salaire jusqu\u2019au 30 novembre 1929, qu\u2019il accepta sous prot\u00eat, sans pr\u00e9judice a ses droits. Sa d\u00e9mission brusque lui a caus\u00e9 des dommages pour perte de salaire, location d\u2019une nouvelle maison, compte d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al et frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement, pour lesquels ils r\u00e9clame $3,850.00.\nLa d\u00e9fenderesse, par son plaidoyer, pr\u00e9tend avoir engag\u00e9 le demandeur au mois, comme tous ses autres employ\u00e9s qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas engag\u00e9s en vertu d\u2019une r\u00e9solution du bureau de direction; et, en payant $1,875.00 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019appelante aurait g\u00e9n\u00e9reusement exc\u00e9d\u00e9 son obligation stricte envers lui.\nRemarquons que la d\u00e9fenderesse n\u2019a nullement pr\u00e9tendu que le contrat \u00e9tait pour une p\u00e9riode de temps ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e; au contraire, elle a plaid\u00e9, en fait, un engagement au mois. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la contestation li\u00e9e, le contrat \u00e9tait limit\u00e9 \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode fixe; un mois ou une ann\u00e9e. Ceci ressort clairement du plaidoyer alternatif au paragraphe 16, o\u00f9 l\u2019appelante all\u00e8gue que, m\u00eame si Cook \u00e9tait engag\u00e9 du 1er mai 1927 au 1er mai 1928, la tacite reconduction n\u2019aurait pu avoir lieu que pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e qui pouvait \u00eatre interrompue par l\u2019appelante en donnant un avis raisonnable \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 et en payant son salaire.\nL\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tendit, de plus, avoir renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour bonne et suffisante cause; mais elle a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9tention.\nPar l\u2019application \u00e0 ce plaidoyer des articles 110 et 339 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure civile, l\u2019appelante ne peut pas nous soumettre, en la d\u00e9guisant comme une question de droit, sa nouvelle pr\u00e9tention qu\u2019en fait, l\u2019engagement \u00e9tait pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, surtout apr\u00e8s avoir pratiquement exempt\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de prouver le contrat pour un an en faisant, \u00e0 d\u2019ouverture de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, la d\u00e9claration suivante:\nDefendant declares it has no proof to offer in support of the allegation that the dismissal was for cause, and the issue is, therefore, limited to the question of law as to whether there was an annual engagement expiring on May 1st, 1930.\nQuelle est la port\u00e9e de cette d\u00e9claration? Devons-nous la consid\u00e9rer comme limitant le litige \u00e0 la seule question de droit mentionn\u00e9e au paragraphe 16 du plaidoyer quant \u00e0 la longueur du terme pour lequel le contrat aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9 par tacite reconduction le 1er mai 1929? Dans l\u2019affirmative, cela expliquerait suffisamment, vu le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de l\u2019ex-pr\u00e9sident W. G. Ross, pourquoi on n\u2019a pas interrog\u00e9 le demandeur Cook sur les circonstances qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 et accompagn\u00e9 son entr\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de l\u2019appelante. L\u2019appelante n\u2019a jamais plaid\u00e9, mais a pr\u00e9tendu, apparemment pour la premi\u00e8re fois devant nous, que l\u2019engagement initial \u00e9tait, ni pour un an, ni pour un mois, mais pour une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Je ne crois pas qu\u2019elle puisse le faire, vu notre loi de proc\u00e9dure et sa d\u00e9claration, peut-\u00eatre ambigu\u00eb, mais qui semble renoncer \u00e0 sa pr\u00e9tention d\u2019un engagement au mois et nous laisser, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les plaidoiries, la seule alternative d\u2019un engagement \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e, tel qu\u2019all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9. Cette d\u00e9claration \u00e9limine aussi l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019une novation en septembre, lors de l\u2019augmentation du salaire.\nQuoiqu\u2019il en soit, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la doctrine, la jurisprudence et la loi, m\u00eame ce fait serait suffisamment \u00e9tabli au dossier.\nL\u2019on nous a cit\u00e9, comme devant lier cette cour, la cause de Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al v. Davis[24]. Je serais plut\u00f4t port\u00e9 \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer cet arr\u00eat comme une d\u00e9cision d\u2019esp\u00e8ce affirmant le pouvoir de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, en vertu d\u2019une disposition sp\u00e9ciale de sa charte, de renvoyer ses employ\u00e9s, \u00e0 discr\u00e9tion et suivant son bon plaisir. L\u2019Honorable juge Rinfret, cependant, dans la cause de Iverson v. Chicoutimi Pulp Company[25], a cru n\u00e9cessaire de suivre la doctrine expos\u00e9e par Sir Alexandre Lacoste dans cette cause de La Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al v. Davis[26] o\u00f9 l\u2019ancien juge-en-chef affirme que la Cour du Banc du Roi, dans les causes de Dugdale v. La Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[27] et Les Commissaires des chemins \u00e0 barri\u00e8res de Montr\u00e9al & Rielle[28] n\u2019aurait pas tir\u00e9, de la fixation du salaire \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e, une pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale de la dur\u00e9e du contrat.\nJe ne connais aucun texte de loi, disait-il, qui cr\u00e9e une semblable pr\u00e9somption en mati\u00e8re de louage de services. C\u2019est tout au plus une pr\u00e9somption de fait qui a plus ou moins de force suivant les circonstances.\nAppliquant cette jurisprudence \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause, il n\u2019y a pas de doute que la lettre pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, comme le dit l\u2019honorable juge Bernier, serait presque suffisante, par elle-m\u00eame, pour indiquer que l\u2019engagement du demandeur \u00e9tait un engagement \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e. L\u2019article 1602 du Code civil d\u00e9finit le louage d\u2019ouvrage: un contrat par lequel l\u2019une des parties s\u2019engage \u00e0 faire quelque chose pour l\u2019autre, moyennant un prix. Quel est le prix fix\u00e9, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la lettre de W. G. Ross? $6,000. C\u2019est un minimum. On ne dit pas: \u201cpayable monthly or semi-monthly\u201d, ni \u201cat the rate of $6,000 per annum\u201d. Quelle chose Cook devait-il faire pour gagner cette r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de $6,000 et la jouissance d\u2019une maison? Travailler comme assistant-g\u00e9rant, pendant une ann\u00e9e. La lettre nous donne clairement les obligations r\u00e9ciproques requises par l\u2019article 1602. Outre cette lettre, le premier juge avait, pour d\u00e9cider en faveur de l\u2019engagement \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e et non au mois:\n1\u00b0 Le fait que lors de rengagement Cook demeurait \u00e0 Westmount, ce qui n\u00e9cessitait son d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement \u00e0 Thetford Mines;\n2\u00b0 La mise l\u00e0 sa disposition d\u2019une maison \u00e0 Thetford comme partie de sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration;\n3\u00b0 L\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de penser qu\u2019un homme de bon sens aurait d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 pour occuper une position pr\u00e9caire qu\u2019on aurait pu lui enlever chaque mois, sans raison, suivant le caprice de la compagnie;\n4\u00b0 Que cette derni\u00e8re a plaid\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait bonne et suffisante raison de renvoyer le d\u00e9fendeur; ce qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 inutile s\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9 au mois;\n5\u00b0 Le fait que le nouveau pr\u00e9sident Massie a cru devoir, indirectement, demander la r\u00e9signation du demandeur, ce qui est incompatible avec l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019un engagement au mois.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance, prenant en consid\u00e9ration la lettre et les autres circonstances de la cause, a conclu en fait \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un contrat annuel. Or, cette pr\u00e9somption de fait, mentionn\u00e9e dans la cause de Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al v. Davis[29], accept\u00e9e par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et par la Cour du Banc du Roi \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9, est, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les articles 1238 et 1242 du Code civil, abandonn\u00e9e \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion et au jugement du tribunal.\nPouvons-nous, m\u00eame si la d\u00e9claration \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la d\u00e9fense n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une admission implicite de l\u2019engagement \u00e0 l\u2019origine pour au moins une ann\u00e9e enti\u00e8re, mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance et celui des juges en appel et leur appr\u00e9ciation des circonstances qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019un d\u2019eux, cr\u00e9e une pr\u00e9somption de faits violente que les deux parties entendaient faire un engagement \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e et non pas au mois? Il nous est impossible de d\u00e9clarer que tous ces savants magistrats ont commis une erreur \u00e9vidente; et, suivant la jurisprudence de cette cour, il n\u2019y aurait donc pas lieu d\u2019intervenir sur cette question de fait.\nReste la question de droit, qui est le seul et v\u00e9ritable litige entre les parties. La tacite reconduction qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019admission de l\u2019appelante, a eu lieu entre l\u2019appelante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 le 1er mai 1929 est-elle un renouvellement pur et simple du contrat pour une autre ann\u00e9e ou pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9finie?\nSur ce point, comme l\u2019a expos\u00e9 clairement monsieur le juge St-Germain dans ses notes, la doctrine fran\u00e7aise contemporaine ne saurait nous aider, vu les divergences capitales qui existent entre le Code Napol\u00e9on et le n\u00f4tre. L\u2019article 1667 de notre Code civil dit que le contrat de louage de service personnel ne peut \u00eatre que pour un temps limit\u00e9, ou pour une entreprise d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, reproduisant pratiquement l\u2019article 1780 du Code Napol\u00e9on. Nos codificateurs ont cependant ajout\u00e9 un deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe qui ne se trouve pas au code fran\u00e7ais en disant que ce contrat de louage de service \u201cpeut \u00eatre continu\u00e9 par tacite reconduction\u201d.\nL\u2019honorable juge Dorion dit fort bien dans ses notes que ce n\u2019est pas un bail continu\u00e9, mais un bail renouvel\u00e9. D\u2019apr\u00e8s Larousse, reconduction veut dire renouvellement. Je crois, comme l\u2019honorable juge Ramsay dans la cause de City of Montreal v. Dugdale[30] que\nIf it be reconduction, the parties must be put in the same position in which they were before, else the law would presume a different bargain. This would be an illogical operation.\nEn France, l\u2019article 1780, non seulement ne pourvoit pas express\u00e9ment \u00e0 la tacite reconduction du louage de service, mais la loi du 27 d\u00e9cembre 1890 dit que le louage de service, fait sans d\u00e9termination de dur\u00e9e, peut toujours cesser par la volont\u00e9 d\u2019une des parties contractantes, sauf indemnit\u00e9, qui doit \u00eatre fix\u00e9e en tenant compte de certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans l\u2019article.\nNous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une esp\u00e8ce toute particuli\u00e8re dans laquelle les parties ont conduit le proc\u00e8s et l\u2019enqu\u00eate de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 restreindre les tribunaux \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision d\u2019une seule question : si l\u2019engagement originaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour un an, la tacite reconduction a-t-elle eu lieu pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e ou pour une ann\u00e9e additionnelle?\nS\u2019il s\u2019agissait, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, d\u2019un contrat originaire pour une p\u00e9riode de plus d\u2019une ann\u00e9e, et en cons\u00e9quence d\u2019une reconduction, d\u2019un renouvellement possible, pour une nouvelle p\u00e9riode d\u00e9passant une ann\u00e9e, il nous faudrait examiner et d\u00e9cider l\u2019application, par analogie ou autrement, de la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019article 1609 \u00e0 la tacite reconduction pr\u00e9vue par l\u2019article 1667. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider cette question dans la pr\u00e9sente cause. Pour moi, il n\u2019y a pas de doute que le renouvellement d\u2019un contrat d\u2019un an doit \u00eatre pour une nouvelle ann\u00e9e.\nLa tacite reconduction qui a eu lieu en mai 1929 a renouvel\u00e9 les obligations des parties pour une nouvelle p\u00e9riode d\u2019un an. En France, on a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de recourir, par analogie, aux articles. 1758, 1759 et 1760 du Code Napol\u00e9on, pour d\u00e9terminer la dur\u00e9e du louage de services continus du consentement tacite des parties. Or, comme le fait remarquer monsieur le juge St-Germain, l\u2019article 1738 du Code Napol\u00e9on, qui correspond \u00e0 l\u2019article 1609 de notre Code civil, contrairement \u00e0 ce dernier, dit que si, \u00e0 l\u2019expiration des baux \u00e9crits, le preneur est laiss\u00e9 en possession, il s\u2019op\u00e8re un nouveau bail dont l\u2019effet est r\u00e9gl\u00e9 par l\u2019article relatif aux locations faites sans \u00e9crit, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, sans dur\u00e9e indiqu\u00e9e, et o\u00f9 l\u2019une des parties ne peut donner cong\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019autre qu\u2019en observant les d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s par l\u2019usage des lieux. Notre code, au contraire, contient des r\u00e8gles pr\u00e9cises quant \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019occupation, m\u00eame sans bail, par simple tol\u00e9rance du propri\u00e9taire, et quant aux effets de la tacite reconduction. Le Code Napol\u00e9on, de propos d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, vu la multitude des coutumes existant dans les diff\u00e9rentes provinces de France, a simplement r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019usage des lieux. Vo. Motifs du Code civil, 1er vol. Page 636 (Paris 1855).\nIl nous faut donc \u00e9viter l\u2019application des commentateurs du Code Napol\u00e9on, et de la l\u00e9gislation encore plus r\u00e9cente du travail en France, et nous en tenir au texte de notre code et \u00e0 notre jurisprudence. Je crois appliquer l\u2019un et l\u2019autre en disant que le contrat annuel intervenu en mai 1927 s\u2019est renouvel\u00e9 en 1928 pour un an, et en 1929 pour une autre ann\u00e9e expirant le 1er mai 1930. Reste la derni\u00e8re question soulev\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante, \u00e0 savoir que le jugement doit \u00eatre r\u00e9duit de $225.00, la diff\u00e9rence entre le montant de son salaire avec l\u2019appelante et celui qu\u2019il recevait en avril 1930.\nJe crois que, le 24 avril 1930, date de l\u2019institution de l\u2019action, la mesure des dommages qu\u2019il r\u00e9clamait \u00e9tait suffisamment \u00e9tablie, vu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 pour jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin d\u2019avril 1930 \u00e0 un salaire moindre que celui qu\u2019il aurait re\u00e7u s\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 pr\u00e9matur\u00e9ment par l\u2019appelante. Quand l\u2019action fut prise, il endurait la r\u00e9duction de salaire qu\u2019il avait d\u00fb accepter pour tout le mois d\u2019avril alors courant, sans rem\u00e8de possible. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019ailleurs de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des dommages, et il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019intervenir. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une action pour salaire r\u00e9clam\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode non expir\u00e9e. Le demandeur a pu, quelque mois apr\u00e8s son renvoi, obtenir un nouvel emploi et il avait droit, d\u00e8s que sa situation s\u2019\u00e9tait de nouveau stabilis\u00e9e, de venir devant la cour pour d\u00e9montrer les dommages d\u00e8s lors assur\u00e9ment caus\u00e9s par la rupture du contrat. Il est \u00e9vident que si l\u2019on avait plaid\u00e9 et prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 physiquement incapable dans cette derni\u00e8re semaine du mois d\u2019avril 1930 de gagner aucun salaire, cette circonstance aurait pu \u00eatre prise en consid\u00e9ration par le premier juge. Mais en appliquant la r\u00e8gle: De minimis non curat pr\u0153tor, je ne crois pas qu\u2019il y ait lieu de modifier le jugement pour cette raison, qui n\u2019a pas, d\u2019ailleurs, \u00e9t\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement plaid\u00e9e.\nJe suis donc d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mitchell, Ralston, Kearney & Duquet.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.
